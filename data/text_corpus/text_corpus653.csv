3265,large marine sedimentary basins often contain concentrated geothermal mineral resources chongqing municipality located in the sichuan marine sedimentary basin and the surrounding mountainous area of southwest china is rich in thermal waters and brines chongqing belongs to the middle upper yangtze tectonic block previous studies have mostly been based on basin structure but less on the whole plate structure to study the distribution and evolution of groundwater in this paper 78 middle deep groundwater samples in the study area were collected to better understand the occurrence and hydrochemical evolution of middle deep groundwater using ionic ratios hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and geothermometers tectonic stress has been transferred from se to nw in the jiangnan orogenic belt and from ne to sw in the qinling dabie orogenic belt making the extent of tectonic denudation and its related properties such as hydrochemical type reservoir temperature and maximum circulation depth trend along the same directions four of the water samples have br 103 cl and na cl molar ratios 1 5 and 0 87 respectively indicating that they are marine metamorphic brines the ratios of the rest of the samples are mostly distributed in a range suggesting precipitation dissolved halite or somewhere in between this suggests that the study area is in the denudation leaching period of the hydrogeological cycle and the middle deep groundwater system is still in the dynamic process of formation water residual metamorphic paleo seawater of the previous hydrogeological cycle diluted in places by rainwater a conceptual circulation model for regional middle deep groundwater is proposed rainfall in the late pleistocene infiltrated as groundwater recharge via fractures and karst valleys and circulated to deep strata driven by gravity where it could mix with residual paleo evaporated seawater then the groundwater was heated by geothermal and chemical energy sources mixing with shallow groundwater as it moved upward along faults toward the surface eventually to emerge from springs keywords middle deep groundwater geological structure marine sedimentary rock karst aqufier chongqing sw china 1 introduction accumulation and storage of water in sedimentary basins can provide favorable environments to form geothermal mineral resources craig 1969 lowenstein et al 2003 geothermal water is an environment friendly resource which can partially replace fossil fuels direct utilization of geothermal energy in a total of 82 countries is 592 638 tj year 164 635 gwh year at the end of 2014 john and tonya 2016 preventing 149 1 million tonnes of co2 being released to the atmosphere geothermal water resources are widely used directly for heating therapy and recreation and indirectly for power generation górecki et al 2015 sowiżdżał et al 2019 pang et al 2018 the metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources in deep seated subsurface brines are also widely used in salt making and industrial raw material supply lowenstein et al 2003 ryabtsev et al 2020 as the development and utilization of middle deep groundwater in evaporate basins can thus provide an important resource to help solve global resource and environmental issues it is necessary to understand relevant formation mechanisms and the laws that govern distribution of these resources worldwide the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow circulating karst groundwaters which are generally of a hco3 ca or hco3 ca mg type are different from those of middle 0 3 2 km and deep 2 km circulating water in karst systems hem 1970 shallow karst systems containing evaporites are easily leached resulting in the loss of soluble salts as the flow path becomes longer the water flow can become almost stagnant which can result in the hydrochemical type gradually evolving into a so4 ca and cl na type with higher temperature and salinity ta et al 2019 chen et al 2007 the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are controlled by geological structure and lithology permeability influenced by lithology exerts an important control on the rate of groundwater circulation as variations in the hydrochemical type of groundwater can affect the extent of flushing of the rock strata schmoker and halley 1982 several studies have emphasized the impact of geological structure on groundwater circulation mcintosh and ferguson 2021 dafny et al 2010 labat et al 2021 kong et al 2020 the degree of structural development affects the evolution of hydrochemical types and lithology provides the material basis for the formation of hydrochemical types these two factors play different roles in different regions the total karst area in china is 344 104 km2 accounting for 1 3 of the national area yuan et al 2016 chongqing is located in southwestern china fig 1 a which has the most concentrated and contiguous karst area of karst landscape development about 36 3 104 km2 of chongqing is covered by karst in chongqing lithology related to permeability is relatively consistent and can be used as the control variable tectonic topography then becomes the explanatory variable that controls the extent of water circulation and in turn the hydrochemical type and water temperature the eastern sichuan fold belt dominates the geologic structure of chongqing and is characterized by folds alternating between long steeply dipping anticlines and wide gentle synclines within this belt stratified thermal karst aquifers occur in uplifted mountain areas middle and lower triassic carbonate aquifers occur in the flanks of anticlines buried at depths of several hundred to 2 000 m wang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 and these mainly host low and medium temperature so4 ca water this is in contrast to shallow karst groundwater dominated by hco3 and ca2 pu et al 2010 but typical for mid to deep carbonate waters previous geothermal resource development utilization and research have mainly been concentrated in the eastern sichuan fold belt while only a handful of studies have focused on other local areas of consistent internal geological structure in chongqing cheng et al 2015 cao 2014 guo 2019 luo et al 2019 ta et al 2018 2019 xiao 2012 yang et al 2017 2019 zeng 2012 in the higher level of geological tectonic divisions all of chongqing belongs to the middle upper yangtze block the internal subregions of chongqing are interrelated with each other so that the distribution formation and evolution mechanisms of middle deep groundwater in the different regions are relatively homogeneous details of the flow paths and even the recharge areas are poorly characterized both of which are obviously of great importance in the exploration of geothermal water and brines in this context this paper studies the whole of chongqing at the level of the middle upper yangtze block the goals of this paper are to explore the origins of middle deep groundwater water rock interactions and runoff processes finally the geological temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the openness degree of middle deep groundwater systems in chongqing under the influence of geological structure are clarified providing reference for the exploration comprehensive exploitation and sustainable utilization of geothermal resources 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting southwest china s chongqing municipality is located between n 28 10 32 13 and e 105 17 110 11 covering an area of 8 24 104 km2 there were 142 thermal water access points warm springs and drilled warm springs by the end of 2014 thus it has been called the hot springs capital of china the landscape in chongqing consists mainly of hills and mountains and it is known as a mountain city wang et al 2018 the north east and south are surrounded by mt daba mt wuling and mt dalou respectively fig 1b the area is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate with mean annual air temperature and rainfall from 17 to 23 c and 1000 mm respectively the wet season is from may to september accounting for about 53 of the total annual precipitation the dry season occurs in december and january to march of the following year yang et al 2019 2 2 geological settings geological formations from upper sinian to middle triassic in the study area are mainly marine carbonates interbedded with clastic rocks and evaporates gypsum and or anhydrite and halite fig 1c they have undergone multicyclic tectonic movement varying in a thickness from 4 to 7 km the underlying lower paleozoic marine black mud shale has high hydrocarbon generation potential guo 2015 the strata from the upper triassic to the cretaceous are red sandstone and mudstone deposits of lacustrine facies ranging in a thickness from 2 to 6 km mou et al 2014 luo and he 2014 zhou et al 1997 according to finer tectonic subdivisions chongqing is divided into the central sichuan gentle fold belt located to the west of the mt huaying basement fault the eastern sichuan fold belt located to the west of the mt qiyao basement fault the qianyuxiange uplift fold belt located to the east of the mt qiyao basement fault and the mt daba arc like fault fold belt located to the north of the shashi hidden fault fig 2 different hydrogeological conditions are the key factors affecting hydrochemical composition of groundwater drogue et al 2000 therefore the study area can be divided into three divisions according to the different tectonic units and outcrops fig 2 2 2 1 midwest chongqing mwc the central sichuan anteklise is located in the westernmost part of chongqing and of the mt huaying basement fault because its geological structure is similar to the syncline of the eastern sichuan fold belt it is classified into this category there are mostly ne to nne trending short axis gently dipping anticlines in the central sichuan anteklise and the strata dip angle is generally 1 3 li et al 1980 jurassic red sandstone and mudstone are the main outcropping formations luo 1987 faults are rare and the structures and lithology are simple so the soluble salts of protogenetic deposits in the strata can be preserved li et al 1977 the eastern sichuan fold belt is characterized by a succession of nearly parallel nne trending narrow asymmetric steeply dipping anticlines and nearly symmetrical broad gentle synclines the elevation of the low ranges formed by these anticlines is generally between 500 and 900 m and the synclines form relatively broad hills ranging in elevation from 300 to 500 m chen 1977 the faults of the wide and gentle synclines are not developed but the deep seated faults of the triassic jialingjiang formation and the older strata near the axis of the high uplift anticline are well developed luo 1987 tan 1990 wang and zhang 2004 these are mainly small scale compression torsional thrust faults that have become pathways for deep formation thermal fluids middle and lower triassic marine sedimentary rocks occur at the axis of the anticlines varying in a thickness from 600 to 1000 m and are the main reservoirs of middle deep groundwater yang et al 2007 the upper triassic xujiahe formation which has poor thermal and water conductivity and serves as a cap rock is composed of feldspar quartz sandstone imbedded with carbonaceous shale and coal seams with a thickness of about 400 m mainly outcropping in the flanks and cores of anticlines the lower triassic feixianguan or daye formation is argillaceous rock interbedded with limestone with a thickness of 500 m and exhibits low permeability and thermal conductivity cheng et al 2015 2 2 2 southeast chongqing sec southeast chongqing is located to the southeast of the mt qiyao basement fault and the paleozoic strata are widely distributed it is characterized by a series of ne trending synclines and anticlines cut by faults from nw to se the folds change from narrow anticlines and wide synclines to wide anticlines and narrow synclines and the intensity of structural deformation gradually strengthens as the outcrops gradually evolve through time hu 2017 most folds form low to medium sized mountains ranging in elevation from 1000 to 1300 m normal faults are well developed mostly occurring in the axes of anticlines and are the main pathways for the ascent of middle deep groundwater the devonian and silurian strata serve as aquitards with a thickness of nearly two kilometers located in the anticlinal flanks sandwiched between the cambrian and ordovician carbonate aquifers these mainly outcrop in anticlines while the permian and triassic carbonate aquifers mainly outcrop in synclines zhou et al 2017 there are more halite pseudocrystal and gypsum layers in the middle cambrian section the total thickness of sedimentary the strata is 7700 m and the lower paleozoic marine carbonate strata are the most well developed and widely distributed with a thickness of 4545 m xia et al 1979 2 2 3 northeast chongqing nec the northeast chongqing section includes the shashi hidden fault the mt daba arc like fault fold belt to the north and the area to the east of the mt qiyao basement fault in northeast chongqing the latter is adjacent to the mt daba arc like fault fold belt which is structurally similar and the outcrops are all mostly middle and lower triassic so they belong to the same area for discussion there are mainly a series of nw trending and sw protruding arc shaped faulted folds accompanied by high angle thrust faults and strong compression the density of folds and faults weakens towards the southwest lin 2016 as the altitude decreases from 2200 to about 1500 m chen 1977 the rock formations have steep dip angles and provide the thermal fluid migration channels the outcrops include a large area of carbonate rock and a small amount of interbedded insoluble rock ranging from upper sinian to lower triassic the lower triassic strata are the most widely distributed mostly occurring in the cores of synclines the lower cambrian strata mostly occur in the cores of anticlines ordovician and permian strata constitute the main potential thermal reservoirs and the lower triassic daye formation forms a cap rock lower permian devonian and carboniferous formations serve as aquitards the lower triassic jialingjiang formation constitutes the secondary potential thermal reservoir with a cap rock formed by the middle triassic badong formation 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and measurements this paper summarizes strata lithology and the evolutionary history of geological structure based on previous literature and geological maps physicochemical data of the middle deep groundwater in chongqing and the data related to the exploitation of geothermal wells were collected and combined with the data of 19 thermal waters in sec obtained during november 2017 and july 2018 field sampling methods laboratory tests and corresponding data have been reported in literature yang et al 2019b the data of the remaining 59 water samples are from yang et al 2017 guo 2019 luo et al 1981 gong 2016 and zhou et al 1980 all of the sample locations are shown in fig 2 the temperature ph major ions total dissolved solids tds and hydrogen and oxygen isotopes if any were compiled the aforementioned data and their extreme values mean values standard deviation and corresponding calculation results are shown in table a 1 all values are expressed as mean one standard deviation 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 saturation index si the saturation index si was calculated using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 when si 0 the solution is undersaturated when si 0 mineral dissolution and precipitation reach equilibrium and the solution is saturated when si 0 the solution is over saturated and minerals are predicted to precipitate 3 2 2 geothermometers there are reaction equilibrium relationships between mineral solubility and temperature with which a series of empirical formulas can be established to estimate reservoir temperature arnorsson 1985 and these are called geothermometers silica geothermometers and cation geothermometers are widely used the calculations used in this study are as follows 1 quartz fournier 1977 t1 1309 5 19 lgsio2 273 15 2 improved sio2 verma and santoyo 1997 t2 44 119 0 24469sio2 1 7414 10 4sio2 2 79 305lgsio2 3 k mg giggenbach 1988 tk mg 4410 14 lg k2 mg 273 15 4 na k ca fournier and truesdell 1973 tna k ca 1647 lg na k βlg ca na 2 24 273 15 the coefficient β of formula 4 is 4 3 for calculated temperatures below 100 c and 1 3 for calculated temperatures above 100 c fournier and truesdell 1973 where t is the estimated reservoir temperature in c sio2 na k ca and mg are their corresponding concentrations in mg l 3 2 3 circulation depth the circulation depth is calculated by eq 1 lin 1993 1 z t z t 0 g z 0 where z is the circulation depth in km tz is the estimated reservoir temperature in c the local mean annual air temperature t0 is set to 18 c in nec and mwc and 16 5 c in sec https www tianqi com the geothermal gradient g is assumed to be 30 c km for mwc xu et al 2011 17 c km for nec fan et al 2014 and 21 c km for sec luo et al 2019 z0 is the depth of the constant temperature zone in km which in chongqing is about 80 100 m zhou et al 2017 thus taking the average depth of 0 09 km as the value of z0 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemistry piper plots can intuitively show water samples of different hydrochemical facies according to the proportions of major ions chadha 1999 considering the tds values the water samples can be roughly classified into two hydrochemical categories sulfate water dominated by ca2 and so4 2 and lower tds values ranging 1000 3000 mg l and chloride water dominated by na and cl and higher tds values 5000 mg l fig 3 among chloride waters average tds values in mwc nec and sec decrease successively which are 146580 120144 57641 88694 and 16048 11534 mg l respectively fig 3 the average discharging temperatures in mwc sec and nec are 40 8 9 5 31 6 14 3 and 25 4 8 2 c respectively table a 1 among sulfate waters the average discharging temperatures and tds values in nec 19 8 1 c 731 82 mg l are lower than those in mwc 45 2 7 9 c 2484 786 6 mg l the average discharging temperatures and tds values of sec are 41 5 6 5 c and 1020 3 770 5 mg l respectively which are between those of mwc and nec table a 1 4 2 saturation index si and hydrochemical balance the sis of quartz in middle deep groundwater range from 0 2 to 1 1 and these imply oversaturation but close to saturation table 1 the sis of halite are 0 implying undersaturation the sis of anhydrite calcite dolomite and gypsum range over positive and negative values which indicate the dissolved minerals vary between oversaturation and undersaturation the na k mg triangular plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 can be used to identify the water rock equilibrium and categorize groundwater into three groups fully equilibrated water immature water that has been mixed with shallow water during deep seated thermal fluid ascent and or re equilibrates along the circulation flow path and partially equilibrated water in between sulfate waters in sec and mwc are at the mg2 corner and showing immature water fig 4 suggesting that the groundwater has been mixed with shallow cold groundwater in the ascending process chloride water data points are mostly located in partially equilibrated and mature water zones 4 3 reservoir temperature and circulation depth the geothermometer is based on temperature dependent water rock chemical equilibrium so the mineral equilibrium of water samples should be tested first giggenbach 1988 fig 4 shows that part of the chloride waters are in the full equilibrium area so the cation geothermometer is available the na k geothermometer is applicable to high temperature 180 c geothermal systems arnorsson 1985 the δd and δ18o of groundwater show no significant positive δ18o shift fig 5 indicating that the maximum reservoir temperature is below 100 c mayo and loucks 1995 thus the na k geothermometer is not applicable the k mg geothermometer is suitable for low temperature geothermal systems giggenbach 1988 the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for geothermal water that is rich in calcium fournier and potter 1995 quartz dissolved in groundwater is generally oversaturated table 1 thus the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and the improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 are suitable for the calculation of reservoir temperature resulting in a value of 70 c the calculation results of reservoir temperatures are shown in table a 1 compared with the discharging temperatures the reservoir temperatures calculated by the k mg geothermometer are lower in the sulfate waters of mwc and sec and others are higher the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for calcium rich geothermal water so it is not feasible to calculate the reservoir temperatures for chloride water dominated by na and cl and the calculated temperatures of sulfate water are lower than discharging temperatures the results of quartz geothermometer and the improved sio2 geothermometer are slightly higher than the groundwater outflow temperatures table a 1 which proves that the calculation results are reasonable in summary taking the average value of the calculation results of quartz geothermometer and the improved sio2 geothermometer the estimated reservoir temperatures of sulfate water in sec and mwc are the highest averaging at 82 15 and 78 9 c respectively the estimated reservoir temperatures of chloride water in mwc are slightly higher than that in sec averaging at 69 8 and 64 18 c respectively the estimated reservoir temperatures of chloride water in nec are the lowest averaging at 55 27 c these values are consistent with the temperature range 64 104 c of geothermal reservoir data obtained from the chongqing geological survey chongqing municipal people s government 2010 groundwater temperature depends on circulation depth geothermal gradient exothermic reactions in water rock interactions magmatic activity and active faulting yang et al 2017 to the east of the mt huaying basement fault in the study area is the basement area of weak to non magnetic and low grade metamorphic rocks of mid late proterozoic without an active magmatic heat source and radioactive heat generation fig 2 to the west of this fault is the basement area of archean strongly magnetic and medium basic igneous rocks luo 1987 feng et al 2019 we can conclude that waters examined in this research are mainly heated by terrestrial heat as such the circulation depth can be estimated via the geothermal gradient and reservoir temperature as expressed by eq 1 the average maximum circulation depths of sulfate water in sec and mwc are 3 2 0 7 and 2 1 0 3 km and that of chloride water are 2 3 0 8 and 1 8 0 3 km respectively the average maximum circulation depths of chloride water in nec are 1 3 0 9 km table a 1 which are the shallowest among the three regions comparing the calculated results of 31 geothermal drilling water samples with the well depths table a 1 it was found that the calculated circulation depth of 5 water samples is slightly less than the geothermal well depth and the relative error range is 0 7 5 8 this may be due to the mixing of middle deep groundwater with shallow groundwater resulting in the calculated circulation depth being less than the actual circulation depth shown by the geothermal wells but the error is within a reasonable range the exploration results of 30 drilled wells in mwc demonstrate that most well waters are in the 2nd through the 4th members of the jialingjiang formation with depth of about two kilometers the 1st member and older strata depth 2 5 km have low porosity and poor water abundance yang et al 2007 5 discussion 5 1 origin of the middle deep groundwaters oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are relatively stable in groundwater circulation and can be used as tracers to determine the potential origin of groundwater and water rock interactions craig 1961 hydrogen and oxygen isotope studies have shown that thermal springs with a low enthalpy background are most likely replenished by rainfall soraya et al 2019 the current study area mostly belongs to a low enthalpy thermal water area wang et al 2018 fig 5 shows that δ18o and δd values of all the data points n 19 except numbers 1 and 2 fall near the chongqing meteoric water line cmwl li et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 indicating that the middle deep groundwaters originated as meteoric water this is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by luo et al 2006 and yang et al 2019 that the recharge of thermal waters in the sec and the southern part of mwc originated from precipitation in the late pleistocene 5 2 principal geochemical processes the chemical composition of middle deep groundwater is the result of water rock interaction under high temperature conditions governed by the chemical composition of country rock minerals huang et al 2019 the key mineral components of the carbonate evaporite rocks e g the lower triassic jialingjiang formation are calcite and dolomite followed by secondary minerals such as anhydrite pyrite halite quartz and celestite which provide a material basis for the chemical composition of geothermal water han 2002 it can thus be assumed that based on geological structure and lithology analyses combined with hydrochemical characteristics the origin of groundwater principal geochemical reactions and the evolution of chemical composition can be determined christina et al 2014 zarei et al 2013 when the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 is 1 1 the ions are controlled by the solubility equilibrium of carbonate and gypsum guo et al 2018 marghade et al 2020 most of the data points in fig 6 a are close to the 1 1 line indicating that the equilibrium dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite and carbonate minerals are the main source of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 in the water when carbonate rock dissolution is dominant the meq l ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 is 1 1 and the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratio of gypsum dissolution is 1 1 choi et al 2012 ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios for most data points deviate far away from 1 1 line fig 6b and the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratios mostly fall near the 1 1 line fig 6c indicating that ca2 and so4 2 in waters are mainly from gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution in equilibrium the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratios of some chloride waters including sample no 1 in nec and mwc show a nonlinear relationship fig 6a c which may be due to bacterial sulfate reduction christina et al 2014 drogue et al 2000 or thermal chemical sulfate reduction reactions machel et al 1995 krouse and viau 1988 involving water and hydrocarbons under high temperature and pressure reducing conditions the reaction reduces so4 2 to h2s gas and consumes light isotopes first making the δd of water sample number 1 formed by rainfall dissolving halite more positive fig 5 in fig 6d the molar ratios of na cl mostly fall near the 1 1 line indicating that they are from the dissolution of halite formations water rock interactions can release heat at 18 c the heat released during anhydrite dissolution is 4 44 kcal mol gao et al 2008 thus the dissolution of sulfate rocks and halite can heat middle deep groundwater sr2 exists in the crystal lattice of gypsum and has leached into groundwater with gypsum the precipitation of srso4 is later than that of caco3 and earlier than that of caso4 2h2o and caso4 shen 2010 therefore sr2 is not enriched in the carbonate deposits and the content of sr2 in groundwater from the carbonate reservoir is low thus the molar ratio of ca2 sr2 is high close to 200 in marine connate sedimentary waters the ratio of ca sr is generally about 33 guo 2019 the tds values of sample numbers 72 and 73 of sec are as low as 396 26 and 276 mg l and the molar ratios of ca sr are close to 200 that is 152 and 194 respectively fig 6e indicating that these may have come from carbonate formations without gypsum resulting in low sr2 and salinity the molar ratios of ca sr in the remaining data points are mostly between 33 and 200 and this is likely due to the dissolution of sulfate formations in the dissolution processes of the minerals above the water rock interaction dissolves the reservoir which provides ideal channels for groundwater transport in the middle and deep strata 5 3 evolution of hydrochemical types in geological history under favorable structural conditions evaporated seawater can be trapped in marine carbonate rocks in study area marine sedimentary metamorphic black brine mainly occurs in the middle and lower triassic carbonate aquifers in confined low gentle anticlines with low tectonic pressures cao 2014 chen et al 2014 lin and pan 2001 zhou et al 2018 the black brine has a black sediment of turbid suspended solids strong hydrogen sulfide odor and high heavy metal content it originated as a mixture of gypsum crystal water dissolving halite and residual paleo evaporated seawater lin 2006 wang 1989 zhou et al 1997 the strata and structures where the brine is located are also where some of the middle deep circulating groundwater is located such as the hechuan dashiqiao anticline no 22 the dianjiang wolonghe anticline nos 21 and 24 the kaizhou wenquan anticline nos 4 6 and the yunanchang anticline nos 14 17 gong 2016 the deep formation brine can become the replenishment source of middle deep groundwater during structural evolution the mixing of brine and meteoric water can increase the concentration of cl na as well as br a characteristic element in marine sedimentary brines in the middle deep groundwater richard et al 2011 na cl and br 103 cl coefficients are the coefficients with greatest stability in seawater which can be used to determine the origin of groundwater fig 7 the molar ratio of na cl in standard seawater ranges from 0 85 to 0 87 when seawater evaporates and becomes concentrated to the point of halite deposition the molar ratio of na cl decreases continuously so the ratio of depositional metamorphic brine is generally 0 87 and that of non marine leaching brines is generally greater than or close to 1 stiller et al 2009 vengosh et al 2002 when dissolved salts begin to deposit with the evaporation of lake water in enclosed lake basins less soluble carbonates caco3 camg co3 2 are deposited first followed by sulphates caso4 na2so4 mgso4 and chlorides nacl kmgcl3 last shen 2010 thus the molar ratio of na cl can also decrease sometimes even below 0 87 when dissolving the strata containing chlorides of the last deposition stage stiller et al 2009 br takes a minimal part in the reactions that form solid minerals in the process of evaporation and concentration of seawater only a small fraction of bromine ions replace chloride ions in the form of isomorphism into solid salts and most br remains in the residual evaporated seawater the br content of residual evaporated seawater increases linearly with evaporation and concentration the br 103 cl molar ratio of modern seawater is 1 5 fontes and matray 1993 halite precipitation consumes 1 1 mol of na and cl thus the br 103 cl molar ratio of residual evaporated seawater is 1 5 the seawater value the br 103 cl molar ratio of sedimentary halite is between 0 05 and 0 3 correspondingly that ratio of dissolved halite precipitation is 0 3 when potassium halide is deposited the br 103 cl molar ratio in the residual evaporated seawater increases to 25 and the sylvite deposited at the same time is also rich in br therefore that ratio of rainwater dissolving potassium and magnesium salts is 1 hao et al 2020 vengosh et al 2002 samples numbers 17 22 23 24 fig 7 and 25 fig 6d in mwc are not stagnant sedimentary metamorphic brine and their na cl molar ratios range from 0 476 to 0 845 the data suggest that these water samples probably originated from rainwater leached potassium and magnesium salts or rainwater mixed with sedimentary metamorphic brine fig 7 these water samples are in the transition stage of the dynamic process of marine sedimentary metamorphic brine being replaced by rainwater with the progress of weathering and denudation middle deep groundwater undergoes part or all of this process marine sedimentary metamorphic brine flushing out of brines by meteoric water rainwater principally dissolves chloride minerals rainwater principally dissolves sulfate minerals rainwater principally dissolves carbonate minerals the hydrogeological cycle of the study area starts from the continental clastic rocks deposited in the upper triassic and now enters the second stage of the cycle that is the denudation leaching period the middle deep groundwater system is still in the dynamic process of residual metamorphic paleo seawater of the previous hydrogeological cycle diluted in places by rainwater 5 4 geologic tectonic process and distribution of hydrochemical type the middle deep groundwaters in sec mainly occur in the cambrian ordovician and permian formations to the west of the yushan fault chloride water occurs with sulfate water to the east fig 2 yang et al 2019b from the axes to the flanks of steeply dipping anticlines in mwc on which karst valleys develop the hydrochemical types of groundwater in the middle and lower triassic formations change from the bicarbonate type to the sulfate type and chloride water mostly occurs in synclines and confined anticlines in nec sulfate water mainly exists in synclines within the large area of triassic carbonate outcrops and chloride water mainly occurs in the paleozoic formations of the secondary anticline and the tectonically confined triassic strata chen 1977 luo et al 1981 figs 1 2 different hydrochemical types may be primarily related to two factors one is lithology the other is the strength of tectonism the formation of most of the giant halite and sulfate sedimentary layers in the strata is related to the evaporation and precipitation after seawater percolates into enclosed depressions warren 2010 marine evaporites in the study area are widely distributed there are three salt forming ages in the study area sinian cambrian and early middle triassic ma et al 1988 lin 1999 the tectonic framework of the study area was formed during the indosinian yanshan epoch indosinian was a period of amalgamation of the main plates in china during this period the cathaysian block and the yangtze block were the first to complete the amalgamation at the end of middle triassic and the qinling dabie orogenic belt was formed in the late triassic the mountains formed during this period have been flattened the sichuan basin was formed in the yanshanian jurassic to early cretaceous and the current mountain range was formed later however the distribution of hydrochemical types in this area is very consistent with the current geological structure and topography therefore under the background of widespread distribution of evaporites including salt rock in cambrian and early middle triassic it can be inferred that different groundwater circulation velocities and recharge conditions controlled by tectonic movement are the primary reason for such distribution of hydrochemical types which is of great significance for the preservation of soluble components coomar et al 2019 chongqing is located in the middle upper yangtze block fig 1a the jiangnan orogenic belt has formed from the collision and extrusion of the yangtze block and the cathaysian block forms a tectonic stress transmitted from se to nw in chongqing chengkou and the area to the north of it belong to the qinling geosynclinal fold system fig 1 wang et al 2018 under the action of the qinling dabie orogenic belt formed by the collision of the yangtze block and the north china block the tectonic stress of the shallow crust was transferred from ne to sw and strong extrusion resulted in the the mt daba arc like fault fold belt projecting to the sw fig 1b wang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 the whole tectonic framework was generated in the indosinian and yanshanian movements and the previous tectonic framework was transformed in different degrees by the himalayan movement wang et al 2018 from sec and nec to mwc the deformation time was delayed progressively and the degree of compression deformation decreased which has resulted in the corresponding changes of the properties related to the degree of tectonic opening and topographic gradients of circulation depth water temperature influence of meteoric water and tds the strata in sec and nec are broken and have open hydrological connectivity the central and eastern part of mwc has medium hydrological connectivity with both closed and open strata to the west of the mt huaying basement fault its hydrological connectivity is poor and the strata are closed fig 2 in sec heat and water conduction by faults are assumed to be major controlling factors of middle deep groundwater channels yang et al 2019 from se to nw there is a gradual variation from trough like folds with wide anticlines and narrow synclines to partition style folds with narrow anticlines and wide synclines fig 8 the fold strength and the degree of aquifer filtration and dilution decreases along the same gradient resulting in the change of sulfate water to chloride water and average maximum circulation depths also decreases from 3 2 0 7 to 2 3 0 8 km table a 1 in nec large areas of triassic carbonate rocks that contain salts where halite and sylvite occur in synclines lin 1999 constitute the most enriched strata of underground formation water brine in the sichuan basin zhou et al 2014 the anticlines are paleozoic salt bearing strata including those from the cambrian ordovician and permian all of which are favorable for the formation of chloride water under suitable structural conditions although the folding and denudation are intense in sec and nec the ancient paleozoic strata have been exposed relatively recently the evaporites in the strata that have not been excessively dissolved and filtered can still form saline springs in mwc thick jurassic sandy mudstone caprocks are distributed in synclines and low gentle anticlines within which the relatively weak tectonic stresses and the good sealing capacity greatly weaken the intensity of water circulation and preserve the soluble salts of protogenetic deposits the total salt content of the inland fluvial lacustrine jurassic strata to the west of the mt huaying basement fault is 0 76 20 91 which has greatly exceeded the salt bearing formation index 0 5 li et al 1980 xie et al 1981 however the strata in the axis of the steeply dipping anticlines are eroded earlier and the fissures caused by tensile stress provide ideal channels for fluid flow resulting in the formation of sulfate water by leaching and dilution salts are precipitated according to their solubility sulfate rocks with low solubility are distributed extensively and it is easy for chlorides to be over filtrated and diluted so that sulfate water is widely distributed 5 5 conceptual model of middle deep groundwater circulation the deep seated thermal fluids are principally controlled by stratigraphic structure and topography while the influence of karst development is significantly weakened wang et al 2018 boreholes on both sides of the anticlines e g no 39 41 48 and 51 are located at the flexure point of the anticline flank and syncline and there are still so4 ca type geothermal waters in the reservoirs drilled from the mid jurassic to the buried depths of 1718 2974 m wang 2003 yang et al 2017 wang and zhang 2004 the yangtze river the base level of erosion in study area is above 150 m a s l in addition the drilling profiles in mwc and sec show that the karst fracture systems of reservoirs are heterogeneous which are separated into several sections by dense limestone liu 2010 all of these show that the groundwater flows along the deep seated strata may not be controlled by the minimum erosion base level although the shallow aquifer is exposed to the surface at the formation decompression formed by river erosion groundwater in the deep aquifer continues to flow along the stratum below the river that cuts the core of an anticline and supplies the reservoirs in the flanks of the anticline at the opposite river bank the recharge and discharge of groundwater in a basin is generally driven by gravity tóth 1963 and overburden pressure lin 2006 precipitation in mwc recharges groundwater via tectonically weak zones such as karst valleys in steeply dipping anticlines and tensile fractures that connect cap rocks and aquifers in anticlines and the amount of recharge is related to the aquifer s outcrop area shallow karst groundwater flows through the aquifer to the depth of the two flanks of the anticline and along the anticlinal trend towards the plunging end the triassic aquifers in the syncline axes are mostly buried at a depth of about 3 km han 2002 under the action of sedimentary compaction only solid evaporites and a small amount of stagnant formation water brine are retained in deep seated syncline axes most of the brine is compacted and discharged ma et al 1988 song 1993 tang et al 2018 compaction also makes the deep seated carbonates in the syncline axis have low porosity which impede the fluid movement along the flank of the anticline to the synclinal axis groundwater in the two flanks of the same anticline is separated by mudstone and limestone of the lower triassic feixianguan formation in the core and connects only at the plunging end fig 9 in the process of deep circulation chemical heat generated in the process of water rock interaction and the geothermal gradient make the groundwater temperature increase groundwater dissolves surrounding rock minerals and obtains the corresponding chemical components these waters can be replenished by connate water in the depth of the anticlinal flanks and mixed with shallow groundwater as they discharge at the decompression of rock strata such as anticlines cut by rivers or faults to form a spring fig 9 the well developed fractures and decollement spaces formed in the nec and sec synclinal cores provide flow paths and there are parallel axial and vertical axial groundwater flows under the influence of gravity the depths of carbonate aquifers in synclinal axes are shallower than those in mwc driven by gravity associated with the topographic gradients the meteoric water percolates via karst fissures and faults from higher altitude in the folds the places with higher altitudes are not limited to anticlines but may also be the gentle flanks within higher altitudes of synclines the groundwater flows across the formation and through the synclinal axes to supply the adjacent anticlines or discharges in areas with topographic head differences and or fault cutting to form thermal springs the fluid is heated by geothermal heat and dissolves evaporites to increase salinity figs 8 10 6 conclusions the geological structure affects the erosion and weathering of the strata within the geologic structures of chongqing in southwest china which makes the evolution and distribution of hydrochemical types and flow paths of groundwater behave according to certain regular patterns the middle deep groundwaters in this region mainly dissolve gypsum and or anhydrite or halite to form sulfate water or chloride water respectively due to the different degree of structural closure related to topographic relief and the history of geological evolution these middle deep groundwaters have undergone all or part of the whole process as marine sedimentary metamorphic brine flushing out of brines by meteoric water rainwater mainly dissolving chloride minerals rainwater mainly dissolving sulfate minerals rainwater mainly dissolving carbonate minerals the tectonic stress transferred from se to nw in the jiangnan orogenic belt makes the maximum circulation depth of middle deep groundwater decreasing in the same direction and the average reservoir temperatures of sulfate water decrease from sec 82 15 c to mwc 78 9 c from the southeast to northwest of sec there is a transition from sulfate water to chloride water and its average maximum circulation depths are reduced from 3 2 0 7 to 2 3 0 8 km and the average estimated reservoir temperatures are reduced from 82 15 to 64 18 c the steeply dipping anticlines in mwc are characterized by the concentration of tectonic stress and the occurrence of sulfate water due to excessive leaching while synclines and low anticlines with confined structures or recent weathering and denudation exude chloride water and the average maximum circulation depths and temperatures of the former 2 1 0 3 km 78 9 c are higher than those of the latter 1 8 0 3 km 69 8 c the qinling dabie orogenic belt in nec is characterized by tectonic stress transferred from ne to sw violent tectonics thickening of strata and well developed fractures result in rapid downward percolation of groundwater and the lowest average estimated reservoir temperature of chloride water 55 27 c paleozoic strata of the anticlines are exposed by relatively recent denudation hosting chloride water and triassic formations largely outcrop in synclines containing sulfate water precipitation in mwc recharges groundwater via karst valleys and faults in the axes of steeply dipping anticlines driven by gravity the total flow direction of middle deep groundwater is anticlinal plunging end and deep seated flanks which cannot cross the deep seated synclines to discharge or supply another anticline the structure and geomorphology of nec and sec are not consistent and groundwater replenished by precipitation can discharge or replenish another anticline across the syncline the folds in the area to the west of the mt huaying basement fault tend to be horizontal and the groundwater runoff is slow or even stagnant and there are high salinity brines from leached rock salt or connate deposits in the process of runoff the groundwater is heated by geothermal and chemical heat mixes with different layers while ascending and mostly discharges springs formed in places such as river valleys or faults the outflow of eight middle deep groundwater sampling points in mwc varies slightly with a variation about 9 5 luo et al 2001 pu et al 2001 wang 2003 wang and zhang 2004 xiao 2004 yang 2008 zhang 2006 zhang and pu 2005 it may be that in groundwater flow systems composed of multiple aquifers and aquitards well developed shallow faults lead to the mixing of meteoric water or that water extraction groundwater mining causes the decrease of geothermal reservoir pressure this may results in cones of depression in some areas that the adjacent aquifers replenish across relatively impermeable layers this may affect the calculations of reservoir temperature and cycle depth but establishing that the overall variation trend

3265,large marine sedimentary basins often contain concentrated geothermal mineral resources chongqing municipality located in the sichuan marine sedimentary basin and the surrounding mountainous area of southwest china is rich in thermal waters and brines chongqing belongs to the middle upper yangtze tectonic block previous studies have mostly been based on basin structure but less on the whole plate structure to study the distribution and evolution of groundwater in this paper 78 middle deep groundwater samples in the study area were collected to better understand the occurrence and hydrochemical evolution of middle deep groundwater using ionic ratios hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and geothermometers tectonic stress has been transferred from se to nw in the jiangnan orogenic belt and from ne to sw in the qinling dabie orogenic belt making the extent of tectonic denudation and its related properties such as hydrochemical type reservoir temperature and maximum circulation depth trend along the same directions four of the water samples have br 103 cl and na cl molar ratios 1 5 and 0 87 respectively indicating that they are marine metamorphic brines the ratios of the rest of the samples are mostly distributed in a range suggesting precipitation dissolved halite or somewhere in between this suggests that the study area is in the denudation leaching period of the hydrogeological cycle and the middle deep groundwater system is still in the dynamic process of formation water residual metamorphic paleo seawater of the previous hydrogeological cycle diluted in places by rainwater a conceptual circulation model for regional middle deep groundwater is proposed rainfall in the late pleistocene infiltrated as groundwater recharge via fractures and karst valleys and circulated to deep strata driven by gravity where it could mix with residual paleo evaporated seawater then the groundwater was heated by geothermal and chemical energy sources mixing with shallow groundwater as it moved upward along faults toward the surface eventually to emerge from springs keywords middle deep groundwater geological structure marine sedimentary rock karst aqufier chongqing

for power generation górecki et al 2015 sowiżdżał et al 2019 pang et al 2018 the metallic and nonmetallic mineral resources in deep seated subsurface brines are also widely used in salt making and industrial raw material supply lowenstein et al 2003 ryabtsev et al 2020 as the development and utilization of middle deep groundwater in evaporate basins can thus provide an important resource to help solve global resource and environmental issues it is necessary to understand relevant formation mechanisms and the laws that govern distribution of these resources worldwide the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow circulating karst groundwaters which are generally of a hco3 ca or hco3 ca mg type are different from those of middle 0 3 2 km and deep 2 km circulating water in karst systems hem 1970 shallow karst systems containing evaporites are easily leached resulting in the loss of soluble salts as the flow path becomes longer the water flow can become almost stagnant which can result in the hydrochemical type gradually evolving into a so4 ca and cl na type with higher temperature and salinity ta et al 2019 chen et al 2007 the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater are controlled by geological structure and lithology permeability influenced by lithology exerts an important control on the rate of groundwater circulation as variations in the hydrochemical type of groundwater can affect the extent of flushing of the rock strata schmoker and halley 1982 several studies have emphasized the impact of geological structure on groundwater circulation mcintosh and ferguson 2021 dafny et al 2010 labat et al 2021 kong et al 2020 the degree of structural development affects the evolution of hydrochemical types and lithology provides the material basis for the formation of hydrochemical types these two factors play different roles in different regions the total karst area in china is 344 104 km2 accounting for 1 3 of the national area yuan et al 2016 chongqing is located in southwestern china fig 1 a which has the most concentrated and contiguous karst area of karst landscape development about 36 3 104 km2 of chongqing is covered by karst in chongqing lithology related to permeability is relatively consistent and can be used as the control variable tectonic topography then becomes the explanatory variable that controls the extent of water circulation and in turn the hydrochemical type and water temperature the eastern sichuan fold belt dominates the geologic structure of chongqing and is characterized by folds alternating between long steeply dipping anticlines and wide gentle synclines within this belt stratified thermal karst aquifers occur in uplifted mountain areas middle and lower triassic carbonate aquifers occur in the flanks of anticlines buried at depths of several hundred to 2 000 m wang et al 2018 yang et al 2017 and these mainly host low and medium temperature so4 ca water this is in contrast to shallow karst groundwater dominated by hco3 and ca2 pu et al 2010 but typical for mid to deep carbonate waters previous geothermal resource development utilization and research have mainly been concentrated in the eastern sichuan fold belt while only a handful of studies have focused on other local areas of consistent internal geological structure in chongqing cheng et al 2015 cao 2014 guo 2019 luo et al 2019 ta et al 2018 2019 xiao 2012 yang et al 2017 2019 zeng 2012 in the higher level of geological tectonic divisions all of chongqing belongs to the middle upper yangtze block the internal subregions of chongqing are interrelated with each other so that the distribution formation and evolution mechanisms of middle deep groundwater in the different regions are relatively homogeneous details of the flow paths and even the recharge areas are poorly characterized both of which are obviously of great importance in the exploration of geothermal water and brines in this context this paper studies the whole of chongqing at the level of the middle upper yangtze block the goals of this paper are to explore the origins of middle deep groundwater water rock interactions and runoff processes finally the geological temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the openness degree of middle deep groundwater systems in chongqing under the influence of geological structure are clarified providing reference for the exploration comprehensive exploitation and sustainable utilization of geothermal resources 2 study area 2 1 geographical setting southwest china s chongqing municipality is located between n 28 10 32 13 and e 105 17 110 11 covering an area of 8 24 104 km2 there were 142 thermal water access points warm springs and drilled warm springs by the end of 2014 thus it has been called the hot springs capital of china the landscape in chongqing consists mainly of hills and mountains and it is known as a mountain city wang et al 2018 the north east and south are surrounded by mt daba mt wuling and mt dalou respectively fig 1b the area is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate with mean annual air temperature and rainfall from 17 to 23 c and 1000 mm respectively the wet season is from may to september accounting for about 53 of the total annual precipitation the dry season occurs in december and january to march of the following year yang et al 2019 2 2 geological settings geological formations from upper sinian to middle triassic in the study area are mainly marine carbonates interbedded with clastic rocks and evaporates gypsum and or anhydrite and halite fig 1c they have undergone multicyclic tectonic movement varying in a thickness from 4 to 7 km the underlying lower paleozoic marine black mud shale has high hydrocarbon generation potential guo 2015 the strata from the upper triassic to the cretaceous are red sandstone and mudstone deposits of lacustrine facies ranging in a thickness from 2 to 6 km mou et al 2014 luo and he 2014 zhou et al 1997 according to finer tectonic subdivisions chongqing is divided into the central sichuan gentle fold belt located to the west of the mt huaying basement fault the eastern sichuan fold belt located to the west of the mt qiyao basement fault the qianyuxiange uplift fold belt located to the east of the mt qiyao basement fault and the mt daba arc like fault fold belt located to the north of the shashi hidden fault fig 2 different hydrogeological conditions are the key factors affecting hydrochemical composition of groundwater drogue et al 2000 therefore the study area can be divided into three divisions according to the different tectonic units and outcrops fig 2 2 2 1 midwest chongqing mwc the central sichuan anteklise is located in the westernmost part of chongqing and of the mt huaying basement fault because its geological structure is similar to the syncline of the eastern sichuan fold belt it is classified into this category there are mostly ne to nne trending short axis gently dipping anticlines in the central sichuan anteklise and the strata dip angle is generally 1 3 li et al 1980 jurassic red sandstone and mudstone are the main outcropping formations luo 1987 faults are rare and the structures and lithology are simple so the soluble salts of protogenetic deposits in the strata can be preserved li et al 1977 the eastern sichuan fold belt is characterized by a succession of nearly parallel nne trending narrow asymmetric steeply dipping anticlines and nearly symmetrical broad gentle synclines the elevation of the low ranges formed by these anticlines is generally between 500 and 900 m and the synclines form relatively broad hills ranging in elevation from 300 to 500 m chen 1977 the faults of the wide and gentle synclines are not developed but the deep seated faults of the triassic jialingjiang formation and the older strata near the axis of the high uplift anticline are well developed luo 1987 tan 1990 wang and zhang 2004 these are mainly small scale compression torsional thrust faults that have become pathways for deep formation thermal fluids middle and lower triassic marine sedimentary rocks occur at the axis of the anticlines varying in a thickness from 600 to 1000 m and are the main reservoirs of middle deep groundwater yang et al 2007 the upper triassic xujiahe formation which has poor thermal and water conductivity and serves as a cap rock is composed of feldspar quartz sandstone imbedded with carbonaceous shale and coal seams with a thickness of about 400 m mainly outcropping in the flanks and cores of anticlines the lower triassic feixianguan or daye formation is argillaceous rock interbedded with limestone with a thickness of 500 m and exhibits low permeability and thermal conductivity cheng et al 2015 2 2 2 southeast chongqing sec southeast chongqing is located to the southeast of the mt qiyao basement fault and the paleozoic strata are widely distributed it is characterized by a series of ne trending synclines and anticlines cut by faults from nw to se the folds change from narrow anticlines and wide synclines to wide anticlines and narrow synclines and the intensity of structural deformation gradually strengthens as the outcrops gradually evolve through time hu 2017 most folds form low to medium sized mountains ranging in elevation from 1000 to 1300 m normal faults are well developed mostly occurring in the axes of anticlines and are the main pathways for the ascent of middle deep groundwater the devonian and silurian strata serve as aquitards with a thickness of nearly two kilometers located in the anticlinal flanks sandwiched between the cambrian and ordovician carbonate aquifers these mainly outcrop in anticlines while the permian and triassic carbonate aquifers mainly outcrop in synclines zhou et al 2017 there are more halite pseudocrystal and gypsum layers in the middle cambrian section the total thickness of sedimentary the strata is 7700 m and the lower paleozoic marine carbonate strata are the most well developed and widely distributed with a thickness of 4545 m xia et al 1979 2 2 3 northeast chongqing nec the northeast chongqing section includes the shashi hidden fault the mt daba arc like fault fold belt to the north and the area to the east of the mt qiyao basement fault in northeast chongqing the latter is adjacent to the mt daba arc like fault fold belt which is structurally similar and the outcrops are all mostly middle and lower triassic so they belong to the same area for discussion there are mainly a series of nw trending and sw protruding arc shaped faulted folds accompanied by high angle thrust faults and strong compression the density of folds and faults weakens towards the southwest lin 2016 as the altitude decreases from 2200 to about 1500 m chen 1977 the rock formations have steep dip angles and provide the thermal fluid migration channels the outcrops include a large area of carbonate rock and a small amount of interbedded insoluble rock ranging from upper sinian to lower triassic the lower triassic strata are the most widely distributed mostly occurring in the cores of synclines the lower cambrian strata mostly occur in the cores of anticlines ordovician and permian strata constitute the main potential thermal reservoirs and the lower triassic daye formation forms a cap rock lower permian devonian and carboniferous formations serve as aquitards the lower triassic jialingjiang formation constitutes the secondary potential thermal reservoir with a cap rock formed by the middle triassic badong formation 3 methodology 3 1 sampling and measurements this paper summarizes strata lithology and the evolutionary history of geological structure based on previous literature and geological maps physicochemical data of the middle deep groundwater in chongqing and the data related to the exploitation of geothermal wells were collected and combined with the data of 19 thermal waters in sec obtained during november 2017 and july 2018 field sampling methods laboratory tests and corresponding data have been reported in literature yang et al 2019b the data of the remaining 59 water samples

oxygen isotopes if any were compiled the aforementioned data and their extreme values mean values standard deviation and corresponding calculation results are shown in table a 1 all values are expressed as mean one standard deviation 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 saturation index si the saturation index si was calculated using phreeqc version 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 when si 0 the solution is undersaturated when si 0 mineral dissolution and precipitation reach equilibrium and the solution is saturated when si 0 the solution is over saturated and minerals are predicted to precipitate 3 2 2 geothermometers there are reaction equilibrium relationships between mineral solubility and temperature with which a series of empirical formulas can be established to estimate reservoir temperature arnorsson 1985 and these are called geothermometers silica geothermometers and cation geothermometers are widely used the calculations used in this study are as follows 1 quartz fournier 1977 t1 1309

zone in km which in chongqing is about 80 100 m zhou et al 2017 thus taking the average depth of 0 09 km as the value of z0 4 results 4 1 hydrogeochemistry piper plots can intuitively show water samples of different hydrochemical facies according to the proportions of major ions chadha 1999 considering the tds values the water samples can be roughly classified into two hydrochemical categories sulfate water dominated by ca2 and so4 2 and lower tds values ranging 1000 3000 mg l and chloride water dominated by na and cl and higher tds values 5000 mg l fig 3 among chloride waters average tds values in mwc nec and sec decrease successively which are 146580 120144 57641 88694 and 16048 11534 mg l respectively fig 3 the average discharging temperatures in mwc sec and nec are 40 8 9 5 31 6 14 3 and 25 4 8 2 c respectively table a 1 among sulfate waters the average discharging temperatures and tds values in nec 19 8 1 c 731 82 mg l are lower than those in mwc 45 2 7 9 c 2484 786 6 mg l the average discharging temperatures and tds values of sec are 41 5 6 5 c and 1020 3 770 5 mg l respectively which are between those of mwc and nec table a 1 4 2 saturation index si and hydrochemical balance the sis of quartz in middle deep groundwater range from 0 2 to 1 1 and these imply oversaturation but close to saturation table 1 the sis of halite are 0 implying undersaturation the sis of anhydrite calcite dolomite and gypsum range over positive and negative values which indicate the dissolved minerals vary between oversaturation and undersaturation the na k mg triangular plot proposed by giggenbach 1988 can be used to identify the water rock equilibrium and categorize groundwater into three groups fully equilibrated water immature water that has been mixed with shallow water during deep seated thermal fluid ascent and or re equilibrates along the circulation flow path and partially equilibrated water in between sulfate waters in sec and mwc are at the mg2 corner and showing immature water fig 4 suggesting that the groundwater has been mixed with shallow cold groundwater in the ascending process chloride water data points are mostly located in partially equilibrated and mature water zones 4 3 reservoir temperature and circulation depth the geothermometer is based on temperature dependent water rock chemical equilibrium so the mineral equilibrium of water samples should be tested first giggenbach 1988 fig 4 shows that part of the chloride waters are in the full equilibrium area so the cation geothermometer is available the na k geothermometer is applicable to high temperature 180 c geothermal systems arnorsson 1985 the δd and δ18o of groundwater show no significant positive δ18o shift fig 5 indicating that the maximum reservoir temperature is below 100 c mayo and loucks 1995 thus the na k geothermometer is not applicable the k mg geothermometer is suitable for low temperature geothermal systems giggenbach 1988 the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for geothermal water that is rich in calcium fournier and potter 1995 quartz dissolved in groundwater is generally oversaturated table 1 thus the quartz geothermometer fournier 1977 and the improved sio2 geothermometer verma and santoyo 1997 are suitable for the calculation of reservoir temperature resulting in a value of 70 c the calculation results of reservoir temperatures are shown in table a 1 compared with the discharging temperatures the reservoir temperatures calculated by the k mg geothermometer are lower in the sulfate waters of mwc and sec and others are higher the na k ca geothermometer is suitable for calcium rich geothermal water so it is not feasible to calculate the reservoir temperatures for chloride water dominated by na and cl and the calculated temperatures of sulfate water are lower than discharging temperatures the results of quartz geothermometer and the improved sio2 geothermometer are slightly higher than the groundwater outflow temperatures table a 1 which proves that the calculation results are reasonable in summary taking the average value of the calculation results of quartz geothermometer and the improved sio2 geothermometer the estimated reservoir temperatures of sulfate water in sec and mwc are the highest averaging at 82 15 and 78 9 c respectively the estimated reservoir temperatures of chloride water in mwc are slightly higher than that in sec averaging at 69 8 and 64 18 c respectively the estimated reservoir temperatures of chloride water in nec are the lowest averaging at 55 27 c these values are consistent with the temperature range 64 104 c of geothermal reservoir data obtained from the chongqing geological survey chongqing municipal people s government 2010 groundwater temperature depends on circulation depth geothermal gradient exothermic reactions in water rock interactions magmatic activity and active faulting yang et al 2017 to the east of the mt huaying basement fault in the study area is the basement area of weak to non magnetic and low grade metamorphic rocks of mid late proterozoic without an active magmatic heat source and radioactive heat generation fig 2 to the west of this fault is the basement area of archean strongly magnetic and medium basic igneous rocks luo 1987 feng et al 2019 we can conclude that waters examined in this research are mainly heated by terrestrial heat as such the circulation depth can be estimated via the geothermal gradient and reservoir temperature as expressed by eq 1 the average maximum circulation depths of sulfate water in sec and mwc are 3 2 0 7 and 2 1 0 3 km and that of chloride water are 2 3 0 8 and 1 8 0 3 km respectively the average maximum circulation depths of chloride water in nec are 1 3 0 9 km table a 1 which are the shallowest among the three regions comparing the calculated results of 31 geothermal drilling water samples with the well depths table a 1 it was found that the calculated circulation depth of 5 water samples is slightly less than the geothermal well depth and the relative error range is 0 7 5 8 this may be due to the mixing of middle deep groundwater with shallow groundwater resulting in the calculated circulation depth being less than the actual circulation depth shown by the geothermal wells but the error is within a reasonable range the exploration results of 30 drilled wells in mwc demonstrate that most well waters are in the 2nd through the 4th members of the jialingjiang formation with depth of about two kilometers the 1st member and older strata depth 2 5 km have low porosity and poor water abundance yang et al 2007 5 discussion 5 1 origin of the middle deep groundwaters oxygen and hydrogen isotopes are relatively stable in groundwater circulation and can be used as tracers to determine the potential origin of groundwater and water rock interactions craig 1961 hydrogen and oxygen isotope studies have shown that thermal springs with a low enthalpy background are most likely replenished by rainfall soraya et al 2019 the current study area mostly belongs to a low enthalpy thermal water area wang et al 2018 fig 5 shows that δ18o and δd values of all the data points n 19 except numbers 1 and 2 fall near the chongqing meteoric water line cmwl li et al 2010 and the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 indicating that the middle deep groundwaters originated as meteoric water this is in agreement with the conclusions drawn by luo et al 2006 and yang et al 2019 that the recharge of thermal waters in the sec and the southern part of mwc originated from precipitation in the late pleistocene 5 2 principal geochemical processes the chemical composition of middle deep groundwater is the result of water rock interaction under high temperature conditions governed by the chemical composition of country rock minerals huang et al 2019 the key mineral components of the carbonate evaporite rocks e g the lower triassic jialingjiang formation are calcite and dolomite followed by secondary minerals such as anhydrite pyrite halite quartz and celestite which provide a material basis for the chemical composition of geothermal water han 2002 it can thus be assumed that based on geological structure and lithology analyses combined with hydrochemical characteristics the origin of groundwater principal geochemical reactions and the evolution of chemical composition can be determined christina et al 2014 zarei et al 2013 when the equivalent ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 is 1 1 the ions are controlled by the solubility equilibrium of carbonate and gypsum guo et al 2018 marghade et al 2020 most of the data points in fig 6 a are close to the 1 1 line indicating that the equilibrium dissolution of gypsum and or anhydrite and carbonate minerals are the main source of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 in the water when carbonate rock dissolution is dominant the meq l ratio of ca2 mg2 hco3 is 1 1 and the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratio of gypsum dissolution is 1 1 choi et al 2012 ca2 mg2 hco3 equivalent ratios for most data points deviate far away from 1 1 line fig 6b and the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratios mostly fall near the 1 1 line fig 6c indicating that ca2 and so4 2 in waters are mainly from gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution in equilibrium the ca2 so4 2 equivalent ratios of some chloride waters including sample no 1 in nec and mwc show a nonlinear relationship fig 6a c which may be due to bacterial sulfate reduction christina et al 2014 drogue et al 2000 or thermal chemical sulfate reduction reactions machel et al 1995 krouse and viau 1988 involving water and hydrocarbons under high temperature and pressure reducing conditions the reaction reduces so4 2 to h2s gas and consumes light isotopes first making the δd of water sample number 1 formed by rainfall dissolving halite more positive fig 5 in fig 6d the molar ratios of na cl mostly fall near the 1 1 line indicating that they are from the dissolution of halite formations water rock interactions can release heat at 18 c the heat released during anhydrite dissolution is 4 44 kcal mol gao et al 2008 thus the dissolution of sulfate rocks and halite can heat middle deep groundwater sr2 exists in the crystal lattice of gypsum and has leached into groundwater with gypsum the precipitation of srso4 is later than that of caco3 and earlier than that of caso4 2h2o and caso4 shen 2010 therefore sr2 is not enriched in the carbonate deposits and the content of sr2 in groundwater from the carbonate reservoir is low thus the molar ratio of ca2 sr2 is high close to 200 in marine connate sedimentary waters the ratio of ca sr is generally about 33 guo 2019 the tds values of sample numbers 72 and 73 of sec are as low as 396 26 and 276 mg l and the molar ratios of ca sr are close to 200 that is 152 and 194 respectively fig 6e indicating that these may have come from carbonate formations without gypsum resulting in low sr2 and salinity the molar ratios of ca sr in the remaining data points are mostly between 33 and 200 and this is likely due to the dissolution of sulfate formations in the dissolution processes of the minerals above the water rock interaction dissolves the reservoir which provides ideal channels for groundwater transport in the middle and deep strata 5 3 evolution of hydrochemical types in geological history under favorable structural conditions evaporated seawater can be trapped in marine carbonate rocks in study area marine sedimentary metamorphic black brine mainly occurs in the middle and lower triassic carbonate aquifers in confined low gentle anticlines with low tectonic pressures cao 2014 chen et al 2014 lin and pan 2001 zhou et al 2018 the black brine has a black sediment of turbid suspended solids strong hydrogen sulfide odor and high heavy metal content it originated as a mixture of gypsum crystal water dissolving halite and residual paleo evaporated seawater lin 2006 wang 1989 zhou et al 1997 the strata and structures where the brine is located are also where some of the middle deep circulating groundwater is located such as the hechuan dashiqiao anticline no 22 the dianjiang wolonghe anticline nos 21 and 24 the kaizhou wenquan anticline nos 4 6 and the yunanchang anticline nos 14 17 gong 2016 the deep formation brine can become the replenishment source of middle deep groundwater during structural evolution the mixing of brine and meteoric water can increase the concentration of cl na as well as br a characteristic element in marine sedimentary brines in the middle deep groundwater richard et al 2011 na cl and br 103 cl coefficients are the coefficients with greatest stability in seawater which can be used to determine the origin of groundwater fig 7 the molar ratio of na cl in standard seawater ranges from 0 85 to 0 87 when seawater evaporates and becomes concentrated to the point of halite deposition the molar ratio of na cl decreases continuously so the ratio of depositional metamorphic brine is generally 0 87 and that of non marine leaching brines is generally greater than or close to 1 stiller et al 2009 vengosh et al 2002 when dissolved salts begin to deposit with the evaporation of lake water in enclosed lake basins less soluble carbonates caco3 camg co3 2 are deposited first followed by sulphates caso4 na2so4 mgso4 and chlorides nacl kmgcl3 last shen 2010 thus the molar ratio of na cl can also decrease sometimes even below 0 87 when dissolving the strata containing chlorides of the last deposition stage stiller et al 2009 br takes a minimal part in the reactions that form solid minerals in the process of evaporation and concentration of seawater only a small fraction of bromine ions replace chloride ions in the form of isomorphism into solid salts and most br remains in the residual evaporated seawater the br content of residual evaporated seawater increases linearly with evaporation and concentration the br 103 cl molar ratio of modern seawater is 1 5 fontes and matray 1993 halite precipitation consumes 1 1 mol of na and cl thus the br 103 cl molar ratio of residual evaporated seawater is 1 5 the seawater value the br 103 cl molar ratio of sedimentary halite is between 0 05 and 0 3 correspondingly that ratio of dissolved halite precipitation is 0 3 when potassium halide is deposited the br 103 cl molar ratio in the residual evaporated seawater increases to 25 and the sylvite deposited at the same time is also rich in br therefore that ratio of rainwater dissolving potassium and magnesium salts is 1 hao et al 2020 vengosh et al 2002 samples numbers 17 22 23 24 fig 7 and 25 fig 6d in mwc are not stagnant sedimentary metamorphic brine and their na cl molar ratios range from 0 476 to 0 845 the data suggest that these water samples probably originated from rainwater leached potassium and magnesium salts or rainwater mixed with sedimentary metamorphic brine fig 7 these water samples are in the transition stage of the dynamic process of marine sedimentary metamorphic brine being replaced by rainwater with the progress of weathering and denudation middle deep groundwater undergoes part or all of this process marine sedimentary metamorphic brine flushing out of brines by meteoric water rainwater principally dissolves chloride minerals rainwater principally dissolves sulfate minerals rainwater principally dissolves carbonate minerals the hydrogeological cycle of the study area starts from the continental clastic rocks deposited in the upper triassic and now enters the second stage of the cycle that is the denudation leaching period the middle deep groundwater system is still in the dynamic process of residual metamorphic paleo seawater of the previous hydrogeological cycle diluted in places by rainwater 5 4 geologic tectonic process and distribution of hydrochemical type the middle deep groundwaters in sec mainly occur in the cambrian ordovician and permian formations to the west of the yushan fault chloride water occurs with sulfate water to the east fig 2 yang et al 2019b from the axes to the flanks of steeply dipping anticlines in mwc on which karst valleys develop the hydrochemical types of groundwater in the middle and lower triassic formations change from the bicarbonate type to the sulfate type and chloride water mostly occurs in synclines and confined anticlines in nec sulfate water mainly exists in synclines within the large area of triassic carbonate outcrops and chloride water mainly occurs in the paleozoic formations of the secondary anticline and the tectonically confined triassic strata chen 1977 luo et al 1981 figs 1 2 different hydrochemical types may be primarily related to two factors one is lithology the other is the strength of tectonism the formation of most of the giant halite and sulfate sedimentary layers in the strata is related to the evaporation and precipitation after seawater percolates into enclosed depressions warren 2010 marine evaporites in the study area are widely distributed there are three salt forming ages in the study area sinian cambrian and early middle triassic ma et al 1988 lin 1999 the tectonic framework of the study area was formed during the indosinian yanshan epoch indosinian was a period of amalgamation of the main plates in china during this period the cathaysian block and the yangtze block were the first to complete the amalgamation at the end of middle triassic and the qinling dabie orogenic belt was formed in the late triassic the mountains formed during this period have been flattened the sichuan basin was formed in the yanshanian jurassic to early cretaceous and the current mountain range was formed later however the distribution of hydrochemical types in this area is very consistent with the current geological structure and topography therefore under the background of widespread distribution of evaporites including salt rock in cambrian and early middle triassic it can be inferred that different groundwater circulation velocities and recharge conditions controlled by tectonic movement are the primary reason for such distribution of hydrochemical types which is of great significance for the preservation of soluble components coomar et al 2019 chongqing is located in the middle upper yangtze block fig 1a the jiangnan orogenic belt has formed from the collision and extrusion of the yangtze block and the cathaysian block forms a tectonic stress transmitted from se to nw in chongqing chengkou and the area to the north of it belong to the qinling geosynclinal fold system fig 1 wang et al 2018 under the action of the qinling dabie orogenic belt formed by the collision of the yangtze block and the north china block the tectonic stress of the shallow crust was transferred from ne to sw and strong extrusion resulted in the the mt daba arc like fault fold belt projecting to the sw fig 1b wang et al 2017 yan et al 2018 the whole tectonic framework was generated in the indosinian and yanshanian movements and the previous tectonic framework was transformed in different degrees by the himalayan movement wang et al 2018 from sec and nec to mwc the deformation time was delayed progressively and the degree of compression deformation decreased which has resulted in the corresponding changes of the properties related to the degree of tectonic opening and topographic gradients of circulation depth water temperature influence of meteoric water and tds the strata in sec and nec are broken and have open hydrological connectivity the central and eastern part of mwc has medium hydrological connectivity with both closed and open strata to the west of the mt huaying basement fault its hydrological connectivity is poor and the strata are closed fig 2 in sec heat and water conduction by faults are assumed to be major controlling factors of middle deep groundwater channels yang et al 2019 from se to nw there is a gradual variation from trough like folds with wide anticlines and narrow synclines to partition style folds with narrow anticlines and wide synclines fig 8 the fold strength and the degree of aquifer filtration and dilution decreases along the same gradient resulting in the change of sulfate water to chloride water and average maximum circulation depths also decreases from 3 2 0 7 to 2 3 0 8 km table a 1 in nec large areas of triassic carbonate rocks that contain salts where halite and sylvite occur in synclines lin 1999 constitute the most enriched strata of underground formation water brine in the sichuan basin zhou et al 2014 the anticlines are paleozoic salt bearing strata including those from the cambrian ordovician and permian all of which are favorable for the formation of chloride water under suitable structural conditions although the folding and denudation are intense in sec and nec the ancient paleozoic strata have been exposed relatively recently the evaporites in the strata that have not been excessively dissolved and filtered can still form saline springs in mwc thick jurassic sandy mudstone caprocks are distributed in synclines and low gentle anticlines within which the relatively weak tectonic stresses and the good sealing capacity greatly weaken the intensity of water circulation and preserve the soluble salts of protogenetic deposits the total salt content of the inland fluvial lacustrine jurassic strata to the west of the mt huaying basement fault is 0 76 20 91 which has greatly exceeded the salt bearing formation index 0 5 li et al 1980 xie et al 1981 however the strata in the axis of the steeply dipping anticlines are eroded earlier and the fissures caused by tensile stress provide ideal channels for fluid flow resulting in the formation of sulfate water by leaching and dilution salts are precipitated according to their solubility sulfate rocks with low solubility are distributed extensively and it is easy for chlorides to be over filtrated and diluted so that sulfate water is widely distributed 5 5 conceptual model of middle deep groundwater circulation the deep seated thermal fluids are principally controlled by stratigraphic structure and topography while the influence of karst development is significantly weakened wang et al 2018 boreholes on both sides of the anticlines e g no 39 41 48 and 51 are located at the flexure point of the anticline flank and syncline and there are still so4 ca type geothermal waters in the reservoirs drilled from the mid jurassic to the buried depths of 1718 2974 m wang 2003 yang et al 2017 wang and zhang 2004 the yangtze river the base level of erosion in study area is above 150 m a s l in addition the drilling profiles in mwc and sec show that the karst fracture systems of reservoirs are heterogeneous which are separated into several sections by dense limestone liu 2010 all of these show that the groundwater flows along the deep seated strata may not be controlled by the minimum erosion base level although the shallow aquifer is exposed to the surface at the formation decompression formed by river erosion groundwater in the deep aquifer continues to flow along the stratum below the river that cuts the core of an anticline and supplies the reservoirs in the flanks of the anticline at the opposite river bank the recharge and discharge of groundwater in a basin is generally driven by gravity tóth 1963 and overburden pressure lin 2006 precipitation in mwc recharges groundwater via tectonically weak zones such as karst valleys in steeply dipping anticlines and tensile fractures that connect cap rocks and aquifers in anticlines and the amount of recharge is related to the aquifer s outcrop area shallow karst groundwater flows through the aquifer to the depth of the two flanks of the anticline and along the anticlinal trend towards the plunging end the triassic aquifers in the syncline axes are mostly buried at a depth of about 3 km han 2002 under the action of sedimentary compaction only solid evaporites and a small amount of stagnant formation water brine are retained in deep seated syncline axes most of the brine is compacted and discharged ma et al 1988 song 1993 tang et al 2018 compaction also makes the deep seated carbonates in the syncline axis have low porosity which impede the fluid movement along the flank of the anticline to the synclinal axis groundwater in the two flanks of the same anticline is separated by mudstone and limestone of the lower triassic feixianguan formation in the core and connects only at the plunging end fig 9 in the process of deep circulation chemical heat generated in the process of water rock interaction and the geothermal gradient make the groundwater temperature increase groundwater dissolves surrounding rock minerals and obtains the corresponding chemical components these waters can be replenished by connate water in the depth of the anticlinal flanks and mixed with shallow groundwater as they discharge at the decompression of rock strata such as anticlines cut by rivers or faults to form a spring fig 9 the well developed fractures and decollement spaces formed in the nec and sec synclinal cores provide flow paths and there are parallel axial and vertical axial groundwater flows under the influence of gravity the depths of carbonate aquifers in synclinal axes are shallower than those in mwc driven by gravity associated with the topographic gradients the meteoric water percolates via karst fissures and faults from higher altitude in the folds the places with higher altitudes are not limited to anticlines but may also be the gentle flanks within higher altitudes of synclines the groundwater flows across the formation and through the synclinal axes to supply the adjacent anticlines or discharges in areas with topographic head differences and or fault cutting to form thermal springs the fluid is heated by geothermal heat and dissolves evaporites to increase salinity figs 8 10 6 conclusions the geological structure affects the erosion and weathering of the strata within the geologic structures of chongqing in southwest china which makes the evolution and distribution of hydrochemical types and flow paths of groundwater behave according to certain regular patterns the middle deep groundwaters in this region mainly dissolve gypsum and or anhydrite or halite to form sulfate water or chloride water respectively due to the different degree of structural closure related to topographic relief and the history of geological evolution these middle deep groundwaters have undergone all or part of the whole process as marine sedimentary metamorphic brine flushing out of brines by meteoric water rainwater mainly dissolving chloride minerals rainwater mainly dissolving sulfate minerals rainwater mainly dissolving carbonate minerals the tectonic stress transferred from se to nw in the jiangnan orogenic belt makes the maximum circulation depth of middle deep groundwater decreasing in the same direction and the average reservoir temperatures of sulfate water decrease from sec 82 15 c to mwc 78 9 c from the southeast to northwest of sec there is a transition from sulfate water to chloride water and its average maximum circulation depths are reduced from 3 2 0 7 to 2 3 0 8 km and the average estimated reservoir temperatures are reduced from 82 15 to 64 18 c the steeply dipping anticlines in mwc are characterized by the concentration of tectonic stress and the occurrence of sulfate water due to excessive leaching while synclines and low anticlines with confined structures or recent weathering and denudation exude chloride water and the average maximum circulation depths and temperatures of the former 2 1 0 3 km 78 9 c are higher than those of the latter 1 8 0 3 km 69 8 c the qinling dabie orogenic belt in nec is characterized by tectonic stress transferred from ne to sw violent tectonics thickening of strata and well developed fractures result in rapid downward percolation of groundwater and the lowest average estimated reservoir temperature of chloride water 55 27 c paleozoic strata of the anticlines are exposed by relatively recent denudation hosting chloride water and triassic formations largely outcrop in synclines containing sulfate water precipitation in mwc recharges groundwater via karst valleys and faults in the axes of steeply dipping anticlines driven by gravity the total flow direction of middle deep groundwater is anticlinal plunging end and deep seated flanks which cannot cross the deep seated synclines to discharge or supply another anticline the structure and geomorphology of nec and sec are not consistent and groundwater replenished by precipitation can discharge or replenish another anticline across the syncline the folds in the area to the west of the mt huaying basement fault tend to be horizontal and the groundwater runoff is slow or even stagnant and there are high salinity brines from leached rock salt or connate deposits in the process of runoff the groundwater is heated by geothermal and chemical heat mixes with different layers while ascending and mostly discharges springs formed in places such as river valleys or faults the outflow of eight middle deep groundwater sampling points in mwc varies slightly with a variation about 9 5 luo et al 2001 pu et al 2001 wang 2003 wang and zhang 2004 xiao 2004 yang 2008 zhang 2006 zhang and pu 2005 it may be that in groundwater flow systems composed of multiple aquifers and aquitards well developed shallow faults lead to the mixing of meteoric water or that water extraction groundwater mining causes the decrease of geothermal reservoir pressure this may results in cones of depression in some areas that the adjacent aquifers replenish across relatively impermeable layers this may affect the calculations of reservoir temperature and cycle depth but establishing that the overall variation trend

appendix 
3266,a new method of groundwater sampling has recently been proposed which involves two phase well purging a high flow rate pumping phase followed by low flow rate purging and sampling the high pumping rate yields a rapid well drawdown and enhances hydraulic gradients within the aquifer after switching to a low pumping rate the stressed flow field is maintained to prevent the water in the well casing from moving downwards to bias the collected samples this study addresses two practical issues that are critical for applying such a sampling method the determination of the pumping switch time and the transition time interval available for groundwater sampling we use theis and papadopulos solutions to study the impact of wellbore storage on the correlation between switch time and transition time interval by imposing critical conditions to the derived solutions we suggest that the transition time interval is solely associated with the switch time results show that a later switch time yields a longer transition time interval theis solution provides an approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the transition time interval which can be used as a simple approximate practical guideline results from papadopulos solution confirm the linear relationship at late times and provide a more accurate relationship for early times by accounting for the well storage impact a sensitivity analysis indicates that aquifers with smaller storativity under a higher pumping ratio will generate a longer transition time interval given the same switch time similarly an earlier switch time is allowed given a predefined transition time interval this study presents a guideline to determine reasonable switch time under various aquifer hydrogeologic conditions and estimate the ideal groundwater sampling window keywords groundwater sampling ideal sampling window high stress low flow purging two phase pumping transition pumping period 1 introduction the common goal of developing groundwater sampling procedures is to collect samples that represent actual hydrogeochemical conditions armstrong et al 2020 barcelona et al 1994 martin hayden 1999 spalding and watson 2008 pumped groundwater samples are usually composed of two parts of water one is the vertical flow of stagnant water in the borehole which is driven by a vertical head gradient and the other is aquifer water which is driven by a horizontal head gradient in the aquifer mcmillan et al 2014 however the stagnant water in wells may not represent actual aquifer hydrogeochemical conditions particularly for the well casing water above the well screen which is exposed to the atmosphere and may undergo physiochemical and biological changes such as volatilization of organic pollutants dissolution of oxygen and microbial degradation hou and luo 2019 schuller et al 1981 thus a good groundwater sampling method needs to minimize the vertical well flow that may bias the collected samples two traditional methods for groundwater sampling have been proposed to solve this issue the low flow minimal drawdown approach and the well volume high stress approach usgs 2006 yeskis zavala 2002 generally the flow rate used for the low flow purging is about 0 1 0 5 l min plus and barcelona 1997 us epa 2010 this approach reduces the stress on formation minimal drawdown causes less mixing of stagnant borehole water with formation water and increases the representativeness of groundwater samples however this approach may require a prolonged sampling time in the field for low production wells thus incurring high capital costs the well volume approach applies a relatively high pumping rate commonly less than 1 gallon min or 3 8 l min yeskis zavala 2002 the guidelines issued by epa suggest to remove at least three well volumes of water prior to sampling to avoid the mixing of non representative stagnant water this approach is indeed faster than the previous one but it produces a significant amount of wastewater that needs to be remediated and stored moreover the well volume method cannot ensure stabilized samples a new groundwater sampling approach was proposed recently named the high stress low flow hslf approach hou and luo 2019 wang et al 2019 it involves a two phase well purging an initial high flow rate of pumping followed by a low flow rate for purging and sampling the high purge rate in phase 1 creates a target drawdown level that is deeper than the steady state drawdown level for a low flow sampling extraction rate phase 2 is a low flow purge rate to achieve stabilization and subsequent sampling during phase 2 the well drawdown decreases or the water level in the well increases thus there is no vertical flow down to the screen and hence the collected sample is 100 of formation water this approach can take advantages of both methods of purging a well mentioned above and combine epa guidelines to apply low flow sampling in an overly stressed filed hou and luo 2019 the essence of the hslf approach is to use the transition time interval between two pumping rates for groundwater sampling although proof of concept studies have been conducted by numerical methods and analytical solutions wang et al 2019 hou and luo 2019 the hydraulic behavior in the transition time interval has not been thoroughly explored chen et al 2012 more specifically a critical switch time is given in previous work at which the pumping water is 100 formation water but the time window for such behavior to be maintained is unknown and not discussed in fact switching pumping rate at the critical time yields no time window at all i e the pumping water will only be representative of groundwater at that moment and then becomes biased instantaneously as a result several fundamental questions remain for applying this approach to field practice the first question is how long the effective time interval can last for groundwater sampling since the low flow rate sampling during phase 2 usually uses the sample stabilization criteria to determine the sample representativeness i e three consecutive samples with similar measurements of water quality indicator parameters including ph temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductance and oxidation reduction potential the approach can only be feasible if a reasonably long time interval say half an hour can be created for groundwater sampling the second question is when the pumping rate should be switched due to the higher pumping rate in phase 1 it is better to use an earlier switch time so that the amount of investigation derived wastewater can be minimized these two questions are not independent i e the switch time and the transition time interval are related this modeling study is to address these questions to provide more comprehensive and practical understanding for improving the application of the hslf approach specifically we aim to provide equations and graphical tool to predict the transition time interval with varies switch time one can customize and identify a critical switch time with a reasonably long transition time interval during which the drawdown in well would decrease and the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water in addition we found the original drawdown solution for the hslf approach fails to give a direct and simple result of the transition time interval and can only be solved numerically due to its complex and implicit form thus a new analytical solution for drawdown behavior is proposed to illustrate and study the transition time interval a sensitivity analysis is conducted to help understand how the switch time and transition time interval vary in different hydrogeologic conditions 2 mathematical models for simplicity we use the same conceptual model that was presented for developing the hslf method i e a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer with the consideration of well storage hou and luo 2019 fig 1 illustrates the schematic of the conceptualized model the aquifer is assumed to be homogenous isotropic and of infinite horizontal extent with uniform thickness b l transmissivity t l 2 t and storativity s l 3 l 3 variables associated with the sampling well include pumping rate q l 3 t and the effective radius of well screen and casing r w and r c l for simplicity we assume r w r c while pump intake position may affect groundwater sampling it is not taken into consideration in this study prior to pumping the aquifer is in a state of equilibrium and the drawdown is zero in addition we assume the formation water is released from storage when the hydraulic head declines and enters into the borehole uniformly along the length of the screen pumped groundwater is comprised of two portions of water one is the stagnant water from the vertical flow q w l 3 t in the well casing driven by a vertical head gradient and the other is aquifer water q aq l 3 t driven by a horizontal head gradient the water in the well screen prior to pumping is considered to be the same as the aquifer water in addition to the water sources from the formation and the well casing mixing within the well screen zone is another factor determining the sampled concentration because mixing within the well is usually not a limiting process hou and luo 2019 we may use water source ratio to describe the sample representativeness 1 η q q aq q i e the sample is considered unbiased if the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water our research goal is to investigate the impact of the standing water in the pumping well on the sampling process thus the well storage must be considered the theis solution theis 1935 assumes zero well radius and all pumped water from the formation therefore if the theis solution is used there is no need to study the sample representativeness because the sampled water is always 100 of the formation solution however the theis solution provides useful insights into the drawdown change behavior and the transition time interval between two pumping rates which may be used as preliminary results and compared to study the impact of well storage later we will show that theis solution results actually provide a simple and direct estimation of the transition time interval which greatly increases the feasibility of applying hslf approach in the field for the theis solution the dimensionless drawdown and time are defined as 2 s d 4 π t δ h q t d 4 t t r w 2 s at the pumping well i e r r w the theis solution is 3 s d t d w t d where 4 w u u e u d u u the proposed hslf approach consists of two pumping phases a high pumping rate q 1 is applied during phase 1 while a low pumping rate q 2 is used for phase 2 after the switch time t s a pumping rate ratio of the two phases is defined as 5 λ q 1 q 2 the drawdown in phase 1 is given by eqs 2 and 6 the linear superposition principle can be applied to solve the drawdown in phase 2 neglecting the well storage and presenting dimensionless drawdown with the second phase pumping rate the theis solution yields 6 s d t d λ w t d t d t sd λ w t d λ 1 w t d t sd t d t sd where t sd is the dimensionless switch time for the hslf approach hou luo 2019 derived the drawdown for two phases based on another classic but more complex solution which is derived by papadopulos and cooper 1967 with a more realistic assumption that considers the water storage in the pumping well 7 s d t d α λ f t d α t d t sd λ f t d α λ 1 f t d t sd α t d t sd where 8 f t d α 32 α 2 π 2 0 1 e β

3 transition pumping period to achieve the aquifer water ratio η q 1 the drawdown in the pumping well should satisfy 11 d s d d t d 0 that is the water level in the well needs to remain at a constant level or rising implying no downward flow to the well screen zone from the well casing fig 2 c and f illustrate the typical change behavior of the drawdown and aquifer water ratio η q that is used for the hslf approach during phase 1 η q gradually increases with the well drawdown indicating that a large portion of pumped water is from the well storage if one keeps the constant pumping rate it will take a long period for η q to approach 1 as described by dash lines in fig 2 at the pumping rate switch time t sd the drawdown decreases as a result of the excessive gradient created by the high pumping rate in phase 1 for the low rate in phase 2 thus η q sharply rises to 1 after a certain period of time δ t d η q starts to decrease as the drawdown restarts to rise i e the water level in the well declines again we shall notice that the conceptual model assumes an infinite aquifer and all pumped water is from the formation and well storage thus there is no steady state for the well drawdown no matter how low the pumping rate is that is the drawdown can always recover to the increase trend in phase 2 in principle there exists a time interval δ t d before the recovery which corresponds to 100 of the formation water inflow this time interval would be desirable for sample a critical pumping rate switch time t sd can be defined as the time at which 12 d s d d t d 0 t d t sd correspondingly there is no vertical flow down to the screen and η q sharply increases to 1 variations of η q and the drawdown for the critical case are shown in fig 2 b and e as can be seen immediately after the switch point η q starts to decrease and the drawdown inside the well begins to increase which indicates that no desirable sampling period can be achieved if 100 influent formation water is preferred in addition to the critical case the flow scenarios may be divided further into two categories the first one is when t sd t sd as shown in fig 2 a and d in this case η q cannot rise to 1 at the switch time and the drawdown increases monotonically indicating the pumped water still has a large portion of the stored water from the well casing the second scenario is the case of t sd t sd immediately after the pump rate switch η q reaches 1 η q remains constant while the drawdown decreases over a time interval of δ t d the major design goal is to determine when to switch the pumping rate such that a sufficiently long desirable sampling period δ t d can be created in addition the methodology for estimating δ t d should be direct and simple enough to be used in the field the transition time interval for the aquifer water ratio η q maintaining at 1 i e the desirable sampling period can be expressed as 13 δ t d t d k 0 t sd where t sd is the switch time and t d k 0 is the time at which the drawdown restarts to rise if the critical switch time is selected as shown in fig 2 b and e the transition time interval is simply zero because t d k 0 and t sd coincide 14 t d k 0 t sd δ t d 0 a t t sd t sd t d k 0 is derived from the equation d s d d t d 0 using the drawdown solution in phase 2 which suggests t d k 0 is a function of t sd and therefore 15 δ t d f t sd while η q maintains at 1 and δ t d becomes greater than zero the downward casing flow rate decreases to a negative vale that is the formation inflow not only supplies 100 influent to the pump intake but also produces upward water to the casing as described in fig 3 such hydraulic behavior may cause the extension of sampling window since the representative groundwater in the casing will flow back to the screen as soon as the transition time interval is over however mixing of the upward fresh water and casing water also occurs during the transition time interval and the downward flow from casing becomes biased again after the drawdown restarts to rise to conclude the hydraulic behavior introduces uncertainty to the proposed transition time interval to avoid such uncertainty and provide a conservative analysis of δ t d that is the ideal δ t d will only be shorter than the practical δ t d we assume that the downward casing water will always be nonrepresentative of the formation water during two phases of pumping 3 1 no well storage impact substituting eqs 2 5 into eq 6 yields the gradient of drawdown 16 d s d d t d λ e 1 t d 1 t d λ 1 e 1 t d t sd 1 t d t sd t d t

branch of the lambert w function also denoted omega function and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions the values of t sd can be solved for a given transition time interval δ t d it is well known that the theis solution can be represented as an infinite series as 19 s d 0 5772 ln 1 t d 1 t d 1 t d 2 1 2 2 1 t d 3 1 3 3 when the dimensionless time is large eq 19 can be approximated by the first two terms cooper and jacob 1946 20 s d 0 5772 ln 1 t d substituting eq 13 and eq 20 into eq 6 at critical condition eq 12 leaves 21 0 λ t sd δ t d λ 1 δ t d which leads to a linear equation for the desirable transition time interval 22 δ t d λ 1 t sd substituting it into eq 13 yields 23 t d k 0 λ t sd fig 4 presents three cases of δ t d versus the parameter t sd for different values of the pumping rate ratio λ it clearly confirms the linear relationship at a large time given by eq 22 and larger λ yields longer δ t d given same t sd we shall notice that due to the neglect of well storage groundwater sampling is always representative of the formation condition because the influent is only from the formation water thus there is no particularly critical pumping rate switch time i e one can switch the pumping rate at any time during phase 1 to achieve 100 intake from the aquifer formation eqs 16 23 are derived based on the well drawdown behavior that is the transition time interval between the switch time and the time when the well drawdown starts to rise again is a linear function of the pumping rate switch time with a slope of λ 1 eq 22 provides a very simple and useful guidance for selecting the pumping rate ratio and the pumping rate switch time 3 2 well storage impact substituting eqs 8 10 into eqs 7 yields the rate of change of drawdown 24 d s d d t d 32 α 2 π 2 λ 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 t d d β λ 1 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 t d t sd d β t d t sd substituting it into eq 12 we can numerically solve for the transition time interval δ t d the main impact of the well storage in the pumping well is that there is a critical pumping rate switch time t sd as shown in fig 2 b and e if one switches the pumping rate before this moment i e the switch time is in zone 1 in fig 5 b the aquifer water ratio cannot rise to 1 i e the well drawdown still increases at a slow speed as showed in fig 2 a and d a portion of pump influent is the vertical flow from the well casing the points marked on the x axis in fig 5 are the critical switch times t sd where the water ratio sharply rises to 1 and the gradient of drawdown becomes zero at this moment there is no vertical flow coming down from the well casing and hence the pump influent is 100 formation water however the drawdown restarts rising immediately after this critical point indicating that the transition time interval is zero we shall notice that at the critical switch time t sd the slope of the hydraulic head in the well is zero after which the water level starts to increase again and the vertical flow driven by the head gradient reappears the critical switch time t sd can be directly solved according to the equation provided by hou and luo 2019 25 η q 1 λ where 26 η q 1 1 α d s d d t d as we apply a later switch time which is in zone 2 the transition time interval starts to increase sharply and eventually asymptotes to the results without considering the well storage impact here another critical time point t s d i n t is observed which is the intersection point of theis and papadopulos solutions eq 27 can be used to obtain t s d i n t we shall notice theis solution presents discrepancy in zone 2 due to the assumption of neglecting the well storage impact therefore only papadopulos solutions can be used to predict transition time interval in zone 2 by applying the critical condition eq 12 and substituting eq 23 into eq 24 we obtain 27 λ 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 λ t sd d β λ 1 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 λ 1 t sd d β 0 after the switch time exceeds the second critical time point t s d i n t which indicating the solutions fall into zone 3 the transition time interval becomes larger than the result of theis solution i e the transition time interval that neglects the well storage impact then the behavior of the solution curves becomes similar to theis solution i e a linear relationship between the transition time interval and the switch time however differences between these two solutions still exist therefore in zone 3 theis solution can be used as a conservative estimation of transition time interval which can be solved by eq 22 a simple relationship may be defined for the two critical times 28 t s d i n t φ t sd where φ is a simple constant φ 1 we will show in the next section that φ is typically less than 2 for wide ranges of hydrogeologic parameters 3 3 sensitivity to α and λ according to eq 24 the pumping ratio λ and storativity α are the two variables which impact the transition time interval δ t d given a pumping rate switch time fig 6 a shows that with the decrease of α and increase of λ δ t d becomes larger given a constant switch time it also implies that a smaller switch time is needed to achieve a target δ t d for smaller α and larger λ actually the curves for α 10 4 show little difference and are almost the same with the further decrease of α the increase of the δ t d becomes gradually obvious thus a longer sampling period may be achieved for aquifers with low storativity fig 6 b provides graphical tools to find dimensionless critical time points t sd and t s d i n t based on eqs 25 and 27 it also demonstrates that the two critical switch time points increase with larger λ and smaller α aquifer with small storativity can be categorized as good aquifer to apply the hslf approach in terms of shortening the sampling time also increasing pumping ratio may produce longer transition time interval and shorten the sampling time greatly 4 numerical simulation 4 1 comparison with a numerical model numerical simulations of a three dimensional axisymmetric model are conducted to validate the results derived from the analytical solution clemo 2010 martin hayden et al 2014 muller and witherspoon 1965 qi et al 2017 in the simulations darcy s law is used to describe aquifer flow and naiver stoke equations are applied to simulate the wellbore laminar flow field table 1 summarizes the hydrogeologic parameters two scenarios were simulated where the flow rate is changed at the critical times t s and t s i n t for a given pumping ratio λ 5 the model is solved by comsol multiphysics cmosol inc fig 7 shows that the analytical solution results match the numerical simulation results in terms of the aquifer flow ratio and well drawdown furthermore the transition time interval of 32 min in fig 7 b and d is consistent with the result solved by eq 22 i e the transition time interval is a linear function of the pumping rate switch time with a slope of λ 1 hence the numerical simulation also proved the validation of applying theis solution as a lower bound estimation of transition time interval at or after the second critical time t s d i n t 4 2 specific cases in varies hydrogeologic conditions specific numerical cases with typical hydrogeologic parameters solved with the analytical solution and numerical model are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the derived results table 2 lists the critical switch times for various parameter combinations of hydraulic conductivity and storativity in typical ranges for a given pumping ratio λ 5 table 2 shows that t s i n t is smaller than two times of t s i e the ratio of two critical time points 2 φ 1 thus the interval between two points i e the length of zone 2 is smaller than t s we shall also notice that t s and t s i n t are significantly small when the transmissivity t is within the range of 10 3 10 5 m 2 s indicating that zone 2 is narrow and hence can be neglected therefore we recommend to switch the pumping rate after the second critical point t s i n t for these aquifer conditions the transition time interval would be λ 1 times of the switch time low permeability aquifers have large t s and t s i n t and zone 2 becomes wider accordingly in these cases choosing the switch time in zone 3 is unnecessary because the switch time in zone 2 can achieve a sufficiently long sampling period the corresponding transition time interval in zone 2 can be estimated by the graphical tool presented in fig 5 table 2 also lists the time t sampling required for η q to reach 0 95 i e 95 inflow into the well screen zone is aquifer water using the conventional constant low flow purging method with the consideration of the well storage impact it is obvious that the time required by the conventional method is more than ten times the time required by the hslf method even without the consideration of zone 2 t s i n t in zone 3 is ten times smaller than t sampling also the pump influent reaches 100 aquifer water during the sampling period for the hslf method which is difficult to achieve for the constant pumping method therefore the comparison in table 1 further proves the feasibility and superiority of the hslf method 4 3 limitation remarks for application the derived analytical solution and approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the sampling interval provide very useful tools for applying the hslf method in field applications in addition to the idealized hydrogeologic conditions for deriving the analytical solution we discuss several important assumptions here first the sample representativeness is quantified by the aquifer water ratio i e the sample is considered unbiased if the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water in other words solute transport inside the wellbore is omitted from the analytical derivation and numerical simulation this assumption may not be valid at early time when the well storage water is considered unrepresentative second the analysis and results neglect the negative casing water effect discussed in section 3 seepage or diffusion across the well and aquifer boundary and the impact of the pumping intake position third complex hydrogeologic and well conditions partially penetrating or additional head loss may yield different characteristics of the aquifer water ratio behavior and corresponding transition time interval compared to a fully penetrating monitoring well in a homogenous confined aquifer nonetheless the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of the hslf method and provides an ideal feasible strategy to design a specific sampling plan that can be developed and further improved in more complex scenarios as described above 5 conclusion this study proposed an important parameter when applying the hslf approach for practice that is the transition time interval two basic questions are addressed the first question is how long is the transition time interval for groundwater sampling as showed in fig 2 c and f after switching to a lower pumping rate the drawdown inside the well decreases as a result of the excessive gradient caused by the previous high pumping rate decline of drawdown inside the well indicates that there is no vertical flow from the unrepresentative stagnant well casing water before the drawdown rises again the pumping water is 100 formation water this period is adequately studied and called the transition time interval which is defined as δ t d f t sd and solved by imposing the critical condition d s d d t d 0 the second question is when to switch the pumping rate as shown in fig 2 a and d applying an early pumping rate switch time may fail to increase the aquifer water ratio η q to 1 also if the pumping rate is switched too late a considerable amount of waste water can be derived a new analytical solution for drawdown behavior was derived by applying theis solution and solved with the critical condition which provides a simple linear relationship between pumping rate switch time t sd and transition time interval δ t d i e δ t d is a linear function of t sd with a slope of λ 1 papadopulos solution provides a more accurate solution by accounting for the impact of well storage two critical moments are identified and defined the first critical moment t sd indicates that the aquifer water ratio η q rises sharply to 1 after the pumping rate is switch and then drops immediately achieving no desirable sampling period if the pumping rate is switched before t sd the aquifer water ratio cannot rise to 1 so there is no δ t d as t sd is delayed δ t d increases which can be estimated by the graphical tool shown in fig 5 after t sd exceeds the second critical moment t s d i n t δ t d increases linearly with a slope of λ 1 which is similar to the results of theis solution thus such a linear relationship may be used as a safe and direct method to estimate δ t d numerical simulation shows that the two critical moments satisfy t s d i n t φ t sd where φ is a constant with 2 φ 1 for a wide range of hydrogeological parameter values a parametric analysis is performed to illustrate the impact of pumping ratio λ and aquifer storativity α on δ t d aquifers with smaller storativity can achieve a longer δ t d also a large pumping ratio may increase δ t d compared with conventional low flow sampling methods the present results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of applying the hslf method the representativeness and sampling period of groundwater samples can be greatly improved particularly in less permeable aquifers to mitigate the uncertainty of applying the hslf method in practical applications solute transport within the wellbore and complex hydrogeologic conditions

3266,a new method of groundwater sampling has recently been proposed which involves two phase well purging a high flow rate pumping phase followed by low flow rate purging and sampling the high pumping rate yields a rapid well drawdown and enhances hydraulic gradients within the aquifer after switching to a low pumping rate the stressed flow field is maintained to prevent the water in the well casing from moving downwards to bias the collected samples this study addresses two practical issues that are critical for applying such a sampling method the determination of the pumping switch time and the transition time interval available for groundwater sampling we use theis and papadopulos solutions to study the impact of wellbore storage on the correlation between switch time and transition time interval by imposing critical conditions to the derived solutions we suggest that the transition time interval is solely associated with the switch time results show that a later switch time yields a longer transition time interval theis solution provides an approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the transition time interval which can be used as a simple approximate practical guideline results from papadopulos solution confirm the linear relationship at late times and provide a more accurate relationship for early times by accounting for the well storage impact a sensitivity analysis indicates that aquifers with smaller storativity under a higher pumping ratio will generate a longer transition time interval given the same switch time similarly an earlier switch time is allowed given a predefined transition time interval this study presents a guideline to determine reasonable switch time under various aquifer hydrogeologic conditions and estimate the ideal groundwater sampling window keywords groundwater sampling ideal sampling window high stress low flow purging two phase pumping transition pumping period 1 introduction the common goal of developing groundwater sampling procedures is to collect samples that represent actual hydrogeochemical conditions armstrong et al 2020 barcelona et al 1994 martin hayden 1999 spalding and watson 2008 pumped groundwater samples are usually composed of two parts of water one is the vertical flow of stagnant water in the borehole which is driven by a vertical head gradient and the other is aquifer water which is driven by a horizontal head gradient in the aquifer mcmillan et al 2014 however the stagnant water in wells may not represent actual aquifer hydrogeochemical conditions particularly for the well casing water above the well screen which is exposed to the atmosphere and may undergo physiochemical and biological changes such as volatilization of organic pollutants dissolution of oxygen and microbial degradation hou and luo 2019 schuller et al 1981 thus a good groundwater sampling method needs to minimize the vertical well flow that may bias the collected samples two traditional methods for groundwater sampling have been proposed to solve this issue the low flow minimal drawdown approach and the well volume high stress approach usgs 2006 yeskis zavala 2002 generally the flow rate used for the low flow purging is about 0 1 0 5 l min plus and barcelona 1997 us epa 2010 this approach reduces the stress on formation minimal drawdown causes less mixing of stagnant borehole water with formation water and increases the representativeness of groundwater samples however this approach may require a prolonged sampling time in the field for low production wells thus incurring high capital costs the well volume approach applies a relatively high pumping rate commonly less than 1 gallon min or 3 8 l min yeskis zavala 2002 the guidelines issued by epa suggest to remove at least three well volumes of water prior to sampling to avoid the mixing of non representative stagnant water this approach is indeed faster than the previous one but it produces a significant amount of wastewater that needs to be remediated and stored moreover the well volume method cannot ensure stabilized samples a new groundwater sampling approach was proposed recently named the high stress low flow hslf approach hou and luo 2019 wang et al 2019 it involves a two phase well purging an initial high flow rate of pumping followed by a low flow rate for purging and sampling the high purge rate in phase 1 creates a target drawdown level that is deeper than the steady state drawdown level for a low flow sampling extraction rate phase 2 is a low flow purge rate to achieve stabilization and subsequent sampling during phase 2 the well drawdown decreases or the water level in the well increases thus there is no vertical flow down to the screen and hence the collected sample is 100 of formation water this approach can take advantages of both methods of purging a well mentioned above and combine epa guidelines to apply low flow sampling in an overly stressed filed hou and luo 2019 the essence of the hslf approach is to use the transition time interval between two pumping rates for groundwater sampling although proof of concept studies have been conducted by numerical methods and analytical solutions wang et al 2019 hou and luo 2019 the hydraulic behavior in the transition time interval has not been thoroughly explored chen et al 2012 more specifically a critical switch time is given in previous work at which the pumping water is 100 formation water but the time window for such behavior to be maintained is unknown and not discussed in fact switching pumping rate at the critical time yields no time window at all i e the pumping water will only be representative of groundwater at that moment and then becomes biased instantaneously as a result several fundamental questions remain for applying this approach to field practice the first question is how long the effective time interval can last for groundwater sampling since the low flow rate sampling during phase 2 usually uses the sample stabilization criteria to determine the sample representativeness i e three consecutive samples with similar measurements of water quality indicator parameters including ph temperature dissolved oxygen turbidity electrical conductance and oxidation reduction potential the approach can only be feasible if a reasonably long time interval say half an hour can be created for groundwater sampling the second question is when the pumping rate should be switched due to the higher pumping rate in phase 1 it is better to use an earlier switch time so that the amount of investigation derived wastewater can be minimized these two questions are not independent i e the switch time and the transition time interval are related this modeling study is to address these questions to provide more comprehensive and practical understanding for improving the application of the hslf approach specifically we aim to provide equations and graphical tool to predict the transition time interval with varies switch time one can customize and identify a critical switch time with a reasonably long transition time interval during which the drawdown in well would decrease and the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water in addition we found the original drawdown solution for the hslf approach fails to give a direct and simple result of the transition time interval and can only be solved numerically due to its complex and implicit form thus a new analytical solution for drawdown behavior is proposed to illustrate and study the transition time interval a sensitivity analysis is conducted to help understand how the switch time and transition time interval vary in different hydrogeologic conditions 2 mathematical models for simplicity we use the same conceptual model that was presented for developing the hslf method i e a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer with the consideration of well storage hou and luo 2019 fig 1 illustrates the schematic of the conceptualized model the aquifer is assumed to be homogenous isotropic and of infinite horizontal extent with uniform thickness b l transmissivity t l 2 t and storativity s l 3 l 3 variables associated with the sampling well include pumping rate q l 3 t and the effective radius of well screen and casing r w and r c l for simplicity we assume r w r c while pump intake position may affect groundwater sampling it is not taken into consideration in this study prior to pumping the aquifer is in a state of equilibrium and the drawdown is zero in addition we assume the formation water is released from storage when the hydraulic head declines and enters into the borehole uniformly along the length of the screen pumped groundwater is comprised of two portions of water one is the stagnant water from the vertical flow q w l 3 t in the well casing driven by a vertical head gradient and the other is aquifer water q aq l 3 t driven by a horizontal head gradient the water in the well screen prior to pumping is considered to be the same as the aquifer water in addition to the water sources from the formation and the well casing mixing within the well screen zone is another factor determining the sampled concentration because mixing within the well is usually not a limiting process hou and luo 2019 we may use water source ratio to describe the sample representativeness 1 η q q aq q i e the sample is considered unbiased if the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water our research goal is to investigate the impact of the standing water in the pumping well on the sampling process thus the well storage must be considered the theis solution theis 1935 assumes zero well radius and all pumped water from the formation therefore if the theis solution is used there is no need to study the sample representativeness because the sampled water is always 100 of the formation solution however the theis solution provides useful insights into the drawdown change behavior and the transition time interval between two pumping rates which may be used as preliminary results and compared to study the impact of well storage later we will show that theis solution results actually provide a simple and direct estimation of the transition time interval which greatly increases the feasibility of applying hslf approach in the field for the theis solution the dimensionless drawdown and time are defined as 2 s d 4 π t δ h q t d 4 t t r w 2 s at the pumping well i e r r w the theis solution is 3 s d t d w t d where 4 w u u e u d u u the proposed hslf approach consists of two pumping phases a high pumping rate q 1 is applied during phase 1 while a low pumping rate q 2 is used for phase 2 after the switch time t s a pumping rate ratio of the two phases is defined as 5 λ q 1 q 2 the drawdown in phase 1 is given by eqs 2 and 6 the linear superposition principle can be applied to solve the drawdown in phase 2 neglecting the well storage and presenting dimensionless drawdown with the second phase pumping rate the theis solution yields 6 s d t d λ w t d t d t sd λ w t d λ 1 w t d t sd t d t sd where t sd is the dimensionless switch time for the hslf approach hou luo 2019 derived the drawdown for two phases based on another classic but more complex solution which is derived by papadopulos and cooper 1967 with a more realistic assumption that considers the water storage in the pumping well 7 s d t d α λ f t d α t d t sd λ f t d α λ 1 f t d t sd α t d t sd where 8 f t d α 32 α 2 π 2 0 1 e β

3 transition pumping period to achieve the aquifer water ratio η q 1 the drawdown in the pumping well should satisfy 11 d s d d t d 0 that is the water level in the well needs to remain at a constant level or rising implying no downward flow to the well screen zone from the well casing fig 2 c and f illustrate the typical change behavior of the drawdown and aquifer water ratio η q that is used for the hslf approach during phase 1 η q gradually increases with the well drawdown indicating that a large portion of pumped water is from the well storage if one keeps the constant pumping rate it will take a long period for η q to approach 1 as described by dash lines in fig 2 at the pumping rate switch time t sd the drawdown decreases as a result of the excessive gradient created by the high pumping rate in phase 1 for the low rate in phase 2 thus η q sharply rises to 1 after a certain period of time δ t d η q starts to decrease as the drawdown restarts to rise i e the water level in the well declines again we shall notice that the conceptual model assumes an infinite aquifer and all pumped water is from the formation and well storage thus there is no steady state for the well drawdown no matter how low the pumping rate is that is the drawdown can always recover to the increase trend in phase 2 in principle there exists a time interval δ t d before the recovery which corresponds to 100 of the formation water inflow this time interval would be desirable for sample a critical pumping rate switch time t sd can be defined as the time at which 12 d s d d t d 0 t d t sd correspondingly there is no vertical flow down to the screen and η q sharply increases to 1 variations of η q and the drawdown for the critical case are shown in fig 2 b and e as can be seen immediately after the switch point η q starts to decrease and the drawdown inside the well begins to increase which indicates that no desirable sampling period can be achieved if 100 influent formation water is preferred in addition to the critical case the flow scenarios may be divided further into two categories the first one is when t sd t sd as shown in fig 2 a and d in this case η q cannot rise to 1 at the switch time and the drawdown increases monotonically indicating the pumped water still has a large portion of the stored water from the well casing the second scenario is the case of t sd t sd immediately after the pump rate switch η q reaches 1 η q remains constant while the drawdown decreases over a time interval of δ t d the major design goal is to determine when to switch the pumping rate such that a sufficiently long desirable sampling period δ t d can be created in addition the methodology for estimating δ t d should be direct and simple enough to be used in the field the transition time interval for the aquifer water ratio η q maintaining at 1 i e the desirable sampling period can be expressed as 13 δ t d t d k 0 t sd where t sd is the switch time and t d k 0 is the time at which the drawdown restarts to rise if the critical switch time is selected as shown in fig 2 b and e the transition time interval is simply zero because t d k 0 and t sd coincide 14 t d k 0 t sd δ t d 0 a t t sd t sd t d k 0 is derived from the equation d s d d t d 0 using the drawdown solution in phase 2 which suggests t d k 0 is a function of t sd and therefore 15 δ t d f t sd while η q maintains at 1 and δ t d becomes greater than zero the downward casing flow rate decreases to a negative vale that is the formation inflow not only supplies 100 influent to the pump intake but also produces upward water to the casing as described in fig 3 such hydraulic behavior may cause the extension of sampling window since the representative groundwater in the casing will flow back to the screen as soon as the transition time interval is over however mixing of the upward fresh water and casing water also occurs during the transition time interval and the downward flow from casing becomes biased again after the drawdown restarts to rise to conclude the hydraulic behavior introduces uncertainty to the proposed transition time interval to avoid such uncertainty and provide a conservative analysis of δ t d that is the ideal δ t d will only be shorter than the practical δ t d we assume that the downward casing water will always be nonrepresentative of the formation water during two phases of pumping 3 1 no well storage impact substituting eqs 2 5 into eq 6 yields the gradient of drawdown 16 d s d d t d λ e 1 t d 1 t d λ 1 e 1 t d t sd 1 t d t sd t d t

branch of the lambert w function also denoted omega function and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions the values of t sd can be solved for a given transition time interval δ t d it is well known that the theis solution can be represented as an infinite series as 19 s d 0 5772 ln 1 t d 1 t d 1 t d 2 1 2 2 1 t d 3 1 3 3 when the dimensionless time is large eq 19 can be approximated by the first two terms cooper and jacob 1946 20 s d 0 5772 ln 1 t d substituting eq 13 and eq 20 into eq 6 at critical condition eq 12 leaves 21 0 λ t sd δ t d λ 1 δ t d which leads to a linear equation for the desirable transition time interval 22 δ t d λ 1 t sd substituting it into eq 13 yields 23 t d k 0 λ t sd fig 4 presents three cases of δ t d versus the parameter t sd for different values of the pumping rate ratio λ it clearly confirms the linear relationship at a large time given by eq 22 and larger λ yields longer δ t d given same t sd we shall notice that due to the neglect of well storage groundwater sampling is always representative of the formation condition because the influent is only from the formation water thus there is no particularly critical pumping rate switch time i e one can switch the pumping rate at any time during phase 1 to achieve 100 intake from the aquifer formation eqs 16 23 are derived based on the well drawdown behavior that is the transition time interval between the switch time and the time when the well drawdown starts to rise again is a linear function of the pumping rate switch time with a slope of λ 1 eq 22 provides a very simple and useful guidance for selecting the pumping rate ratio and the pumping rate switch time 3 2 well storage impact substituting eqs 8 10 into eqs 7 yields the rate of change of drawdown 24 d s d

of the well storage in the pumping well is that there is a critical pumping rate switch time t sd as shown in fig 2 b and e if one switches the pumping rate before this moment i e the switch time is in zone 1 in fig 5 b the aquifer water ratio cannot rise to 1 i e the well drawdown still increases at a slow speed as showed in fig 2 a and d a portion of pump influent is the vertical flow from the well casing the points marked on the x axis in fig 5 are the critical switch times t sd where the water ratio sharply rises to 1 and the gradient of drawdown becomes zero at this moment there is no vertical flow coming down from the well casing and hence the pump influent is 100 formation water however the drawdown restarts rising immediately after this critical point indicating that the transition time interval is zero we shall notice that at the critical switch time t sd the slope of the hydraulic head in the well is zero after which the water level starts to increase again and the vertical flow driven by the head gradient reappears the critical switch time t sd can be directly solved according to the equation provided by hou and luo 2019 25 η q 1 λ where 26 η q 1 1 α d s d d t d as we apply a later switch time which is in zone 2 the transition time interval starts to increase sharply and eventually asymptotes to the results without considering the well storage impact here another critical time point t s d i n t is observed which is the intersection point of theis and papadopulos solutions eq 27 can be used to obtain t s d i n t we shall notice theis solution presents discrepancy in zone 2 due to the assumption of neglecting the well storage impact therefore only papadopulos solutions can be used to predict transition time interval in zone 2 by applying the critical condition eq 12 and substituting eq 23 into eq 24 we obtain 27 λ 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 λ t sd d β λ 1 0 1 4 β δ β e β 2 4 λ 1 t sd d β 0 after the switch time exceeds the second critical time point t s d i n t which indicating the solutions fall into zone 3 the transition time interval becomes larger than the result of theis solution i e the transition time interval that neglects the well storage impact then the behavior of the solution curves becomes similar to theis solution i e a linear relationship between the transition time interval and the switch time however differences between these two solutions still exist therefore in zone 3 theis solution can be used as a conservative estimation of transition time interval which can be solved by eq 22 a simple relationship may be defined for the two critical times 28 t s d i n t φ t sd where φ is a simple constant φ 1 we will show in the next section that φ is typically less than 2 for wide ranges of hydrogeologic parameters 3 3 sensitivity to α and λ according to eq 24 the pumping ratio λ and storativity α are the two variables which impact the transition time interval δ t d given a pumping rate switch time fig 6 a shows that with the decrease of α and increase of λ δ t d becomes larger given a constant switch time it also implies that a smaller switch time is needed to achieve a target δ t d for smaller α and larger λ actually the curves for α 10 4 show little difference and are almost the same with the further decrease of α the increase of the δ t d becomes gradually obvious thus a longer sampling period may be achieved for aquifers with low storativity fig 6 b provides graphical tools to find dimensionless critical time points t sd and t s d i n t based on eqs 25 and 27 it also demonstrates that the two critical switch time points increase with larger λ and smaller α aquifer with small storativity can be categorized as good aquifer to apply the hslf approach in terms of shortening the sampling time also increasing pumping ratio may produce longer transition time interval and shorten the sampling time greatly 4 numerical simulation 4 1 comparison with a numerical model numerical simulations of a three dimensional axisymmetric model are conducted to validate the results derived from the analytical solution clemo 2010 martin hayden et al 2014 muller and witherspoon 1965 qi et al 2017 in the simulations darcy s law is used to describe aquifer flow and naiver stoke equations are applied to simulate the wellbore laminar flow field table 1 summarizes the hydrogeologic parameters two scenarios were simulated where the flow rate is changed at the critical times t s and t s i n t for a given pumping ratio λ 5 the model is solved by comsol multiphysics cmosol inc fig 7 shows that the analytical solution results match the numerical simulation results in terms of the aquifer flow ratio and well drawdown furthermore the transition time interval of 32 min in fig 7 b and d is consistent with the result solved by eq 22 i e the transition time interval is a linear function of the pumping rate switch time with a slope of λ 1 hence the numerical simulation also proved the validation of applying theis solution as a lower bound estimation of transition time interval at or after the second critical time t s d i n t 4 2 specific cases in varies hydrogeologic conditions specific numerical cases with typical hydrogeologic parameters solved with the analytical solution and numerical model are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the derived results table 2 lists the critical switch times for various parameter combinations of hydraulic conductivity and storativity in typical ranges for a given pumping ratio λ 5 table 2 shows that t s i n t is smaller than two times of t s i e the ratio of two critical time points 2 φ 1 thus the interval between two points i e the length of zone 2 is smaller than t s we shall also notice that t s and t s i n t are significantly small when the transmissivity t is within the range of 10 3 10 5 m 2 s indicating that zone 2 is narrow and hence can be neglected therefore we recommend to switch the pumping rate after the second critical point t s i n t for these aquifer conditions the transition time interval would be λ 1 times of the switch time low permeability aquifers have large t s and t s i n t and zone 2 becomes wider accordingly in these cases choosing the switch time in zone 3 is unnecessary because the switch time in zone 2 can achieve a sufficiently long sampling period the corresponding transition time interval in zone 2 can be estimated by the graphical tool presented in fig 5 table 2 also lists the time t sampling required for η q to reach 0 95 i e 95 inflow into the well screen zone is aquifer water using the conventional constant low flow purging method with the consideration of the well storage impact it is obvious that the time required by the conventional method is more than ten times the time required by the hslf method even without the consideration of zone 2 t s i n t in zone 3 is ten times smaller than t sampling also the pump influent reaches 100 aquifer water during the sampling period for the hslf method which is difficult to achieve for the constant pumping method therefore the comparison in table 1 further proves the feasibility and superiority of the hslf method 4 3 limitation remarks for application the derived analytical solution and approximate linear relationship between the switch time and the sampling interval provide very useful tools for applying the hslf method in field applications in addition to the idealized hydrogeologic conditions for deriving the analytical solution we discuss several important assumptions here first the sample representativeness is quantified by the aquifer water ratio i e the sample is considered unbiased if the influent into the well screen zone is 100 of the formation water in other words solute transport inside the wellbore is omitted from the analytical derivation and numerical simulation this assumption may not be valid at early time when the well storage water is considered unrepresentative second the analysis and results neglect the negative casing water effect discussed in section 3 seepage or diffusion across the well and aquifer boundary and the impact of the pumping intake position third complex hydrogeologic and well conditions partially penetrating or additional head loss may yield different characteristics of the aquifer water ratio behavior and corresponding transition time interval compared to a fully penetrating monitoring well in a homogenous confined aquifer nonetheless the present study demonstrates the effectiveness of the hslf method and provides an ideal feasible strategy to design a specific sampling plan that can be developed and further improved in more complex scenarios as described above 5 conclusion this study proposed an important parameter when applying the hslf approach for practice that is the transition time interval two basic questions are addressed the first question is how long is the transition time interval for groundwater sampling as showed in fig 2 c and f after switching to a lower pumping rate the drawdown inside the well decreases as a result of the excessive gradient caused by the previous high pumping rate decline of drawdown inside the well indicates that there is no vertical flow from the unrepresentative stagnant well casing water before the drawdown rises again the pumping water is 100 formation water this period is adequately studied and called the transition time interval which is defined as δ t d f t sd and solved by imposing the critical condition d s d d t d 0 the second question is when to switch the pumping rate as shown in fig 2 a and d applying an early pumping rate switch time may fail to increase the aquifer water ratio η q to 1 also if the pumping rate is switched too late a considerable amount of waste water can be derived a new analytical solution for drawdown behavior was derived by applying theis solution and solved with the critical condition which provides a simple linear relationship between pumping rate switch time t sd and transition time interval δ t d i e δ t d is a linear function of t sd with a slope of λ 1 papadopulos solution provides a more accurate solution by accounting for the impact of well storage two critical moments are identified and defined the first critical moment t sd indicates that the aquifer water ratio η q rises sharply to 1 after the pumping rate is switch and then drops immediately achieving no desirable sampling period if the pumping rate is switched before t sd the aquifer water ratio cannot rise to 1 so there is no δ t d as t sd is delayed δ t d increases which can be estimated by the graphical tool shown in fig 5 after t sd exceeds the second critical moment t s d i n t δ t d increases linearly with a slope of λ 1 which is similar to the results of theis solution thus such a linear relationship may be used as a safe and direct method to estimate δ t d numerical simulation shows that the two critical moments satisfy t s d i n t φ t sd where φ is a constant with 2 φ 1 for a wide range of hydrogeological parameter values a parametric analysis is performed to illustrate the impact of pumping ratio λ and aquifer storativity α on δ t d aquifers with smaller storativity can achieve a longer δ t d also a large pumping ratio may increase δ t d compared with conventional low flow sampling methods the present results demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of applying the hslf method the representativeness and sampling period of groundwater samples can be greatly improved particularly in less permeable aquifers to mitigate the uncertainty of applying the hslf method in practical applications solute transport within the wellbore and complex hydrogeologic conditions

3267,the anthropogenic organic contaminants contemplated in the environmental legislation as well as those of emerging concern threaten the quality of water resources to a degree that remains largely unknown contaminant exposure in the aquatic environment is a crucial element if a full understanding of the risk is pursued there are still many uncertainties about the occurrence of organic pollutants and behavior in the hydro geo logical media in large scale areas the case study of the unconfined aquifer of the granada plain approximately 200 km2 is presented here two surface and groundwater monitoring campaigns were conducted march 2017 and june 2018 in total 41 out of 171 target organic pollutants were detected at least once 17 pharmaceuticals or drugs of abuse 21 pesticides or their metabolites and three polyaromatic hydrocarbons in addition physico chemical parameters were measured during the monitoring campaigns and hydrochemical parameters and stable isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c were analyzed statistical tests confirmed the significance of seasonal changes for some of these parameters e g ec cl f δ18o δ13c revealing the influence from snowmelt water input on streams and the intensification of irrigation in march 2017 the group of pesticides largely represented by triazines predominated whereas the frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals increased substantially in june 2018 results suggest four main factors affecting the spatial and seasonal variation of organic pollutants in the aquifer the anthropogenic factor determining the period of contaminant release throughout the year pesticide application period and growth of tourism along with irrigation practices that include reclaimed wastewater unsaturated zone thickness hydraulic gradient and river groundwater hydraulic connection the latter can be especially important in the case of those contaminants whose main path of entry into the aquatic environment occurs through wastewater discharge into streams i e pharmaceuticals keywords pharmaceuticals pesticides detrital aquifer seasonal variation unsaturated zone recharge process 1 introduction a contaminant of emerging concern cec is known as such not only because it has been recently considered to cause known or suspected adverse ecological or human health effects stuart et al 2012 but also because they remain largely unregulated in the field of water policy daughton 2004 nonetheless the importance of learning more about their occurrence harmful potential and environmental behavior has been recognized and highlighted by institutions and the scientific community according to directive 2013 39 eu european parliament and of the council 2013 the european commission must establish a watch list that includes substances that can be of concern and for which information must be gathered to date three watch lists have been set out european commission 2020 which include substances that are essentially pharmaceuticals and pesticides similarly a watch list for pollutants in groundwater including emerging contaminants has also been demanded european commission 2014 lapworth et al 2019 although pesticides are pollutants contemplated in the environmental legislation european parliament and council of the european union 2008 and the use of some of said pollutants such as atrazine has been banned european commission 2004 due to its endocrine disruption potential hayes et al 2011 and other harmful effects they continue to be detected in the aquatic environment at concentrations still above their limit silva et al 2012 sassine et al 2016 moreover relatively few groundwater studies targeting contaminant metabolites such as those resulting from pesticide degradation have been undertaken these by products can also be of concern bunting et al 2020 the potential adverse effects of emerging pollutants to human health or to ecosystems have also been researched and reviewed lópez pacheco et al 2019 lei et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 however in order to fully understand the risk that cecs may entail the exposure must be defined and this is why hydrogeological studies are essential mas pla 2018 large scale studies are very valuable to understand the spatial occurrence and trends of cecs and will help build a foundation for future regulation yet these studies are not as frequently conducted as they should bunting et al 2020 furthermore the spatial distribution of anthropogenic organic contaminants is challenging to assess as it can be affected by several factors such as the spatial and temporal distribution of pollution sources since wastewater treatment is not fully successful at eliminating cecs carballa et al 2004 carballa et al 2005 wastewater discharge into streams acts as the main path of entry into the aquatic environment which is the reason why emerging contaminant research has mainly focused on surface water stuart et al 2012 other factors need to be considered the influence of the hydraulic context on cecs occurrence was observed by corada fernández et al 2017 who compared periods of droughts and extreme rainfall events lutri et al 2020 determined the relationship between the presence of glyphosate and its main metabolite and shallowest water table and low flow velocity the physico chemical properties of the pollutants themselves can grant them different environmental behaviors massmann et al 2006 schaffer and licha 2015 martínez hernández et al 2016 llamas dios et al 2020 pointed out the potential role of hydraulic infrastructure on spatial distribution of hydrophilic cecs i e pharmaceuticals in this study we present the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of cecs and other regulated organic pollutants in water resources of the vega de granada aquifer hereafter vg aquifer vega means irrigated plain in spanish an alluvial aquifer of 200 km2 approximately one hundred and seventy one organic pollutants were analyzed including pharmaceuticals pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and brominated diphenyl ethers bdes data interpretation focused on the distribution of pharmaceuticals pesticides and their metabolites according to their higher frequency of detection as it will be seen in following sections two monitoring campaigns were carried out in order to assess the importance of aquifer recharge processes associated with seasonal changes natural and anthropogenic the vg aquifer is an alluvial aquifer covered by agricultural lands and urban areas demanding an increasing volume of water resources from surface streams and the subsoil human activities have led to a general increase of salinity castillo et al 2010 and high nitrate contents in groundwater due to decades of fertilizer use castillo 2005 rodriguez galiano et al 2018 and to a decrease of water recharge and renewal rates castillo et al 2010 microbiological contamination has also proven to be a sanitary problem in this region castillo and ramos cormenzana 2002 luque espinar et al 2015 conducted a study on the distribution and seasonal variation of six cecs in water resources of granada city metropolitan areas observing water pollution by pharmaceutical active compounds ibuprofen paracetamol caffeine and pantoprazole and even affection on the crops which are usually irrigated with wastewater luque espinar and chica olmo 2020 observed an important affection by wastewater in the entire aquifer amoxicillin caffeine paracetamol and ibuprofen were detected in collected vegetables as mentioned in the present study the number of target pollutants to be analyzed in water resources has been expanded the purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other regulated organic pollutants i e pesticides in surface and groundwater of the highly impacted vg aquifer and to assess seasonal differences to do so the following specific objectives are pursued 1 to provide a description of the system regarding water pollution by organic chemicals and 2 to define the context of the groundwater system during both campaigns using hydrochemical data and environmental isotopes the aim is to distinguish the importance of the role played by the different possible factors i e hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer hydrodynamic context physico chemical properties of the pollutants human practices on the spread of organic pollutants in the vg aquifer 2 study area the vega de granada vg plain extends over 200 km2 and is located in the south of the iberian peninsula in spain fig 1 the vg plain is at the center of the upper genil river catchment 2 950 km2 also known as the granada basin it is the largest water consumption zone within the catchment area meeting the demands of 120 km2 of irrigation lands and 550 000 inhabitants approximately castillo et al 2010 the genil river starts in the sierra nevada mountain range on the east and flows through the plain in a westerly direction where it is joined by several tributaries the elevation of the plain is about 550 m a s l the sierra nevada mountains reaching 3 470 m a s l the average temperature in the plain is around 15 16 c whereas that of the sierra nevada ranges from 5 to 6 c at an elevation of 2 550 m a s l mean annual precipitation is 490 mm year in the plain and about 1 000 mm year in the upper mountains kohfahl et al 2008 the granada basin fig 1 consists of an outcrop of neogene to quaternary sediments overlying the ne sw trending contact between the external and internal zones of the betic cordillera the sequence of the sedimentary materials is over 2 km thick in some areas uplift of the cordilleras that started in the late miocene generated normal faults that defined the basin limits and caused the deposition of alluvial and delta fans along the edges the aquifer corresponds to the holocene quaternary detritic sediments filling the tectonic depression which presents a sedimentary multilayered structure with levels of gravels sand silt and clay as a result of the coalescence between river sedimentation and that of the alluvial fans aquifer thickness reaches up to 250 m in the center part mateos et al 2017 low permeability neogene and quaternary materials showing variable lithology bound the vg aquifer except for a jurassic carbonate outcrop located in the north dpg igme 1990 the latter consists of limestones and dolostones overlying a triassic evaporitic basement miocene neogene materials form the basement of the alluvial sediments of the aquifer dpg igme 1990 the general neogene sedimentary sequence is composed of calcarenites terrigenous sediments and evaporites kohfahl et al 2008 fig 2 the holocene vg aquifer boundaries are closed except for those in contact with the jurassic carbonates and those in contact with coarse grained upper pliocene lower pleistocene materials at the eastern boundary and with quaternary alluvial fan materials in the southeast the vg aquifer fine grained substratum is impervious due to its content in clays and silts luque espinar et al 2002 transmissivity of the vg aquifer ranges between 100 and 40 000 m2 day with an average of 4 000 m2 day castillo et al 2010 along the central axis of the aquifer and in the southeastern part in zones close to the genil river and the monachil and dílar rivers the aquifer consists mainly of fluvial gravels and sands thus the highest transmissivity values are observed in these zones coarse sediments with thicknesses of up to 150 m have been recorded at the central zone of the aquifer clay content increases towards the boundaries and a minimum clay content of 80 has been estimated in the northeastern part of the aquifer mateos et al 2017 where the steepest hydraulic gradient is observed fig 3 average renewable water resources of the vg aquifer are estimated to be 160 hm3 year castillo et al 2010 aquifer water recharge comes mainly from surface runoff generated in the granada basin nevertheless the main recharge area is located in the southeastern sector where most tributaries join the main riverbed chica olmo et al 2014 thus water recharge from surface water infiltration takes place essentially thanks to infiltration from the genil dílar and monachil rivers chg 2021 fig 1 infiltration of surface runoff is strongly driven by irrigation through a dense network of irrigation channels and ditches that takes up part of this surface water this water input is estimated to be 126 hm3 year rain infiltration over the permeable surface of the aquifer adds 24 hm3 year and contribution from adjacent aquifers is around 10 hm3 year castillo et al 2010 which is likely to occur mainly at the southeastern boundary of the aquifer near to the more permeable carbonate rocks kohfahl et al 2008 aquifer discharge occurs on the one hand through natural discharge in the western sector of the aquifer downstream from the town of fuente vaqueros through springs and diffuse sources towards the genil and cubillas rivers igme 1990 the average value of this output has been estimated at 110 hm3 year on the other hand net groundwater abstraction through wells accounts for the remaining 50 hm3 year 85 for agricultural use and 15 for urban water supply castillo et al 2010 as mentioned stream aquifer hydraulic connection is different in the eastern and western parts in the eastern sector a river disconnected from the water table loses water towards the aquifer whereas the river gains water from the aquifer predominantly near the western boundary igme 2009 in the eastern part below the city of granada the unsaturated zone of the aquifer reaches its maximum thickness with minimum thicknesses found in the western part fig 3 there are two wastewater treatment plants wwtp treating wastewater from the granada area fig s1 in these facilities 42 hm3 and 37 hm3 of wastewater was treated in 2017 and in 2018 respectively purification processes consist of preliminary treatment a primary sedimentation process secondary biological treatment and secondary sedimentation treated and untreated urban wastewaters are directly released into ditches of the irrigation network or into riverbeds from which water is also used for irrigation robles arenas et al 2012 the location and magnitude of urban wastewater discharge permitted by the basin authority can be seen in fig 4 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and measurement of physico chemical parameters two monitoring campaigns were conducted one in march 2017 and in june 2018 they consisted of the collection of 30 groundwater samples and 10 surface water samples fig 1 groundwater samples were collected mainly from irrigation wells from the alluvial unconfined aquifer vg aquifer continuous pumping was performed before collecting the sample surface water samples were collected from the genil river and smaller tributaries sampling points are classified in two groups those situated in the eastern part of the plain and those situated in the western part based on the aforementioned differences between the two aquifer sectors fig 3 water samples were filtered using a 0 45 µm millipore filter merck kgaa darmstadt germany sterile high density polyethylene bottles 120 ml sealed with inverted cone caps were used to store water samples for hydrochemical and isotopic analyses water samples used for organic contaminants analysis were stored in sterile amber glass bottles 1l with teflon caps bottles were rinsed before sampling carried in an ice filled cool box and stored in a fridge 4 c until analysis physico chemical parameters ph temperature electrical conductivity redox potential and dissolved oxygen were measured with a portable multi parameter probe hach

compound analysis was conducted at the iproma laboratory castellón spain 3 4 statistical analysis to evaluate the statistical significance of seasonal change of surface water and groundwater the paired sample t test was used the latter was applied to physico chemical and hydrochemical parameters the t test requires the differences between paired observations to be normally distributed helsel et al 2020 to check the normal distribution of differences the shapiro wilk test was used for datasets that do not follow a normal distribution the non parametric wilcoxon signed rank test was applied helsel et al 2020 the analyses were performed using the stats package in r software r core team 2020 if the obtained p value is below 0 05 the null hypothesis stating that the two compared groups do not differ significantly was rejected 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface and groundwater hydrochemical composition descriptive statistics of measured physico chemical parameters and hydrochemical results are available in the supplementary material section tables s2 and s3 a spatial variability of hydrochemical characteristics is observed in the study area regarding both surface water and groundwater fig 5 fig 6 calcium and magnesium bicarbonate low mineralized type water is predominant in the eastern part potentially as a consequence of water input coming from the sierra nevada mountain range through riverbeds in contrast mixed facies with a higher level of mineralization are most commonly found in the western part indicating different factors affecting water quality other than rock water interaction i e impact of human activities sulphate sodium chloride sodium and sulphate calcium facies near the southern aquifer limit reflect the influence of the evaporitic materials from the miocene deposits the electrical conductivity ec mean value was higher in the western sector in both campaigns a mean value of 1 453 538 µs cm was recorded in groundwater in the western sector in march 2017 1 767 567 µs cm in june 2018 whereas a mean value of 824 266 µs cm was recorded in groundwater from the eastern sector in march 2017 977 255 µs cm in june 2018 as regards surface water a mean value of 1 162 166 µs cm was recorded in the western sector in march 2017 909 490 µs cm in june 2018 and a mean value of 333 69 µs cm was recorded in the eastern sector in march 2017 176 51 µs cm in june 2018 hence in terms of temporary variation groundwater ec values were significantly higher p 0 05 see table s4 in june than in march however fluoride is the only ion increasing its concentration significantly in groundwater in june in contrast surface water ec values were significantly lower in june than in march this ec decrease was statistically significant only in the eastern sector probably because the streams are influenced in the west by groundwater quality ca2 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl diminish significantly p 0 05 in surface water in the eastern sector which is consistent with the ec decrease however surface and groundwater types remain very similar in both monitoring campaigns as observed in piper diagrams fig 5 nitrate concentration values in groundwater surpass the threshold value 50 mg l european parliament and the council of the european union 2006 in both sectors although a higher mean value is determined in the western sector indicating worse water quality nitrate concentrations have been high for decades in the vg aquifer as a result of a fertilizer input for crops and low renewal rates castillo et al 2010 plata bedmar and greciano gonzález 2018 no seasonal change in nitrate concentration has been statistically significant p greater than 0 05 4 2 surface and groundwater stable isotopes groundwater from the eastern sector is more depleted in oxygen 18 mean 8 4 0 5 in both monitoring campaigns and deuterium mean 55 5 2 9 in march 2017 and 56 0 3 5 in june 2018 than groundwater in the western sector δ18o mean value 7 4 1 0 in march 2017 and 6 6 2 3 in june 2017 δ2h mean value 51 3 5 3 in march 2017 and 55 2 7 5 in june 2018 fig 7 δ18o spatial variation can be observed in fig 8 for both monitoring campaigns similar isotopic signals of groundwater in the eastern sector and surface water coming from the east reveal the significance of these streams as a source of groundwater little recharge contribution from rainwater is estimated since its δ18o signal is 7 5 delgado huertas et al 1991 although mean values do not change substantially in groundwater between the two monitoring campaigns some difference can be observed in the june 2018 campaign few more extreme values were recorded more depleted δ18o values were recorded near the southeastern boundary of the aquifer and slightly more enriched δ18o values were observed in the western part fig 8 this isotope enrichment suggests an intensification of irrigation during this warmer season evaporation from irrigation return flows can cause enrichment in oxygen 18 in groundwater urresti estala et al 2016 on the other hand surface water in the east was significantly more depleted in this isotope fig 7 fig 8 in june 2018 mean 9 4 0 5 than in march 2017 mean 8 5 0 7 during spring and summer these rivers receive meltwater from the sierra nevada fig 1 with lighter δ18o because of the high altitude precipitation river aquifer interactions in the east can cause oxygen 18 depletion in groundwater near the southeastern sector where the rivers lose water towards the aquifer additionally the statistical analysis showed that the seasonal δ18o variation was only significant in the case of surface water in the eastern sector p 0 05 surface water from rivers flowing from the east was also more enriched in carbon 13 in june than in march fig 9 an increase in δ13c can indicate co2 removal from water by photosynthesis which is more intense in warmer months atekwana krishnamurthy 1998 surface water temperature in this sector was also significantly greater p 0 05 in june mean 13 4 c 0 9 than in march mean 10 9 c 1 5 the potential photosynthesis increase along with dilution due to meltwater contribution can be the cause of a lower bicarbonate concentration in these surface water sampling points in june table s3 the isotopic composition δ13c of surface water in the western sector is not very similar to that of the eastern sector since this stretch of the river receives water from the aquifer thus groundwater influences the isotopic signal of surface water in this case a significant decrease in δ13c in groundwater p 0 05 suggests water infiltration from the unsaturated zone when waters infiltrate to the subsurface they equilibrate with soil co2 in most temperate landscapes soil co2 is generally about 23 clark fritz 1997 4 3 occurrence and spatial and seasonal variation of target organic pollutants according to usage group organic compound analysis table s1 showed that in the march 2017 monitoring campaign 29 out of 171 analyzed compounds were found in at least one sample 11 phacs 16 pesticides and two pahs in the june 2018 campaign 33 compounds were detected 15 phacs 14 pesticides and two pahs hence four more pharmaceuticals and two less pesticides were found in the second campaign the frequency of detection and average concentration of all detected organic contaminants in surface water and in groundwater is shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively in both monitoring campaigns most phacs were detected more often in surface water than in groundwater 10 out of 11 in march 2017 and 12 out of 15 in june 2018 this can be a consequence of the importance of wastewater discharge into streams as a path of entry of these pollutants into the aquatic environment as well as of aquifer attenuation capacity as regards pesticides 7 out of 16 were detected more often in groundwater in march 2017 in june 2018 only 3 out of 14 were detected more frequently in groundwater these are all triazines which are herbicides the rest include other herbicides fungicides and insecticides herbicides are applied directly to the soil in agricultural lands as a diffuse source and they would be expected to reach the water table through wash off and release from the soil granulates before reaching the streams in contrast fungicides and insecticides are generally applied to the foliage and thus they are more susceptible to reach the streams through spray drift variation differences between the two seasons might be due to the use of the compounds target pest and thus the time of the year in which these are applied thirteen out of the total number of pesticides detected in both campaigns 21 are herbicides all of the triazines oxyfluorfen metolachlor pendimethalin and linuron the frequency of detection of 11 of them including all triazines decreases in june whereas the frequency of detection of the rest remains largely similar or increases among triazines only simazine desethyl terbuthylazine and desethyl atrazine remain at detectable concentrations in the second campaign and they do almost exclusively in groundwater this can mean that they are no longer being applied to the fields thus excess of these pesticides would not run off and reach the streams but the remaining molecules trapped in the soil and geological media could slowly reach the water table thanks to washing by rain events or irrigation regarding all data concentrations ranged from 0 0002 µg l for cocaine in surface water june 2018 to a maximum of 0 6 µg l of pesticide terbuconazole in surface water march 2017 minimum maximum and mean values of organic contaminant concentrations are available in tables s6 and s7 priority substances naphthalene atrazine chlorpyrifos and simazine were detected under the environmental quality standards established for these substances in surface waters european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 although lindane γ isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane was only detected in groundwater its concentration exceeded the limit set for surface waters in directive 2013 39 ue greater than0 04 μg l in the monitoring campaign carried out in march 2017 the limit set for individual pesticides in groundwater directive 2006 118 ec european parliament and council of the european union 2006 is exceeded in sampling point g23 0 24 µg l of desethyl terbutilazine in the june 2018 monitoring campaign this limit was exceeded in sampling point g41 0 11 µg l of metolachlor the following contaminants detected in this study are included in the latest watch list decision eu 2020 1161 european commission 2020 pesticides imazalil and tebuconazole and pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and venlafaxine erythromycin and clarithromycin were the only detected pharmaceuticals that are included in the first voluntary groundwater watch list although they were found only in surface water therefore none of the pollutants included in that list were detected in groundwater in this study fig 12 shows concentrations and distribution of detected organic compounds according to usage group in the study area for both monitoring campaigns a widespread distribution and dominance of triazines is observed in march 2017 whereas pharmaceuticals gain ground in june 2018 also in the march 2017 8 sampling points showed no detectable content in organic pollutants but in june 2018 this number decreases to 3 sampling points a general increase of pharmaceuticals in june can be a consequence of a growth in tourism and an increase of water demand during summer murillo díaz et al 2006 a group of detected organic contaminants has been selected for discussion the selection is based in their high frequency of detection therefore they can provide insights into the spatial and seasonal variation the selection includes illicit drugs cocaine and benzoylecgonine diclofenac desethyl terbuthylazine desethyl atrazine and simazine 4 4 selected pharmaceutical active compounds phacs the phacs most frequently detected present in more than 70 of groundwater or surface water samples in any of the two monitoring campaigns were cocaine benzoylecgonine and diclofenac fig 10 diclofenac was detected in one groundwater sample 0 018 μg l and in one surface water sample 0 012 μg l collected on march 2017 in the june 2018 monitoring campaign its frequency of occurrence increased substantially it was then detected in 53 of groundwater samples 0 010 0 014 μg l and in all surface water samples 0 025 0 024 μg l diclofenac is an anti inflammatory agent and it was one of the most reported cecs in european groundwater in recent years bunting et al 2021 in spite of its relatively high octanol water partition coefficient logkow 4 51 diclofenac is an acidic compound with a pka acid value of 4 15 which means that only the ionized form negatively charged exists in solution with ph 6 15 biel maeso et al 2017 ph field measurements ranged from 6 8 to 8 7 in this study this characteristic facilitates the mobility of the substance in the subsurface since it avoids sorption onto negatively charged surfaces of clays and organic matter schaffer and licha 2015 diclofenac can be quickly removed by biodegradation in agricultural soils 7 days as observed by thelusmond and co workers 2018 benzoylecgonine is the major metabolite of cocaine it is formed by hydrolysis of cocaine in the liver of cocaine users these two substances showed a relatively high frequency of detection in both campaigns in march 2017 benzoylecgonine was detected in 90 of surface water samples with a mean concentration of 0 021 0 016 μg l and in 13 of groundwater samples mean of 0 011 0 01 μg l cocaine was found in 50 of surface water samples 0 008 0 006 μg l and in 16 of groundwater samples 0 010 0 013 μg l an increase was observed in june 2018 benzoylecgonine showed a frequency of detection of 37 in groundwater 0 001 0 001 μg l and still a 90 in surface water 0 016 0 016 μg l cocaine showed a frequency of detection of 70 in surface water 0 005 0 006 μg l and 13 in groundwater 0 002 0 002 μg l benzoylecgonine can remain in the body of users longer and in larger quantities than cocaine pal et al 2013 and once in the environment cocaine can be rapidly degraded mainly by hydrolysis whereas benzoylecgonine can persist in the aquatic environment even after 15 days from the time of discharge mccall et al 2016 which can explain why it shows a more widespread distribution than its parent compound benzoylecgonine contains both an acidic and basic functional group making it a zwitter ion skopp and pötsch 1999 white moore 2018 cocaine is a base with a pka base 8 6 kim et al 2019 which means that it can be present partially as a cation under environmental ph conditions hence the ionized form can be more easily subjected to sorption processes which would not be the case for the non ionized form both substances are rather hydrophilic because they have a relatively low logkow 2 3 and 1 3 for cocaine and benzoylecgonine respectively skopp and pötsch 1999 so they are expected to sorb poorly onto solid particles and be present in the aqueous phase 4 5 selected pesticides triazines were the most ubiquitous group of pesticides fig 10 especially in groundwater which is consistent with other european surveys loos et al 2010 tasca et al 2018 terbuthylazine is one of the most widely used herbicides mostly because of the ban on the use of atrazine in europe since 2004 european commission 2004 however both substances are potentially used in the area in similar amounts since metabolites desethyl terbuthylazine and desethyl atrazine were the most frequently found compounds within this group both reaching a frequency of detection of 47 in groundwater and 30 in surface water in the march 2017 monitoring campaign in june 2018 these two compounds along with simazine were the only triazines detected and almost exclusively in groundwater desethyl terbuthylazine was found in 50 of groundwater samples desethyl atrazine was found in 53 of groundwater samples and in 10 of surface water samples terbuthylazine is a very weak base pka 2 meaning that it is present as a non ionized molecule over almost the entire ph range tasca et al 2018 and its persistence in soils is attributed to a strong adsorption capacity on humic substances navarro et al 2004 its metabolite desethyl terbuthylazine is more likely to pollute groundwater since it has a higher water solubility and does not bind as strongly to organic matter as terbuthylazine does tasca et al 2018 indeed terbuthylazine has a higher logkow 3 2 tasca et al 2018 than desethyl terbuthylazine 1 94 ronka and bodylska 2021 similarly atrazine and desethyl atrazine are weak bases pka 1 6 and 1 respectively and present a logkow of 2 61 and 1 51 respectively therefore the metabolite has a greater capacity to contaminate groundwater than the parent compound aelion mathur 2001 the weak base simazine might behave the same way as atrazine since it has a pka value of 1 62 and a logkow value of 2 18 tomlin 1997 thus the selected pesticides are less mobile in the subsurface than selected pharmaceuticals cocaine benzoylecgonine and diclofenac and they are also less stable in the environment atrazine s half life is estimated to be from 60 to more than 100 days in soil and the half life of desethyl atrazine was estimated in microcosm studies to be from just a few weeks to 100 days aelion mathur 2001 the half life of terbuthylazine is up to 120 days in soil and that of desethyl terbuthylazine is up to 223 days tasca et al 2018 lastly the estimated half life of simazine is 59 days candela 2003 4 6 assessment of the fate of selected organic pollutants in the vg aquifer seasonal variation of certain measured parameters table s2 in groundwater and surface water reflects changing conditions in the study area an ec decrease in surface waters in june can be a consequence of an input of low mineralized water from ice melting from the sierra nevada mountain range more depleted oxygen 18 values were observed in groundwater samples near the eastern limit of the aquifer in the june 2018 campaign suggesting water recharge from the streams with a lighter isotopic signal fig 8 indeed a higher river flow rate was recorded during this season by the guadalquivir river basin authority fig s2 nonetheless an ec increase was observed in groundwater in june with respect to march as observed in fig 13 this figure also shows the calcite saturation index in groundwater samples which generally decreases in june with respect to march this can be a consequence of water infiltration from the unsaturated zone which was also reflected by δ13c variations as previously exposed as water flows through the unsaturated zone it dissolves co2 from the soil and has more calcite dissolution capacity and therefore it lowers the saturation index of this mineral infiltrating water might come from surface water runoff or rain but as mentioned little contribution from rainfall is considered especially in the eastern sector as the δ18o signal of precipitation 7 5 delgado huertas et al 1991 does not fully represent that of the vg aquifer groundwater the ec increase in groundwater in june can be caused by irrigation which is generally intensified in this period water irrigation demand is estimated at 0 4 hm3 in march and 11 7 hm3 in june in the granada plain murillo díaz et al 2006 salt re concentration and isotope fractionation potentially due to irrigation return flows are sharpened in june as shown in fig 14 essentially in the western sector fluoride concentration also increased significantly in groundwater p 0 05 in june with respect to march tables s3 and s4 the increase in the fluoride concentration has been considered an indicator of intensified abstraction in the vg aquifer in previous studies castillo sánchez díaz 2005 because when pumping is intensified groundwater transfer from the miocene and triassic deposits is potentially enhanced and renewal rates diminish robles arenas et al 2012 checked the direct relationship between groundwater level rise and flood irrigation in a poplar crop near santa fe where they recorded a 0 5 m rise in one day water transfer from the riverbeds and from irrigation to the aquifer may generate a widespread expansion of certain organic pollutants especially phacs fig 15 shows the relationship between the presence and concentration of selected contaminants and the minimum well depth because in all cases wells are slotted all across the saturated zone the well depth in fig 15 corresponds to the unsaturated zone thickness found at each well location it can be observed that in march 2017 most contaminants are detected in the shallowest wells most of which are located in the western part of the aquifer fig 3 in contrast in the june 2018 monitoring campaign selected pharmaceuticals become almost ubiquitous throughout much of the aquifer the occurrence of desethyl atrazine desethyl terbuthylazine and simazine between campaigns throughout the aquifer thickness does not change as significantly as that of pharmaceuticals the most remarkable variation observed in fig 15 relates to the detection of selected phacs in june 2018 in the deepest wells where they were not detected in march 2017 these were sampling points g6 g2 g3 g1 g31 g14 g34 and g37 g6 g2 and g31 are located near the monachil genil and dílar rivers respectively fig 1 where the aquifer consists of fluvial gravels and sands and has the highest transmissivity values the isotopic composition δ18o recorded in these wells is lighter in june in line with the oxygen 18 depletion of the aforementioned rivers fig 8 sicalcite measured in these groundwater samples is lower fig 13 suggesting recharge from surface fresh water therefore in the case of these wells recharging streams can be the path through which organic contaminants enter the groundwater the monachil and dílar rivers receive untreated wastewater discharges right before they enter the granada plain according to the basin authority fig 4 two wwtp discharge into the genil river before water enters the plain fig s1 in june surface water samples s7 monachil river s8 s9 genil river and s10 dílar river showed detectable concentrations of diclofenac from values below limit of quantification to 0 015 μg l s7 s8 and s9 showed detectable contents of benzoylecgonine from values below limit of quantification to 0 005 μg l and s7 and s9 showed detectable contents of cocaine below limit of quantification wwtps in the granada area include secondary treatment which can be very effective in eliminating cocaine and benzoylecgonine with removal rates above 88 huerta fontela et al 2008 but are extremely unsuccessful in removing diclofenac kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 which requires tertiary treatment alessandretti et al 2021 sampling point g3 located in the southeastern part shows a very low concentration of benzoylecgonine in june oxygen 18 depletion fig 8 and a sicalcite decrease fig 13 in the second monitoring campaign reflect the influence of freshwater recharge either coming from riverbeds or from ditches that convey river freshwater for irrigation fig s1 a very low concentration of the only pharmaceutical detected in g3 and no detectable pollutant concentration in sampling point g4 close to g3 in either of the two monitoring campaigns can be attributed to the lower transmissivity of materials in this part of the aquifer since pollution sources are not absent fig 4 being further away from riverbeds these two wells are drilled in materials originating from alluvial fans deposited in the late miocene conglomerates sands silts and clays mateos et al 2017 with a lower transmissivity recharge water takes longer to reach the groundwater table and thus the load of more degradable compounds i e phacs can be reduced as exposed selected pharmaceuticals are potentially more mobile in the subsurface than triazines and these are more susceptible to sorption processes generally sorbed chemicals are less accessible to microorganisms and accordingly sorption limits their degradation arias estévez et al 2008 sampling point g36 did not show any detectable content of organic pollutants in any monitoring campaign fig 12 and sampling point g5 showed a relatively low and similar concentration of triazines in both campaigns fig 15 which are less mobile than the pharmaceuticals this general absence of organic pollutants at these two points can be attributed to the fact that they are located in the northeastern part of the aquifer where the hydraulic gradient is steeper fig 3 due to a higher clay content mateos et al 2017 in contrast diclofenac was detected in june in g1 which is closer to a stream beiro river in a zone where the aquifer materials become coarser and the hydraulic gradient decreases sampling points g14 g34 and g37 showed a content of selected pharmaceuticals only in june fig 15 but other phacs were detected at these points in march fig 12 this can be due to important and constant loads of wastewater coming from the northeastern boundary fig 4 in addition these wells are less deep than those located in the zone right next to the eastern boundary of the aquifer g36 g5 g1 g35 g2 and that located in the south east g6 g4 g3 g31 which did not show any detectable content in phacs in the march monitoring campaign fig 12 the shallower wells are more vulnerable to contamination this can be due to the fact that pollutants persist in the soil and the unsaturated zone thanks to their organic matter and clay content and undergo remobilization by the shallow water table sassine et al 2016 which can be the case specially for those pollutants that are more hydrophobic such as the triazines the potential origin of pharmaceuticals in these wells which are mainly located in the western zone is irrigation which often includes reclaimed wastewater rather than water recharge from riverbeds this is because the aquifer recharges a gaining river in this sector and most urban wastewater discharges are close to the main stream fig 4 5 conclusions in this study we provided the most extended dataset of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water resources presented until now for the unconfined aquifer of the granada plain the situation of the study area in terms of water pollution by these organic chemicals as well as an assessment of potential factors affecting their spread have been depicted a simple representation of the spatial distribution of the organic contaminants in the study area fig 12 is not easy to interpret the wide variety of factors influencing the occurrence of these pollutants makes spatial and seasonal analysis a challenging task physico chemical and hydrochemical parameters along with environmental stable isotopes have been used to define the hydro geo logical context of the study area during the monitoring campaigns this has contributed to the understanding of the spatial and seasonal distribution of the contaminants in this study four factors have been highlighted for their influence on the occurrence of organic pollutants i variability of unsaturated zone thickness ii river groundwater hydraulic connection iii hydraulic gradient and iv the anthropogenic factor determining the period of contaminant release throughout the year and wastewater management practices the unsaturated zone thickness plays a powerful protective role in relation to groundwater contamination namely the presence of selected pharmaceuticals in groundwater was related to the shallowest water table 15 m in the first monitoring campaign march 2017 however the vadose zone is not an insurmountable obstacle if water recharge from the surface increases an increase of stream flow potentially causing aquifer water recharge did not result in a dilution of emerging contaminants as initially expected instead it promoted their widespread distribution across the alluvial aquifer resulting in the detection of selected pharmaceuticals in wells as deep as 123 m as a matter of fact pollution transfer to deeper wells due to water recharge took place in the southeastern part of the aquifer where transmissivity values are high and where groundwater has a better quality and therefore where groundwater is extracted for urban supply water management should focus on eliminating groundwater quality threats such as untreated wastewater discharges and its use for irrigation and should consider further treatment in existing wwtps concentration of organic contaminants in wells situated in the northeastern part with less permeable materials and a greater hydraulic gradient remain very low or under detection limits in essence when the aquifer recharge process from the surface is delayed either by a thick vadose zone or due to the presence of poorly permeable materials pollutants that are more susceptible to degradation do not reach the water table at detectable concentrations finally the importance of the anthropogenic factor cannot be ignored as evidenced by the opposite seasonal tendency regarding frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals and herbicides typical pesticide application periods can explain the appearance of herbicides in march and their frequency detection decrease in june the increase of urban water demand potentially due to growth of tourism in summer can also explain a higher frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in june in both surface water and groundwater intensification of irrigation should also be considered as a potential path of entry of urban organic contaminants treated and untreated urban wastewater is released to streams from which water is diverted for irrigation and also discharged directly into irrigation channels and ditches the hydrodynamic context in the study area drives the greatest changes between seasons in the southeastern part of the aquifer where transmissivity values are greater further research will focus on these zones and will require conducting more frequent monitoring work over time to better characterize this phenomenon research funds will be more efficiently spent by monitoring just the most frequent compounds detected in this

3267,the anthropogenic organic contaminants contemplated in the environmental legislation as well as those of emerging concern threaten the quality of water resources to a degree that remains largely unknown contaminant exposure in the aquatic environment is a crucial element if a full understanding of the risk is pursued there are still many uncertainties about the occurrence of organic pollutants and behavior in the hydro geo logical media in large scale areas the case study of the unconfined aquifer of the granada plain approximately 200 km2 is presented here two surface and groundwater monitoring campaigns were conducted march 2017 and june 2018 in total 41 out of 171 target organic pollutants were detected at least once 17 pharmaceuticals or drugs of abuse 21 pesticides or their metabolites and three polyaromatic hydrocarbons in addition physico chemical parameters were measured during the monitoring campaigns and hydrochemical parameters and stable isotopes δ2h δ18o δ13c were analyzed statistical tests confirmed the significance of seasonal changes for some of these parameters e g ec cl f δ18o δ13c revealing the influence from snowmelt water input on streams and the intensification of irrigation in march 2017 the group of pesticides largely represented by triazines predominated whereas the frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals increased substantially in june 2018 results suggest four main factors affecting the spatial and seasonal variation of organic pollutants in the aquifer the anthropogenic factor determining the period of contaminant release throughout the year pesticide application period and growth of tourism along with irrigation practices that include reclaimed wastewater unsaturated zone thickness hydraulic gradient and river groundwater hydraulic connection the latter can be especially important in the case of those contaminants whose main path of entry into the aquatic environment occurs through wastewater discharge into streams i e pharmaceuticals keywords pharmaceuticals pesticides detrital aquifer seasonal variation unsaturated zone recharge process 1 introduction a contaminant of emerging concern cec is known as such not only because it has been recently considered to cause known or suspected adverse ecological or human health effects stuart et al 2012 but also because they remain largely unregulated in the field of water policy daughton 2004 nonetheless the importance of learning more about their occurrence harmful potential and environmental behavior has been recognized and highlighted by institutions and the scientific community according to directive 2013 39 eu european parliament and of the council 2013 the european commission must establish a watch list that includes substances that can be of concern and for which information must be gathered to date three watch lists have been set out european commission 2020 which include substances that are essentially pharmaceuticals and pesticides similarly a watch list for pollutants in groundwater including emerging contaminants has also been demanded european commission 2014 lapworth et al 2019 although pesticides are pollutants contemplated in the environmental legislation european parliament and council of the european union 2008 and the use of some of said pollutants such as atrazine has been banned european commission 2004 due to its endocrine disruption potential hayes et al 2011 and other harmful effects they continue to be detected in the aquatic environment at concentrations still above their limit silva et al 2012 sassine et al 2016 moreover relatively few groundwater studies targeting contaminant metabolites such as those resulting from pesticide degradation have been undertaken these by products can also be of concern bunting et al 2020 the potential adverse effects of emerging pollutants to human health or to ecosystems have also been researched and reviewed lópez pacheco et al 2019 lei et al 2015 pereira et al 2015 however in order to fully understand the risk that cecs may entail the exposure must be defined and this is why hydrogeological studies are essential mas pla 2018 large scale studies are very valuable to understand the spatial occurrence and trends of cecs and will help build a foundation for future regulation yet these studies are not as frequently conducted as they should bunting et al 2020 furthermore the spatial distribution of anthropogenic organic contaminants is challenging to assess as it can be affected by several factors such as the spatial and temporal distribution of pollution sources since wastewater treatment is not fully successful at eliminating cecs carballa et al 2004 carballa et al 2005 wastewater discharge into streams acts as the main path of entry into the aquatic environment which is the reason why emerging contaminant research has mainly focused on surface water stuart et al 2012 other factors need to be considered the influence of the hydraulic context on cecs occurrence was observed by corada fernández et al 2017 who compared periods of droughts and extreme rainfall events lutri et al 2020 determined the relationship between the presence of glyphosate and its main metabolite and shallowest water table and low flow velocity the physico chemical properties of the pollutants themselves can grant them different environmental behaviors massmann et al 2006 schaffer and licha 2015 martínez hernández et al 2016 llamas dios et al 2020 pointed out the potential role of hydraulic infrastructure on spatial distribution of hydrophilic cecs i e pharmaceuticals in this study we present the spatial distribution and seasonal variation of cecs and other regulated organic pollutants in water resources of the vega de granada aquifer hereafter vg aquifer vega means irrigated plain in spanish an alluvial aquifer of 200 km2 approximately one hundred and seventy one organic pollutants were analyzed including pharmaceuticals pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and brominated diphenyl ethers bdes data interpretation focused on the distribution of pharmaceuticals pesticides and their metabolites according to their higher frequency of detection as it will be seen in following sections two monitoring campaigns were carried out in order to assess the importance of aquifer recharge processes associated with seasonal changes natural and anthropogenic the vg aquifer is an alluvial aquifer covered by agricultural lands and urban areas demanding an increasing volume of water resources from surface streams and the subsoil human activities have led to a general increase of salinity castillo et al 2010 and high nitrate contents in groundwater due to decades of fertilizer use castillo 2005 rodriguez galiano et al 2018 and to a decrease of water recharge and renewal rates castillo et al 2010 microbiological contamination has also proven to be a sanitary problem in this region castillo and ramos cormenzana 2002 luque espinar et al 2015 conducted a study on the distribution and seasonal variation of six cecs in water resources of granada city metropolitan areas observing water pollution by pharmaceutical active compounds ibuprofen paracetamol caffeine and pantoprazole and even affection on the crops which are usually irrigated with wastewater luque espinar and chica olmo 2020 observed an important affection by wastewater in the entire aquifer amoxicillin caffeine paracetamol and ibuprofen were detected in collected vegetables as mentioned in the present study the number of target pollutants to be analyzed in water resources has been expanded the purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other regulated organic pollutants i e pesticides in surface and groundwater of the highly impacted vg aquifer and to assess seasonal differences to do so the following specific objectives are pursued 1 to provide a description of the system regarding water pollution by organic chemicals and 2 to define the context of the groundwater system during both campaigns using hydrochemical data and environmental isotopes the aim is to distinguish the importance of the role played by the different possible factors i e hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer hydrodynamic context physico chemical properties of the pollutants human practices on the spread of organic pollutants in the vg aquifer 2 study area the vega de granada vg plain extends over 200 km2 and is located in the south of the iberian peninsula in spain fig 1 the vg plain is at the center of the upper genil river catchment 2 950 km2 also known as the granada basin it is the largest water consumption zone within the catchment area meeting the demands of 120 km2 of irrigation lands and 550 000 inhabitants approximately castillo et al 2010 the genil river starts in the sierra nevada mountain range on the east and flows through the plain in a westerly direction where it is joined by several tributaries the elevation of the plain is about 550 m a s l the sierra nevada mountains reaching 3 470 m a s l the average temperature in the plain is around 15 16 c whereas that of the sierra nevada ranges from 5 to 6 c at an elevation of 2 550 m a s l mean annual precipitation is 490 mm year in the plain and about 1 000 mm year in the upper mountains kohfahl et al 2008 the granada basin fig 1 consists of an outcrop of neogene to quaternary sediments overlying the ne sw trending contact between the external and internal zones of the betic cordillera the sequence of the sedimentary materials is over 2 km thick in some areas uplift of the cordilleras that started in the late miocene generated normal faults that defined the basin limits and caused the deposition of alluvial and delta fans along the edges the aquifer corresponds to the holocene quaternary detritic sediments filling the tectonic depression which presents a sedimentary multilayered structure with levels of gravels sand silt and clay as a result of the coalescence between river sedimentation and that of the alluvial fans aquifer thickness reaches up to 250 m in the center part mateos et al 2017 low permeability neogene and quaternary materials showing variable lithology bound the vg aquifer except for a jurassic carbonate outcrop located in the north dpg igme 1990 the latter consists of limestones and dolostones overlying a triassic evaporitic basement miocene neogene materials form the basement of the alluvial sediments of the aquifer dpg igme 1990 the general neogene sedimentary sequence is composed of calcarenites terrigenous sediments and evaporites kohfahl et al 2008 fig 2 the holocene vg aquifer boundaries are closed except for those in contact with the jurassic carbonates and those in contact with coarse grained upper pliocene lower pleistocene materials at the eastern boundary and with quaternary alluvial fan materials in the southeast the vg aquifer fine grained substratum is impervious due to its content in clays and silts luque espinar et al 2002 transmissivity of the vg aquifer ranges between 100 and 40 000 m2 day with an average of 4 000 m2 day castillo et al 2010 along the central axis of the aquifer and in the southeastern part in zones close to the genil river and the monachil and dílar rivers the aquifer consists mainly of fluvial gravels and sands thus the highest transmissivity values are observed in these zones coarse sediments with thicknesses of up to 150 m have been recorded at the central zone of the aquifer clay content increases towards the boundaries and a minimum clay content of 80 has been estimated in the northeastern part of the aquifer mateos et al 2017 where the steepest hydraulic gradient is observed fig 3 average renewable water resources of the vg aquifer are estimated to be 160 hm3 year castillo et al 2010 aquifer water recharge comes mainly from surface runoff generated in the granada basin nevertheless the main recharge area is located in the southeastern sector where most tributaries join the main riverbed chica olmo et al 2014 thus water recharge from surface water infiltration takes place essentially thanks to infiltration from the genil dílar and monachil rivers chg 2021 fig 1 infiltration of surface runoff is strongly driven by irrigation through a dense network of irrigation channels and ditches that takes up part of this surface water this water input is estimated to be 126 hm3 year rain infiltration over the permeable surface of the aquifer adds 24 hm3 year and contribution from adjacent aquifers is around 10 hm3 year castillo et al 2010 which is likely to occur mainly at the southeastern boundary of the aquifer near to the more permeable carbonate rocks kohfahl et al 2008 aquifer discharge occurs on the one hand through natural discharge in the western sector of the aquifer downstream from the town of fuente vaqueros through springs and diffuse sources towards the genil and cubillas rivers igme 1990 the average value of this output has been estimated at 110 hm3 year on the other hand net groundwater abstraction through wells accounts for the remaining 50 hm3 year 85 for agricultural use and 15 for urban water supply castillo et al 2010 as mentioned stream aquifer hydraulic connection is different in the eastern and western parts in the eastern sector a river disconnected from the water table loses water towards the aquifer whereas the river gains water from the aquifer predominantly near the western boundary igme 2009 in the eastern part below the city of granada the unsaturated zone of the aquifer reaches its maximum thickness with minimum thicknesses found in the western part fig 3 there are two wastewater treatment plants wwtp treating wastewater from the granada area fig s1 in these facilities 42 hm3 and 37 hm3 of wastewater was treated in 2017 and in 2018 respectively purification processes consist of preliminary treatment a primary sedimentation process secondary biological treatment and secondary sedimentation treated and untreated urban wastewaters are directly released into ditches of the irrigation network or into riverbeds from which water is also used for irrigation robles arenas et al 2012 the location and magnitude of urban wastewater discharge permitted by the basin authority can be seen in fig 4 3 materials and methods 3 1 water sampling and measurement of physico chemical parameters two monitoring campaigns were conducted one in march 2017 and in june 2018 they consisted of the collection of 30 groundwater samples and 10 surface water samples fig 1 groundwater samples were collected mainly from irrigation wells from the alluvial unconfined aquifer vg aquifer continuous pumping was performed before collecting the sample surface water samples were collected from the genil river and smaller tributaries sampling points are classified in two groups those situated in the eastern part of the plain and those situated in the western part based on the aforementioned differences between the two aquifer sectors fig 3 water samples were filtered using a 0 45 µm millipore filter merck kgaa darmstadt germany sterile high density polyethylene bottles 120 ml sealed with inverted cone caps were used to store water samples for hydrochemical and isotopic

paired sample t test was used the latter was applied to physico chemical and hydrochemical parameters the t test requires the differences between paired observations to be normally distributed helsel

not differ significantly was rejected 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface and groundwater hydrochemical composition descriptive statistics of measured physico chemical parameters and hydrochemical results are available in the supplementary material section tables s2 and s3 a spatial variability of hydrochemical characteristics is observed in the study area regarding both surface water and groundwater fig 5 fig 6 calcium and magnesium bicarbonate low mineralized type water is predominant in the eastern part potentially as a consequence of water input coming from the sierra nevada mountain range through riverbeds in contrast mixed facies with a higher level of mineralization are most commonly found in the western part indicating different factors affecting water quality other than rock water interaction i e impact of human activities sulphate sodium chloride sodium and sulphate calcium facies near the southern aquifer limit reflect the influence of the evaporitic materials from the miocene deposits the electrical conductivity ec mean value was higher in the western sector in both campaigns a mean value of 1 453 538 µs cm was recorded in groundwater in the western sector in march 2017 1 767 567 µs cm in june 2018 whereas a mean value of 824 266 µs cm was recorded in groundwater from the eastern sector in march 2017 977 255 µs cm in june 2018 as regards surface water a mean value of 1 162 166 µs cm was recorded in the western sector in march 2017 909 490 µs cm in june 2018 and a mean value of 333 69 µs cm was recorded in the eastern sector in march 2017 176 51 µs cm in june 2018 hence in terms of temporary variation groundwater ec values were significantly higher p 0 05 see table s4 in june than in march however fluoride is the only ion increasing its concentration significantly in groundwater in june in contrast surface water ec values were significantly lower in june than in march this ec decrease was statistically significant only in the eastern sector probably because the streams are influenced in the west by groundwater quality ca2 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl diminish significantly p 0 05 in surface water in the eastern sector which is consistent with the ec decrease however surface and groundwater types remain very similar in both monitoring campaigns as observed in piper diagrams fig 5 nitrate concentration values in groundwater surpass the threshold value 50 mg l european parliament and the council of the european union 2006 in both sectors although a higher mean value is determined in the western sector indicating worse water quality nitrate concentrations have been high for decades in the vg aquifer as a result of a fertilizer input for crops and low renewal rates castillo et al 2010 plata bedmar and greciano gonzález 2018 no seasonal change in nitrate concentration has been statistically significant p greater than 0 05 4 2 surface and groundwater stable isotopes groundwater from the eastern sector is more depleted in oxygen 18 mean 8 4 0 5 in both monitoring campaigns and deuterium mean 55 5 2 9 in march 2017 and 56 0 3 5 in june 2018 than groundwater in the western sector δ18o mean value 7 4 1 0 in march 2017 and 6 6 2 3 in june 2017 δ2h mean value 51 3 5 3 in march 2017 and 55 2 7 5 in june 2018 fig 7 δ18o spatial variation can be observed in fig 8 for both monitoring campaigns similar isotopic signals of groundwater in the eastern sector and surface water coming from the east reveal the significance of these streams as a source of groundwater little recharge contribution from rainwater is estimated since its δ18o signal is 7 5 delgado huertas et al 1991 although mean values do not change substantially in groundwater between the two monitoring campaigns some difference can be observed in the june 2018 campaign few more extreme values were recorded more depleted δ18o values were recorded near the southeastern boundary of the aquifer and slightly more enriched δ18o values were observed in the western part fig 8 this isotope enrichment suggests an intensification of irrigation during this warmer season evaporation from irrigation return flows can cause enrichment in oxygen 18 in groundwater urresti estala et al 2016 on the other hand surface water in the east was significantly more depleted in this isotope fig 7 fig 8 in june 2018 mean 9 4 0 5 than in march 2017 mean 8 5 0 7 during spring and summer these rivers receive meltwater from the sierra nevada fig 1 with lighter δ18o because of the high altitude precipitation river aquifer interactions in the east can cause oxygen 18 depletion in groundwater near the southeastern sector where the rivers lose water towards the aquifer additionally the statistical analysis showed that the seasonal δ18o variation was only significant in the case of surface water in the eastern sector p 0 05 surface water from rivers flowing from the east was also more enriched in carbon 13 in june than in march fig 9 an increase in δ13c can indicate co2 removal from water by photosynthesis which is more intense in warmer months atekwana krishnamurthy 1998 surface water temperature in this sector was also significantly greater p 0 05 in june mean 13 4 c 0 9 than in march mean 10 9 c 1 5 the potential photosynthesis increase along with dilution due to meltwater contribution can be the cause of a lower bicarbonate concentration in these surface water sampling points in june table s3 the isotopic composition δ13c of surface water in the western sector is not very similar to that of the eastern sector since this stretch of the river receives water from the aquifer thus groundwater influences the isotopic signal of surface water in this case a significant decrease in δ13c in groundwater p 0 05 suggests water infiltration from the unsaturated zone when waters infiltrate to the subsurface they equilibrate with soil co2 in most temperate landscapes soil co2 is generally about 23 clark fritz 1997 4 3 occurrence and spatial and seasonal variation of target organic pollutants according to usage group organic compound analysis table s1 showed that in the march 2017 monitoring campaign 29 out of 171 analyzed compounds were found in at least one sample 11 phacs 16 pesticides and two pahs in the june 2018 campaign 33 compounds were detected 15 phacs 14 pesticides and two pahs hence four more pharmaceuticals and two less pesticides were found in the second campaign the frequency of detection and average concentration of all detected organic contaminants in surface water and in groundwater is shown in fig 10 and fig 11 respectively in both monitoring campaigns most phacs were detected more often in surface water than in groundwater 10 out of 11 in march 2017 and 12 out of 15 in june 2018 this can be a consequence of the importance of wastewater discharge into streams as a path of entry of these pollutants into the aquatic environment as well as of aquifer attenuation capacity as regards pesticides 7 out of 16 were detected more often in groundwater in march 2017 in june 2018 only 3 out of 14 were detected more frequently in groundwater these are all triazines which are herbicides the rest include other herbicides fungicides and insecticides herbicides are applied directly to the soil in agricultural lands as a diffuse source and they would be expected to reach the water table through wash off and release from the soil granulates before reaching the streams in contrast fungicides and insecticides are generally applied to the foliage and thus they are more susceptible to reach the streams through spray drift variation differences between the two seasons might be due to the use of the compounds target pest and thus the time of the year in which these are applied thirteen out of the total number of pesticides detected in both campaigns 21 are herbicides all of the triazines oxyfluorfen metolachlor pendimethalin and linuron the frequency of detection of 11 of them including all triazines decreases in june whereas the frequency of detection of the rest remains largely similar or increases among triazines only simazine desethyl terbuthylazine and desethyl atrazine remain at detectable concentrations in the second campaign and they do almost exclusively in groundwater this can mean that they are no longer being applied to the fields thus excess of these pesticides would not run off and reach the streams but the remaining molecules trapped in the soil and geological media could slowly reach the water table thanks to washing by rain events or irrigation regarding all data concentrations ranged from 0 0002 µg l for cocaine in surface water june 2018 to a maximum of 0 6 µg l of pesticide terbuconazole in surface water march 2017 minimum maximum and mean values of organic contaminant concentrations are available in tables s6 and s7 priority substances naphthalene atrazine chlorpyrifos and simazine were detected under the environmental quality standards established for these substances in surface waters european parliament and the council of the european union 2013 although lindane γ isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane was only detected in groundwater its concentration exceeded the limit set for surface waters in directive 2013 39 ue greater than0 04 μg l in the monitoring campaign carried out in march 2017 the limit set for individual pesticides in groundwater directive 2006 118 ec european parliament and council of the european union 2006 is exceeded in sampling point g23 0 24 µg l of desethyl terbutilazine in the june 2018 monitoring campaign this limit was exceeded in sampling point g41 0 11 µg l of metolachlor the following contaminants detected in this study are included in the latest watch list decision eu 2020 1161 european commission 2020 pesticides imazalil and tebuconazole and pharmaceuticals ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and venlafaxine erythromycin and clarithromycin were the only detected pharmaceuticals that are included in the first voluntary groundwater watch list although they were found only in surface water therefore none of the pollutants included in that list were detected in groundwater in this study fig 12 shows concentrations and distribution of detected organic compounds according to usage group in the study area for both monitoring campaigns a widespread distribution and dominance of triazines is observed in march 2017 whereas pharmaceuticals gain ground in june 2018 also in the march 2017 8 sampling points showed no detectable content in organic pollutants but in june 2018 this number decreases to 3 sampling points a general increase of pharmaceuticals in june can be a consequence of a growth in tourism and an increase of water demand during summer murillo díaz et al 2006 a group of detected organic contaminants has been selected for discussion the selection is based in their high frequency of detection therefore they can provide insights into the spatial and seasonal variation the selection includes illicit drugs cocaine and benzoylecgonine diclofenac desethyl terbuthylazine desethyl atrazine and simazine 4 4 selected pharmaceutical active compounds phacs the phacs most frequently detected present in more than 70 of groundwater or surface water samples in any of the two monitoring campaigns were cocaine benzoylecgonine and diclofenac fig 10 diclofenac was detected in one groundwater sample 0 018 μg l and in one surface water sample 0 012 μg l collected on march 2017 in the june 2018 monitoring campaign its frequency of occurrence increased substantially it was then detected in 53 of groundwater samples 0 010 0 014 μg l and in all surface water samples 0 025 0 024 μg l diclofenac is an anti inflammatory agent and it was one of the most reported cecs in european groundwater in recent years bunting et al 2021 in spite of its relatively high octanol water partition coefficient logkow 4 51 diclofenac is an acidic compound with a pka acid value of 4 15 which means that only the ionized form negatively charged exists in solution with ph 6 15 biel maeso et al 2017 ph field measurements ranged from 6 8 to 8 7 in this study this characteristic facilitates the mobility of the substance in the subsurface since it avoids sorption onto negatively charged surfaces of clays and organic matter schaffer and licha 2015 diclofenac can be quickly removed by biodegradation in agricultural soils 7 days as observed by thelusmond and co workers 2018 benzoylecgonine is the major metabolite of cocaine it is formed by hydrolysis of cocaine in the liver of cocaine users these two substances showed a relatively high frequency of detection in both campaigns in march 2017 benzoylecgonine was detected in 90 of surface water samples with a mean concentration of 0 021 0 016 μg l and in 13 of groundwater samples mean of 0 011 0 01 μg l cocaine was found in 50 of surface water samples 0 008 0 006 μg l and in 16 of groundwater samples 0 010 0 013 μg l an increase was observed in june 2018 benzoylecgonine showed a frequency of detection of 37 in groundwater 0 001 0 001 μg l and still a 90 in surface water 0 016 0 016 μg l cocaine showed a frequency of detection of 70 in surface water 0 005 0 006 μg l and 13 in groundwater 0 002 0 002 μg l benzoylecgonine can remain in the body of users longer and in larger quantities than cocaine pal et al 2013 and once in the environment cocaine can be rapidly degraded mainly by hydrolysis whereas benzoylecgonine can persist in the aquatic environment even after 15 days from the time of discharge mccall et al 2016 which can explain why it shows a more widespread distribution than its parent compound benzoylecgonine contains both an acidic and basic functional group making it a zwitter ion skopp and pötsch 1999 white moore 2018 cocaine is a base with a pka base 8 6 kim et al 2019 which means that it can be present partially as a cation under environmental ph conditions hence the ionized form can be more easily subjected to sorption processes which would not be the case for the non ionized form both substances are rather hydrophilic because they have a relatively low logkow 2 3 and 1 3 for cocaine and benzoylecgonine respectively skopp and pötsch 1999 so they are expected to sorb poorly onto solid particles and be present in the aqueous phase 4 5 selected pesticides triazines were the most ubiquitous group of pesticides fig 10 especially in groundwater which is consistent with other european surveys loos et al 2010 tasca et al 2018 terbuthylazine is one of the most widely used herbicides mostly because of the ban on the use of atrazine in europe since 2004 european commission 2004 however both substances are potentially used in the area in similar amounts since metabolites desethyl terbuthylazine and desethyl atrazine were the most frequently found compounds within this group both reaching a frequency of detection of 47 in groundwater and 30 in surface water in the march 2017 monitoring campaign in june 2018 these two compounds along with simazine were the only triazines detected and almost exclusively in groundwater desethyl terbuthylazine was found in 50 of groundwater samples desethyl atrazine was found in 53 of groundwater samples and in 10 of surface water samples terbuthylazine is a very weak base pka 2 meaning that it is present as a non ionized molecule over almost the entire ph range tasca et al 2018 and its persistence in soils is attributed to a strong adsorption capacity on humic substances navarro et al 2004 its metabolite desethyl terbuthylazine is more likely to pollute groundwater since it has a higher water solubility and does not bind as strongly to organic matter as terbuthylazine does tasca et al 2018 indeed terbuthylazine has a higher logkow 3 2 tasca et al 2018 than desethyl terbuthylazine 1 94 ronka and bodylska 2021 similarly atrazine and desethyl atrazine are weak bases pka 1 6 and 1 respectively and present a logkow of 2 61 and 1 51 respectively therefore the metabolite has a greater capacity to contaminate groundwater than the parent compound aelion mathur 2001 the weak base simazine might behave the same way as atrazine since it has a pka value of 1 62 and a logkow value of 2 18 tomlin 1997 thus the selected pesticides are less mobile in the subsurface than selected pharmaceuticals cocaine benzoylecgonine and diclofenac and they are also less stable in the environment atrazine s half life is estimated to be from 60 to more than 100 days in soil and the half life of desethyl atrazine was estimated in microcosm studies to be from just a few weeks to 100 days aelion mathur 2001 the half life of terbuthylazine is up to 120 days in soil and that of desethyl terbuthylazine is up to 223 days tasca et al 2018 lastly the estimated half life of simazine is 59 days candela 2003 4 6 assessment of the fate of selected organic pollutants in the vg aquifer seasonal variation of certain measured parameters table s2 in groundwater and surface water reflects changing conditions in the study area an ec decrease in surface waters in june can be a consequence of an input of low mineralized water from ice melting from the sierra nevada mountain range more depleted oxygen 18 values were observed in groundwater samples near the eastern limit of the aquifer in the june 2018 campaign suggesting water recharge from the streams with a lighter isotopic signal fig 8 indeed a higher river flow rate was recorded during this season by the guadalquivir river basin authority fig s2 nonetheless an ec increase was observed in groundwater in june with respect to march as observed in fig 13 this figure also shows the calcite saturation index in groundwater samples which generally decreases in june with respect to march this can be a consequence of water infiltration from the unsaturated zone which was also reflected by δ13c variations as previously exposed as water flows through the unsaturated zone it dissolves co2 from the soil and has more calcite dissolution capacity and therefore it lowers the saturation index of this mineral infiltrating water might come from surface water runoff or rain but as mentioned little contribution from rainfall is considered especially in the eastern sector as the δ18o signal of precipitation 7 5 delgado huertas et al 1991 does not fully represent that of the vg aquifer groundwater the ec increase in groundwater in june can be caused by irrigation which is generally intensified in this period water irrigation demand is estimated at 0 4 hm3 in march and 11 7 hm3 in june in the granada plain murillo díaz et al 2006 salt re concentration and isotope fractionation potentially due to irrigation return flows are sharpened in june as shown in fig 14 essentially in the western sector fluoride concentration also increased significantly in groundwater p 0 05 in june with respect to march tables s3 and s4 the increase in the fluoride concentration has been considered an indicator of intensified abstraction in the vg aquifer in previous studies castillo sánchez díaz 2005 because when pumping is intensified groundwater transfer from the miocene and triassic deposits is potentially enhanced and renewal rates diminish robles arenas et al 2012 checked the direct relationship between groundwater level rise and flood irrigation in a poplar crop near santa fe where they recorded a 0 5 m rise in one day water transfer from the riverbeds and from irrigation to the aquifer may generate a widespread expansion of certain organic pollutants especially phacs fig 15 shows the relationship between the presence and concentration of selected contaminants and the minimum well depth because in all cases wells are slotted all across the saturated zone the well depth in fig 15 corresponds to the unsaturated zone thickness found at each well location it can be observed that in march 2017 most contaminants are detected in the shallowest wells most of which are located in the western part of the aquifer fig 3 in contrast in the june 2018 monitoring campaign selected pharmaceuticals become almost ubiquitous throughout much of the aquifer the occurrence of desethyl atrazine desethyl terbuthylazine and simazine between campaigns throughout the aquifer thickness does not change as significantly as that of pharmaceuticals the most remarkable variation observed in fig 15 relates to the detection of selected phacs in june 2018 in the deepest wells where they were not detected in march 2017 these were sampling points g6 g2 g3 g1 g31 g14 g34 and g37 g6 g2 and g31 are located near the monachil genil and dílar rivers respectively fig 1 where the aquifer consists of fluvial gravels and sands and has the highest transmissivity values the isotopic composition δ18o recorded in these wells is lighter in june in line with the oxygen 18 depletion of the aforementioned rivers fig 8 sicalcite measured in these groundwater samples is lower fig 13 suggesting recharge from surface fresh water therefore in the case of these wells recharging streams can be the path through which organic contaminants enter the groundwater the monachil and dílar rivers receive untreated wastewater discharges right before they enter the granada plain according to the basin authority fig 4 two wwtp discharge into the genil river before water enters the plain fig s1 in june surface water samples s7 monachil river s8 s9 genil river and s10 dílar river showed detectable concentrations of diclofenac from values below limit of quantification to 0 015 μg l s7 s8 and s9 showed detectable contents of benzoylecgonine from values below limit of quantification to 0 005 μg l and s7 and s9 showed detectable contents of cocaine below limit of quantification wwtps in the granada area include secondary treatment which can be very effective in eliminating cocaine and benzoylecgonine with removal rates above 88 huerta fontela et al 2008 but are extremely unsuccessful in removing diclofenac kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 which requires tertiary treatment alessandretti et al 2021 sampling point g3 located in the southeastern part shows a very low concentration of benzoylecgonine in june oxygen 18 depletion fig 8 and a sicalcite decrease fig 13 in the second monitoring campaign reflect the influence of freshwater recharge either coming from riverbeds or from ditches that convey river freshwater for irrigation fig s1 a very low concentration of the only pharmaceutical detected in g3 and no detectable pollutant concentration in sampling point g4 close to g3 in either of the two monitoring campaigns can be attributed to the lower transmissivity of materials in this part of the aquifer since pollution sources are not absent fig 4 being further away from riverbeds these two wells are drilled in materials originating from alluvial fans deposited in the late miocene conglomerates sands silts and clays mateos et al 2017 with a lower transmissivity recharge water takes longer to reach the groundwater table and thus the load of more degradable compounds i e phacs can be reduced as exposed selected pharmaceuticals are potentially more mobile in the subsurface than triazines and these are more susceptible to sorption processes generally sorbed chemicals are less accessible to microorganisms and accordingly sorption limits their degradation arias estévez et al 2008 sampling point g36 did not show any detectable content of organic pollutants in any monitoring campaign fig 12 and sampling point g5 showed a relatively low and similar concentration of triazines in both campaigns fig 15 which are less mobile than the pharmaceuticals this general absence of organic pollutants at these two points can be attributed to the fact that they are located in the northeastern part of the aquifer where the hydraulic gradient is steeper fig 3 due to a higher clay content mateos et al 2017 in contrast diclofenac was detected in june in g1 which is closer to a stream beiro river in a zone where the aquifer materials become coarser and the hydraulic gradient decreases sampling points g14 g34 and g37 showed a content of selected pharmaceuticals only in june fig 15 but other phacs were detected at these points in march fig 12 this can be due to important and constant loads of wastewater coming from the northeastern boundary fig 4 in addition these wells are less deep than those located in the zone right next to the eastern boundary of the aquifer g36 g5 g1 g35 g2 and that located in the south east g6 g4 g3 g31 which did not show any detectable content in phacs in the march monitoring campaign fig 12 the shallower wells are more vulnerable to contamination this can be due to the fact that pollutants persist in the soil and the unsaturated zone thanks to their organic matter and clay content and undergo remobilization by the shallow water table sassine et al 2016 which can be the case specially for those pollutants that are more hydrophobic such as the triazines the potential origin of pharmaceuticals in these wells which are mainly located in the western zone is irrigation which often includes reclaimed wastewater rather than water recharge from riverbeds this is because the aquifer recharges a gaining river in this sector and most urban wastewater discharges are close to the main stream fig 4 5 conclusions in this study we provided the most extended dataset of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals and pesticides in water resources presented until now for the unconfined aquifer of the granada plain the situation of the study area in terms of water pollution by these organic chemicals as well as an assessment of potential factors affecting their spread have been depicted a simple representation of the spatial distribution of the organic contaminants in the study area fig 12 is not easy to interpret the wide variety of factors influencing the occurrence of these pollutants makes spatial and seasonal analysis a challenging task physico chemical and hydrochemical parameters along with environmental stable isotopes have been used to define the hydro geo logical context of the study area during the monitoring campaigns this has contributed to the understanding of the spatial and seasonal distribution of the contaminants in this study four factors have been highlighted for their influence on the occurrence of organic pollutants i variability of unsaturated zone thickness ii river groundwater hydraulic connection iii hydraulic gradient and iv the anthropogenic factor determining the period of contaminant release throughout the year and wastewater management practices the unsaturated zone thickness plays a powerful protective role in relation to groundwater contamination namely the presence of selected pharmaceuticals in groundwater was related to the shallowest water table 15 m in the first monitoring campaign march 2017 however the vadose zone is not an insurmountable obstacle if water recharge from the surface increases an increase of stream flow potentially causing aquifer water recharge did not result in a dilution of emerging contaminants as initially expected instead it promoted their widespread distribution across the alluvial aquifer resulting in the detection of selected pharmaceuticals in wells as deep as 123 m as a matter of fact pollution transfer to deeper wells due to water recharge took place in the southeastern part of the aquifer where transmissivity values are high and where groundwater has a better quality and therefore where groundwater is extracted for urban supply water management should focus on eliminating groundwater quality threats such as untreated wastewater discharges and its use for irrigation and should consider further treatment in existing wwtps concentration of organic contaminants in wells situated in the northeastern part with less permeable materials and a greater hydraulic gradient remain very low or under detection limits in essence when the aquifer recharge process from the surface is delayed either by a thick vadose zone or due to the presence of poorly permeable materials pollutants that are more susceptible to degradation do not reach the water table at detectable concentrations finally the importance of the anthropogenic factor cannot be ignored as evidenced by the opposite seasonal tendency regarding frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals and herbicides typical pesticide application periods can explain the appearance of herbicides in march and their frequency detection decrease in june the increase of urban water demand potentially due to growth of tourism in summer can also explain a higher frequency of detection of pharmaceuticals and drugs of abuse in june in both surface water and groundwater intensification of irrigation should also be considered as a potential path of entry of urban organic contaminants treated and untreated urban wastewater is released to streams from which water is diverted for irrigation and also discharged directly into irrigation channels and ditches the hydrodynamic context in the study area drives the greatest changes between seasons in the southeastern part of the aquifer where transmissivity values are greater further research will focus on these zones and will require conducting more frequent monitoring work over time to better characterize this phenomenon research funds will be more efficiently spent by monitoring just the most frequent compounds detected in this

3268,in this research work an implementation of the gridded flash flood guidance ffg method is conducted for the prediction and evaluation of flash floods in greece the ffg system is a well established early warning system ews for the estimation of flash flood threats especially in small ungauged basins where flash floods are the most dominant form of flooding first an overview of the gridded ffg system is conducted where all computations are performed at grid level the methodology applied consists of the derivation of the threshold rainfall referred to as the ffg the catastrophic flash flood event that occurred on the 15th of november 2017 and caused the loss of 24 human lives and extensive economic damage within the mandra settlement in the attica region in greece is used to assess the lead time provided by the system finally a sensitivity analysis is performed regarding the two main aspects of the system i e the threshold runoff and the estimation of the soil moisture conditions and their impact on the generated lead times results show that the most crucial aspect of the system is the soil moisture conditions since in wet conditions a 10 deviation on a scale from zero to one can result in a complete time step loss of the possibilities provided lead time while in dry conditions the deviation is much larger finally concerning the studied event results show that if the system was operational and the forecasted rainfall matched the values of the actual rainfall at least a five hour lead time warning could have been issued based on the results of the system keywords flash flood guidance gridded ffg flood threshold maps greece sarantapotamos mandra 1 introduction flood floods are currently among the deadliest weather related hazards worldwide they differ from typical river based floods mainly on their generation mechanism which is characterized by extreme precipitation in a short period of time flash floods are usually considered local events as they are highly related to convective type storms and thus the spatial coverage of the affected areas is reduced houze jr et al 2015 factors that contribute to flash flooding besides high rain intensity and its spatiotemporal structure are the geomorphological and geological characteristics of the basin such as the basin size and slope the poor infiltration capacity of soils and the soil moisture conditions at the start of the event houze jr et al 2015 merz and blöschl 2003 velásquez et al 2020 moreover factors such as high sediment generation and transportation which are related to high rain intensity especially in after burned or on ongoing land development areas can have the effect of altering the rivers cross sections dimensions resulting in deviation of the rivers natural way path and flooding of areas outside the riverbed uncontrolled urbanization and deforestation are among the first causes behind flash flooding on a local scale while climate change effects such as the increasing occurrence and rain intensity of storm events have altered the periodicity of extreme events alfieri et al 2012 caloiero et al 2017 gaur and simonovic 2015 rogger et al 2017 all the above factors have made flash flooding an evolving threat since areas that once did not flood are now prone to flooding bournas and baltas 2021a in the mediterranean flash floods have recently caused huge economic damages and the cost of human lives diakakis et al 2019 2012 feloni 2019 pereira et al 2017 spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2019 mitigation measures against flash flooding are not easy to implement since the locality of the events is hard to predict an early warning systems ews is a non structural mitigation measure which aims for the accurate and in time identification of these extreme events the two cornerstones for the implementation of an early warning systems ews are a the identification of areas that are vulnerable to flooding and b the identification of the weather systems that produce these extreme events in a reasonable lead time spyrou et al 2020 while the first can be achieved by the study of historic events and multi criteria analysis feloni et al 2020 the latter is considered the most crucial and high uncertainty parameter the forecasting of weather on an adequate spatial and temporal scale for use in issuing flood warnings is a still ongoing challenge ews can be categorized into two main categories rainfall based and flow based systems rainfall based systems compare current and forecasted weather conditions and issue warnings based on either historical event analysis or rainfall runoff simulations over selected areas flow based systems make use of either simple stage water measurements to sophisticated rainfall runoff modeling and hydraulic analysis which are usually an expansion of rainfall based systems however these systems are usually data demanding for both calibration and simulation purposes thus extended forecast in time is limited if data are unavailable the rainfall based system cannot predict the exact time and place of where flooding may occur but they are more cost effective and therefore can be easier applied and maintained suhardi et al 2020 nevertheless since the uncertainty of the rainfall input is the most crucial parameter in all cases in flash floods where the time scales are small and at high rainfall return periods a rainfall based system can be as reliable as the flow based system corral et al 2019 the use of well calibrated weather radar quantitative precipitation estimates is usually a key component of accurate and effective ews especially new x band weather radar systems which feature increased spatial and temporal scales anagnostou et al 2018 2010 borga et al 2011 picciotti et al 2013 among the first and most cited flash flood warning systems is the flash flood guidance ffg system developed by the us national weather service nws and operationally implemented by the hydrological research center hrc in the usa the system consists of three main components the threshold runoff component the hydrological model and the ffg computations the first is a pre process of the system and its main purpose is the derivation of the threshold runoff in predetermined areas above which minor flooding occurs the hydrological model is used to provide the soil moistures conditions before and during the rainfall event the final component consists of the derivation of the ffg defined as a rainfall threshold value that will produce the threshold runoff for the current soil moisture conditions douinot et al 2016 georgakakos 2006 1986 hapuarachchi et al 2011 norbiato et al 2008 this value the ffg is then compared with the forecasted rainfall of the same accumulation period if the forecasted value is higher than the ffg then flooding will occur and thus a warning should be issued there have been numerous studies concerning the various components of the system such as methods for calculating the threshold runoff carpenter et al 1999 kim and bae 2006 reed et al 2002 but the majority have dealt with the hydrological model concerning the structure the calibration and validation of the model anderson 2002 carpenter et al 1999 finnerty et al 1997 gupta et al 1998 norbiato et al 2009 2008 moreover different implementations of the system have been devised concerning the spatial resolution of the generated results such as the lumped ffg lffg sweeney 1992 the flash potential index ffpi smith 2003 the gridded flash flood guidance gffg schmidt et al 2007 and the distributed flash flood guidance dffg clark et al 2014 finally studies that have validated the model to assess the success rate on historical events report that while overall the system performed well improvements would be possible through field measurements and better calibration of the system norbiato et al 2009 patsinghasanee et al 2017 seo and breidenbach 2002 the system has also been applied worldwide with implementations of the system in south africa turkey india as well as southeast europe among others georgakakos et al 2022 overall the ffg system is easy to understand and implement does not require high temporal and tuned hydrological modeling and therefore is considered a practical means of improving flash flood warnings georgakakos et al 2022 hapuarachchi et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 in europe the european flood awareness system efas thielen et al 2009 is being operational which mainly provides with river flood warning with flash flood warnings being only recently available through the europe runoff index based on climatology eric raynaud et al 2015 however since flash events are local events there have been numerous ews applications such as the ff ews system corral et al 2009 which operates in spain and the schapi in france javelle et al 2016 which are based on each country available datasets e g weather radar datasets or specific flow measurement sites and its orography in greece the products of the efas and eric systems have limited value since greece lacks the needed spatial and temporal scale of datasets and by being disconnected with central europe cannot make use of other countries datasets such as weather radar measurements and forecasting products moreover the characteristics of rainfall in greece differ from that of central europe and thus a local approach is advised greece is characterized by its diverse orography huge coastline and numerous prone to flash flooding small basins flash floods are becoming a constant threat in greece since not only there has been an increase in their frequency angelakis et al 2020 diakakis et al 2012 flaounas et al 2016 but also recent flash flood events have highlighted the vulnerability of greece s basins towards flash flooding feloni et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 in the wake of recent significant flood events various attempts have been made to provide a complete forecasting and nowcasting system spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 2019 however an operational or statewide ews is still missing since research to operation of complex systems is a challenging task georgakakos et al 2022 2021 and instead any flood threat information provided is mainly only through daily forecast reports issued by the states national hellenic meteorological service nmms that lack the needed temporal and spatial information to deal with flash floods in this study an implementation of the gffg method is performed for a peri urban basin in greece furthermore a flash flood event is simulated to assess the system s ability to provide warnings with adequate lead times a sensitivity analysis is finally being conducted concerning two main aspects of the system the soil moisture and the threshold runoff and examine their impact on the provided lead time 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area the study area is the sarantapotamos river basin as seen in fig 1 which lies in the west area of the attica region in greece the basin is surrounded by the mountains kithairon pastras parnitha and pateras in the northwest north northeast and west accordingly while the outlet of the basin is the elefsis gulf in the southeast the sarantapotmaos river springs lie at the kithairon mountain from where it eventually flows through the valley of inoi and then southeast to be joined by its main sub stream ag vlassios before it reaches the attiki odos motorway this is the rural section of the basin that covers the majority of the basin at approximately 70 from there on the river flows through the thriasion plain an industrialized area before it converges with the streams routed from the mandra settlement and discharges into the sea the mandra subbasin which consists of the ag aikaterini and soures subbasins is notable for the extreme flash flood event that occurred on the 15 november 2017 and caused extreme flooding within the settlement and the surrounding areas with huge infrastructure damages and the loss of 24 human lives diakakis et al 2019 feloni et al 2019 pereira et al 2017 varlas et al 2019 the cause of this flood was mainly the extreme rainfall intensity that occurred on mount pateras in conjunction with the violent disruption of the stream s natural way paths due to the uncontrolled urbanization of the region i e the bad urban plan and expansion of the mandra settlement as well as constructions that replaced or obstructed the streams natural way paths overall sarantapotamos is a well defined peri urban basin since distinctive rural and urban parts are identified both prone to flash flooding the rural part is mostly forest based especially in the higher elevations while limited agricultural activity is found in the plains of inoi on the other hand the southern part of the basin which consists of the mandra magoula elefsis settlements and the thriassion plain is highly urbanized 2 2 data used the geomorphological analysis of the basin is performed using a digital elevation model dem provided by the national cadaster mapping agency s a the dem features a high resolution 5 m 5 m grid elevation dataset with a geometric accuracy of the product of rmsez 2 00 m and an absolute accuracy less than 3 92 m for a 95 confidence level for local implementation purposes the analysis is performed in the hellenic geodetic reference system 1987 also known as greek grid ggrs87 to calculate the soil conservation service scs curve number cn the most recent corine land cover of 2018 clc 2018 dataset was used in conjunction with the hydrologic soil group maps which were created for the results of the flood risk management plans for the attica river basin district by the ministry of environment energy and climate change ssw meecc 2018 the intensity duration curves idf used in the analysis were derived in the course of the flood risk management plans for greece by the ministry of environment energy and climate change ssw meecc 2017 finally regarding the studied flash flood event that occurred on 15 november 2017 herein referred to as the mandra event the mean area precipitation calculated over the soures subbasin as shown in fig 2 based on the work of varlas varlas et al 2019 and diakakis diakakis et al 2019 who made use of the national observatory of athens noa x band polarimetric radar xpol rainfall estimates while both the ag aikaterini and soures subbasin mean precipitation were available both subbasins are of relatively small size i e 20 km2 each and thus it is expected that the use of any mean area precipitation estimate would produce the same flood threat estimate the above dataset was used not only as real time measurements but as forecasted rainfall fields of pre determined accumulation periods of 1 3 and 6 h as well finally regarding the initial soil moisture conditions of the study area based on the antecedent precipitation index api of the event it was found that near saturated conditions were present diakakis et al 2019 3 methodology ffg is the depth of rain over a specified area of a given accumulation period and soil moisture conditions which will cause minor flooding a flow chart of an ews that utilizes the concept of the ffg is shown in fig 3 the system can be divided into three components the threshold runoff component the hydrological model and the ffg calculations the first two are independent components and can be customized accordingly while the latter one combines the two into producing the ffg values which are then compared with the forecasted rainfall fields the system therefore does not include forecasting or nowcasting calculations but links them up with the hydrological conditions of the monitored areas 3 1 threshold runoff component the threshold runoff component is a pre process of the system which involves the geomorphological analysis of the study area and its delineation into smaller units the product of this analysis is a gridded dataset of threshold runoff i e the runoff value that will cause minor flooding that will be used in the ffg calculations first the delineation of the study area into smaller units must be performed the delineation of the area can be achieved through two main methods the first one used in the original ffg system is by delineating the study area into subbasins of sizes 200 2000 km2 and calculating the threshold runoff for each subbasin based on geomorphological characteristics carpenter et al 1999 georgakakos 2006 ntelekos et al 2006 this threshold runoff is then set the same for the entire subbasin before it is being interpolated into grids that match the coordinate system of the rainfall field dataset that will be used in the ews e g the weather radar grid the method applied in this study is the gffg schmidt et al 2007 where all analysis is performed in grids rather than in subbasins where the delineation process can be troublesome and inaccurate when a large study area is defined moreover since the result is a gridded dataset by performing all calculations in grids the implementation is much easier to be performed and maintained furthermore the method provides the advantage of adjusting the grid dimensions into the desired size and therefore can increase the spatial detail of the calculations when finer spatial scale datasets are available for better application purposes a grid size that matches the grid size of the forecasted rainfall field is usually used typical operational meteorological and atmospheric forecasting models feature from four to eight km2 while some research efforts to increase the spatial resolution to two km2 finer resolutions can be obtained either through spatial downscaling processes spyrou et al 2020 or through nowcasting products based on weather radar measurements for instance x band weather radar features high resolutions of as low as 100 m 100 m bournas and baltas 2020 however in this case the forecasting area is reduced since x band radars feature usually up to 50 60 km scanning range and a radar network is required to extend the forecasting area and thus the forecasting period moreover in the current gffg application the rainfall runoff procedure included schmidt et al 2007 is not favorable to very fine grids since the hydrological processes are not optimized for such scales specifically each grid is treated as a separate subbasin where rainfall runoff is computed and therefore small grid cells would not work well typical grid sizes that have been used in ffg research vary from 1 km2 to 4 km2 matching the grid size of the forecasting field seo et al 2013 wasko et al 2021 zeng et al 2016 in this study considering the above limitations the subbasins size and available rainfall forecasting products in greece lagouvardos et al 2003 mariani et al 2015 papadopoulos et al 2002 varlas et al 2021 2020 a 1 km2 grid size was set to estimate the threshold runoff values the bankfull conditions are to be estimated in the original ffg method this can be achieved through the establishment of regional relationships concerning channel cross section parameters this method is better applied when the ffg system refers to subbasins rather than in grids that do not have a defined outlet therefore in the gffg the 2 year average recurrence interval ari i e the 50 annual exceedance probability aep of the discharge can be used carpenter et al 1999 reed et al 2002 provided that historic flow records are available and regional relationships can be established in ungauged basins where such records are absent to overcome the problem of establishing regional relationships a rainfall ari can be used instead and through rainfall runoff calculations estimate the desired 2 year discharge it is referenced that for flood events the 2 year discharge ari is highly related to the 5 year ari of rainfall erlingis et al 2013 schmidt et al 2007 although this is convenient variability in what is considered a flash flood as well as the actual flood vulnerability of the study area makes the one size fits all approach of the rainfall ari a factor to consider and therefore regional relationships or spatial variable aris should be used instead nevertheless in this study the 5 year rainfall ari is used as a good approximation for estimating the threshold value and a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the uncertainty generated in the lead times provided the rainfall ari can be easily estimated from idf curves which have been derived for selected stations in greece within and nearby the study area two stations are found the elefsis and mandra station shown in fig 1 the rainfall runoff transformation applied is the scs triangular unit hydrograph method in conjunction with the scs cn method to estimate the rainfall losses due to its simplicity and good application in greece bournas and baltas 2021b myronidis and ioannou 2019 3 2 hydrological model the second component involves the soil moisture accounting model i e the hydrological simulations which are performed continuously to estimate the initial soil moisture conditions before the ffg calculations since soil moisture conditions do not change as fast in time as rainfall input the model can be designed to run in predetermined temporal scales of 6 h 12 h or even daily which is subject to the availability of datasets and the desired uncertainty involved the hydrological model is run continuously thus rainfall and evapotranspiration inputs are required while snow modeling calculations should be included in areas where snow and snow melting occur the desired output of the model is the soil moisture state which is defined by either the values of the models state variables and parameters or by an output e g a simple moisture percentage value the spatial resolution of the model is usually but not always configured to match the one in the threshold runoff component therefore a lumped a semi lumped or a fully distributed model can be used in most cases a conceptual model is used since the delineation of the study area usually results in numerous ungauged basins where the determination of the model parameters is hindered by the lack of streamflow data in this study implementation of a continuously simulating hydrological model is not performed but it is assumed that an output of percentage soil moisture will be available in each time interval the implementation of the current soil moisture conditions into the threshold runoff calculations is being done with the use of an adjudgment on the default cn values the default cn values can be calculated through the association of the hydrological soil group the land use and table values at grid level these values correspond for antecedent moisture condition ii amc ii i e medium saturated conditions while for completely dry conditions amc i or wet conditions amc iii an empirical equation is used instead to incorporate the percentage of soil moisture conditions into the cn value it is assumed that amc ii conditions denote 50 soil moisture while amc i and amc iii correspond to 0 and 100 soil moisture accordingly therefore for each cn value a linear relationship is defined between completely dry i e 0 soil moisture and wet i e 100 soil moisture conditions as seen in fig 4 for a calculated amc ii cn value of 50 0 soil moisture would adjust the cn value into the value of 30 while in wet conditions i e 100 soil moisture the value would be 70 based on fig 4 it is noticeable that for middle cn values e g 50 the span between the amc ii amc i and amc iii conditions is at the maximum whereas for very high or low cn values e g a cn value of over 90 the span is much smaller and therefore the soil moisture percentage will have a limited effect this is logical since in high cn values where areas are near impervious high runoff is expected regardless of the soil moisture percentage 3 3 flash flood guidance computations the third component is the ffg computations which are used to calculate the current ffg value based on the threshold runoff value and the current soil moisture conditions at each grid the calculations are performed for the accumulation periods of 1 3 and 6 h where inverse rainfall runoff modeling is involved i e the rainfall value the ffg is calculated as the amount of rainfall that will produce the threshold runoff for the current soil moisture conditions in fig 5 an example of the relationship between the ffg values and the threshold runoff in rainfall units is seen for different soil moisture conditions the ffg value is expected to be lower when the current soil moisture conditions are high this is rephrased as the amount of rainfall needed to flood the ffg is less when the soil moisture percentage is high for instance based on fig 5 for a rainfall threshold volume of 30 mm the ffg is only 20 mm ffg when the soil moisture is 90 thus if 20 mm of rainfall falls within three hours and the soil is 90 saturated minor flooding will occur on the selected grid whereas if the soil moisture conditions are at 50 then 30 mm will have to fall to cause flooding for every grid and accumulation period a single ffg value is calculated and then compared with the forecasted rainfall value of the same duration if the input rainfall exceeds the ffg value then flooding over that area is expected and a warning should be issued while the difference of these two values can produce an estimate of how big the threat of flooding is the system is deterministic and therefore it ultimately only reports whether flood will occur or not if a grid floods for just a few millimeters or many it still counts as a flooded cell and is flagged for warning to overcome this issue and further assist with the decision making the calculation of ffg values for different rainfall accumulation periods is performed lower accumulation periods as a product of rainfall forecasting tend to have the least uncertainty involved but the provided lead time can be short for effective civilian warning and anti flood measures action on the other hand longer durations lead to larger lead times but higher uncertainty is involved moreover it is essential to notice that the system does not provide flash flood predictions but rather that a threat is imminent for instance when a longer accumulation period is used the system only reports if a flood threat is imminent within that period and not when or where therefore it is essential to analyze the results of the system before warnings are issued 4 results and discussion 4 1 derivation of threshold maps in the implementation of the gffg system the first component is the derivation of the threshold runoff the threshold runoff is to be estimated using the 5 year rainfall ari within the study area only two stations are located with known idf curves the elefsis and mandra stations the total amount of rainfall for a 5 year return period is calculated for different rainfall durations shown in fig 6 for each rainfall accumulation period used in the system i e the 1 3 and 6 h the idf rainfall values are interpolated into designated grids of 1 km 1 km dimensions using the inverse distance weighting idw algorithm the calculation of the threshold runoff is then performed through the methodology beforementioned the cn amc ii value and the slope percentage of each cell which are the two most important factors of runoff generation are shown in fig 7 the result is the generation of the threshold runoff maps which are converted into threshold rainfall maps as shown in fig 8 by applying the same methodology as the ffg for fixed soil moisture conditions the values of the plots indicate how much rainfall volume is necessary to fall within each grid for a designated period to cause minor flooding therefore low values of rainfall indicate that it is much easier for a grid to be flooded by locating these low threshold values with the cn and slope maps shown in fig 7 it is obvious that they are correlated with the areas where the corresponding cn is high i e the runoff potential is high or where the slope values are low these areas are mainly the industrial areas in the southeast at the thriasion plain and at the north where low slopes indicate the location of the inoi valley the effect of soil moisture conditions in the ffg generation is shown in fig 9 where the ffg of a 3 hour accumulation period is displayed for two scenarios the amc ii and amc iii which correspond to the 50 and 100 soil moisture conditions as seen the threshold values are reduced dramatically when the amc iii full saturated conditions are used and therefore flooding is easier to be achieved grids cells that are located in the southeast as stated earlier have high default cn values i e the urban cells and therefore a smaller change is observed when wet conditions are met performing the threshold calculations for each rainfall accumulation period and different soil moisture conditions i e amc i ii and iii the corresponding threshold values for all grids can be seen in the boxplot shown in fig 10 when dry conditions are present i e amc i conditions the variability of the ffg values within the study area is high approximately 60 mm between the lowest and highest value in all durations while in amc iii conditions this variability is significantly smaller at approximately only 20 mm this underlines that the uncertainty involved in the ffg calculations is much higher when low soil moisture conditions are present moreover the mean threshold value of all grids typically drops as more wet conditions are met but not at the same rate for the 3 h duration the mean threshold value in dry conditions is 75 mm while for normal and wet conditions the mean value drops to 40 and 22 mm this result of course is basin specific since the default cn values of the grids vary and high cn values will not alter significantly with soil moisture conditions as seen in fig 4 4 2 simulation of the mandra event the proposed methodology is applied to the mandra subbasins the soures and ag aikaterini subbasins as shown in fig 12 along with the corresponding grid delineation the mean area precipitation over the area is used as input rainfall for all grids while the soil moisture conditions are assumed as near saturated at 90 in fig 11 the precipitation time series for each forecasted rainfall accumulation period of 1 3 and 6 h while in fig 13 the expected flooded grids are shown in red for each time interval of the event per accumulation period a summary of the results is also shown in table 1 where the number and the corresponding percentage of the area that is flooded are reported concerning the forecasted accumulation periods shown in fig 11 the value which is used at each timestep is the sum of the next 1 3 or 6 values according to the accumulation period used for instance at timestep 15 11 0 00 the 6 hour value is the sum of the next six hours while the 3 hour value includes the sum of the next three hours in fig 13 the timestep of each figure indicates the result at the referenced period when a different rainfall accumulation period has been used before the result for instance the 6 hour figure with the 14 11 21 00 timestep shows which cells flood at 14 11 21 00 when a 6 hour forecast has been applied six hours earlier commenting on the summary shown in table 1 the first time that grids are flagged for flood is at the 14 11 17 00 timestep where only six grids are flagged while on the next time interval the number increases to 24 i e 36 of the basin these grids are located on the bottom right area where the mandra settlement is found and have high runoff potential since they feature high cn values at timestep 14 11 20 00 flooding is observed for almost all cells with the 6 hour forecast while in the 14 11 21 00 timestep flooding of 25 of the basin is also observed with the 3 hour forecast at the 15 11 01 00 timestep all cells flood with both the 3 and 6 hour forecasts while the 1 hour forecast flags for flooding only at the 15 11 03 00 timestep where 33 of the basin is flagged finally at the 15 11 04 00 timestep all forecasts report 100 of grids flagged for flood this sudden increase of the number of cells flooding is caused by the forecasted precipitation series where low rainfall is recorded at the start of the event but increases rapidly at 32 and 58 mm in timesteps 15 11 04 00 to 15 11 05 00 these last two rainfall inputs are higher than any ffg value calculated in the region and therefore any forecast that includes these two values results in flooding all cells while the 6 hour forecast provides a 6 hour lead time in real time conditions such long forecasts are subject to higher uncertainty and are better suited in large basins therefore it is more logical to use a smaller duration to decrease the uncertainty involved and increase the accuracy of the warnings moreover when at a specified time step only a few grids indicate flooding it is most likely that a warning over the entire region would not be issued unless sensitive infrastructure is located within therefore a basin percentage threshold can be determined where it is almost certain that extended flooding within the basin will cause extended flood damages by utilizing a threshold where when 30 of the basin is flagged a warning should be issued and since the peak discharge of the generated hydrograph was estimated to be at 5 40 of november 15 diakakis et al 2019 it can be said that at timestep 14 11 22 00 with the 3 hour forecast reporting 34 of the basin being flooded an overall lead time of seven hours could have been provided by the system by applying a more conservative threshold e g 60 of the basin being flooded before a warning is issued this lead time would have been five hours at time step 15 11 01 00 while by utilizing only the 1 hour forecast where the rainfall forecast uncertainty is at the lowest at least one hour or two hours in urban areas the lead time would have been provided provided that rainfall forecasts matched the observed values these lead times are deemed more than enough to trigger an alarm and direct the civil protection authorities to start mitigation measures such as news broadcasting warnings road redirections and on site monitoring 4 3 sensitivity analysis in this chapter we examine the impact of specific aspects of the system and their impact on the calculated lead times these aspects are the estimated threshold runoff values and the soil moisture conditions used in the ffg calculations first we address the threshold runoff estimation the methodology followed made use of the 5 year rainfall ari which through the use of the scs triangular hydrograph method calculated the threshold runoff this runoff an estimate of the 2 year discharge ari although it is usually considered adequate for use with the gffg system is subject to uncertainty especially when streamflow data are unavailable therefore to examine the impact of the 5 year rainfall ari we examine a range of rainfall aris and specifically 2 10 and 20 year rainfall aris based on the idf curves the percentage change between the 5 year set as the base value and the 2 10 and 20 year total rainfall is approximate 25 21 and 45 accordingly in table 2 the summary of the calculations i e the percentage of grids that are flooded is displayed for each case it is shown that the number of grids that eventually flood at each timestep is reduced when a higher rainfall return period is used the main differences are seen in the early time steps where the forecasted rainfalls are low or near the threshold concerning the 6 hour forecast at timestep 14 11 19 00 by using the 5 year ari a 52 of the cells are flooded while by using the 2 year nearly all grids i e 85 are flooded and by using the 10 and 20 year aris on 30 of the cells flood the results on the 3 hour forecast are similar to the 6 hour overall while some differences are found especially in the early stages of the event and between two following timesteps the system is deemed not as sensitive to this change while 85 of grids flooding is much larger than 52 by examining the previous and following time step the difference is negligible thus one can argue that in the worst case the loss of lead time is approximately one timestep moreover this difference is observed only on the low values which is most likely on the values that are close to the threshold values due to the system being deterministic and providing boolean answers i e flood or not flood such small differences subject to uncertainty cannot be eradicated overall the 5 year ari is considered viable since it follows literature as well as the fact that flash flood events are usually observed for rainfall return periods as low as two or five to ten years for a more in depth analysis and better approximation of the threshold runoff an analysis of historic rainfall events because of minor flooding should be conducted to evaluate the best rainfall ari for each grid in an implementation of the ews system the selection of different rainfall ari can be described as adjusting the threshold sensitivity of the system by selecting a higher rainfall ari the system is being less sensitive and thus would provide warnings for only the higher precipitation volumes for the same soil moisture conditions this application can be extended within one study area where specific areas that are deemed crucial can be calibrated with the use of low rainfall aris to make the system more sensitive in these particular areas and the opposite in areas of no interest such as in high elevation areas with no human activities the second parameter which is deemed crucial is the amount of soil moisture percentage used in the ffg calculations soil moisture conditions are related to the cn value through an adjudgment based on the soil moisture percentage reported by the hydrological model based on fig 4 the amc i and amc iii differences are at their maximum when the default cn value is 50 for soil moisture percentage at 50 the adjusted value retains the value 50 while for soil moisture 0 and 100 for completely dry and saturated soils the value is adjusted into 30 and 70 accordingly therefore high uncertainty is involved in grids where the cn amc ii value is near the value of 50 which is common for rural areas whereas cn values in urban areas are usually high values of 80 or more and thus the adjustment is significantly smaller in the base scenario saturated conditions of 90 soil moisture were assumed we conduct the same ffg simulations using a 100 80 and 50 soil moisture conditions percentage the results are shown in table 3 it is observed that by using a lower soil moisture percentage condition the number of grids that flood can dramatically change it is observed that there is a total of 10 fewer grids that flood when setting a 90 soil moisture from 100 especially in the early stages where rainfall intensity has not reached its peak specifically while assuming total wet conditions i e 100 soil moisture the 3 hour forecast estimates flooding for 90 of the basin at timestep 14 11 22 00 while by assuming 90 soil moisture this percentage drops to only 34 however the 90 moisture results are found similar to the 80 which shows that the difference at this stage is not that high on the other hand when the lower 50 soil moisture is used the number of flooded grids drops significantly even in the 15 11 01 00 timestep when the entire basin is flagged for flood in the other cases only 28 is flagged the 28 consists of the grids that have high cn values i e in the urban areas where the actual soil moisture conditions have little impact on the rainfall runoff transformation finally the 6 hours forecasts have similar results with the 3 h forecast for the particular event since high soil moisture conditions were present based on the 5 day api and therefore soil moisture above 80 was expected the forecasting lead time drop is approximately one hour per 10 soil moisture difference in the 6 hour forecast a 100 soil moisture would flag the entire basin at timestep 14 11 20 00 while by assuming a 90 and 80 soil moisture the flagging of the entire basin is delayed by one and two hours later accordingly in the 3 hr forecast the entire basin is flagged for flooding with the 100 soil moisture conditions at the 14 11 22 00 timestep while in the rest of cases this does not occur before timestep 15 11 01 00 i e 3 h later these findings are related to the nature of the studied event which features a significant increase of rainfall within one hour at two timesteps however this analysis highlights the importance of the hydrological model output concerning the derivation of the soil moisture conditions moreover although the quality concerning the soil moisture percentage is crucial the temporal availability of these datasets is also deemed important in all simulations the soil moisture conditions were assumed as static in time whereas they are continuously changing into saturation as rainfall begins in flash flood events as in the studied event this change can happen in a very short amount of time thus a hydrological model that reports soil moisture conditions in a 6 hour time frame will most likely fail to report the correct amount of soil moisture at small time intervals to address this issue it is suggested that a second hydrological model calibrated to run specifically in higher temporal scales under flood conditions be applied during the event to provide a high temporal scale of soil moisture conditions bournas and baltas 2021a this approach can also be used in conjunction with satellite based soil moisture products which while they lack the needed temporal and spatial resolution can be used as a good estimate of the initial conditions as well as for calibration and validation of the hydrological model provided that proper downscaling and assimilation processes are applied overall as highlighted in this study the ffg is a versatile system that can be easily customized and configured to provide accurate warnings which is essential for mitigating flash flood threats any limitations of the system lie mostly in the research to operational application and specifically data availability considering data quality and resolution which control the main uncertainties of the system from calibration to validation and operation the method applied due to its simplicity and easy applicability and fast processing can be used either as a basin vulnerability analysis through the estimation of the ffg the threshold rainfall or either as a first stop monitoring tool to provide the basis of other more sophisticated systems spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 that incorporate distributed rainfall runoff processes to provide with detailed inundation maps in this case since most ews rely on the same datasets i e soil moisture and rainfall field forecasts a data assimilation process or a calibration and validation scheme where each model feeds the other with information can be established in order to reduce uncertainty generated through the models own procedures 5 conclusions in this research work an application and evaluation of the gffg system were performed for a peri urban basin in greece an ews based on rainfall thresholds has the advantage of being easy to implement and maintain the system uses a hydrometeorological approach for detecting areas where minor flooding will occur by comparing current and forecasted rainfall fields with the corresponding threshold referred to as the ffg the gridded format has the advantage of being versatile since the grid size can be configured according to the scale of the rainfall forecast thus providing increased spatial and temporal resolution in this application the soil moisture conditions are incorporated by applying a simple algorithm to adjust the cn value based on a soil moisture percentage finally three threshold maps were created one for each of the 1 3 and 6 hour rainfall accumulation periods which are the most used forecasting periods the generated threshold maps of the sarantapotamos river basin show high variability for each of the different rainfall accumulation periods and soil moisture schemes used areas with high cn values and low slopes are highlighted by their low threshold values i e less rainfall is needed for these areas to flood moreover the effect of soil moisture conditions is also deemed crucial where it is found that when dry conditions are met higher uncertainty is expected in the computations the mean 3 hour rainfall accumulation threshold value for the entire basin in dry conditions is 75 mm while for normal and wet conditions the mean value drops to 40 mm and 22 mm overall the results are deemed logical and agree with similar research works the system was then applied for the mandra event that occurred on the 15th of november 2017 to assess the possible lead time that could have been provided results show that if the system was operational and the forecasted rainfall matched the values of the actual rainfall using the moderate 3 hr forecast 30 of the mandra subbasin including the urban areas would have been issued for warning with at least a seven hour lead time the majority of the basin using the 3 hr forecast would be flagged for flooding five hours ahead showing a strong indication that flood is imminent downstream although these results are subject to uncertainty involving the true state of the soil moisture conditions prior the event and the actual rainfall forecasts an experienced forecaster monitoring the event would have issued based on the results of the system at least two hours lead time warning by utilizing the 1 hr forecast furthermore a sensitivity analysis was then performed to examine the impact incorporating different rainfall ari and the soil moisture conditions to the threshold runoff estimation and the generated lead times regarding the first it is found that no significant changes are observed in the provided lead times when lower or higher rainfall aris are used specifically by incorporating a two and a ten year ari a one timestep loss i e one hour can be identified in the early stages and therefore the system is not that sensitive in this parameter especially in the extremes where high amount of rainfall is expected any differences observed are at some grids where the forecasted values matched the ffg values therefore the exploration of incorporating a spatially variable rainfall ari based either on the analysis of historic events or the flood vulnerability of selected grids is advised to optimize the system output regarding the impact of the soil moisture conditions it is found that the system is quite sensitive to this parameter and therefore a good approximation of it is deemed essential in wet conditions a 10 deviation of the soil moisture value can lead to at least one hour of lead time loss while the problem is expanded in the medium and dry conditions where flood threat cannot be reached unless very high amount of precipitation is detected since the soil moisture conditions often dictate whether an area or grid is flagged for flooding or not this highlights the need of updating the soil moisture conditions at finer time intervals as suggested in literature although this effect is more prominent to occur on events that feature in modest rainfall events close to the threshold values or short storm durations prior to dry conditions whereas in high rainfall events or in near saturated prior conditions this effect is reduced therefore it is suggested not only to have a properly calibrated soil moisture accounting model but also to perform the needed calculations in high temporal scales since data collection tends to become better spatial and temporal scaled so must the respected models to that end a hydrological model calibrated to simulate at high temporal scales during flash floods events could be an improvement of the gffg system overall as highlighted in this study the ffg is a versatile system that can be easily customized and configured to provide with accurate warnings which is essential for mitigating flash flood threats however an ews is as good as the forecasted rainfall input thus increased attention should be given to the forecasting and nowcasting procedures when applying a well established ews in a new study area while the ability of the forecasters to correctly intrepid the results of the system is also important nevertheless the impact of the gffg as an ews in mitigating flash flood threats is undeniable and can be considered as first stop valuable asset against natural disasters which civil protection agencies ought to

3268,in this research work an implementation of the gridded flash flood guidance ffg method is conducted for the prediction and evaluation of flash floods in greece the ffg system is a well established early warning system ews for the estimation of flash flood threats especially in small ungauged basins where flash floods are the most dominant form of flooding first an overview of the gridded ffg system is conducted where all computations are performed at grid level the methodology applied consists of the derivation of the threshold rainfall referred to as the ffg the catastrophic flash flood event that occurred on the 15th of november 2017 and caused the loss of 24 human lives and extensive economic damage within the mandra settlement in the attica region in greece is used to assess the lead time provided by the system finally a sensitivity analysis is performed regarding the two main aspects of the system i e the threshold runoff and the estimation of the soil moisture conditions and their impact on the generated lead times results show that the most crucial aspect of the system is the soil moisture conditions since in wet conditions a 10 deviation on a scale from zero to one can result in a complete time step loss of the possibilities provided lead time while in dry conditions the deviation is much larger finally concerning the studied event results show that if the system was operational and the forecasted rainfall matched the values of the actual rainfall at least a five hour lead time warning could have been issued based on the results of the system keywords flash flood guidance gridded ffg flood threshold maps greece sarantapotamos mandra 1 introduction flood floods are currently among the deadliest weather related hazards worldwide they differ from typical river based floods mainly on their generation mechanism which is characterized by extreme precipitation in a short period of time flash floods are usually considered local events as they are highly related to convective type storms and thus the spatial coverage of the affected areas is reduced houze jr et al 2015 factors that contribute to flash flooding besides high rain intensity and its spatiotemporal structure are the geomorphological and geological characteristics of the basin such as the basin size and slope the poor infiltration capacity of soils and the soil moisture conditions at the start of the event houze jr et al 2015 merz and blöschl 2003 velásquez et al 2020 moreover factors such as high sediment generation and transportation which are related to high rain intensity especially in after burned or on ongoing land development areas can have the effect of altering the rivers cross sections dimensions resulting in deviation of the rivers natural way path and flooding of areas outside the riverbed uncontrolled urbanization and deforestation are among the first causes behind flash flooding on a local scale while climate change effects such as the increasing occurrence and rain intensity of storm events have altered the periodicity of extreme events alfieri et al 2012 caloiero et al 2017 gaur and simonovic 2015 rogger et al 2017 all the above factors have made flash flooding an evolving threat since areas that once did not flood are now prone to flooding bournas and baltas 2021a in the mediterranean flash floods have recently caused huge economic damages and the cost of human lives diakakis et al 2019 2012 feloni 2019 pereira et al 2017 spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2019 mitigation measures against flash flooding are not easy to implement since the locality of the events is hard to predict an early warning systems ews is a non structural mitigation measure which aims for the accurate and in time identification of these extreme events the two cornerstones for the implementation of an early warning systems ews are a the identification of areas that are vulnerable to flooding and b the identification of the weather systems that produce these extreme events in a reasonable lead time spyrou et al 2020 while the first can be achieved by the study of historic events and multi criteria analysis feloni et al 2020 the latter is considered the most crucial and high uncertainty parameter the forecasting of weather on an adequate spatial and temporal scale for use in issuing flood warnings is a still ongoing challenge ews can be categorized into two main categories rainfall based and flow based systems rainfall based systems compare current and forecasted weather conditions and issue warnings based on either historical event analysis or rainfall runoff simulations over selected areas flow based systems make use of either simple stage water measurements to sophisticated rainfall runoff modeling and hydraulic analysis which are usually an expansion of rainfall based systems however these systems are usually data demanding for both calibration and simulation purposes thus extended forecast in time is limited if data are unavailable the rainfall based system cannot predict the exact time and place of where flooding may occur but they are more cost effective and therefore can be easier applied and maintained suhardi et al 2020 nevertheless since the uncertainty of the rainfall input is the most crucial parameter in all cases in flash floods where the time scales are small and at high rainfall return periods a rainfall based system can be as reliable as the flow based system corral et al 2019 the use of well calibrated weather radar quantitative precipitation estimates is usually a key component of accurate and effective ews especially new x band weather radar systems which feature increased spatial and temporal scales anagnostou et al 2018 2010 borga et al 2011 picciotti et al 2013 among the first and most cited flash flood warning systems is the flash flood guidance ffg system developed by the us national weather service nws and operationally implemented by the hydrological research center hrc in the usa the system consists of three main components the threshold runoff component the hydrological model and the ffg computations the first is a pre process of the system and its main purpose is the derivation of the threshold runoff in predetermined areas above which minor flooding occurs the hydrological model is used to provide the soil moistures conditions before and during the rainfall event the final component consists of the derivation of the ffg defined as a rainfall threshold value that will produce the threshold runoff for the current soil moisture conditions douinot et al 2016 georgakakos 2006 1986 hapuarachchi et al 2011 norbiato et al 2008 this value the ffg is then compared with the forecasted rainfall of the same accumulation period if the forecasted value is higher than the ffg then flooding will occur and thus a warning should be issued there have been numerous studies concerning the various components of the system such as methods for calculating the threshold runoff carpenter et al 1999 kim and bae 2006 reed et al 2002 but the majority have dealt with the hydrological model concerning the structure the calibration and validation of the model anderson 2002 carpenter et al 1999 finnerty et al 1997 gupta et al 1998 norbiato et al 2009 2008 moreover different implementations of the system have been devised concerning the spatial resolution of the generated results such as the lumped ffg lffg sweeney 1992 the flash potential index ffpi smith 2003 the gridded flash flood guidance gffg schmidt et al 2007 and the distributed flash flood guidance dffg clark et al 2014 finally studies that have validated the model to assess the success rate on historical events report that while overall the system performed well improvements would be possible through field measurements and better calibration of the system norbiato et al 2009 patsinghasanee et al 2017 seo and breidenbach 2002 the system has also been applied worldwide with implementations of the system in south africa turkey india as well as southeast europe among others georgakakos et al 2022 overall the ffg system is easy to understand and implement does not require high temporal and tuned hydrological modeling and therefore is considered a practical means of improving flash flood warnings georgakakos et al 2022 hapuarachchi et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 in europe the european flood awareness system efas thielen et al 2009 is being operational which mainly provides with river flood warning with flash flood warnings being only recently available through the europe runoff index based on climatology eric raynaud et al 2015 however since flash events are local events there have been numerous ews applications such as the ff ews system corral et al 2009 which operates in spain and the schapi in france javelle et al 2016 which are based on each country available datasets e g weather radar datasets or specific flow measurement sites and its orography in greece the products of the efas and eric systems have limited value since greece lacks the needed spatial and temporal scale of datasets and by being disconnected with central europe cannot make use of other countries datasets such as weather radar measurements and forecasting products moreover the characteristics of rainfall in greece differ from that of central europe and thus a local approach is advised greece is characterized by its diverse orography huge coastline and numerous prone to flash flooding small basins flash floods are becoming a constant threat in greece since not only there has been an increase in their frequency angelakis et al 2020 diakakis et al 2012 flaounas et al 2016 but also recent flash flood events have highlighted the vulnerability of greece s basins towards flash flooding feloni et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 in the wake of recent significant flood events various attempts have been made to provide a complete forecasting and nowcasting system spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 2019 however an operational or statewide ews is still missing since research to operation of complex systems is a challenging task georgakakos et al 2022 2021 and instead any flood threat information provided is mainly only through daily forecast reports issued by the states national hellenic meteorological service nmms that lack the needed temporal and spatial information to deal with flash floods in this study an implementation of the gffg method is performed for a peri urban basin in greece furthermore a flash flood event is simulated to assess the system s ability to provide warnings with adequate lead times a sensitivity analysis is finally being conducted concerning two main aspects of the system the soil moisture and the threshold runoff and examine their impact on the provided lead time 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area the study area is the sarantapotamos river basin as seen in fig 1 which lies in the west area of the attica region in greece the basin is surrounded by the mountains kithairon pastras parnitha and pateras in the northwest north northeast and west accordingly while the outlet of the basin is the elefsis gulf in the southeast the sarantapotmaos river springs lie at the kithairon mountain from where it eventually flows through the valley of inoi and then southeast to be joined by its main sub stream ag vlassios before it reaches the attiki odos motorway this is the rural section of the basin that covers the majority of the basin at approximately 70 from there on the river flows through the thriasion plain an industrialized area before it converges with the streams routed from the mandra settlement and discharges into the sea the mandra subbasin which consists of the ag aikaterini and soures subbasins is notable for the extreme flash flood event that occurred on the 15 november 2017 and caused extreme flooding within the settlement and the surrounding areas with huge infrastructure damages and the loss of 24 human lives diakakis et al 2019 feloni et al 2019 pereira et al 2017 varlas et al 2019 the cause of this flood was mainly the extreme rainfall intensity that occurred on mount pateras in conjunction with the violent disruption of the stream s natural way paths due to the uncontrolled urbanization of the region i e the bad urban plan and expansion of the mandra settlement as well as constructions that replaced or obstructed the streams natural way paths overall sarantapotamos is a well defined peri urban basin since distinctive rural and urban parts are identified both prone to flash flooding the rural part is mostly forest based especially in the higher elevations while limited agricultural activity is found in the plains of inoi on the other hand the southern part of the basin which consists of the mandra magoula elefsis settlements and the thriassion plain is highly urbanized 2 2 data used the geomorphological analysis of the basin is performed using a digital elevation model dem provided by the national cadaster mapping agency s a the dem features a high resolution 5 m 5 m grid elevation dataset with a geometric accuracy of the product of rmsez 2 00 m and an absolute accuracy less than 3 92 m for a 95 confidence level for local implementation purposes the analysis is performed in the hellenic geodetic reference system 1987 also known as greek grid ggrs87 to calculate the soil conservation service scs curve number cn the most recent corine land cover of 2018 clc 2018 dataset was used in conjunction with the hydrologic soil group maps which were created for the results of the flood risk management plans for the attica river basin district by the ministry of environment energy and climate change ssw meecc 2018 the intensity duration curves idf used in the analysis were derived in the course of the flood risk management plans for greece by the ministry of environment energy and climate change ssw meecc 2017 finally regarding the studied flash flood event that occurred on 15 november 2017 herein referred to as the mandra event the mean area precipitation calculated over the soures subbasin as shown in fig 2 based on the work of varlas varlas et al 2019 and diakakis diakakis et al 2019 who made use of the national observatory of athens noa x band polarimetric radar xpol rainfall estimates while both the ag aikaterini and soures subbasin mean precipitation were available both subbasins are of relatively small size i e 20 km2 each and thus it is expected that the use of any mean area precipitation estimate would produce the same flood threat estimate the above dataset was used not only as real time measurements but as forecasted rainfall fields of pre determined accumulation periods of 1 3 and 6 h as well finally regarding the initial soil moisture conditions of the study area based on the antecedent precipitation index api of the event it was found that near saturated conditions were present diakakis et al 2019 3 methodology ffg is the depth of rain over a specified area of a given accumulation period and soil moisture conditions which will cause minor flooding a flow chart of an ews that utilizes the concept of the ffg is shown in fig 3 the system can be divided into three components the threshold runoff component the hydrological model and the ffg calculations the first two are independent components and can be customized accordingly while the latter one combines the two into producing the ffg values which are then compared with the forecasted rainfall fields the system therefore does not include forecasting or nowcasting calculations but links them up with the hydrological conditions of the monitored areas 3 1 threshold runoff component the threshold runoff component is a pre process of the system which involves the geomorphological analysis of the study area and its delineation into smaller units the product of this analysis is a gridded dataset of threshold runoff i e the runoff value that will cause minor flooding that will be used in the ffg calculations first the delineation of the study area into smaller units must be performed the delineation of the area can be achieved through two main methods the first one used in the original ffg system is by delineating the study area into subbasins of sizes 200 2000 km2 and calculating the threshold runoff for each subbasin based on geomorphological characteristics carpenter et al 1999 georgakakos 2006 ntelekos et al 2006 this threshold runoff is then set the same for the entire subbasin before it is being interpolated into grids that match the coordinate system of the rainfall field dataset that will be used in the ews e g the weather radar grid the method applied in this study is the gffg schmidt et al 2007 where all analysis is performed in grids rather than in subbasins where the delineation process can be troublesome and inaccurate when a large study area is defined moreover since the result is a gridded dataset by performing all calculations in grids the implementation is much easier to be performed and maintained furthermore the method provides the advantage of adjusting the grid dimensions into the desired size and therefore can increase the spatial detail of the calculations when finer spatial scale datasets are available for better application purposes a grid size that matches the grid size of the forecasted rainfall field is usually used typical operational meteorological and atmospheric forecasting models feature from four to eight km2 while some research efforts to increase the spatial resolution to two km2 finer resolutions can be obtained either through spatial downscaling processes spyrou et al 2020 or through nowcasting products based on weather radar measurements for instance x band weather radar features high resolutions of as low as 100 m 100 m bournas and baltas 2020 however in this case the forecasting area is reduced since x band radars feature usually up to 50 60 km scanning range and a radar network is required to extend the forecasting area and thus the forecasting period moreover in the current gffg application the rainfall runoff procedure included schmidt et al 2007 is not favorable to very fine grids since the hydrological processes are not optimized for such scales specifically each grid is treated as a separate subbasin where rainfall runoff is computed and therefore small grid cells would not work well typical grid sizes that have been used in ffg research vary from 1 km2 to 4 km2 matching the grid size of the forecasting field seo et al 2013 wasko et al 2021 zeng et al 2016 in this study considering the above limitations the subbasins size and available rainfall forecasting products in greece lagouvardos et al 2003 mariani et al 2015 papadopoulos et al 2002 varlas et al 2021 2020 a 1 km2 grid size was set to estimate the threshold runoff values the bankfull conditions are to be estimated in the original ffg method this can be achieved through the establishment of regional relationships concerning channel cross section parameters this method is better applied when the ffg system refers to subbasins rather than in grids that do not have a defined outlet therefore in the gffg the 2 year average recurrence interval ari i e the 50 annual exceedance probability aep of the discharge can be used carpenter et al 1999 reed et al 2002 provided that historic flow records are available and regional relationships can be established in ungauged basins where such records are absent to overcome the problem of establishing regional relationships a rainfall ari can be used instead and through rainfall runoff calculations estimate the desired 2 year discharge it is referenced that for flood events the 2 year discharge ari is highly related to the 5 year ari of rainfall erlingis et al 2013 schmidt et al 2007 although this is convenient variability in what is considered a flash flood as well as the actual flood vulnerability of the study area makes the one size fits all approach of the rainfall ari a factor to consider and therefore regional relationships or spatial variable aris should be used instead nevertheless in this study the 5 year rainfall ari is used as a good approximation for estimating the threshold value and a sensitivity analysis is performed to assess the uncertainty generated in the lead times provided the rainfall ari can be easily estimated from idf curves which have been derived for selected stations in greece within and nearby the study area two stations are found the elefsis and mandra station shown in fig 1 the rainfall runoff transformation applied is the scs triangular unit hydrograph method in conjunction with the scs cn method to estimate the rainfall losses due to its simplicity and good application in greece bournas and baltas 2021b myronidis and ioannou 2019 3 2 hydrological model the second component involves the soil moisture accounting model i e the hydrological simulations which are performed continuously to estimate the initial soil moisture conditions before the ffg calculations since soil moisture conditions do not change as fast in time as rainfall input the model can be designed to run in predetermined temporal scales of 6 h 12 h or even daily which is subject to the availability of datasets and the desired uncertainty involved the hydrological model is run continuously thus rainfall and evapotranspiration inputs are required while snow modeling calculations should be included in areas where snow and snow melting occur the desired output of the model is the soil moisture state which is defined by either the values of the models state variables and parameters or by an output e g a simple moisture percentage value the spatial resolution of the model is usually but not always configured to match the one in the threshold runoff component therefore a lumped a semi lumped or a fully distributed model can be used in most cases a conceptual model is used since the delineation of the study area usually results in numerous ungauged basins where the determination of the model parameters is hindered by the lack of streamflow data in this study implementation of a continuously simulating hydrological model is not performed but it is assumed that an output of percentage soil moisture will be available in each time interval the implementation of the current soil moisture conditions into the threshold runoff calculations is being done with the use of an adjudgment on the default cn values the default cn values can be calculated through the association of the hydrological soil group the land use and table values at grid level these values correspond for antecedent moisture condition ii amc ii i e medium saturated conditions while for completely dry conditions amc i or wet conditions amc iii an empirical equation is used instead to incorporate the percentage of soil moisture conditions into the cn value it is assumed that amc ii conditions denote 50 soil moisture while amc i and amc iii correspond to 0 and 100 soil moisture accordingly therefore for each cn value a linear relationship is defined between completely dry i e 0 soil moisture and wet i e 100 soil moisture conditions as seen in fig 4 for a calculated amc ii cn value of 50 0 soil moisture would adjust the cn value into the value of 30 while in wet conditions i e 100 soil moisture the value would be 70 based on fig 4 it is noticeable that for middle cn values e g 50 the span between the amc ii amc i and amc iii conditions is at the maximum whereas for very high or low cn values e g a cn value of over 90 the span is much smaller and therefore the soil moisture percentage will have a limited effect this is logical since in high cn values where areas are near impervious high runoff is expected regardless of the soil moisture percentage 3 3 flash flood guidance computations the third component is the ffg computations which are used to calculate the current ffg value based on the threshold runoff value and the current soil moisture conditions at each grid the calculations are performed for the accumulation periods of 1 3 and 6 h where inverse rainfall runoff modeling is involved i e the rainfall value the ffg is calculated as the amount of rainfall that will produce the threshold runoff for the current soil moisture conditions in fig 5 an example of the relationship between the ffg values and the threshold runoff in rainfall units is seen for different soil moisture conditions the ffg value is expected to be lower when the current soil moisture conditions are high this is rephrased as the amount of rainfall needed to flood the ffg is less when the soil moisture percentage is high for instance based on fig 5 for a rainfall threshold volume of 30 mm the ffg is only 20 mm ffg when the soil moisture is 90 thus if 20 mm of rainfall falls within three hours and the soil is 90 saturated minor flooding will occur on the selected grid whereas if the soil moisture conditions are at 50 then 30 mm will have to fall to cause flooding for every grid and accumulation period a single ffg value is calculated and then compared with the forecasted rainfall value of the same duration if the input rainfall exceeds the ffg value then flooding over that area is expected and a warning should be issued while the difference of these two values can produce an estimate of how big the threat of flooding is the system is deterministic and therefore it ultimately only reports whether flood will occur or not if a grid floods for just a few millimeters or many it still counts as a flooded cell and is flagged for warning to overcome this issue and further assist with the decision making the calculation of ffg values for different rainfall accumulation periods is performed lower accumulation periods as a product of rainfall forecasting tend to have the least uncertainty involved but the provided lead time can be short for effective civilian warning and anti flood measures action on the other hand longer durations lead to larger lead times but higher uncertainty is involved moreover it is essential to notice that the system does not provide flash flood predictions but rather that a threat is imminent for instance when a longer accumulation period is used the system only reports if a flood threat is imminent within that period and not when or where therefore it is essential to analyze the results of the system before warnings are issued 4 results and discussion 4 1 derivation of threshold maps in the implementation of the gffg system the first component is the derivation of the threshold runoff the threshold runoff is to be estimated using the 5 year rainfall ari within the study area only two stations are located with known idf curves the elefsis and mandra stations the total amount of rainfall for a 5 year return period is calculated for different rainfall durations shown in fig 6 for each rainfall accumulation period used in the system i e the 1 3 and 6 h the idf rainfall values are interpolated into designated grids of 1 km 1 km dimensions using the inverse distance weighting idw algorithm the calculation of the threshold runoff is then performed through the methodology beforementioned the cn amc ii value and the slope percentage of each cell which are the two most important factors of runoff generation are shown in fig 7 the result is the generation of the threshold runoff maps which are converted into threshold rainfall maps as shown in fig 8 by applying the same methodology as the ffg for fixed soil moisture conditions the values of the plots indicate how much rainfall volume is necessary to fall within each grid for a designated period to cause minor flooding therefore low values of rainfall indicate that it is much easier for a grid to be flooded by locating these low threshold values with the cn and slope maps shown in fig 7 it is obvious that they are correlated with the areas where the corresponding cn is high i e the runoff potential is high or where the slope values are low these areas are mainly the industrial areas in the southeast at the thriasion plain and at the north where low slopes indicate the location of the inoi valley the effect of soil moisture conditions in the ffg generation is shown in fig 9 where the ffg of a 3 hour accumulation period is displayed for two scenarios the amc ii and amc iii which correspond to the 50 and 100 soil moisture conditions as seen the threshold values are reduced dramatically when the amc iii full saturated conditions are used and therefore flooding is easier to be achieved grids cells that are located in the southeast as stated earlier have high default cn values i e the urban cells and therefore a smaller change is observed when wet conditions are met performing the threshold calculations for each rainfall accumulation period and different soil moisture conditions i e amc i ii and iii the corresponding threshold values for all grids can be seen in the boxplot shown in fig 10 when dry conditions are present i e amc i conditions the variability of the ffg values within the study area is high approximately 60 mm between the lowest and highest value in all durations while in amc iii conditions this variability is significantly smaller at approximately only 20 mm this underlines that the uncertainty involved in the ffg calculations is much higher when low soil moisture conditions are present moreover the mean threshold value of all grids typically drops as more wet conditions are met but not at the same rate for the 3 h duration the mean threshold value in dry conditions is 75 mm while for normal and wet conditions the mean value drops to 40 and 22 mm this result of course is basin specific since the default cn values of the grids vary and high cn values will not alter significantly with soil moisture conditions as seen in fig 4 4 2 simulation of the mandra event the proposed methodology is applied to the mandra subbasins the soures and ag aikaterini subbasins as shown in fig 12 along with the corresponding grid delineation the mean area precipitation over the area is used as input rainfall for all grids while the soil moisture conditions are assumed as near saturated at 90 in fig 11 the precipitation time series for each forecasted rainfall accumulation period of 1 3 and 6 h while in fig 13 the expected flooded grids are shown in red for each time interval of the event per accumulation period a summary of the results is also shown in table 1 where the number and the corresponding percentage of the area that is flooded are reported concerning the forecasted accumulation periods shown in fig 11 the value which is used at each timestep is the sum of the next 1 3 or 6 values according to the accumulation period used for instance at timestep 15 11 0 00 the 6 hour value is the sum of the next six hours while the 3 hour value includes the sum of the next three hours in fig 13 the timestep of each figure indicates the result at the referenced period when a different rainfall accumulation period has been used before the result for instance the 6 hour figure with the 14 11 21 00 timestep shows which cells flood at 14 11 21 00 when a 6 hour forecast has been applied six hours earlier commenting on the summary shown in table 1 the first time that grids are flagged for flood is at the 14 11 17 00 timestep where only six grids are flagged while on the next time interval the number increases to 24 i e 36 of the basin these grids are located on the bottom right area where the mandra settlement is found and have high runoff potential since they feature high cn values at timestep 14 11 20 00 flooding is observed for almost all cells with the 6 hour forecast while in the 14 11 21 00 timestep flooding of 25 of the basin is also observed with the 3 hour forecast at the 15 11 01 00 timestep all cells flood with both the 3 and 6 hour forecasts while the 1 hour forecast flags for flooding only at the 15 11 03 00 timestep where 33 of the basin is flagged finally at the 15 11 04 00 timestep all forecasts report 100 of grids flagged for flood this sudden increase of the number of cells flooding is caused by the forecasted precipitation series where low rainfall is recorded at the start of the event but increases rapidly at 32 and 58 mm in timesteps 15 11 04 00 to 15 11 05 00 these last two rainfall inputs are higher than any ffg value calculated in the region and therefore any forecast that includes these two values results in flooding all cells while the 6 hour forecast provides a 6 hour lead time in real time conditions such long forecasts are subject to higher uncertainty and are better suited in large basins therefore it is more logical to use a smaller duration to decrease the uncertainty involved and increase the accuracy of the warnings moreover when at a specified time step only a few grids indicate flooding it is most likely that a warning over the entire region would not be issued unless sensitive infrastructure is located within therefore a basin percentage threshold can be determined where it is almost certain that extended flooding within the basin will cause extended flood damages by utilizing a threshold where when 30 of the basin is flagged a warning should be issued and since the peak discharge of the generated hydrograph was estimated to be at 5 40 of november 15 diakakis et al 2019 it can be said that at timestep 14 11 22 00 with the 3 hour forecast reporting 34 of the basin being flooded an overall lead time of seven hours could have been provided by the system by applying a more conservative threshold e g 60 of the basin being flooded before a warning is issued this lead time would have been five hours at time step 15 11 01 00 while by utilizing only the 1 hour forecast where the rainfall forecast uncertainty is at the lowest at least one hour or two hours in urban areas the lead time would have been provided provided that rainfall forecasts matched the observed values these lead times are deemed more than enough to trigger an alarm and direct the civil protection authorities to start mitigation measures such as news broadcasting warnings road redirections and on site monitoring 4 3 sensitivity analysis in this chapter we examine the impact of specific aspects of the system and their impact on the calculated lead times these aspects are the estimated threshold runoff values and the soil moisture conditions used in the ffg calculations first we address the threshold runoff estimation the methodology followed made use of the 5 year rainfall ari which through the use of the scs triangular hydrograph method calculated the threshold runoff this runoff an estimate of the 2 year discharge ari although it is usually considered adequate for use with the gffg system is subject to uncertainty especially when streamflow data are unavailable therefore to examine the impact of the 5 year rainfall ari we examine a range of rainfall aris and specifically 2 10 and 20 year rainfall aris based on the idf curves the percentage change between the 5 year set as the base value and the 2 10 and 20 year total rainfall is approximate 25 21 and 45 accordingly in table 2 the summary of the calculations i e the percentage of grids that are flooded is displayed for each case it is shown that the number of grids that eventually flood at each timestep is reduced when a higher rainfall return period is used the main differences are seen in the early time steps where the forecasted rainfalls are low or near the threshold concerning the 6 hour forecast at timestep 14 11 19 00 by using the 5 year ari a 52 of the cells are flooded while by using the 2 year nearly all grids i e 85 are flooded and by using the 10 and 20 year aris on 30 of the cells flood the results on the 3 hour forecast are similar to the 6 hour overall while some differences are found especially in the early stages of the event and between two following timesteps the system is deemed not as sensitive to this change while 85 of grids flooding is much larger than 52 by examining the previous and following time step the difference is negligible thus one can argue that in the worst case the loss of lead time is approximately one timestep moreover this difference is observed only on the low values which is most likely on the values that are close to the threshold values due to the system being deterministic and providing boolean answers i e flood or not flood such small differences subject to uncertainty cannot be eradicated overall the 5 year ari is considered viable since it follows literature as well as the fact that flash flood events are usually observed for rainfall return periods as low as two or five to ten years for a more in depth analysis and better approximation of the threshold runoff an analysis of historic rainfall events because of minor flooding should be conducted to evaluate the best rainfall ari for each grid in an implementation of the ews system the selection of different rainfall ari can be described as adjusting the threshold sensitivity of the system by selecting a higher rainfall ari the system is being less sensitive and thus would provide warnings for only the higher precipitation volumes for the same soil moisture conditions this application can be extended within one study area where specific areas that are deemed crucial can be calibrated with the use of low rainfall aris to make the system more sensitive in these particular areas and the opposite in areas of no interest such as in high elevation areas with no human activities the second parameter which is deemed crucial is the amount of soil moisture percentage used in the ffg calculations soil moisture conditions are related to the cn value through an adjudgment based on the soil moisture percentage reported by the hydrological model based on fig 4 the amc i and amc iii differences are at their maximum when the default cn value is 50 for soil moisture percentage at 50 the adjusted value retains the value 50 while for soil moisture 0 and 100 for completely dry and saturated soils the value is adjusted into 30 and 70 accordingly therefore high uncertainty is involved in grids where the cn amc ii value is near the value of 50 which is common for rural areas whereas cn values in urban areas are usually high values of 80 or more and thus the adjustment is significantly smaller in the base scenario saturated conditions of 90 soil moisture were assumed we conduct the same ffg simulations using a 100 80 and 50 soil moisture conditions percentage the results are shown in table 3 it is observed that by using a lower soil moisture percentage condition the number of grids that flood can dramatically change it is observed that there is a total of 10 fewer grids that flood when setting a 90 soil moisture from 100 especially in the early stages where rainfall intensity has not reached its peak specifically while assuming total wet conditions i e 100 soil moisture the 3 hour forecast estimates flooding for 90 of the basin at timestep 14 11 22 00 while by assuming 90 soil moisture this percentage drops to only 34 however the 90 moisture results are found similar to the 80 which shows that the difference at this stage is not that high on the other hand when the lower 50 soil moisture is used the number of flooded grids drops significantly even in the 15 11 01 00 timestep when the entire basin is flagged for flood in the other cases only 28 is flagged the 28 consists of the grids that have high cn values i e in the urban areas where the actual soil moisture conditions have little impact on the rainfall runoff transformation finally the 6 hours forecasts have similar results with the 3 h forecast for the particular event since high soil moisture conditions were present based on the 5 day api and therefore soil moisture above 80 was expected the forecasting lead time drop is approximately one hour per 10 soil moisture difference in the 6 hour forecast a 100 soil moisture would flag the entire basin at timestep 14 11 20 00 while by assuming a 90 and 80 soil moisture the flagging of the entire basin is delayed by one and two hours later accordingly in the 3 hr forecast the entire basin is flagged for flooding with the 100 soil moisture conditions at the 14 11 22 00 timestep while in the rest of cases this does not occur before timestep 15 11 01 00 i e 3 h later these findings are related to the nature of the studied event which features a significant increase of rainfall within one hour at two timesteps however this analysis highlights the importance of the hydrological model output concerning the derivation of the soil moisture conditions moreover although the quality concerning the soil moisture percentage is crucial the temporal availability of these datasets is also deemed important in all simulations the soil moisture conditions were assumed as static in time whereas they are continuously changing into saturation as rainfall begins in flash flood events as in the studied event this change can happen in a very short amount of time thus a hydrological model that reports soil moisture conditions in a 6 hour time frame will most likely fail to report the correct amount of soil moisture at small time intervals to address this issue it is suggested that a second hydrological model calibrated to run specifically in higher temporal scales under flood conditions be applied during the event to provide a high temporal scale of soil moisture conditions bournas and baltas 2021a this approach can also be used in conjunction with satellite based soil moisture products which while they lack the needed temporal and spatial resolution can be used as a good estimate of the initial conditions as well as for calibration and validation of the hydrological model provided that proper downscaling and assimilation processes are applied overall as highlighted in this study the ffg is a versatile system that can be easily customized and configured to provide accurate warnings which is essential for mitigating flash flood threats any limitations of the system lie mostly in the research to operational application and specifically data availability considering data quality and resolution which control the main uncertainties of the system from calibration to validation and operation the method applied due to its simplicity and easy applicability and fast processing can be used either as a basin vulnerability analysis through the estimation of the ffg the threshold rainfall or either as a first stop monitoring tool to provide the basis of other more sophisticated systems spyrou et al 2020 varlas et al 2021 that incorporate distributed rainfall runoff processes to provide with detailed inundation maps in this case since most ews rely on the same datasets i e soil moisture and rainfall field forecasts a data assimilation process or a calibration and validation scheme where each model feeds the other with information can be established in order to reduce uncertainty generated through the models own procedures 5 conclusions in this research work an application and evaluation of the gffg system were performed for a peri urban basin in greece an ews based on rainfall thresholds has the advantage of being easy to implement and maintain the system uses a hydrometeorological approach for detecting areas where minor flooding will occur by comparing current and forecasted rainfall fields with the corresponding threshold referred to as the ffg the gridded format has the advantage of being versatile since the grid size can be configured according to the scale of the rainfall forecast thus providing increased spatial and temporal resolution in this application the soil moisture conditions are incorporated by applying a simple algorithm to adjust the cn value based on a soil moisture percentage finally three threshold maps were created one for each of the 1 3 and 6 hour rainfall accumulation periods which are the most used forecasting periods the generated threshold maps of the sarantapotamos river basin show high variability for each of the different rainfall accumulation periods and soil moisture schemes used areas with high cn values and low slopes are highlighted by their low threshold values i e less rainfall is needed for these areas to flood moreover the effect of soil moisture conditions is also deemed crucial where it is found that when dry conditions are met higher uncertainty is expected in the computations the mean 3 hour rainfall accumulation threshold value for the entire basin in dry conditions is 75 mm while for normal and wet conditions the mean value drops to 40 mm and 22 mm overall the results are deemed logical and agree with similar research works the system was then applied for the mandra event that occurred on the 15th of november 2017 to assess the possible lead time that could have been provided results show that if the system was operational and the forecasted rainfall matched the values of the actual rainfall using the moderate 3 hr forecast 30 of the mandra subbasin including the urban areas would have been issued for warning with at least a seven hour lead time the majority of the basin using the 3 hr forecast would be flagged for flooding five hours ahead showing a strong indication that flood is imminent downstream although these results are subject to uncertainty involving the true state of the soil moisture conditions prior the event and the actual rainfall forecasts an experienced forecaster monitoring the event would have issued based on the results of the system at least two hours lead time warning by utilizing the 1 hr forecast furthermore a sensitivity analysis was then performed to examine the impact incorporating different rainfall ari and the soil moisture conditions to the threshold runoff estimation and the generated lead times regarding the first it is found that no significant changes are observed in the provided lead times when lower or higher rainfall aris are used specifically by incorporating a two and a ten year ari a one timestep loss i e one hour can be identified in the early stages and therefore the system is not that sensitive in this parameter especially in the extremes where high amount of rainfall is expected any differences observed are at some grids where the forecasted values matched the ffg values therefore the exploration of incorporating a spatially variable rainfall ari based either on the analysis of historic events or the flood vulnerability of selected grids is advised to optimize the system output regarding the impact of the soil moisture conditions it is found that the system is quite sensitive to this parameter and therefore a good approximation of it is deemed essential in wet conditions a 10 deviation of the soil moisture value can lead to at least one hour of lead time loss while the problem is expanded in the medium and dry conditions where flood threat cannot be reached unless very high amount of precipitation is detected since the soil moisture conditions often dictate whether an area or grid is flagged for flooding or not this highlights the need of updating the soil moisture conditions at finer time intervals as suggested in literature although this effect is more prominent to occur on events that feature in modest rainfall events close to the threshold values or short storm durations prior to dry conditions whereas in high rainfall events or in near saturated prior conditions this effect is reduced therefore it is suggested not only to have a properly calibrated soil moisture accounting model but also to perform the needed calculations in high temporal scales since data collection tends to become better spatial and temporal scaled so must the respected models to that end a hydrological model calibrated to simulate at high temporal scales during flash floods events could be an improvement of the gffg system overall as highlighted in this study the ffg is a versatile system that can be easily customized and configured to provide with accurate warnings which is essential for mitigating flash flood threats however an ews is as good as the forecasted rainfall input thus increased attention should be given to the forecasting and nowcasting procedures when applying a well established ews in a new study area while the ability of the forecasters to correctly intrepid the results of the system is also important nevertheless the impact of the gffg as an ews in mitigating flash flood threats is undeniable and can be considered as first stop valuable asset against natural disasters which civil protection agencies ought to

3269,in this work a new solution is developed for the problem of contaminant transport in a single fracture matrix system where the first order reaction rate constants are different in both fracture and matrix it takes a form of convolution with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms separately the statistical nature of the three functions as well as the interpretation of the solution as a marginal probability distribution in the case of no first order reactions allows us to develop a simple time domain random walk tdrw algorithm to calculate the breakthrough curves at a given point of observation downstream the fracture compared with the existing versions of the tdrw algorithm it is superior not only in the physical reasoning and statistical interpretations but also in its numerical implementations in addition the developed algorithm can not only be used to estimate the distribution profile of the contaminant concentration along the fracture but also the concentration within the matrix since the analytical solution to contaminant concentration in the matrix also takes a convolution form of three functions also the distribution profile of contaminant concentration within the matrix can readily be determined by the use of our tdrw algorithm to validate the developed algorithm three benchmark cases are considered for either nuclide or colloid transport through a fractured rock the results show that tdrw algorithm is superior to the gaussian quadrature solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense when nearly identical results are obtained however the monte carlo nature of the tdrw algorithm implies that the accuracy of the computational result is related to the number of

berkowitz 2002 based on either discrete fracture network dfn model dershowitz et al 1998 or channel network model cnm gylling et al 1999 shahkarami et al 2016 although there exist some variants both models aim to address the problem of water flow and nuclide transport in fractured crystalline rocks under the repository circumstance dershowitz et al 1998 gylling et al 1999 by taking the single fracture matrix system as a representative volume element for this reason the fracture matrix system has been studied over many years neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 commonly the fracture in a single fracture matrix system is considered as a highly effective pathway for nuclide transport due merely to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion as compared to the host rock where diffusion and sorption are the main mechanisms for nuclide retardation radioactive decay is described by a first order rate constant i e decay constant which is independent of position already in 1980 s neretnieks 1980 presented an analytical solution for this model under the assumption that dispersion along the fracture is negligible tang et al 1981 developed a transient analytical solution for the same problem but accounted for fickian dispersion it is not only complicated in structure but also difficult to be applied into practical use only recently liu et al 2018 found that the solution of tang et al 1981 can actually be treated as a convolution of two simple functions later on meng et al 2018 extended the system into the case where the penetration depth of nuclides into the matrix is limited and concluded that the solution established by liu et al 2018 also holds the conceptualization behind the problem of nuclide transport is however not valid for colloid transport colloid transport in fractures is mainly caused by advection and hydrodynamic dispersion and retarded by matrix diffusion exclusion from some aperture regions due to colloid size i e physical straining or surface charge i e charge exclusion relative to the aperture of the fracture mccarthy and zachara 1989 settling to the bottom of the fracture i e sedimentation due to the gravitational forces of larger colloids or aggregated colloids exceeding the combined effect of buoyant lift and drag forces swanton 1995 oswald and ibaraki 2001 stoll et al 2016 and deposition zhang et al 2012 among these mechanisms deposition has been observed as the primary colloid retention mechanisms rodrigues and dickson 2015 stoll et al 2017 cohen and weisbrod 2018 and is generally considered as irreversible nocito gobel and tobiason 1996 masciopinto and visino 2017 yosri et al 2020 which can be described mathematically through a deposition coefficient or the corresponding first order rate constant abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1994 yosri et al 2020 however unlike the nuclide decay colloid may deposit only in the fracture yosri et al 2020 making the rate constant zero in the porous matrix for this reason we generalize the model of tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 to consider the case where the rate constants are different in the fracture and matrix the solution to this generalized problem can be obtained numerically by either finite difference or finite element method grisak and pickens 1980 barker 1982 hodgkinson and maul 1988 or analytically by applying laplace transform method tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 the result would then give evolutions of the contaminant concentration over space and time where the contaminant here can be understood as either nuclide or colloid for pa purpose however the breakthrough curve obtained at the point of observation downstream the fracture is of great importance in order to assess the risk of contaminant transport on the biosphere this motivates us to follow the approach of liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 to develop a general transient solution for contaminant transport in a single fracture matrix system with different rate constants it was found that the solution also takes a form of convolution similar to that developed by liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms individually in general the analytical solutions can be numerically evaluated by three methods i e the inverse laplace transform method mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the gaussian quadrature method tang et al 1981 and the monte carlo methods salamon et al 2006 noetinger et al 2016 by comparison the inverse laplace transform method is the simplest one to implement giving the most accurate result by performing a numerical inverse laplace transform on the solution in the laplace domain it can be readily extended into a channel network or a fracture network along each of the transport paths the surrounding media have constant geological properties mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 it cannot however be used to address the consequence of e g glacial rebound and climate change painter et al 2020 in pa applications the gaussian quadrature method tries to directly solve the analytical solution in the time domain it can be successful for a single fracture but difficult to be applied to a transport path consisting of numerous channels not to mention the case where the channels change with time in their geological properties the monte carlo methods have been developed over the years in terms of discretization either in space or in time including many variants such as random walk particle tracking rwpt method tompson and gelhar 1990 delay et al 2005 salamon et al 2006 noetinger et al 2016 meng and pfingsten 2017 continuous time random walk ctrw method barkai et al 2000 berkowitz et al 2001

walk tdrw method yamashita and kimura 1990 delay and bodin 2001 moreno and neretnieks 1993 reimus and james 2002 painter et al 2008 yosri et al 2020 etc compared with rwpt and ctrw approaches the time domain random walk tdrw method determines the travel time over a fixed displacement which might be deterministic in the case of purely advective transport or stochastic if dispersion is accounted for yamashita and kimura 1990 delay and bodin 2001 moreno and neretnieks 1993 w reimus and james 2002 painter et al 2008 as detailed by yosri et al 2020 with a clear introduction on tdrw method a large amount of information and strong enlightenment the advantage of tdrw as compared with rwpt is that a single step of space can be used to move all the particles across the fracture makes the algorithm much more efficient in computation it is free of numerical dispersion and capable of accounting for more retardation mechanisms without significant computational burden that would otherwise be required by rwpt as a result more and more efforts have been made recently to accommodate the tdrw method into different problems historically moreno and neretnieks 1993 may be one of the pioneers to apply the tdrw algorithm for the fracture matrix system in which dispersion was however not considered in the algorithms of delay and bodin 2001 reimus and james 2002 and bodin et al 2003 the dispersion is included but handled only in an approximate manner by contrast painter et al 2008 developed an algorithm that treated dispersion rigorously for colloid transport yosri et al 2020 also established a tdrw algorithm based on the work of delay and bodin 2001 that accounted for deposition of colloid only along the fracture although these algorithms of tdrw have been successfully used to simulate contaminant transport in fractured rocks the underlying physics was not clearly interpreted this makes the existing tdrw algorithms difficult to be extended into general cases where e g the first order rate constants in the fracture and matrix may be different for this reason a new tdrw algorithm was developed based on the physical and statistical interpretations of the analytical solution we obtained which becomes actually a marginal probability distribution in the case where the first order reaction term is absent our tdrw algorithm can also be used to estimate the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture in addition we notice that limited efforts for estimating contaminant concentration within the matrix by applying either gaussian quadrature directly on analytical solution or tdrw algorithm have been made this motivates us to follow the approach of liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 to develop a general transient solution to contaminant concentration within the matrix it was found that the solution also takes a form of convolution with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms individually more importantly this convolution form suggests that our tdrw algorithm could also be used to estimate the concentration and even the concentration profile within the matrix the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we first establish a general model for the problem of contaminant transport along a single fracture embedded in a homogeneous porous matrix with different rate constants in section 2 the transient analytical solution is then obtained by following the approach of liu et al 2018 and interpreted from both physical and statistical points of view in the next section a new tdrw algorithm is proposed in terms of the statistical nature of the solution we obtained its advantage over the existing versions of the tdrw algorithms is then discussed in detail also the method for estimating the concentration profile along the fracture will be introduced then the tdrw algorithm for estimating the concentration and concentration profile in the matrix will be discussed in section 4 in section 5 the accuracy and efficacy of the new algorithm are demonstrated by three benchmark cases against the numerical solution of the inverse laplace transform method afterwards concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 mathematical model and transient solution as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the system under consideration is the same as that studied by tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 for contaminant transport in the fractured rock the fracture is represented by two smooth parallel plates with a constant aperture 2 b embedded in a semi infinite homogeneous porous rock the water velocity u in the fracture is constant and the tracer is injected at the inlet of the fracture with a concentration of c i n t the contaminant transport in the fracture is governed by advection hydrodynamic dispersion surface adsorption while the movement in the matrix is affected by diffusion and sorption in addition contaminant might also be involved in local reactions e g radioactive decay for nuclides and deposition for colloid in the fracture and matrix to address this problem two first order reactions are considered in the model combined with this conceptualization and other simplifications and assumptions used in tang et al 1981 the transport processes in the fracture matrix system can be described by two coupled one dimensional equations of continuity that can be written respectively as 1 r f c f t u c f x d f 2 c f x 2 d p ε p b c p z z b r f λ f c f and 2 r p c p t d p 2 c p z 2 r p λ p c p along with the initial and boundary conditions for contaminant transport through the fracture 3 c f x 0 0 4 c f 0 t c in t 5 c f t 0 and in the porous matrix 6 c p x z 0 0 7 c p x b t c f x t 8 c p x t 0 where the subscripts f and p refer to the fracture and pore space of the rock matrix respectively x and z are the coordinates along and perpendicular to the fracture plane respectively t is the time c denotes the concentration of the contaminant r indicates retardation coefficient d f represents the dispersion coefficient in the fracture d p indicates the pore diffusion coefficient in the homogeneous matrix ε p indicates the porosity λ is the first order rate constant for ease of reference a complete list of symbols and dimensions are also given at the beginning of the paper it should be noted that λ f λ p in the case of a nuclide transport whereas λ p 0 can be assumed in the study of colloid transport as discussed by yosri et al 2020 in whatever cases one can apply laplace transform to the governing equations along with the initial and boundary conditions to give the contaminant concentration in the fracture in laplace domain as 9 c f c in exp pe 2 exp pe 2 1 4 pe t w g s λ f r f s r f λ p where g is the diffusive mass transfer parameter mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2016 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 defined as g ε p r p d p b p e is the péclet number p e ux d f t w is the water residence time meng et al 2018 t w x u and s is the laplace transform variable once c f is determined the contaminant concentration in the matrix in laplace domain can by applying boundary condition i e eq 7 be written as 10 c p c f exp r p t m s λ p where t m is the characteristic diffusion time in the rock matrix t m z b 2 d p in the case of z b eq 10 is similar to c f while an exponential term is additionally included therefore we will first focus on the analytical solution to contaminant concentration in the fracture i e eq 9 this analytical solution in laplace domain is quite general in the sense that it is applicable to any dirichlet boundary conditions at inlet of the fracture with an arbitrary definition of c i n t however as discussed by meng et al 2018 it is sufficient to consider only the case of a dirac delta injection because in general cases the solution to c f t can be obtained from the convolution of c i n t and the impulse response to δ t a dirac delta function with an unit of m l 3 leading to c i n 1 it follows from the approach of liu et al 2018 that c f can then be written as 11 c f 0 f τ c f τ pe d τ with 12 f τ 1 2 π d f τ x τ exp x u τ 2 4 d f τ and a laplace solution to the case of p e given by 13 c f τ pe exp τ g s λ p r f s r f λ f since c f is a convolution of f and c f p e with the f function independent of laplace transform variable s the inverse laplace transform of c f immediately gives 14 c f t 0 f τ c f t τ pe d τ with the inverse laplace transform of c f p e written in the form 15 c f t τ pe k r f τ λ f g t r f τ g τ k t r f τ λ p where we have defined 16 g t r f τ g τ g τ 2 π t r f τ 3 exp g τ 2 4 t r f τ h t r f τ and 17 k t λ exp λ t and h t is the heaviside step function as a result c f t in eq 14 can be rewritten as 18 c f t 0 φ r f τ λ f γ t r f τ g τ λ p d τ with 19 φ r f τ λ f f τ k r f τ λ f and 20 γ t r f τ g τ λ p g t r f τ g τ k t r f τ λ p in the limiting case of λ f λ p 0 φ and γ function reduce to f and g function respectively and c f t would then become the one obtained by liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 i e 21 c f t λ f λ p 0 0 f τ g t r f τ g τ d τ as given in eq 18 c f t is therefore a convolution of φ and γ functions in which the f g and k functions all have clear physical and mathematical meanings as discussed in detail in what follows moreover it should be stressed that the solution of c f t throughout this paper refers only to the impulse response to δ t 2 1 f function as defined in eq 12 the f function is dependent on u and d f only for a given point of observation downstream the fracture it is nothing but the solution to the advection dispersion equation in free water in the case of dirac delta injection given an advection time τ it can therefore be regarded as an impulse response function in a fracture only system in which the surface adsorption and local reaction along the fracture are not considered since now τ varies from zero to infinity in eq 11 or 14 we may envisage τ as the contaminant advection time in a fracture only system liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 as if the hydrodynamic dispersion is a result of advection with different water velocities r f τ is then the contaminant residence time along the fracture on the other hand it is noted that 0 f τ d τ 1 and hence the f function can also be seen as a probability density function p τ of the advection time distribution of the contaminant resulting apparently from hydrodynamic dispersion liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 with the mean 22 μ f t w and variance 23 σ f 2 2 pe t w 2 the cumulative distribution function of the contaminant advection time is then given by 24 p τ 1 2 erfc pe 2 1 ω ω 1 2 exp pe erfc pe 2 1 ω ω where we have defined ω as ω τ t w this result is however seldom used in monte carlo simulations due to the difficulty to obtain inversely the random advection time instead the f function is often approximated as a lognormal distribution to give bodin et al 2003 25 ln τ τ 0 n μ ln σ ln 2 where τ 0 is introduced to make τ dimensionless and equals to a unit of time τ and n μ σ 2 denotes a normal distribution with a mean of μ and a variance of σ 2 and 26 μ ln ln μ f τ 0 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 and 27 σ ln 2 ln 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 for short fractures with very low velocities i e p e 10 the approximation of lognormal distribution is not accurate bodin et al 2003 suggested that eq 26 should then be modified as 28 μ ln 1 1 33 pe ln μ f 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 2 2 g function as suggested by eq 16 the g function is actually the analytical solution to δ t in the limiting case as p e at time t r f τ for a given contaminant advection time τ with λ 0 it is therefore the impulse response function of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow involving advection matrix diffusion and sorption without however hydrodynamic dispersion and local reaction liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 as a result t p t r f τ in the definition of the g function in eq 16 can be understood as the contaminant residence time in the porous matrix since 0 g t p g τ d t p 1 the g function in eq 16 can also be seen as a probability density function of the residence time distribution of the contaminant in the matrix given a contaminant advection time τ i e p t p τ the cumulative distribution function of t p is then given by 29 p t p τ erfc g τ 2 t p 2 3 k function as defined in eq 17 the k function is an exponential function involving only the first order rate constant it describes the loss of contaminant mass due solely to local reaction for this reason φ as defined in eq 19 can be seen as a modified f function whereas γ in eq 20 is the modified g function when the first order reactions are accounted for in addition it is noted that k t λ varies in a range from 0 to 1 as a result k function can be regarded as a cumulative distribution function of the reaction time it may be used to describe the time t r e c when local reaction takes place making the contaminant disappear to give 30 t rec ln u 0 1 λ where u 0 1 denotes a uniform distribution between zero and unity 2 4 c f function as detailed in liu et al 2018 for a conservative contaminant the c f function i e c f t λ f λ p 0 in eq 21 is actually a convolution of f and g functions since the f and g functions work on different systems involving different mechanisms of retardation as discussed above evaluation of the f and g functions alone allow us to consider the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on contaminant transport separately this decoupling is equivalent to splitting the single fracture matrix system shown in fig 1 into two subsystems with different mechanisms as shown in fig 2 a the integral form of c f t λ f λ p 0 couples then all the transport processes together by performing a convolution of f and g functions in more general cases when local reactions considered eq 18 suggests that c f is a convolution of φ and γ functions as discussed above the φ function can be understood as the output of a fracture only system involving local reaction when the f function is taken as the input the γ function can likewise be seen as the response to the g function when local reaction in the matrix is accounted for as a result the decoupling concept we observed in the limiting case still holds and the single fracture matrix system can still be divided into two subsystems with different mechanism as shown in fig 2 b on the other hand we notice previously that f τ p τ and g t p g τ p t p τ the product of f and g functions i e p τ p t p τ gives p t p the joint probability density function of t and τ due to t p t r f τ this allows us to follow the probability theory miller and childers 2012 to take the impulse response function i e c f t λ f λ p 0 as a marginal probability density function p τ t of t the residence time of contaminant through the fracture matrix system i e 31 c f t λ f λ p 0 p τ t thus the statistical interpretations of f g and c f t λ 0 coincide entirely with the idea of the time domain random walk tdrw method delay and bodin 2001 painter et al 2008 in the evaluation of c f t λ f λ p 0 more importantly the similarity of c f and c f t λ f λ p 0 in the convolution form makes it possible to extend this probability consideration into general cases by accounting for the modification of k on both f and g functions i e to write 32 c f t p τ t where p τ t is not a probability density function but a modified form of p τ t by accounting for the effect of k function as can be understood from the difference between eqs 18 and 21 3 numerical implementations in estimation of contaminant concentration in the fracture in general the solution to c f t can be numerically evaluated by three methods the simplest and the most accurate one is to perform an inverse laplace transform on eq 9 numerically by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 this method is not only easily implemented but also readily extended into the case where the transport path consists of a series of piecewise constant channels along each of which the surrounding media have constant geological properties mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the disadvantage of this method is however in that it is not applicable to the cases where the geological properties of the channels or surrounding media suddenly change painter et al 2020 the second method is to apply gaussian quadrature directly on eq 18 in which the upper limit of the integration can further be reduced by use of the properties of the heaviside step function in eq 16 for the g function to give 33 c f t 0 t r f φ r f τ λ f γ r t p g τ λ p d τ this method can be successful for a single fracture with only 20 gaussian points liu et al 2018 but difficult to be applied to a transport path consisting of numerous channels not to mention the case where the channels change with time in their geological properties the third method is the one we discuss in detail in this section i e to apply the tdrw algorithm to evaluate c f t numerically in a monte carlo way delay and bodin 2001 bodin et al 2003 this method can tackle all the problems associated with the first and second approaches by envisaging the contaminant plume as an ensemble of contaminant particles the larger the number of the contaminant particles the greater the accuracy of the result this implies that a channel fracture network often requires a large number of contaminant particles otherwise the breakthrough curves obtained would be fluctuated somehow originally the tdrw method was proposed by applying the lagrange approach on the fokker plank formalism of the advection dispersion equation in free water or equivalently in the fracture only system delay and bodin 2001 painter et al 2008 when applied to the fracture matrix system a parameter ϱ defined as retardation factor has to be introduced to account for the delay caused by matrix diffusion as compared to pure advection delay and bodin 2001 while the efficacy of this retardation factor based approach has been demonstrated it is lack of sound physical reasoning by defining ϱ as the ratio between the characteristic time considering advection and matrix diffusion and that of pure advection our tdrw method stems however from discussion on the statistical properties of the f g and c f t functions with eq 31 as the core it avoids definition of the retardation factor ϱ as did by delay and bodin 2001 but records directly the arrival time of each contaminant particle at the outlet of the fracture to determine the cumulative distribution function of contaminant residence time t for this sake we have introduced four time concepts as discussed above the first one is the contaminant advection time τ which relates to the velocity the contaminant advects with water as a result of hydrodynamic dispersion the probability distribution of τ is described by the f function the second one is the contaminant residence time r f τ along the fracture the third one is the contaminant residence time t p in the porous matrix the probability distribution of which is given by the g function the last one is the reaction time t r e c which determines the time the reaction takes place either along the fracture or in the matrix the probability distribution of t r e c is determined by the k function the idea behind our tdrw algorithm is therefore to first evaluate τ and hence r f τ for each of contaminant particles by use of a random number acting on eq 24 or preferably eq 25 and then t p also by a random number acting on eq 29 this would be sufficient to calculate the contaminant residence time t for each particle through the fracture matrix system in the case of a conservative contaminant to be specific our tdrw algorithm for the conservative case with λ 0 can be assembled by following eq 21 or equivalently eq 31 as 1 denote a unit mass of contaminant injected at the inlet of fracture with n particles 2 for each particle sample a random number z from a normal distribution and then determine contaminant advection time τ from a variant form of eq 25 to give τ exp μ l n z σ l n 3 sample a random number u from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then determine the contaminant residence time t p in the matrix from eq 29 to give t p g τ 2 e r f c 1 u 2 with the use of τ obtained in step 2 4 calculate the contaminant arrival time t s r f τ t p 5 repeat from step 2 to 4 a total of n times 6 find all particles with t s smaller than a specific time t the total number of these particles n s is then determined the result of n s n for a series of observation times gives thus the heaviside response function 7 use the algorithm of e g the adaptive kernel density estimation botev et al 2010 to differentiate numerically the heaviside response function with respect to time giving the impulse response function c f t compared with the algorithm proposed by delay and bodin 2001 our tdrw method does not modify the velocity of advection u by a fictitious retardation factor ϱ which is used to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant advection time τ instead we determine τ in a fracture only system as if the hydrodynamic dispersion of contaminant particles is a result of advection with different water velocities this allows us to relate the contaminant residence time in the matrix t p directly to τ in the place of the water residence time t w and to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant travel time separately on the other hand it is noticed that our tdrw algorithm is nearly identical to that established by painter et al 2008 the proposed algorithm has however different physical origins and it is based firmly on the statistical properties of f and g functions as well as the interpretation of c f t λ f λ p 0 as a marginal probability distribution when the first order reactions are taken into account only step 4 is needed to update by following eq 18 or equivalently eq 32 to address the effect of k on the particle travel time i e 4 sample two random numbers u f and u p from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then calculate the contaminant reaction times in the fracture and matrix respectively from eq 30 to give t r e c f l n u f λ f and t r e c p l n u p λ p only in the case of r f τ t r e c f and t p t r e c p the contaminant travel time is determined as t s r f τ t p otherwise set t s to be infinity to make the particle disappear in the system this modification originates from the update of f and g functions by the k function and therefore in the case of λ f λ p 0 it reduces to the original version of step 4 for a single transport path consisting of a series of piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties along each channel mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 our tdrw algorithm can be applied directly without any extra efforts i e to record just the travel time of each particle along the path once the breakthrough curve for either heaviside step or dirac delta injection is obtained for a given location x the concentration at a time of interest say t can readily be determined by the method of linear interpolation if this procedure is repeated for a series of x along the fracture the result would give directly the distribution profile at time t 4 numerical implementations in estimation of contaminant concentration in the matrix in some cases the contaminant concentration in the matrix is also required to be evaluated giving e g the concentration distribution within matrix for this or other purposes one can also apply the three methods that we used for calculating c f t the first method is to perform the inverse laplace transform to eq 10 numerically by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the second method is to apply the gaussian quadrature directly on the analytical solution of c p t which can be obtained by following the same steps as deriving c f t but taking eq 10 as a starting point the result is 34 c p t 0 φ r f τ λ f γ t r f τ g τ r p t m λ p d τ with 35 γ t r f τ g τ r p t m λ p g t r f τ g τ r p t m k t r f τ λ p clearly c p t also takes a form of convolution in terms of φ and γ functions as c f t does the γ function now depends however additionally on r p t m or z as indicated in eq 35 in the limiting case of λ f λ p 0 φ and γ function also reduce to f and g function respectively and then c p t becomes 36 c p t λ f λ p 0 0 f τ g t r f τ g τ r p t m d τ with 37 g t r f τ g τ r p t m g τ r p t m 2 π t r f τ 3 exp g τ r p t m 2 4 t r f τ h t r f τ as a result c f t can be seen as a special case of c p t with z b since we have defined t p t r f τ and 0 g t p g τ r p t m d t p 1 the g function as given in eq 37 can still be considered as a probability density function for the residence time distribution of the contaminant in the matrix given a contaminant time τ and a characteristic diffusion time t m the cumulative distribution function of t p then becomes 38 p t p τ t m erfc g τ r p t m 2 t p the analysis suggests therefore that our tdrw algorithm can also be applied to estimate the concentration distribution within the matrix with only minor modification on step 3 in the algorithm outlined above i e 3 sample a random number u from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then determine the contaminant residence time t p in the matrix from eq 38 to give t p g τ r p t m 2 e r f c 1 u 2 for a given z or t m with the use of τ obtained in step 2 this gives the evolution of contaminant concentration at a given point x z it follows that the linear interpolation approach can also be used to yield the concentration at the time of interest t repeating this procedure for a multitude of points in the matrix would then result in the concentration profile within the matrix at time t 5 verification and discussion in synthetic cases to demonstrate the accuracy of our tdrw algorithm three cases are considered against the numerical solution of inverse laplace transform of eq 9 or by use of de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 5 1 case one nuclide transport in a fracture matrix system the nuclide transport in a fractured rock is influenced by advection hydrodynamic dispersion surface retardation matrix diffusion and sorption meng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 they may also decay in the system with the decay constant independent of position this implies that the first order rate constants of the nuclide in fracture and matrix are identical and both are equal to the decay constant for this case we have made simulations with x 20 m b 50 μ m u 0 1 m d d f 1 6 10 9 m 2 s r f 5 d p 1 6 10 10 m 2 s ε p 0 01 r p 10 and considered three nuclides with decay constants tabulated in table 1 as presented in fig 3 a for the case of heaviside step injection and fig 3 b for the case of dirac delta injection the simulation results of the tdrw algorithm all agree excellently with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian solution from the numerical quadrature of eq 18 the difference between these three methods lies only in the computation efficiency the computational time of the tdrw algorithm with 10 000 particles is nearly identical to that of the inverse laplace transform solution but much shorter than that of the gaussian quadrature solution the reason for the long time required for the gaussian solution is due mainly to the evaluation of the integral by use of adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 with 50 gauss points the tdrw algorithm involves however no integrations but simple algebraic calculations making it much more efficient in computation in addition it should be stressed that the results shown in fig 3 b is obtained simply by applying the algorithm of the adaptive kernel density estimation botev et al 2010 to differentiate the heaviside response function given in fig 3 a with respect to time as can be seen this numerical method of differentiation gives the impulse response function as good as that obtained from the inverse laplace transform method on the condition that sufficient particles and observation times have been used moreover we can also estimate the contaminant concentration along the fracture and in the matrix with the application of our tdrw algorithm to verify this a test for radionuclide b at t 50 y r with 10 000 particles applied has been performed and the results for the case of heaviside step injection and dirac delta injection are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively as presented in fig 4 the simulation results of the tdrw algorithm all agree excellently with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian solution this indicates that the proposed algorithm works well for the problem of estimating contaminant concentration along the fracture or in the matrix 5 2 case two colloid transport in a fracture matrix system for colloid transport in a fractured rock it is different from nuclide transport in that no decay is involved but deposition instead zhang et al 2012 in fact as the primary retention mechanism for colloid transport deposition is a two step process in which both electrostatics and hydrodynamics play important roles yosri et al 2020 it might be reversible or irreversible james and chrysikopoulos 2003 but only significant in the fracture while negligible in the porous matrix when considered to be irreversible colloid deposition is often described as a first order reaction with a constant deposition coefficient κ abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1994 this is equivalent to defining the first order rate constants as λ f κ u 2 b 2 and λ p 0 in our governing equations for this case yosri et al 2020 also established a tdrw algorithm by following the idea of delay and bodin 2001 the only modification was made on the probability density function of colloid travel time along the fracture which is obtained from the analytical solution to the advection dispersion equation in free water that accounts for colloid deposition instead of eq 12 this algorithm can be regarded as a modified version of tdrw originally proposed by delay and bodin 2001 but not as general as our algorithm to demonstrate the applicability of our tdrw approach to colloid transport we considered the same case as studied by yosri et al 2020 x 5 m b 62 5 μ m u 1 m y r d f 0 25 m 2 y r r f 1 d p 1 29 10 5 m 2 y r ε p 0 01 r p 1 the values of the deposition coefficient κ and the corresponding λ f are tabulated in table 2 as shown in fig 5 a for the case of dirac delta injection the simulation results of our tdrw algorithm with 12 000 particles applied also make an excellent agreement with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian quadrature solution this indicates that our tdrw algorithm also works well for the situation of colloid transport it is superior to the gaussian solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense if we switch λ f and λ p values to explore the consequence of the assumption of colloid deposition only in the porous matrix even though it might be impossible in practice yosri et al 2020 earlier and less dispersed breakthrough curves are observed in fig 5 b compared to the results shown in fig 5 a for the corresponding cases this is reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks are attributed mainly to the mechanisms governing colloid transport along the fracture if no colloid is deposited in the fracture more colloidal particles would be advected by water to arrive at the outlet of fracture earlier making the breakthrough curves less spreading than the case of deposition solely along the fracture the similarity of the results shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b suggests however that one should first determine by other means whether colloid deposition really occurs along the fracture or in the matrix prior to using the model to interpret the experimental results on the other hand it should be emphasized that the experimental study of dirac delta injection is more favorable over the case of heaviside step injection because the fine features observed in the breakthrough curves in the former case would be smeared out in the latter case notably even though the local reaction rates discussed above are different however either λ f or λ p in the shown cases is zero which makes the applicability of the obtained conclusion limited to address this problem we additionally performed two groups of simulations 12000 particles used where colloid is considered to deposit in both fracture and matrix i e different ratios of λ f and λ p are applied while λ f is kept a constant similar to the differences of the performances of the curves between fig 5 a and b more retarded and spreading the breakthrough curves are found to be in fig 6 b with λ f 3 2 10 1 1 y r for the corresponding cases compared with the results in fig 6 a with λ f 1 28 10 2 1 y r this is reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks are dominated mainly by the mechanisms governing colloid transport along the fracture if the amount of colloid deposited in the fracture is more i e larger λ f fewer colloidal particles would be advected by water to arrive at the outlet of fracture earlier making the breakthrough curves more spreading than the case of smaller λ f in addition the influence of colloid deposition in the matrix on the colloid transport is more and more significant with the increase of ratio as shown in either fig 6 a and b this is also reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks becomes attributed mainly to the mechanisms governing colloid transport in the matrix once λ f does not change also the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture and in the matrix can be estimated by applying the tdrw algorithm as presented in fig 7 the distribution profiles of colloid b at different depths for t 50 y r with 12 000 particles used for the case of λ f 0 and λ p 0 are in good agreement with each other this indicates that our tdrw algorithm also works well for the situation of colloid transport 5 3 case three colloid transport in a complicated fracture matrix system to verify if our tdrw algorithm is still applicable to a more complicated case we consider that the path of colloid transport consists of three piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties along each channel based on the data used in case two the parameters we have changed for each of the channels are tabulated in table 3 since the solution to c f t as given in eq 18 cannot directly be extended to this general case the gaussian solution is not available we can however still apply the inverse laplace transform method to obtain the results as did by mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the assumption behind is that the solution in laplace domain or the analytical solution obtained from an infinite length fracture can reasonably be used to approximate the evolution of contaminant concentration at a given point of observation downstream a fracture with a length of sufficiently large this is actually a common practice in performing the safety assessment of deep geological repositories for simplicity in addition since our concern here is mainly to show the potential ability of our tdrw algorithm we restricted ourselves only to the case of an embedding matrix with an infinite extent as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the breakthrough curves of the tdrw algorithm and the inverse laplace transform solution is still excellent even in the case most of colloids have been deposited along the fracture the only price we have then paid is to increase the number of particles used in the tdrw algorithm a bit e g 15 000 particles in addition the tdrw method for estimating the concentration distribution along the fracture or within the matrix can also be applicable to a more complicated case as validated in fig 9 for the distribution profiles of colloid b at different depths with t 50 y r a good agreement between inverse laplace transform solution and tdrw algorithm can also be achieved especially in the case of increasing the number of particles in the simulations e g 15 000 particles although both tdrw algorithm and the inverse laplace transform approach work well for this or similar cases it should be noted that inverse laplace transform approach is not valid when the geological properties of transport path suddenly change with time this implies that the inverse laplace transform method is limited in its applicability by contrast our tdrw approach can be adapted somehow to simulate even the situation of glacial rebound or climate change by considering the distribution of contaminant particles in the porous matrix as attempted by painter et al 2020 this work will be done and presented in the near future 6 conclusion in this contribution we extended the model of tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 to accomodate the problem of colloid transport in a single fracture matrix system i e to account for the first order reactions with different rate constants in fracture and matrix the solution to this generalized model also takes a form of convolution similar to that developed by liu et al 2018 with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms separately the first function denoted as f function can be seen as the probability density function of contaminant advection time the second function denoted as g function can be seen as the probability density function of contaminant residence time in the matrix for a given advection time the third function denoted as k function can be regarded as the cumulative density function of contaminant reaction time to make the contaminant disappear or deposit in the fracture matrix system the k function can further be split into two parts acting on f and g functions respectively the statistical interpretation of the f g and k functions allows us to develop a new tdrw algorithm to estimate the contaminant concentration at the outlet of the fracture compared to the one originally proposed by delay and bodin 2001 and latter extended by yosri et al 2020 our tdrw algorithm avoid not only the modification of the velocity of advection by a fictitious retardation factor which is used to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant travel time but also the modification of the probability density function of colloid travel time along the fracture to consider the effect of colloid deposition all these facts make our tdrw algorithm superior to the one developed by delay and bodin 2001 and yosri et al 2020 on the other hand it is noticed that our tdrw algorithm is nearly identical to that established by painter et al 2008 nevertheless our approach has very different physical and statistical origins and it can easily be extended to general cases where the rate constants of the first order reactions are different in the fracture and matrix moreover our algorithm bears all the advantages of tdrw approach as compared to the inverse laplace transform method and the gaussian quadrature method it can even be applied to address the problems of contaminant transport through a channel network or fracture network where each of the transport paths consists of piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties no matter if the geological properties of each fracture matrix segment keep constant or suddenly change due to e g glacial rebound in addition our algorithm can also be used to determine the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture and contaminant concentration in the matrix to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of our tdrw algorithm three benchmark cases are considered for either nuclide or colloid transport through a fractured rock the comparisons suggest that the tdrw algorithm is superior to the gaussian quadrature solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense when nearly identical results are obtained from three approaches however the monte carlo nature of the tdrw algorithm implies that the larger the number of the contaminant particles used the greater the accuracy of the computational result as a consequence for a channel fracture network in pa scale it often requires a large number of contaminant particles otherwise the results obtained would be fluctuated somehow this is perhaps the sole drawback of the tdrw algorithm 7 data availability

3269,in this work a new solution is developed for the problem of contaminant transport in a single fracture matrix system where the first order reaction rate constants are different in both fracture and matrix it takes a form of convolution with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms separately the statistical nature of the three functions as well as the interpretation of the solution as a marginal probability distribution in the case of no first order reactions allows us to develop a simple time domain random walk tdrw algorithm to calculate the breakthrough curves at a given point of observation downstream the fracture compared with the existing versions of the tdrw algorithm it is superior not only in the physical reasoning and statistical interpretations but also in its numerical implementations in addition the developed algorithm can not only be used to estimate the distribution profile of the contaminant concentration along the fracture but also the concentration within the matrix since the analytical solution to contaminant concentration in the matrix also takes a convolution form of three functions also the distribution profile of contaminant concentration within the matrix can readily be determined by the use of our tdrw algorithm to validate the developed algorithm three benchmark cases are considered for either nuclide or colloid transport through a fractured rock the results show that tdrw algorithm is superior to the gaussian quadrature solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense when nearly identical results are obtained however the monte carlo nature of the tdrw algorithm implies that the accuracy of the computational result is related to the number of

berkowitz 2002 based on either discrete fracture network dfn model dershowitz et al 1998 or channel network model cnm gylling et al 1999 shahkarami et al 2016 although there exist some variants both models aim to address the problem of water flow and nuclide transport in fractured crystalline rocks under the repository circumstance dershowitz et al 1998 gylling et al 1999 by taking the single fracture matrix system as a representative volume element for this reason the fracture matrix system has been studied over many years neretnieks 1980 tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 commonly the fracture in a single fracture matrix system is considered as a highly effective pathway for nuclide transport due merely to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion as compared to the host rock where diffusion and sorption are the main mechanisms for nuclide retardation radioactive decay is described by a first order rate constant i e decay constant which is independent of position already in 1980 s neretnieks 1980 presented an analytical solution for this model under the assumption that dispersion along the fracture is negligible tang et al 1981 developed a transient analytical solution for the same problem but accounted for fickian dispersion it is not only complicated in structure but also difficult to be applied into practical use only recently liu et al 2018 found that the solution of tang et al 1981 can actually be treated as a convolution of two simple functions later on meng et al 2018 extended the system into the case where the penetration depth of nuclides into the matrix is limited and concluded that the solution established by liu et al 2018 also holds the conceptualization behind the problem of nuclide transport is however not valid for colloid transport colloid transport in fractures is mainly caused by advection and hydrodynamic dispersion and retarded by matrix diffusion exclusion from some aperture regions due to colloid size i e physical straining or surface charge i e charge exclusion relative to the aperture of the fracture mccarthy and zachara 1989 settling to the bottom of the fracture i e sedimentation due to the gravitational forces of larger colloids or aggregated colloids exceeding the combined effect of buoyant lift and drag forces swanton 1995 oswald and ibaraki 2001 stoll et al 2016 and deposition zhang et al 2012 among these mechanisms deposition has been observed as the primary colloid retention mechanisms rodrigues and dickson 2015 stoll et al 2017 cohen and weisbrod 2018 and is generally considered as irreversible nocito gobel and tobiason 1996 masciopinto and visino 2017 yosri et al 2020 which can be described mathematically through a deposition coefficient or the corresponding first order rate constant abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1994 yosri et al 2020 however unlike the nuclide decay colloid may deposit only in the fracture yosri et al 2020 making the rate constant zero in the porous matrix for this reason we generalize the model of tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 to consider the case where the rate constants are different in the fracture and matrix the solution to this generalized problem can be obtained numerically by either finite difference or finite element method grisak and pickens 1980 barker 1982 hodgkinson and maul 1988 or analytically by applying laplace transform method tang et al 1981 sudicky and frind 1982 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 the result would then give evolutions of the contaminant concentration over space and time where the contaminant here can be understood as either nuclide or colloid for pa purpose however the breakthrough curve obtained at the point of observation downstream the fracture is of great importance in order to assess the risk of contaminant transport on the biosphere this motivates us to follow the approach of liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 to develop a general transient solution for contaminant transport in a single fracture matrix system with different rate constants it was found that the solution also takes a form of convolution similar to that developed by liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms individually in general the analytical solutions can be numerically evaluated by three methods i e the inverse laplace transform method mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the gaussian quadrature method tang et al 1981 and the monte carlo methods salamon et al 2006 noetinger et al 2016 by comparison the inverse laplace transform method is the simplest one to implement giving the most accurate result by performing a numerical inverse laplace transform on the solution in the laplace domain it can be readily extended into a channel network or a fracture network along each of the transport paths the surrounding media have constant geological properties mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 it cannot however be used to address the consequence of e g glacial rebound and climate change painter et al 2020 in pa applications the gaussian quadrature method tries to directly solve the analytical solution in the time domain it can be successful for a single fracture but difficult to be applied to a transport path consisting of numerous channels not to mention the case where the channels change with time in their geological properties the monte carlo methods have been developed over the years in terms of discretization either in space or in time including many variants such as random walk particle tracking rwpt method tompson and gelhar 1990 delay et al 2005 salamon et al 2006 noetinger et al 2016 meng and pfingsten 2017 continuous time random walk ctrw method barkai et al 2000 berkowitz et al 2001 berkowitz and scher 2001 berkowitz et al 2000 berkowitz et al 2002 berkowitz et al 2006 le vot et al 2017 shlesinger 2017 zaslavsky 2002 salamon et al 2006 noetinger et al 2016 and time domain random walk tdrw method yamashita and kimura 1990 delay and bodin 2001 moreno and neretnieks 1993 reimus and james 2002 painter et al 2008 yosri et al 2020 etc compared with rwpt and ctrw approaches the time domain random walk tdrw method determines the travel time over a fixed displacement which might be deterministic in the case of purely advective transport or stochastic if dispersion is accounted for yamashita and kimura 1990 delay and bodin 2001 moreno and neretnieks 1993 w reimus and james 2002 painter et al 2008 as detailed by yosri et al 2020 with a clear introduction on tdrw method a large amount of information and strong enlightenment the advantage of tdrw as compared with rwpt is that a single step of space can be used to move all the particles across the fracture makes the algorithm much more efficient in computation it is free of numerical dispersion and capable of accounting for more retardation mechanisms without significant computational burden that would otherwise be required by rwpt as a result more and more efforts have been made recently to accommodate the tdrw method into different problems historically moreno and neretnieks 1993 may be one of the pioneers to apply the tdrw algorithm for the fracture matrix system in which dispersion was however not considered in the algorithms of delay and bodin 2001 reimus and james 2002 and bodin et al 2003 the dispersion is included but handled only in an approximate manner by contrast painter et al 2008 developed an algorithm that treated dispersion rigorously for colloid transport yosri et al 2020 also established a tdrw algorithm based on the work of delay and bodin 2001 that accounted for deposition of colloid only along the fracture although these algorithms of tdrw have been successfully used to simulate contaminant transport in fractured rocks the underlying physics was not clearly interpreted this makes the existing tdrw algorithms difficult to be extended into general cases where e g the first order rate constants in the fracture and matrix may be different for this reason a new tdrw algorithm was developed based on the physical and statistical interpretations of the analytical solution we obtained which becomes actually a marginal probability distribution in the case where the first order reaction term is absent our tdrw algorithm can also be used to estimate the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture in addition we notice that limited efforts for estimating contaminant concentration within the matrix by applying either gaussian quadrature directly on analytical solution or tdrw algorithm have been made this motivates us to follow the approach of liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 to develop a general transient solution to contaminant concentration within the matrix it was found that the solution also takes a form of convolution with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms individually more importantly this convolution form suggests that our tdrw algorithm could also be used to estimate the concentration and even the concentration profile within the matrix the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we first establish a general model for the problem of contaminant transport along a single fracture embedded in a homogeneous porous matrix with different rate constants in section 2 the transient analytical solution is then obtained by following the approach of liu et al 2018 and interpreted from both physical and statistical points of view in the next section a new tdrw algorithm is proposed in terms of the statistical nature of the solution we obtained its advantage over the existing versions of the tdrw algorithms is then discussed in detail also the method for estimating the concentration profile along the fracture will be introduced then the tdrw algorithm for estimating the concentration and concentration profile in the matrix will be discussed in section 4 in section 5 the accuracy and efficacy of the new algorithm are demonstrated by three benchmark cases against the numerical solution of the inverse laplace transform method afterwards concluding remarks are given in section 6 2 mathematical model and transient solution as schematically illustrated in fig 1 the system under consideration is the same as that studied by tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 for contaminant transport in the fractured rock the fracture is represented by two smooth parallel plates with a constant aperture 2 b embedded in a semi infinite homogeneous porous rock the water velocity u in the fracture is constant and the tracer is injected at the inlet of the fracture with a concentration of c i n t the contaminant transport in the fracture is governed by advection hydrodynamic dispersion surface adsorption while the movement in the matrix is affected by diffusion and sorption in addition contaminant might also be involved in local reactions e g radioactive decay for nuclides and deposition for colloid in the fracture and matrix to address this problem two first order reactions are considered in the model combined with this conceptualization and other simplifications and assumptions used in tang et al 1981 the transport processes in the fracture matrix system can be described by two coupled one dimensional equations of continuity that can be written respectively as 1 r f c f t u c f x d f 2 c f x 2 d p ε p b c p z z b r f λ f c f and 2 r p c p t d p 2 c p z 2 r p λ p c p along with the initial and boundary conditions for contaminant transport through the fracture 3 c f x 0 0 4 c f 0 t c in t 5 c f t 0 and in the porous matrix 6 c p x z 0 0 7 c p x b t c f x t 8 c p x t 0 where the subscripts f and p refer to the fracture and pore space of the rock matrix respectively x and z are the coordinates along and perpendicular to the fracture plane respectively t is the time c denotes the concentration of the contaminant r indicates retardation coefficient d f represents the dispersion coefficient in the fracture d p indicates the pore diffusion coefficient in the homogeneous matrix ε p indicates the porosity λ is the first order rate constant for ease of reference a complete list of symbols and dimensions are also given at the beginning of the paper it should be noted that λ f λ p in the case of a nuclide transport whereas λ p 0 can be assumed in the study of colloid transport as discussed by yosri et al 2020 in whatever cases one can apply laplace transform to the governing equations along with the initial and boundary conditions to give the contaminant concentration in the fracture in laplace domain as 9 c f c in exp pe 2 exp pe 2 1 4 pe t w g s λ f r f s r f λ p where g is the diffusive mass transfer parameter mahmoudzadeh et al 2013 2016 liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 defined as g ε p r p d p b p e is the péclet number p e ux d f t w is the water residence time meng et al 2018 t w x u and s is the laplace transform variable once c f is determined the contaminant concentration in the matrix in laplace domain can by applying boundary condition i e eq 7 be written as 10 c p c f exp r p t m s λ p where t m is the characteristic diffusion time in the rock matrix t m z b 2 d p in the case of z b eq 10 is similar to c f while an exponential term is additionally included therefore we will first focus on the analytical solution to contaminant concentration in the fracture i e eq 9 this analytical solution in laplace domain is quite general in the sense that it is applicable to any dirichlet boundary conditions at inlet of the fracture with an arbitrary definition of c i n t however as discussed by meng et al 2018 it is sufficient to consider only the case of a dirac delta injection because in general cases the solution to c f t can be obtained from the convolution of c i n t and the impulse response to δ t a dirac delta function with an unit of m l 3 leading to c i n 1 it follows from the approach of liu et al 2018 that c f can then be written as 11 c f 0 f τ c f τ pe d τ with 12 f τ 1 2 π d f τ x τ exp x u τ 2 4 d f τ and a laplace solution to the case of p e given by 13 c f τ pe exp τ g s λ p r f s r f λ f since c f is a convolution of f and c f p e with the f function independent of laplace transform variable s the inverse laplace transform of c f immediately gives 14 c f t 0 f τ c f t τ pe d τ with the inverse laplace transform of c f p e written in the form 15 c f t τ pe k r f τ λ f g t r f τ g τ k t r f τ λ p where we have defined 16 g t r f τ g τ g τ 2 π t r f τ 3 exp g τ 2 4 t r f τ h t r f τ and 17 k t λ exp λ t and h t is the heaviside step function as a result c f t in eq 14 can be rewritten as 18 c f t 0 φ r f τ λ f γ t r f τ g τ λ p d τ with 19 φ r f τ λ f f τ k r f τ λ f and 20 γ t r f τ g τ λ p g t r f τ g τ k t r f τ λ p in the limiting case of λ f λ p 0 φ and γ function reduce to f and g function respectively and c f t would then become the one obtained by liu et al 2018 and meng et al 2018 i e 21 c f t λ f λ p 0 0 f τ g t r f τ g τ d τ as given in eq 18 c f t is therefore a convolution of φ and γ functions in which the f g and k functions all have clear physical and mathematical meanings as discussed in detail in what follows moreover it should be stressed that the solution of c f t throughout this paper refers only to the impulse response to δ t 2 1 f function as defined in eq 12 the f function is dependent on u and d f only for a given point of observation downstream the fracture it is nothing but the solution to the advection dispersion equation in free water in the case of dirac delta injection given an advection time τ it can therefore be regarded as an impulse response function in a fracture only system in which the surface adsorption and local reaction along the fracture are not considered since now τ varies from zero to infinity in eq 11 or 14 we may envisage τ as the contaminant advection time in a fracture only system liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 as if the hydrodynamic dispersion is a result of advection with different water velocities r f τ is then the contaminant residence time along the fracture on the other hand it is noted that 0 f τ d τ 1 and hence the f function can also be seen as a probability density function p τ of the advection time distribution of the contaminant resulting apparently from hydrodynamic dispersion liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 with the mean 22 μ f t w and variance 23 σ f 2 2 pe t w 2 the cumulative distribution function of the contaminant advection time is then given by 24 p τ 1 2 erfc pe 2 1 ω ω 1 2 exp pe erfc pe 2 1 ω ω where we have defined ω as ω τ t w this result is however seldom used in monte carlo simulations due to the difficulty to obtain inversely the random advection time instead the f function is often approximated as a lognormal distribution to give bodin et al 2003 25 ln τ τ 0 n μ ln σ ln 2 where τ 0 is introduced to make τ dimensionless and equals to a unit of time τ and n μ σ 2 denotes a normal distribution with a mean of μ and a variance of σ 2 and 26 μ ln ln μ f τ 0 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 and 27 σ ln 2 ln 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 for short fractures with very low velocities i e p e 10 the approximation of lognormal distribution is not accurate bodin et al 2003 suggested that eq 26 should then be modified as 28 μ ln 1 1 33 pe ln μ f 1 σ f 2 μ f 2 2 2 g function as suggested by eq 16 the g function is actually the analytical solution to δ t in the limiting case as p e at time t r f τ for a given contaminant advection time τ with λ 0 it is therefore the impulse response function of the fracture matrix system in the case of a plug flow involving advection matrix diffusion and sorption without however hydrodynamic dispersion and local reaction liu et al 2018 meng et al 2018 as a result t p t r f τ in the definition of the g function in eq 16 can be understood as the contaminant residence time in the porous matrix since 0 g t p g τ d t p 1 the g function in eq 16 can also be seen as a probability density function of the residence time distribution of the contaminant in the matrix given a contaminant advection time τ i e p t p τ the cumulative distribution function of t p is then given by 29 p t p τ erfc g τ 2 t p 2 3 k function as defined in eq 17 the k function is an exponential function involving only the first order rate constant it describes the loss of contaminant mass due solely to local reaction for this reason φ as defined in eq 19 can be seen as a modified f function whereas γ in eq 20 is the modified g function when the first order reactions are accounted for in addition it is noted that k t λ varies in a range from 0 to 1 as a result k function can be regarded as a cumulative distribution function of the reaction time it may be used to describe the time t r e c when local reaction takes place making the contaminant disappear to give 30 t rec ln u 0 1 λ where u 0 1 denotes a uniform distribution between zero and unity 2 4 c f function as detailed in liu et al 2018 for a conservative contaminant the c f function i e c f t λ f λ p 0 in eq 21 is actually a convolution of f and g functions since the f and g functions work on different systems involving different mechanisms of retardation as discussed above evaluation of the f and g functions alone allow us to consider the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion and matrix diffusion on contaminant transport separately this decoupling is equivalent to splitting the single fracture matrix system shown in fig 1 into two subsystems with different mechanisms as shown in fig 2 a the integral form of c f t λ f λ p 0 couples then all the transport processes together by performing a convolution of f and g functions in more general cases when local reactions considered eq 18 suggests that c f is a convolution of φ and γ functions as discussed above the φ function can be understood as the output of a fracture only system involving local reaction when the f function is taken as the input the γ function can likewise be seen as the response to the g function when local reaction in the matrix is accounted for as a result the decoupling concept we observed in the limiting case still holds and the single fracture matrix system can still be divided into two subsystems with different mechanism as shown in fig 2 b on the other hand we notice previously that f τ p τ and g t p g τ p t p τ the product of f and g functions i e p τ p t p τ gives p t p the joint probability density function of t and τ due to t p t r f τ this allows us to follow the probability theory miller and childers 2012 to take the impulse response function i e c f t λ f λ p 0 as a marginal probability density function p τ t of t the residence time of contaminant through the fracture matrix system i e 31 c f t λ f λ p 0 p τ t thus the statistical interpretations of f g and c f t λ 0 coincide entirely with the idea of the time domain random walk tdrw method delay and bodin 2001 painter et al 2008 in the evaluation of c f t λ f λ p 0 more importantly the similarity of c f and c f t λ f λ p 0 in the convolution form makes it possible to extend this probability consideration into general cases by accounting for the modification of k on both f and g functions i e to write 32 c f t p τ t where p τ t is not a probability density function but a modified form of p τ t by accounting for the effect of k function as can be understood from the difference between eqs 18 and 21 3 numerical implementations in estimation of contaminant concentration in the fracture in general the solution to c f t can be numerically evaluated by three methods the simplest and the most accurate one is to perform an inverse laplace transform on eq 9 numerically by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 this method is not only easily implemented but also readily extended into the case where the transport path consists of a series of piecewise constant channels along each of which the surrounding media have constant geological properties mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the disadvantage of this method is however in that it is not applicable to the cases where the geological properties of the channels or surrounding media suddenly change painter et al 2020 the second method is to apply gaussian quadrature directly on eq 18 in which the upper limit of the integration can further be reduced by use of the properties of the heaviside step function in eq 16 for the g function to give 33 c f t 0 t r f φ r f τ λ f γ r t p g τ λ p d τ this method can be successful for a single fracture with only 20 gaussian points liu et al 2018 but difficult to be applied to a transport path consisting of numerous channels not to mention the case where the channels change with time in their geological properties the third method is the one we discuss in detail in this section i e to apply the tdrw algorithm to evaluate c f t numerically in a monte carlo way delay and bodin 2001 bodin et al 2003 this method can tackle all the problems associated with the first and second approaches by envisaging the contaminant plume as an ensemble of contaminant particles the larger the number of the contaminant particles the greater the accuracy of the result this implies that a channel fracture network often requires a large number of contaminant particles otherwise the breakthrough curves obtained would be fluctuated somehow originally the tdrw method was proposed by applying the lagrange approach on the fokker plank formalism of the advection dispersion equation in free water or equivalently in the fracture only system delay and bodin 2001 painter et al 2008 when applied to the fracture matrix system a parameter ϱ defined as retardation factor has to be introduced to account for the delay caused by matrix diffusion as compared to pure advection delay and bodin 2001 while the efficacy of this retardation factor based approach has been demonstrated it is lack of sound physical reasoning by defining ϱ as the ratio between the characteristic time considering advection and matrix diffusion and that of pure advection our tdrw method stems however from discussion on the statistical properties of the f g and c f t functions with eq 31 as the core it avoids definition of the retardation factor ϱ as did by delay and bodin 2001 but records directly the arrival time of each contaminant particle at the outlet of the fracture to determine the cumulative distribution function of contaminant residence time t for this sake we have introduced four time concepts as discussed above the first one is the contaminant advection time τ which relates to the velocity the contaminant advects with water as a result of hydrodynamic dispersion the probability distribution of τ is described by the f function the second one is the contaminant residence time r f τ along the fracture the third one is the contaminant residence time t p in the porous matrix the probability distribution of which is given by the g function the last one is the reaction time t r e c which determines the time the reaction takes place either along the fracture or in the matrix the probability distribution of t r e c is determined by the k function the idea behind our tdrw algorithm is therefore to first evaluate τ and hence r f τ for each of contaminant particles by use of a random number acting on eq 24 or preferably eq 25 and then t p also by a random number acting on eq 29 this would be sufficient to calculate the contaminant residence time t for each particle through the fracture matrix system in the case of a conservative contaminant to be specific our tdrw algorithm for the conservative case with λ 0 can be assembled by following eq 21 or equivalently eq 31 as 1 denote a unit mass of contaminant injected at the inlet of fracture with n particles 2 for each particle sample a random number z from a normal distribution and then determine contaminant advection time τ from a variant form of eq 25 to give τ exp μ l n z σ l n 3 sample a random number u from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then determine the contaminant residence time t p in the matrix from eq 29 to give t p g τ 2 e r f c 1 u 2 with the use of τ obtained in step 2 4 calculate the contaminant arrival time t s r f τ t p 5 repeat from step 2 to 4 a total of n times 6 find all particles with t s smaller than a specific time t the total number of these particles n s is then determined the result of n s n for a series of observation times gives thus the heaviside response function 7 use the algorithm of e g the adaptive kernel density estimation botev et al 2010 to differentiate numerically the heaviside response function with respect to time giving the impulse response function c f t compared with the algorithm proposed by delay and bodin 2001 our tdrw method does not modify the velocity of advection u by a fictitious retardation factor ϱ which is used to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant advection time τ instead we determine τ in a fracture only system as if the hydrodynamic dispersion of contaminant particles is a result of advection with different water velocities this allows us to relate the contaminant residence time in the matrix t p directly to τ in the place of the water residence time t w and to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant travel time separately on the other hand it is noticed that our tdrw algorithm is nearly identical to that established by painter et al 2008 the proposed algorithm has however different physical origins and it is based firmly on the statistical properties of f and g functions as well as the interpretation of c f t λ f λ p 0 as a marginal probability distribution when the first order reactions are taken into account only step 4 is needed to update by following eq 18 or equivalently eq 32 to address the effect of k on the particle travel time i e 4 sample two random numbers u f and u p from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then calculate the contaminant reaction times in the fracture and matrix respectively from eq 30 to give t r e c f l n u f λ f and t r e c p l n u p λ p only in the case of r f τ t r e c f and t p t r e c p the contaminant travel time is determined as t s r f τ t p otherwise set t s to be infinity to make the particle disappear in the system this modification originates from the update of f and g functions by the k function and therefore in the case of λ f λ p 0 it reduces to the original version of step 4 for a single transport path consisting of a series of piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties along each channel mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 our tdrw algorithm can be applied directly without any extra efforts i e to record just the travel time of each particle along the path once the breakthrough curve for either heaviside step or dirac delta injection is obtained for a given location x the concentration at a time of interest say t can readily be determined by the method of linear interpolation if this procedure is repeated for a series of x along the fracture the result would give directly the distribution profile at time t 4 numerical implementations in estimation of contaminant concentration in the matrix in some cases the contaminant concentration in the matrix is also required to be evaluated giving e g the concentration distribution within matrix for this or other purposes one can also apply the three methods that we used for calculating c f t the first method is to perform the inverse laplace transform to eq 10 numerically by use of e g de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 the second method is to apply the gaussian quadrature directly on the analytical solution of c p t which can be obtained by following the same steps as deriving c f t but taking eq 10 as a starting point the result is 34 c p t 0 φ r f τ λ f γ t r f τ g τ r p t m λ p d τ with 35 γ t r f τ g τ r p t m λ p g t r f τ g τ r p t m k t r f τ λ p clearly c p t also takes a form of convolution in terms of φ and γ functions as c f t does the γ function now depends however additionally on r p t m or z as indicated in eq 35 in the limiting case of λ f λ p 0 φ and γ function also reduce to f and g function respectively and then c p t becomes 36 c p t λ f λ p 0 0 f τ g t r f τ g τ r p t m d τ with 37 g t r f τ g τ r p t m g τ r p t m 2 π t r f τ 3 exp g τ r p t m 2 4 t r f τ h t r f τ as a result c f t can be seen as a special case of c p t with z b since we have defined t p t r f τ and 0 g t p g τ r p t m d t p 1 the g function as given in eq 37 can still be considered as a probability density function for the residence time distribution of the contaminant in the matrix given a contaminant time τ and a characteristic diffusion time t m the cumulative distribution function of t p then becomes 38 p t p τ t m erfc g τ r p t m 2 t p the analysis suggests therefore that our tdrw algorithm can also be applied to estimate the concentration distribution within the matrix with only minor modification on step 3 in the algorithm outlined above i e 3 sample a random number u from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 and then determine the contaminant residence time t p in the matrix from eq 38 to give t p g τ r p t m 2 e r f c 1 u 2 for a given z or t m with the use of τ obtained in step 2 this gives the evolution of contaminant concentration at a given point x z it follows that the linear interpolation approach can also be used to yield the concentration at the time of interest t repeating this procedure for a multitude of points in the matrix would then result in the concentration profile within the matrix at time t 5 verification and discussion in synthetic cases to demonstrate the accuracy of our tdrw algorithm three cases are considered against the numerical solution of inverse laplace transform of eq 9 or by use of de hoog algorithm de hoog et al 1982 5 1 case one nuclide transport in a fracture matrix system the nuclide transport in a fractured rock is influenced by advection hydrodynamic dispersion surface retardation matrix diffusion and sorption meng et al 2018 liu et al 2018 they may also decay in the system with the decay constant independent of position this implies that the first order rate constants of the nuclide in fracture and matrix are identical and both are equal to the decay constant for this case we have made simulations with x 20 m b 50 μ m u 0 1 m d d f 1 6 10 9 m 2 s r f 5 d p 1 6 10 10 m 2 s ε p 0 01 r p 10 and considered three nuclides with decay constants tabulated in table 1 as presented in fig 3 a for the case of heaviside step injection and fig 3 b for the case of dirac delta injection the simulation results of the tdrw algorithm all agree excellently with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian solution from the numerical quadrature of eq 18 the difference between these three methods lies only in the computation efficiency the computational time of the tdrw algorithm with 10 000 particles is nearly identical to that of the inverse laplace transform solution but much shorter than that of the gaussian quadrature solution the reason for the long time required for the gaussian solution is due mainly to the evaluation of the integral by use of adaptive gauss kronrod quadrature kronrod 1965 with 50 gauss points the tdrw algorithm involves however no integrations but simple algebraic calculations making it much more efficient in computation in addition it should be stressed that the results shown in fig 3 b is obtained simply by applying the algorithm of the adaptive kernel density estimation botev et al 2010 to differentiate the heaviside response function given in fig 3 a with respect to time as can be seen this numerical method of differentiation gives the impulse response function as good as that obtained from the inverse laplace transform method on the condition that sufficient particles and observation times have been used moreover we can also estimate the contaminant concentration along the fracture and in the matrix with the application of our tdrw algorithm to verify this a test for radionuclide b at t 50 y r with 10 000 particles applied has been performed and the results for the case of heaviside step injection and dirac delta injection are shown in fig 4 a and fig 4 b respectively as presented in fig 4 the simulation results of the tdrw algorithm all agree excellently with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian solution this indicates that the proposed algorithm works well for the problem of estimating contaminant concentration along the fracture or in the matrix 5 2 case two colloid transport in a fracture matrix system for colloid transport in a fractured rock it is different from nuclide transport in that no decay is involved but deposition instead zhang et al 2012 in fact as the primary retention mechanism for colloid transport deposition is a two step process in which both electrostatics and hydrodynamics play important roles yosri et al 2020 it might be reversible or irreversible james and chrysikopoulos 2003 but only significant in the fracture while negligible in the porous matrix when considered to be irreversible colloid deposition is often described as a first order reaction with a constant deposition coefficient κ abdel salam and chrysikopoulos 1994 this is equivalent to defining the first order rate constants as λ f κ u 2 b 2 and λ p 0 in our governing equations for this case yosri et al 2020 also established a tdrw algorithm by following the idea of delay and bodin 2001 the only modification was made on the probability density function of colloid travel time along the fracture which is obtained from the analytical solution to the advection dispersion equation in free water that accounts for colloid deposition instead of eq 12 this algorithm can be regarded as a modified version of tdrw originally proposed by delay and bodin 2001 but not as general as our algorithm to demonstrate the applicability of our tdrw approach to colloid transport we considered the same case as studied by yosri et al 2020 x 5 m b 62 5 μ m u 1 m y r d f 0 25 m 2 y r r f 1 d p 1 29 10 5 m 2 y r ε p 0 01 r p 1 the values of the deposition coefficient κ and the corresponding λ f are tabulated in table 2 as shown in fig 5 a for the case of dirac delta injection the simulation results of our tdrw algorithm with 12 000 particles applied also make an excellent agreement with those obtained from the inverse laplace transform solution and the gaussian quadrature solution this indicates that our tdrw algorithm also works well for the situation of colloid transport it is superior to the gaussian solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense if we switch λ f and λ p values to explore the consequence of the assumption of colloid deposition only in the porous matrix even though it might be impossible in practice yosri et al 2020 earlier and less dispersed breakthrough curves are observed in fig 5 b compared to the results shown in fig 5 a for the corresponding cases this is reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks are attributed mainly to the mechanisms governing colloid transport along the fracture if no colloid is deposited in the fracture more colloidal particles would be advected by water to arrive at the outlet of fracture earlier making the breakthrough curves less spreading than the case of deposition solely along the fracture the similarity of the results shown in fig 5 a and fig 5 b suggests however that one should first determine by other means whether colloid deposition really occurs along the fracture or in the matrix prior to using the model to interpret the experimental results on the other hand it should be emphasized that the experimental study of dirac delta injection is more favorable over the case of heaviside step injection because the fine features observed in the breakthrough curves in the former case would be smeared out in the latter case notably even though the local reaction rates discussed above are different however either λ f or λ p in the shown cases is zero which makes the applicability of the obtained conclusion limited to address this problem we additionally performed two groups of simulations 12000 particles used where colloid is considered to deposit in both fracture and matrix i e different ratios of λ f and λ p are applied while λ f is kept a constant similar to the differences of the performances of the curves between fig 5 a and b more retarded and spreading the breakthrough curves are found to be in fig 6 b with λ f 3 2 10 1 1 y r for the corresponding cases compared with the results in fig 6 a with λ f 1 28 10 2 1 y r this is reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks are dominated mainly by the mechanisms governing colloid transport along the fracture if the amount of colloid deposited in the fracture is more i e larger λ f fewer colloidal particles would be advected by water to arrive at the outlet of fracture earlier making the breakthrough curves more spreading than the case of smaller λ f in addition the influence of colloid deposition in the matrix on the colloid transport is more and more significant with the increase of ratio as shown in either fig 6 a and b this is also reasonable however because the height and position of the peaks becomes attributed mainly to the mechanisms governing colloid transport in the matrix once λ f does not change also the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture and in the matrix can be estimated by applying the tdrw algorithm as presented in fig 7 the distribution profiles of colloid b at different depths for t 50 y r with 12 000 particles used for the case of λ f 0 and λ p 0 are in good agreement with each other this indicates that our tdrw algorithm also works well for the situation of colloid transport 5 3 case three colloid transport in a complicated fracture matrix system to verify if our tdrw algorithm is still applicable to a more complicated case we consider that the path of colloid transport consists of three piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties along each channel based on the data used in case two the parameters we have changed for each of the channels are tabulated in table 3 since the solution to c f t as given in eq 18 cannot directly be extended to this general case the gaussian solution is not available we can however still apply the inverse laplace transform method to obtain the results as did by mahmoudzadeh et al 2014 the assumption behind is that the solution in laplace domain or the analytical solution obtained from an infinite length fracture can reasonably be used to approximate the evolution of contaminant concentration at a given point of observation downstream a fracture with a length of sufficiently large this is actually a common practice in performing the safety assessment of deep geological repositories for simplicity in addition since our concern here is mainly to show the potential ability of our tdrw algorithm we restricted ourselves only to the case of an embedding matrix with an infinite extent as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the breakthrough curves of the tdrw algorithm and the inverse laplace transform solution is still excellent even in the case most of colloids have been deposited along the fracture the only price we have then paid is to increase the number of particles used in the tdrw algorithm a bit e g 15 000 particles in addition the tdrw method for estimating the concentration distribution along the fracture or within the matrix can also be applicable to a more complicated case as validated in fig 9 for the distribution profiles of colloid b at different depths with t 50 y r a good agreement between inverse laplace transform solution and tdrw algorithm can also be achieved especially in the case of increasing the number of particles in the simulations e g 15 000 particles although both tdrw algorithm and the inverse laplace transform approach work well for this or similar cases it should be noted that inverse laplace transform approach is not valid when the geological properties of transport path suddenly change with time this implies that the inverse laplace transform method is limited in its applicability by contrast our tdrw approach can be adapted somehow to simulate even the situation of glacial rebound or climate change by considering the distribution of contaminant particles in the porous matrix as attempted by painter et al 2020 this work will be done and presented in the near future 6 conclusion in this contribution we extended the model of tang et al 1981 and liu et al 2018 to accomodate the problem of colloid transport in a single fracture matrix system i e to account for the first order reactions with different rate constants in fracture and matrix the solution to this generalized model also takes a form of convolution similar to that developed by liu et al 2018 with three functions as a basis to consider different transport mechanisms separately the first function denoted as f function can be seen as the probability density function of contaminant advection time the second function denoted as g function can be seen as the probability density function of contaminant residence time in the matrix for a given advection time the third function denoted as k function can be regarded as the cumulative density function of contaminant reaction time to make the contaminant disappear or deposit in the fracture matrix system the k function can further be split into two parts acting on f and g functions respectively the statistical interpretation of the f g and k functions allows us to develop a new tdrw algorithm to estimate the contaminant concentration at the outlet of the fracture compared to the one originally proposed by delay and bodin 2001 and latter extended by yosri et al 2020 our tdrw algorithm avoid not only the modification of the velocity of advection by a fictitious retardation factor which is used to account for the effect of matrix diffusion on contaminant travel time but also the modification of the probability density function of colloid travel time along the fracture to consider the effect of colloid deposition all these facts make our tdrw algorithm superior to the one developed by delay and bodin 2001 and yosri et al 2020 on the other hand it is noticed that our tdrw algorithm is nearly identical to that established by painter et al 2008 nevertheless our approach has very different physical and statistical origins and it can easily be extended to general cases where the rate constants of the first order reactions are different in the fracture and matrix moreover our algorithm bears all the advantages of tdrw approach as compared to the inverse laplace transform method and the gaussian quadrature method it can even be applied to address the problems of contaminant transport through a channel network or fracture network where each of the transport paths consists of piecewise constant channels with surrounding media having constant geological properties no matter if the geological properties of each fracture matrix segment keep constant or suddenly change due to e g glacial rebound in addition our algorithm can also be used to determine the distribution profile of contaminant concentration along the fracture and contaminant concentration in the matrix to demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of our tdrw algorithm three benchmark cases are considered for either nuclide or colloid transport through a fractured rock the comparisons suggest that the tdrw algorithm is superior to the gaussian quadrature solution but similar to inverse laplace transform solution in computational expense when nearly identical results are obtained from three approaches however the monte carlo nature of the tdrw algorithm implies that the larger the number of the contaminant particles used the greater the accuracy of the computational result as a consequence for a channel fracture network in pa scale it often requires a large number of contaminant particles otherwise the results obtained would be fluctuated somehow this is perhaps the sole drawback of the tdrw algorithm 7 data availability
