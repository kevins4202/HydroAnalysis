1835,considering the need of characterizing temporal dynamic of groundwater and the lack of available methods we investigate the feasibility of active distributed temperature sensing dts measurements to monitor and quantify groundwater fluxes variations over time active dts which consists here of heating a fiber optic fo cable and in monitoring the temperature elevation has proven to be very efficient to quantify the spatial distribution of groundwater fluxes in saturated porous media at high resolution with low uncertainties however the approach has never been tested to continuously monitor groundwater fluxes changes to test this we rely on both numerical simulations and sandbox experiments to assess the sensitivity of temperature elevation to variable flow conditions and our ability to interpret associated temperature variations results confirm that the temperature elevation and evolution over time is sensitive to flow conditions and that associated temperature variations can be used to characterize groundwater fluxes variations first experimental and numerical results show that when a flow change is followed by a long enough steady state flow period the temperature stabilizes independently of previous fluxes conditions in such case the stabilization temperature can easily be interpreted to estimate groundwater fluxes using the analytical model commonly used under steady flow conditions to interpret active dts measurements furthermore we demonstrate here that under certain flow conditions depending on the nature of flow variations the approach offers the possibility of continuously monitoring fluxes variations for instantaneous flow changes it is even possible to go further by reproducing temperature signal variations over time by applying the superposition principle to the analytical model in the end these preliminary tests are particularly promising and open new perspectives for monitoring and or quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes at different temporal scales including diurnal and short term periodic fluxes variations keywords groundwater flow monitoring groundwater dynamics heat tracer experiment active dts heated fiber optic cable data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the characterization of groundwater fluxes is challenging in many hydrogeological contexts hermans et al 2022 in particular for characterizing the temporal variabilities of flows at compartment interfaces which remains particularly critical for instance in coastal sediments transient flow conditions influence the ecosystem productivity and its biogeochemistry robinson et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 while temporal variabilities in groundwater surface water interactions induce biogeochemical hot moments within the hyporheic zone mcclain et al 2003 boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 the monitoring of groundwater fluxes at different depths during a pumping test would be also very useful to image flow variability and sub surface heterogeneities pouladi et al 2021b the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater fluxes depends on many natural or man induced mechanisms which induce fluctuations in groundwater levels at different time scales freeze and cherry 1979 jiménez martínez et al 2013 short lived fluctuations can typically be observed during the recharge of highly heterogeneous systems ghasemizadeh et al 2012 pouladi et al 2021b while diurnal variations can occur for instance as the result of evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure effects or else tidal effects ataie ashtiani et al 2001 paepen et al 2020 leroux et al 2021 groundwater recharge through infiltration freeze 1974 and bank storage effects near streams winter et al 1998 boano et al 2013 harvey and gooseff 2015 can induce seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels while climate changes and many human activities such as groundwater pumping artificial recharge agricultural irrigation and drainage or else geotechnical drainage induce short term as well as long term fluctuations of groundwater levels freeze and cherry 1979 hancock 2002 de graaf et al 2019 many approaches have been tested for monitoring and quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes in saturated porous media some of them including isotopic tracers burnett et al 2006 garcia orellana et al 2021 or the use of piezometers freeze cherry 1979 only provide averaged values of fluxes over large spatial scales which are not representative of their spatial variability induced by heterogeneities in coastal environments the use of geophysical methods was proposed to assess freshwater fluxes over a tidal cycle dimova et al 2012 folch et al 2020 or seasonal variations in submarine groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone paepen et al 2020 while such methods are suitable to investigate subsurface structures and heterogeneities binley et al 2015 brunner et al 2017 they remain limited for continuous monitoring of groundwater fluxes due to relatively long data acquisition times specific methods based on tracer experiments like the borehole dilution method drost et al 1968 pitrak et al 2007 or the finite volume point dilution method brouyère et al 2008 also appear to be promising techniques for the continuous monitoring of groundwater fluxes jamin et al 2015 jamin and brouyère 2018 however their use provides a spatially averaged value of fluxes over the well length or over the volume investigated and would require repeating point measurements at different depths to investigate the flow distribution heat has also been efficiently used as tracer of groundwater fluxes in many contexts to study vertical fluxes and their temporal dynamics anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2019 passive heat tracing experiments rely on the continuous monitoring of natural temperature variations within the saturated subsurface during several days weeks or months even if the use of passive tracer experiments allows quantifying groundwater flow variations over time analytical and numerical models commonly used to interpret temperature time series generally assume constant daily fluxes hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 constantz 2008 briggs et al 2012 this means that passive experiments only provide an averaged daily value of groundwater fluxes and are not suited for characterizing groundwater fluxes variations occurring at shorter time scale very recent developments discussed the feasibility of monitoring transient flows from temperature depth profiles lin et al 2022 however such approach does not provide fluxes spatial distributions and estimates are dependent of natural temperature variations which limits the applicability of the method in many environments the development of fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts technology providing continuous temperature data along fiber optic cables at high spatial and temporal resolution largely enhanced the use of heat as groundwater tracer for environmental applications selker et al 2006 tyler et al 2009 shanafield et al 2018 its use can be well suited to characterize diurnal temporal flow variations as demonstrated by henderson et al 2009 but also to qualitatively study seasonal and temporal fluctuations of groundwater discharge into surface water slater et al 2010 sebok et al 2013 matheswaran et al 2014 however the approach does not allow characterizing short scale variations of groundwater fluxes and quantifying groundwater fluxes through passive dts measurements remains difficult and uncertain le lay et al 2019 simon et al 2022 recent developments have shown that active dts performs very well for investigating the spatial distribution of groundwater fluxes over a large range of values at an unprecedented high spatial resolution simon et al 2021 active dts methods consist of continuously recording the temperature changes induced by a heat source applied along a fiber optic fo cable the difference of temperature measured between a heated and a non heated fo cable directly depends on the flow rate read et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 sayde et al 2015 bense et al 2016 simon et al 2021 since the temperature increase measured during heat injection directly depends on groundwater fluxes any change in groundwater flow occurring during the heating period should result in a change in temperature variation therefore the method should be well suited for continuously monitoring groundwater flow variations this assumption is supported by the fact that sayde et al 2015 used actively heated fiber optics for continuously monitoring wind speed changes over time and therefore demonstrated that the temperature elevation measured during heating experiments is sensitive to wind speed variations few studies investigated the interest of repeating active dts measurements under different hydrological conditions to study thermal properties changes or groundwater fluxes variability abesser et al 2020 munn et al 2020 but the approach has never been used to continuously monitor groundwater flow variations with time all previous applications of active dts have been performed under steady state flow conditions during the heating period in this study we therefore propose to investigate the potential of active dts measurements for continuously monitoring groundwater fluxes changes over time in fully saturated media the main objective is to verify if the temperature evolution measured during heating injection is sensitive to groundwater flow variations transient flow conditions an increase of groundwater flux should lead to a decrease of temperature groundwater flow dissipating more efficiently the artificial heat injected and vice versa the question of the shape duration of the flow change will also be investigated we aim to understand how instantaneous progressive and periodic flow changes will affect the thermal response for doing so we first rely on simple theoretical developments that are complemented by numerical simulations and sandbox experiments numerical modeling is used to validate the theoretical developments and to simulate the effect of flow fluctuations on the thermal response in various conditions then we rely on an experimental validation by achieving active dts measurements in a sandbox by associating theoretical developments numerical modeling and laboratory experiments we aim to verify the potentiality and the limitations of active dts experiments for monitoring groundwater flows at high spatial resolution 2 material methods 2 1 mathematical and theoretical formulation 2 1 1 background among active dts experiments our interest in this study is a recently used setup which consists of electrically heating a fo cable through its steel armoring while continuously monitoring the elevation in temperature all along the heated section using the fo inside the cable in such configuration a single fo cable is used as a heat source and as a temperature measurement tool bense et al 2016 read et al 2014 selker selker 2018 simon et al 2021 in this case as recently shown by simon et al 2021 and del val et al 2021 and illustrated in fig 1 the total temperature increase δt is the result of two terms δ t δ t fo δ t pm 1 δtfo is the result of the heat storage and heat conduction occurring within the fo cable the electrical heating induces indeed a relatively large increase of temperature during the early period of heating t tc note that tc corresponds to the limit beyond which the temperature elevation is no longer affected by the heat conduction and storage through the fo cable δtfo is maximum and constant for t tc as soon as the heat produced reaches the surrounding material the temperature increase is controlled by heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media surrounding the fo cable which both dissipate a part of the heat produced the associated temperature rise δtpm depends on both thermal conductivity and darcy velocity for sufficient long times heat conduction and advection may fully dissipate the heat produced leading to the temperature stabilization δtf the higher the groundwater flux the lower the temperature of stabilization and the faster steady conditions are reached fig 1 if q 0 no groundwater flow the temperature keeps increasing gradually and never stabilizes carslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 simon et al 2021 δtfo depends on the heating rate power and on the thermal properties of the heating cable and is independent of both the thermal properties of the material and the flow conditions as validated by simon et al 2021 the evolution of δtpm can be modelled over time using the moving instantaneous line source mils model initially developed by carslaw and jaeger 1959 by considering an initial thermal equilibrium t0 the thermal response δtpm δt t t0 along the line source is given in x y direction by 2 δ t pm x y q 4 π λ exp qx 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c x 2 y 2 4 t d t exp ψ x 2 y 2 d t q 2 16 d t ψ ρ w 2 c w 2 ρ 2 c 2 d ψ ψ with q the uniform and constant groundwater flux in x direction or specific discharge m s 1 and q the constant and uniform heating rate power w m 1 the coordinates and y correspond to the distance from the heat source located at 0 and y 0 and ψ is a change of variable ρc is the volumetric heat capacity of the rock fluid matrix j m 3 k 1 and ρwcw the volumetric heat capacity of water j m 3 k 1 the parameter dt is the thermal diffusivity coefficient m2 s 1 and corresponds to the ratio between λ the bulk thermal conductivity w m 1 k 1 and ρc equation 2 can be simplified for t using the bessel function of second kind and order zero k0 diao et al 2004 des tombe et al 2019 δ t f q 2 π λ e x p qx 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c k 0 rq 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c 3 where δtf is the temperature stabilization note that this solution can be used only when temperature stabilization is reached for steady state hydraulic and thermal conditions 2 1 2 theoretical formulation for transient hydraulic conditions as illustrated in fig 1 the temperature increases δ t q 1 and δ t q 2 respectively associated to groundwater fluxes equals to q1 and q2 are given for any t tc by δ t q 1 t δ t fo δ t pm q 1 t 4 δ t q 2 t δ t fo δ t pm q 2 t 5 δ t pm q 1 and δ t pm q 2 correspond to temperature rises associated to heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media for groundwater fluxes respectively equals to q1 and q2 and can be calculated using the analytical form equation 2 for thermal steady state conditions δtpm can be modelled using equation 3 which means that equations 4 and 5 become for late time δ t q 1 t δ t fo δ t f q 1 4 a δ t q 2 t δ t fo δ t f q 2 5 a the heat conduction through the fo cable inducing the temperature increase δ t fo only occurs for short time and is independent of groundwater flux thus for late time we obtain by subtracting equations 4a and 5a δ t q 2 t δ t q 1 t δ t f q 2 δ t f q 1 6 equation 6 means that the difference of temperature stabilization for q1 and for q2 can easily be modelled using equation 2 it suggests that for a groundwater flux change from q1 to q2 and for long enough steady state conditions the temperature stabilizes depending on q 2 and that the temperature increase or decrease after the flow change directly equals to the difference between the temperature of stabilization observed for q1 under stationary flow conditions and the temperature of stabilization observed for q2 under stationary flow conditions then the temperature evolution in response to groundwater flow variations can be seen as the superposition of different hydrological conditions each one being described by the solution calculated for a given flow thus in theory the superposition principle could be applied to interpret temperature in varying groundwater flow conditions this means that the temperature following a sharp or sudden change q1 to q2 should be given for any t tc by δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t q 1 t δ t q 1 t δ t q 2 t 7 with t t t 1 t 1 being the time for which the change of groundwater flow occurs combining equation 7 with equations 4 and 5 leads to δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t fo δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t 8 if we assume that t 1 is larger than the time required to reach temperature stabilization for q q 1 equation 8 becomes δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t fo δ t f q 1 δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t 9 in other words equation 9 means that the evolution of the temperature after the change from q1 to q2 could be obtained by adding to the temperature recorded at t1 the difference of the temperature elevation associated to heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media for groundwater fluxes respectively equals to q1 and q2 note that temperature should increase if q1 q2 and decrease for q1 q2 if t1 is smaller than the time required to reach temperature stabilization equation 8 should be used instead of equation 7 but the same principle should apply and the change of flow should lead to a temperature change related to the difference δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t thus if we suppose a groundwater flux change from q1 to q2 occurring at t t1 we expect the following implications from equations 8 and 9 1 at late times after flow change t t 1 the temperature should stabilize depending on the last flux imposed q 2 and independently of previous fluxes conditions and temperature variations equation 4b consequently any temperature stabilization recorded during heating periods should reflect steady flow conditions and could be used to quantify associated groundwater fluxes 2 the temperature evolution after any flow change should be modeled by applying the superposition principle equation 8 or 9 this involves that besides the temperature stabilization at late times the temperature evolution in time could also be possibly used to quantify q2 2 1 3 objectives of the study to verify the previous developments we rely on experiments conducted in a sandbox where the flow rate can be controlled and changed during active dts measurements the temperature evolution is continuously recorded in response to successive flow rates to verify if the analytical solution mils can actually be used to model temperature changes over time and to quantify groundwater flow changes the question of the shape duration of the flow change should also be addressed we expect that the thermal response to flow change would be different in case of sharp and instantaneous flow change or in case of progressive flow change in both cases we want to investigate the time required to reach a new thermal steady regime after flow change theoretically the stabilization time should depend on q 2 since the smaller the flux the greater the time necessary to reach temperature stabilization simon et al 2021 likewise we aim to investigate the feasibility of monitoring periodic groundwater fluxes as observed in coastal aquifers for instance in theory if temperature evolution is sensitive to water flow changes we expect to observe a periodic temperature signal while flow changes periodically thus for progressive or periodic flow changes a critical point will be to define if temperature changes occur simultaneously to flow variations and therefore if the approach allows continuous and real time monitoring of flow variations with this in mind since flow changes that can be applied in the sandbox are quite limited we rely on numerical simulations to simulate active dts measurements conducted under transient flow conditions thermal responses to different scenarios of flow variations are modelled instantaneous progressive and periodic flow changes to investigate the effect of flow changes rate on temperature evolution 2 2 numerical modeling 2 2 1 numerical model to simulate heat transfer occurring in a porous media during active dts measurements and to assess the effect of flow changes we use a 2d domain numerical model of flow and heat transport implemented in comsol multiphysics the multiphysics software comsol solves heat and flow transfers equations using finite element methods this model includes an explicit representation of fo cables used for field experiments brusens cables llk bste 85 c consisting of a steel core 1 13 mm radius λ 13 4 w m 1 k 1 and a plastic jacket 1 925 mm radius λ 0 245 w m 1 k 1 a heat source term is added in the steel core and simulations are run by fixing the electrical power input injected along the fo cable at 35 w m 1 the domain is modeled as a rectangle whose size is fixed at 3 1 m and the heat source is applied at 1 m of the laminar inflow boundary condition the flow being lengthwise we ensured that the heat produced does not reach the domain boundaries for any flow conditions tested in this study the thermal conductivity of the porous media is fixed at λ 1 1 w m 1 k 1 and its volumetric heat capacity at ρc 3 106 j m 3 k 1 this model has already been used in a previous study to understand the thermal processes controlling the temperature increase measured along a heated fo simon et al 2021 its use allowed validating the data interpretation framework presented in the section 2 1 1 background and the use of the mils model equation 2 to estimate groundwater fluxes however the model has up to now always been used in steady state fluid flow conditions here simulations were performed by considering transient flow conditions during heating periods 2 2 2 sharp and progressive groundwater flow changes firstly sharp or progressive groundwater flow variations from q1 to q2 have been simulated as shown in fig 2 the temperature elevation is first simulated considering steady state fluid flow conditions by applying a constant and uniform flow q1 after several hours of heating a sharp or progressive flow change is simulated to reach a lower flow rate q2 in order to assess the effect of the flow change rate and of the flow change intensity on temperature variations different scenarios are considered as detailed in fig 2 case 1 simulates a groundwater flow decrease from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 1 2 10 5 m s 1 while case 2 simulates a groundwater flow decrease from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 3 2 10 5 m s 1 in both cases the change of flow is occurring three hours after the start of the heat injection once temperature stabilisation has already been reached for flow q1 for each case the applied flow change from q1 to q2 is either instantaneous and so very sharp blue line or smoothed and progressive along time with transition periods varying between 30 min and 8 h with these two cases modeling focuses on assessing the effect of the difference between q1 and q2 on temperature evolutions and on comparing the flow change rate with the temperature change rate besides it has been proven in steady state flow conditions that a gradual and continuous temperature rise during heating period without temperature stabilization at late times occurs in case of no groundwater flux diao et al 2004 simon et al 2021 thus after a change from flow to no flow conditions it can be expected that the temperature evolution shows a similar behaviour and that a continual temperature rise would be observed under no flow conditions to address this point a complementary simulation is run to simulate a change from flow conditions q1 1 2 10 5 m s 1 to no flow conditions q2 0 m s 1 2 2 3 periodic hydraulic flow variations the second set of simulations consists of simulating periodic groundwater flow variations for these simulations the period of the sine signal is set to 12 h 1 43200 hz approximating the period of tidal cycles 12 4 h for the first case with sine variations the amplitude of the signal is 2 4 10 5 m s 1 and flow vary between 1 2 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 fig 6a for the second one a smaller amplitude is considered 8 10 6 m s 1 with fluxes varying between 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 fig 6b 2 3 laboratory tests active dts measurements were carried out during sandbox laboratory experiments the experimental setup consisted of burying a heatable fo cable in a sandbox in which flow rates can be well controlled the sandbox is a 0 576 m3 pvc tank open at the top 1 6 m long 1 2 m width and 0 3 m height and filled with 0 4 1 3 mm diameter quartz sand fig 3 a the height of water in reservoirs on two sides of the sandbox can be manually adjusted to control the hydraulic gradient and thus the water flow through the sand the flow through the sandbox is considered homogeneous and the average hydraulic conductivity is estimated equal to 3x10 3 m s 1 the fo cable buried in the sandbox is a 3 8 mm diameter cable containing 4 multimode 50 125 µm fibers brusens cable reference llk bste 85 c a 7 m section of this cable was electrically isolated and connected to an electrical allowing the injection of electricity from a power controller dts measurements were carried out with a silixa ultima s dts unit used in double ended configuration van de giesen et al 2012 and reporting temperature every 12 5 cm at a 20 s sampling interval 10 s per channel cold and warm baths were used to calibrate temperature measurements fig 3a the relative uncertainty of measurements was estimated to 0 03 c while absolute uncertainty was estimated equal to 0 15 c the effective spatial resolution of the unit was experimentally estimated during heating periods to be between 51 and 67 cm simon et al 2020 a succession of active dts measurements was already conducted under steady state flow conditions using this setup and associated measurements have already been the subject of two precedent studies simon et al 2020 simon et al 2021 for this study the heatable section of the fo cable was continuously energized for 29 h using a silixa heat pulse control system delivering a well controlled power intensity of 15 w m 1 along the heated section for the first 4 hrs of the heat injection the flux was held constant and estimated at 3 37 10 5 m s 1 fig 3b then a three step decrease of the groundwater flow was applied until no flow condition q 0 was reached at the end of the experiment the water fluxes associated to each step are noted q1 q2 q3 and q4 in practice the flow through the sandbox is changed by manually decreasing the height of water in the inlet reservoir which induces a decrease of the hydraulic gradient and thus of the water flux it involves for each change a period of transient flow conditions before a new steady state condition is reached the duration of these transient flow conditions periods is difficult to assess since hydraulic heads changes are not monitored however from the observations made during the experiment we consider steady state flow is reached in approximatively 30 min after flow changes which is consistent with the permeability estimated 3 results 3 1 numerical modeling 3 1 1 sharp and progressive flow changes fig 4 presents temperature transients modelled for case 1 fig a and b and for case 2 fig c and d for the first case the heat injection at t 0 induces a sharp increase of temperature fig 4a the temperature stabilizes rapidly in around 25 min at 17 42 c depending on experimental conditions thermal properties of fo cable power injected on thermal properties of the porous media but especially on flux q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 after three hours of heating a groundwater flow decrease is modelled to reach q2 1 2 10 5 m s 1 it induces an increase of temperature which is in perfect agreement with expectations for lower groundwater flow heat produced is less dissipated by advection leading to a temperature increase in this case independently of the duration of the hydraulic transition period the temperature increases and stabilizes at 21 26 c which corresponds to the temperature stabilization predicted by the model considering steady flow conditions q2 for the whole heating period dotted grey line thus the temperature stabilization after the flow change clearly depends on the groundwater flow q2 however the duration of the hydraulic transition period also affects the temperature variations and the duration of thermal transition period as detailed in fig 4b which shows temperature evolutions modelled after the start of the flow change δt is calculated here as the difference between the temperature simulated for any t 3 h and the temperature at t 3 h corresponding to the stabilization temperature for q1 for an instantaneous and sharp flow change blue line the temperature elevation does not instantaneously stabilize but progressively increases up to reaching stabilization approximately 3 h after the flow change in this case the superposition principle can be used equation 7 to reproduce the temperature change observed after the flow change results are not shown here to not overload the figure for simulations considering smoothed transition periods of 30 min orange line 1 h yellow line 2 h green line and 4 h brown line results show that reaching steady temperature conditions is longer than reaching steady flow conditions temperature and flow changes are not simultaneous and the temperature response is delayed however although difficult to observe in fig 4b because of the logscale that compress the late times when the transition period increases the delay between the temperature stabilization and the flow stabilization decreases thus if the hydraulic transition period lasts 4 h the temperature stabilization is reached in 4h45min for longer transition periods see for instance purple line corresponding to an 8 hrs transition period the temperature stabilization is reached at the same time as the flow steady conditions meaning that temperature changes are occurring at the same rate as flow changes subsequently if flow changes are smoothed enough it becomes possible to monitor flow changes in real time for these cases using the simplest version of the superposition principle equation 7 does not allow reproducing the thermal response observed in response to flow change however regardless of the shape and duration of the transient flow stage the temperature systematically stabilizes depending on the value of q2 which means that the value of the temperature stabilization can be used to estimate q2 using the mils model equation 2 or its simplified version equation 3 fig 4c and d present thermal response to flow change from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 3 2 10 5 m s 1 temperature responses for the three first hours are similar to thermal responses presented in case 1 identical steady flow conditions then the flow change induces an increase of temperature but the temperature stabilization for this case is lower than case 1 17 81 c in agreement with a greater value of q2 actually as observed for case 1 the temperature stabilizes according to the temperature value expected for q2 dotted grey line this confirms that if steady flow conditions are long enough after the flow change thermal steady conditions temperature stabilization are reached independently of earlier flow conditions however the time required to reach the thermal stabilization depends on the rate of flow variations thus the temperature stabilizes faster for case 2 than for case 1 for an instantaneous flow change blue line temperature approximately stabilizes 18 min after the start of flow change against 3 h for case 1 likewise as soon as the transition period exceeds 1 h the temperature stabilization is reached at the same time as the flow steady conditions thus our results show that the duration of the transient temperature variations depends on the value of q2 but also on the intensity of flow variation the difference between q1 and q2 in complement to previous results simulations were run to simulate an instantaneous change applied at t 3hrs from flow conditions q1 1 2 10 5 m s 1 to no flow conditions q2 0 m s 1 in this case fig 5 the temperature rises progressively and almost 24 hrs are required so that the temperature elevation reaches the temperature curve modelled by considering no flow conditions for the whole heating period the absence of groundwater flow after the change means that heat dissipation occurs only through heat conduction which involves slow and less efficient heat transfers although no temperature stabilization occurs for late times the superposition principle equation 8 can efficiently be used to reproduce the temperature elevation observed after the flow change 3 1 2 periodic groundwater flow variations fig 6a and b present temperature responses modelled in response to periodic flow changes occurring during the heating period in this first case the period of the sine signal is set to 12 h with fluxes varying between 1 2x10 5 and 3 6x10 5 m s 1 blue line in fig 6a brown line corresponds to the associated temperature variations heating period starting at t 0 temperature oscillates between 17 42 and 21 18 c in response to flow changes an increase of flux inducing a temperature decrease and vice versa interestingly a delay in time 20 min can be observed between maximum temperature peaks and minimal fluxes fig 6a on the opposite minimum temperature peaks and maximal fluxes are perfectly synchronized actually as shown in fig 6b while groundwater flow is maximal and therefore the temperature elevation minimal the temperature elevation reaches 17 42 c which corresponds to the stabilization temperature of the model considering steady flow conditions and q 3 6 10 5 m s 1 however while groundwater flow is minimal and therefore the temperature elevation maximal the temperature elevation only reaches 21 18 c which is slightly less than the expected temperature the stabilization temperature of the model considering steady flow conditions and q 1 2 10 5 m s 1 being 21 3 c then the amplitude of the sine signal was decreased with fluxes varying between 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 associated results are presented in fig 6c and d in this case temperature oscillated between 17 42 and 18 26 c contrary to previous flow conditions peaks in temperature are perfectly synchronized with peaks in fluxes fig 6c a shown in fig 6d the minimum and maximum temperatures reached are in perfect agreement with stabilization temperatures obtained while considering steady flow conditions of 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 these results seem very promising concerning the applications of active dts measurements under transient flow conditions it suggests that while flow variations are smoothed temperature elevation changes occur simultaneously to flow variations and can therefore be used to continuously monitor and characterize transient flows these results suggest that the feasibility of monitoring fluxes depends on the values of q1 and q2 and on the difference between them 3 2 laboratory tests fig 7 shows the temperature increase δt measured along the fo cable in response to heat injection red line note that the temperature variations presented here were recorded along a section of the cable positioned perpendicular to the main flow direction at t t0 0 the electrical power is switched on the start of the heating period is associated to a rapid and sharp temperature change that reaches 8 8 c in 2 min after 16 min of heating the temperature stabilizes around 10 c meaning that the thermal steady state is reached at t t1 while the flow is decreased from q1 to q2 a significant temperature rise is measured the temperature first increases rapidly before stabilizing around 10 5 c then at t t2 while the flow is decreased from q2 to q3 another significant temperature rise is observed the temperature increases up to stabilizing at 10 9 c 1 h50 after the flow change finally at t t4 the water flow is turned off no flow conditions which induces a new temperature increase 3 2 1 modeling the temperature stabilization the first three flow changes applied during the heating period induced a transient thermal stage followed by a temperature stabilization stage at higher temperature following equation 5 a the temperature theoretically stabilizes at late times according to flow conditions occurring after each flow stage thus it should be possible to model the temperature of stabilization observed for each stage using the analytical model considering associated groundwater fluxes this is presented in fig 7 which compares the temperature increase measured during the heating period red curve with modelled curves grey lines simulated following equation 2 note that equation 3 can also be used to directly match temperature stabilization values with flow estimates the value of δtfo is set at 7 09 c in accordance with the results of simon et al 2021 and with the heating rate power 15 w m 1 each curve is simulated by considering a specific value of flux q1 q2 q3 or q4 corresponding to the different steps of water flow imposed through the sandbox over the heating period indicated on the top of the figure as expected for the first flow step from t0 to t1 the thermal response can be very well reproduced using the mils model as the flow is constant during this period the rmse between modelled and measured data from t0 to t1 is 0 06 c after the first flow change applied at t t1 the measured temperature progressively increases and stabilizes at the temperature stabilization predicted by the model considering q2 the rmse between modelled and measured data during the associated temperature stabilization stage is 0 06 c this result confirms that during heating periods the temperature of stabilization exclusively depends on the effective groundwater flux at the time of the steady state period and not on fluxes variations that have occurred in earlier times for the third stage the temperature of stabilization reached for the third flow step q3 also corresponds to the temperature of stabilization expected under flow conditions such as q q3 although the experimental curve matches not as well with the modelled curve considering q3 the associated rmse is 0 11 c in this case as discussed further this slight difference between modelled and measured data is due to the fact that the temperature stabilization is not fully reached a longer period would have been required before applying another flow change to be able to perfectly model the temperature stabilization when the last flow change is applied at t t3 imposing no flow conditions in the sandbox the measured temperature starts increasing however contrary to the previous steps a significant difference is observed between the experimental curve and the modelled one considering q4 even after a few additional hours of heating 3 2 2 modeling the real time temperature increase theoretically any instantaneous variation in the groundwater flow should induce a change in the temperature evolution which could be modelled using the superposition principle as described in equation 8 this principle was used to reproduce the temperature evolution measured in the sandbox during the heating period fig 8 presents the step by step reproduction of the measured temperature increase considering each flow change applied over the heating period note that only the temperature variations induced by heat transfer through the porous δtpm calculated as δtpm δt δtfo are presented here in each plot the red line corresponds to the measured temperature increase and the black line to the modelled temperature increase established by considering flow variations applied over the heating period for each case blue line corresponds to the temperature increases that would have been observed if steady flow conditions would have been applied during the whole heating period for instance in fig 8b the blue line called δtpm q2 was modelled using the analytical model equation 2 by considering steady flow conditions and the value of groundwater flux q2 applied during this second stage fig 8a focuses on the temperature increase measured from t0 to t1 over which the flux q1 is constant as the flow is constant during this period the temperature evolution can be very well reproduced using the mils model equation 2 then as shown in fig 8b the temperature increase measured from t t1 to t t2 over which the flux q2 is imposed can be very well reproduced following the equation 8 black line likewise temperature increase measured from t t2 to t t3 over which the flux q3 is imposed can be very well reproduced using the same superposition principle as shown in fig 8c black line interestingly this approach reproduces better the temperature reached at the end of this step than the direct use of the analytical solution for a single value of q blue line the comparison between these two lines confirms that the temperature stabilization is not completely reached at t t3 it would have required around 1 3 additional hours of heating to reach the steady state and for the two curves to overlap finally the superposition principle is applied to model the temperature increase measured for t t3 under no flow conditions q4 0 m s 1 fig 8d even if the model does not perfectly reproduce the temperature increase measured for t t3 black line the modelled curve remains satisfactory the difference between the reproduced curve and experimental data can probably be explained as discussed below by experimental conditions and a longer heating period would certainly have improved the result modelled curves in fig 7 black lines correspond to curves that would be obtained for active dts measurements conducted under steady flow conditions it appears for q1 q2 and q3 that temperature stabilization would be reached in approximatively 0 8 h 4 8 h and 10 3 h however in the experiment durations required to reach temperature stabilizations after flow changes were smaller 4 h from q1 to q2 and 5 5 h from q2 to q3 fig 8b this clearly shows that the duration of the transient period depends on the difference between the times required to reach stabilization for each flow value 4 8 h 0 8 h for q varying between q1 to q2 and 10 3 h 4 8 h for q varying between q2 to q3 this confirms that the duration of the transient temperature stage depends on both the value of the flow after the change which controls the late behavior of the temperature elevation and on the difference of fluxes before and after the flow change thus for a flow change from q1 to q3 9 5 h would be required to reach temperature stabilization while only 4 h are required for fluxes varying from q1 to q2 4 discussions in this study we introduce active dts measurements as a new approach to continuously monitor groundwater fluxes changes over time this approach allows to overcome the limitations of methods that have been proposed in the past decades for monitoring and quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes we introduce the possibility of accurately estimating groundwater flow at high spatial resolution while continuously monitoring the temporal dynamics of groundwater flow at different time scales including rapid flow fluctuations both sandbox experiments and numerical simulations show that any changes in the flow rate instantaneously affect the temperature evolution confirming that temperature elevation measured during active dts measurements is sensitive to flow variations results are in perfect agreement with theoretical expectations in the case of a change from flow conditions to no flow conditions the temperature does not stabilize after the flow change and the time required for temperature to reach the conduction trend fig 5 can be very long almost 24 h in simulations numerical simulations were also made to simulate the effect of a flux increase on temperature response results are not presented here because they are very similar to results presented considering flux decrease the only difference is that any flux increase induces a temperature decrease in addition results show that if the flow change either instantaneous or progressive is followed by a steady state flow period the temperature tends to stabilize at late times the temperature of stabilization exclusively depends on the effective groundwater flux at the time of the steady state flow period and not on flow conditions or fluxes variations that have occurred in earlier times therefore as soon as temperature steady state conditions are measured the mils model equation 2 or it simplified version equation 3 can be used to interpret the stabilization temperature and estimate the groundwater flux if the thermal conductivity value has been already determined however in agreement with theoretical developments results show that the thermal response to instantaneous flow changes is not instantaneous a transient period is systematically observed in temperature evolution depending on the value of the groundwater flux despite this transient period both sandbox experiments and numerical simulations confirm the possibility of modeling the thermal response resulting from an instantaneous flow change by applying the superposition principle eq 7 and using the mils model equation 2 considering the values of fluxes before and after the flow change thus as demonstrated in fig 8 the temperature evolution associated to several changes in flow conditions can be modelled which allows monitoring the temporal dynamic of fluxes even if the temperature stabilization is not yet reached this result is particularly promising because it suggests that an inverse model could be used reproduce temperature variations and assess flow variations over time note however that the flow change should be sufficiently important to induce a significant and measurable temperature change for any flow variation from q1 to q2 the duration of the temperature transient stage depends on the difference between the time required to reach the stabilization for q2 under steady flow conditions and the one required for q1 under steady flow conditions thus the larger the difference between q1 and q2 the longer the time required to reach a new stable temperature stage this is true for a flow decrease as well as for a flow increase for progressive flow changes the flow quantification becomes limited as soon as steady thermal conditions are not reached this can occur if the duration of temperature monitoring following the flow change is too short to reach temperature stabilization or if another flow change happens before the temperature stabilization in this case a qualitative characterization of flow dynamics is possible a temperature increase resulting from flux decrease and vice versa since the transient thermal stage cannot be modelled using the superposition principle introduced for modelling instantaneous flow changes no flow quantification can be achieved as long as the temperature is not stabilized in this case a numerical model should be used to interpret the temperature elevation in order to reach a quantitative assessment of flow this is probably what explains the difficulty for modeling temperature changes monitored during the sandbox experiment for t t3 change from flow conditions to no flow conditions in practice reaching steady flow conditions after the stop of the water injection through the sandbox required some duration it means that groundwater flow did not actually stop instantaneously while the model considers no flow conditions at t t3 a longer heating experiment would probably have permitted to improve modelling results concerning periodic flow changes the ability of monitoring groundwater fluxes variations depends on the difference between maximal and minimum fluxes which controls the temperature changes rate and the time required to reach the maximum or minimum of temperature fig 6 if the difference of temperature stabilization times between the maximal flux and the minimum flux is shorter than the half period of the periodic flow change signal the temperature change rate is comparable to the flow change rate in this scale the time shift between the temperature signal and the flow signal becomes negligible and flow variations can be monitored in real times minimal and maximal temperature recorded can be also used to interpret maximal and minimum water fluxes using the analytical solution equation 2 or its simplified version equation 3 on the opposite if the difference of temperature stabilization times between the maximal flux and the minimum flux is larger than the half period of the periodic flow change signal a time lag is observed between temperature variations and flow variations besides in this case the temperature signal appears attenuated in amplitude fig 6c and d since the period of the signal is not long enough to reach maximal or minimum temperature thus if the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded are interpreted using the analytical approach used in this study minimal and maximal fluxes would be overestimated or underestimated once again in this case a numerical model could help for reproducing temperature variations and estimating the range of groundwater fluxes it should be also noted that we assume in this study that the ambient temperature of the porous media is steady over time it involves that any temperature variations recorded is exclusively induced by the heating experiment in practice natural temperature variations can occur and affect the temperature signal measured during heating periods this would be the case for instance if the method is used under losing stream conditions at the stream aquifer interface where stream temperature variations propagates in depth depending on downward water fluxes it means that the temperature signal recorded during heating experiments should be processed in order to filter natural temperature variations before interpreting induced temperature variations this point will be investigated in further works 5 conclusions we investigated the potential of active dts measurements for characterizing variable groundwater fluxes we demonstrated that temperature signal measured over time is sensitive to groundwater flow conditions and their temporal changes offering very interesting perspectives to quantify and monitor fluxes variations we showed in particular the ability of active dts measurements to monitor groundwater flow changes for different hydrological conditions in complement to the few methods which allow quantifying groundwater flow variations active dts measurements offer the possibility of characterizing fluxes at high spatial resolution meaning that their use under transient flow conditions could allow to address the question of the characterization of both the spatial and the temporal variabilities of groundwater fluxes in addition results show that the method proposed in this study proved to be excellent for monitoring groundwater fluxes variations with a great accuracy these preliminary tests are particularly promising and open new perspectives for monitoring and or quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes for many applications at different temporal scales the approach seems particularly well suited to investigate flow fluctuations occurring over long time scales for instance to study bank storage effects induced by square dam releases or recharge of highly heterogeneous systems which are generally followed by relative long periods few hours of water levels stabilization ferencz et al 2019 likewise the approach would be well suited for characterizing groundwater flow variations occurring over days associated with precipitations for instance or over weeks seasonal fluctuations since very low changes could be quasi continuously monitored active dts seems also very well suited to monitor groundwater fluxes at different depths during a pumping test that last few hours or days pouladi et al 2021a in order to image flow variability and sub surface heterogeneities the method should also be efficient to assess diurnal groundwater fluctuations resulting from evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure effects or tidal effects for example none other field method offers the possibility of quantifying both temporal and spatial variabilities of diurnal groundwater fluctuations

1835,considering the need of characterizing temporal dynamic of groundwater and the lack of available methods we investigate the feasibility of active distributed temperature sensing dts measurements to monitor and quantify groundwater fluxes variations over time active dts which consists here of heating a fiber optic fo cable and in monitoring the temperature elevation has proven to be very efficient to quantify the spatial distribution of groundwater fluxes in saturated porous media at high resolution with low uncertainties however the approach has never been tested to continuously monitor groundwater fluxes changes to test this we rely on both numerical simulations and sandbox experiments to assess the sensitivity of temperature elevation to variable flow conditions and our ability to interpret associated temperature variations results confirm that the temperature elevation and evolution over time is sensitive to flow conditions and that associated temperature variations can be used to characterize groundwater fluxes variations first experimental and numerical results show that when a flow change is followed by a long enough steady state flow period the temperature stabilizes independently of previous fluxes conditions in such case the stabilization temperature can easily be interpreted to estimate groundwater fluxes using the analytical model commonly used under steady flow conditions to interpret active dts measurements furthermore we demonstrate here that under certain flow conditions depending on the nature of flow variations the approach offers the possibility of continuously monitoring fluxes variations for instantaneous flow changes it is even possible to go further by reproducing temperature signal variations over time by applying the superposition principle to the analytical model in the end these preliminary tests are particularly promising and open new perspectives for monitoring and or quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes at different temporal scales including diurnal and short term periodic fluxes variations keywords groundwater flow monitoring groundwater dynamics heat tracer experiment active dts heated fiber optic cable data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the characterization of groundwater fluxes is challenging in many hydrogeological contexts hermans et al 2022 in particular for characterizing the temporal variabilities of flows at compartment interfaces which remains particularly critical for instance in coastal sediments transient flow conditions influence the ecosystem productivity and its biogeochemistry robinson et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 while temporal variabilities in groundwater surface water interactions induce biogeochemical hot moments within the hyporheic zone mcclain et al 2003 boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 the monitoring of groundwater fluxes at different depths during a pumping test would be also very useful to image flow variability and sub surface heterogeneities pouladi et al 2021b the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater fluxes depends on many natural or man induced mechanisms which induce fluctuations in groundwater levels at different time scales freeze and cherry 1979 jiménez martínez et al 2013 short lived fluctuations can typically be observed during the recharge of highly heterogeneous systems ghasemizadeh et al 2012 pouladi et al 2021b while diurnal variations can occur for instance as the result of evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure effects or else tidal effects ataie ashtiani et al 2001 paepen et al 2020 leroux et al 2021 groundwater recharge through infiltration freeze 1974 and bank storage effects near streams winter et al 1998 boano et al 2013 harvey and gooseff 2015 can induce seasonal fluctuations in groundwater levels while climate changes and many human activities such as groundwater pumping artificial recharge agricultural irrigation and drainage or else geotechnical drainage induce short term as well as long term fluctuations of groundwater levels freeze and cherry 1979 hancock 2002 de graaf et al 2019 many approaches have been tested for monitoring and quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes in saturated porous media some of them including isotopic tracers burnett et al 2006 garcia orellana et al 2021 or the use of piezometers freeze cherry 1979 only provide averaged values of fluxes over large spatial scales which are not representative of their spatial variability induced by heterogeneities in coastal environments the use of geophysical methods was proposed to assess freshwater fluxes over a tidal cycle dimova et al 2012 folch et al 2020 or seasonal variations in submarine groundwater discharge in the intertidal zone paepen et al 2020 while such methods are suitable to investigate subsurface structures and heterogeneities binley et al 2015 brunner et al 2017 they remain limited for continuous monitoring of groundwater fluxes due to relatively long data acquisition times specific methods based on tracer experiments like the borehole dilution method drost et al 1968 pitrak et al 2007 or the finite volume point dilution method brouyère et al 2008 also appear to be promising techniques for the continuous monitoring of groundwater fluxes jamin et al 2015 jamin and brouyère 2018 however their use provides a spatially averaged value of fluxes over the well length or over the volume investigated and would require repeating point measurements at different depths to investigate the flow distribution heat has also been efficiently used as tracer of groundwater fluxes in many contexts to study vertical fluxes and their temporal dynamics anderson 2005 rau et al 2014 kurylyk et al 2019 passive heat tracing experiments rely on the continuous monitoring of natural temperature variations within the saturated subsurface during several days weeks or months even if the use of passive tracer experiments allows quantifying groundwater flow variations over time analytical and numerical models commonly used to interpret temperature time series generally assume constant daily fluxes hatch et al 2006 keery et al 2007 constantz 2008 briggs et al 2012 this means that passive experiments only provide an averaged daily value of groundwater fluxes and are not suited for characterizing groundwater fluxes variations occurring at shorter time scale very recent developments discussed the feasibility of monitoring transient flows from temperature depth profiles lin et al 2022 however such approach does not provide fluxes spatial distributions and estimates are dependent of natural temperature variations which limits the applicability of the method in many environments the development of fiber optic distributed temperature sensing fo dts technology providing continuous temperature data along fiber optic cables at high spatial and temporal resolution largely enhanced the use of heat as groundwater tracer for environmental applications selker et al 2006 tyler et al 2009 shanafield et al 2018 its use can be well suited to characterize diurnal temporal flow variations as demonstrated by henderson et al 2009 but also to qualitatively study seasonal and temporal fluctuations of groundwater discharge into surface water slater et al 2010 sebok et al 2013 matheswaran et al 2014 however the approach does not allow characterizing short scale variations of groundwater fluxes and quantifying groundwater fluxes through passive dts measurements remains difficult and uncertain le lay et al 2019 simon et al 2022 recent developments have shown that active dts performs very well for investigating the spatial distribution of groundwater fluxes over a large range of values at an unprecedented high spatial resolution simon et al 2021 active dts methods consist of continuously recording the temperature changes induced by a heat source applied along a fiber optic fo cable the difference of temperature measured between a heated and a non heated fo cable directly depends on the flow rate read et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 sayde et al 2015 bense et al 2016 simon et al 2021 since the temperature increase measured during heat injection directly depends on groundwater fluxes any change in groundwater flow occurring during the heating period should result in a change in temperature variation therefore the method should be well suited for continuously monitoring groundwater flow variations this assumption is supported by the fact that sayde et al 2015 used actively heated fiber optics for continuously monitoring wind speed changes over time and therefore demonstrated that the temperature elevation measured during heating experiments is sensitive to wind speed variations few studies investigated the interest of repeating active dts measurements under different hydrological conditions to study thermal properties changes or groundwater fluxes variability abesser et al 2020 munn et al 2020 but the approach has never been used to continuously monitor groundwater flow variations with time all previous applications of active dts have been performed under steady state flow conditions during the heating period in this study we therefore propose to investigate the potential of active dts measurements for continuously monitoring groundwater fluxes changes over time in fully saturated media the main objective is to verify if the temperature evolution measured during heating injection is sensitive to groundwater flow variations transient flow conditions an increase of groundwater flux should lead to a decrease of temperature groundwater flow dissipating more efficiently the artificial heat injected and vice versa the question of the shape duration of the flow change will also be investigated we aim to understand how instantaneous progressive and periodic flow changes will affect the thermal response for doing so we first rely on simple theoretical developments that are complemented by numerical simulations and sandbox experiments numerical modeling is used to validate the theoretical developments and to simulate the effect of flow fluctuations on the thermal response in various conditions then we rely on an experimental validation by achieving active dts measurements in a sandbox by associating theoretical developments numerical modeling and laboratory experiments we aim to verify the potentiality and the limitations of active dts experiments for monitoring groundwater flows at high spatial resolution 2 material methods 2 1 mathematical and theoretical formulation 2 1 1 background among active dts experiments our interest in this study is a recently used setup which consists of electrically heating a fo cable through its steel armoring while continuously monitoring the elevation in temperature all along the heated section using the fo inside the cable in such configuration a single fo cable is used as a heat source and as a temperature measurement tool bense et al 2016 read et al 2014 selker selker 2018 simon et al 2021 in this case as recently shown by simon et al 2021 and del val et al 2021 and illustrated in fig 1 the total temperature increase δt is the result of two terms δ t δ t fo δ t pm 1 δtfo is the result of the heat storage and heat conduction occurring within the fo cable the electrical heating induces indeed a relatively large increase of temperature during the early period of heating t tc note that tc corresponds to the limit beyond which the temperature elevation is no longer affected by the heat conduction and storage through the fo cable δtfo is maximum and constant for t tc as soon as the heat produced reaches the surrounding material the temperature increase is controlled by heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media surrounding the fo cable which both dissipate a part of the heat produced the associated temperature rise δtpm depends on both thermal conductivity and darcy velocity for sufficient long times heat conduction and advection may fully dissipate the heat produced leading to the temperature stabilization δtf the higher the groundwater flux the lower the temperature of stabilization and the faster steady conditions are reached fig 1 if q 0 no groundwater flow the temperature keeps increasing gradually and never stabilizes carslaw and jaeger 1959 diao et al 2004 simon et al 2021 δtfo depends on the heating rate power and on the thermal properties of the heating cable and is independent of both the thermal properties of the material and the flow conditions as validated by simon et al 2021 the evolution of δtpm can be modelled over time using the moving instantaneous line source mils model initially developed by carslaw and jaeger 1959 by considering an initial thermal equilibrium t0 the thermal response δtpm δt t t0 along the line source is given in x y direction by 2 δ t pm x y q 4 π λ exp qx 2 d t ρ w c w ρ c x 2

w c w ρ c 3 where δtf is the temperature stabilization note that this solution can be used only when temperature stabilization is reached for steady state hydraulic and thermal conditions 2 1 2 theoretical formulation for transient hydraulic conditions as illustrated in fig 1 the temperature increases δ t q 1 and δ t q 2 respectively associated to groundwater fluxes equals to q1 and q2 are given for any t tc by δ t q 1 t δ t fo δ t pm q 1 t 4 δ t q 2 t δ t fo δ t pm q 2 t 5 δ t pm q 1 and δ t pm q 2 correspond to temperature rises associated to heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media for groundwater fluxes respectively equals to q1 and q2 and can be calculated using the analytical form equation 2 for thermal steady state conditions δtpm can be modelled using equation 3 which means that equations 4 and 5 become for late time δ t q 1 t δ t fo δ t f q 1 4 a δ t q 2 t δ t fo δ t f q 2 5 a the heat conduction through the fo cable inducing the temperature increase δ t fo only occurs for short time and is independent of groundwater flux thus for late time we obtain by subtracting equations 4a and 5a δ t q 2 t δ t q 1 t δ t f q 2 δ t f q 1 6 equation 6 means that the difference of temperature stabilization for q1 and for q2 can easily be modelled using equation 2 it suggests that for a groundwater flux change from q1 to q2 and for long enough steady state conditions the temperature stabilizes depending on q 2 and that the temperature increase or decrease after the flow change directly equals to the difference between the temperature of stabilization observed for q1 under stationary flow conditions and the temperature of stabilization observed for q2 under stationary flow conditions then the temperature evolution in response to groundwater flow variations can be seen as the superposition of different hydrological conditions each one being described by the solution calculated for a given flow thus in theory the superposition principle could be applied to interpret temperature in varying groundwater flow conditions this means that the temperature following a sharp or sudden change q1 to q2 should be given for any t tc by δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t q 1 t δ t q 1 t δ t q 2 t 7 with t t t 1 t 1 being the time for which the change of groundwater flow occurs combining equation 7 with equations 4 and 5 leads to δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t fo δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t 8 if we assume that t 1 is larger than the time required to reach temperature stabilization for q q 1 equation 8 becomes δ t q 1 q 2 t δ t fo δ t f q 1 δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t 9 in other words equation 9 means that the evolution of the temperature after the change from q1 to q2 could be obtained by adding to the temperature recorded at t1 the difference of the temperature elevation associated to heat conduction and advection occurring through the porous media for groundwater fluxes respectively equals to q1 and q2 note that temperature should increase if q1 q2 and decrease for q1 q2 if t1 is smaller than the time required to reach temperature stabilization equation 8 should be used instead of equation 7 but the same principle should apply and the change of flow should lead to a temperature change related to the difference δ t pm q 1 t δ t pm q 2 t thus if we suppose a groundwater flux change from q1 to q2 occurring at t t1 we expect the following implications from equations 8 and 9 1 at late times after flow change t t 1 the temperature should stabilize depending on the last flux imposed q 2 and independently of previous fluxes conditions and temperature variations equation 4b consequently any temperature stabilization recorded during heating periods should reflect steady flow conditions and could be used to quantify associated groundwater fluxes 2 the temperature evolution after any flow change should be modeled by applying the superposition principle equation 8 or 9 this involves that besides the temperature stabilization at late times the temperature evolution in time could also be possibly used to quantify q2 2 1 3 objectives of the study to verify the previous developments we rely on experiments conducted in a sandbox where the flow rate can be controlled and changed during active dts measurements the temperature evolution is continuously recorded in response to successive flow rates to verify if the analytical solution mils can actually be used to model temperature changes over time and to quantify groundwater flow changes the question of the shape duration of the flow change should also be addressed we expect that the thermal response to flow change would be different in case of sharp and instantaneous flow change or in case of progressive flow change in both cases we want to investigate the time required to reach a new thermal steady regime after flow change theoretically the stabilization time should depend on q 2 since the smaller the flux the greater the time necessary to reach temperature stabilization simon et al 2021 likewise we aim to investigate the feasibility of monitoring periodic groundwater fluxes as observed in coastal aquifers for instance in theory if temperature evolution is sensitive to water flow changes we expect to observe a periodic temperature signal while flow changes periodically thus for progressive or periodic flow changes a critical point will be to define if temperature changes occur simultaneously to flow variations and therefore if the approach allows continuous and real time monitoring of flow variations with this in mind since flow changes that can be applied in the sandbox are quite limited we rely on numerical simulations to simulate active dts measurements conducted under transient flow conditions thermal responses to different scenarios of flow variations are modelled instantaneous progressive and periodic flow changes to investigate the effect of flow changes rate on temperature evolution 2 2 numerical modeling 2 2 1 numerical model to simulate heat transfer occurring in a porous media during active dts measurements and to assess the effect of flow changes we use a 2d domain numerical model of flow and heat transport implemented in comsol multiphysics the multiphysics software comsol solves heat and flow transfers equations using finite element methods this model includes an explicit representation of fo cables used for field experiments brusens cables llk bste 85 c consisting of a steel core 1 13 mm radius λ 13 4 w m 1 k 1 and a plastic jacket 1 925 mm radius λ 0 245 w m 1 k 1 a heat source term is added in the steel core and simulations are run by fixing the electrical power input injected along the fo cable at 35 w m 1 the domain is modeled as a rectangle whose size is fixed at 3 1 m and the heat source is applied at 1 m of the laminar inflow boundary condition the flow being lengthwise we ensured that the heat produced does not reach the domain boundaries for any flow conditions tested in this study the thermal conductivity of the porous media is fixed at λ 1 1 w m 1 k 1 and its volumetric heat capacity at ρc 3 106 j m 3 k 1 this model has already been used in a previous study to understand the thermal processes controlling the temperature increase measured along a heated fo simon et al 2021 its use allowed validating the data interpretation framework presented in the section 2 1 1 background and the use of the mils model equation 2 to estimate groundwater fluxes however the model has up to now always been used in steady state fluid flow conditions here simulations were performed by considering transient flow conditions during heating periods 2 2 2 sharp and progressive groundwater flow changes firstly sharp or progressive groundwater flow variations from q1 to q2 have been simulated as shown in fig 2 the temperature elevation is first simulated considering steady state fluid flow conditions by applying a constant and uniform flow q1 after several hours of heating a sharp or progressive flow change is simulated to reach a lower flow rate q2 in order to assess the effect of the flow change rate and of the flow change intensity on temperature variations different scenarios are considered as detailed in fig 2 case 1 simulates a groundwater flow decrease from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 1 2 10 5 m s 1 while case 2 simulates a groundwater flow decrease from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 3 2 10 5 m s 1 in both cases the change of flow is occurring three hours after the start of the heat injection once temperature stabilisation has already been reached for flow q1 for each case the applied flow change from q1 to q2 is either instantaneous and so very sharp blue line or smoothed and progressive along time with transition periods varying between 30 min and 8 h with these two cases modeling focuses on assessing the effect of the difference between q1 and q2 on temperature evolutions and on comparing the flow change rate with the temperature change rate besides it has been proven in steady state flow conditions that a gradual and continuous temperature rise during heating period without temperature stabilization at late times occurs in case of no groundwater flux diao et al 2004 simon et al 2021 thus after a change from flow to no flow conditions it can be expected that the temperature evolution shows a similar behaviour and that a continual temperature rise would be observed under no flow conditions to address this point a complementary simulation is run to simulate a change from flow conditions q1 1 2 10 5 m s 1 to no flow conditions q2 0 m s 1 2 2 3 periodic hydraulic flow variations the second set of simulations consists of simulating periodic groundwater flow variations for these simulations the period of the sine signal is set to 12 h 1 43200 hz approximating the period of tidal cycles 12 4 h for the first case with sine variations the amplitude of the signal is 2 4 10 5 m s 1 and flow vary between 1 2 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 fig 6a for the second one a smaller amplitude is considered 8 10 6 m s 1 with fluxes varying between 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 fig 6b 2 3 laboratory tests active dts measurements were carried out during sandbox laboratory experiments the experimental setup consisted of burying a heatable fo cable in a sandbox in which flow rates can be well controlled the sandbox is a 0 576 m3 pvc tank open at the top 1 6 m long 1 2 m width and 0 3 m height and filled with 0 4 1 3 mm diameter quartz sand fig 3 a the height of water in reservoirs on two sides of the sandbox can be manually adjusted to control the hydraulic gradient and thus the water flow through the sand the flow through the sandbox is considered homogeneous and the average hydraulic conductivity is estimated equal to 3x10 3 m s 1 the fo cable buried in the sandbox is a 3 8 mm diameter cable containing 4 multimode 50 125 µm fibers brusens cable reference llk bste 85 c a 7 m section of this cable was electrically isolated and connected to an electrical allowing the injection of electricity from a power controller dts measurements were carried out with a silixa ultima s dts unit used in double ended configuration van de giesen et al 2012 and reporting temperature every 12 5 cm at a 20 s sampling interval 10 s per channel cold and warm baths were used to calibrate temperature measurements fig 3a the relative uncertainty of measurements was estimated to 0 03 c while absolute uncertainty was estimated equal to 0 15 c the effective spatial resolution of the unit was experimentally estimated during heating periods to be between 51 and 67 cm simon et al 2020 a succession of active dts measurements was already conducted under steady state flow conditions using this setup and associated measurements have already been the subject of two precedent studies simon et al 2020 simon et al 2021 for this study the heatable section of the fo cable was continuously energized for 29 h using a silixa heat pulse control system delivering a well controlled power intensity of 15 w m 1 along the heated section for the first 4 hrs of the heat injection the flux was held constant and estimated at 3 37 10 5 m s 1 fig 3b then a three step decrease of the groundwater flow was applied until no flow condition q 0 was reached at the end of the experiment the water fluxes associated to each step are noted q1 q2 q3 and q4 in practice the flow through the sandbox is changed by manually decreasing the height of water in the inlet reservoir which induces a decrease of the hydraulic gradient and thus of the water flux it involves for each change a period of transient flow conditions before a new steady state condition is reached the duration of these transient flow conditions periods is difficult to assess since hydraulic heads changes are not monitored however from the observations made during the experiment we consider steady state flow is reached in approximatively 30 min after flow changes which is consistent with the permeability estimated 3 results 3 1 numerical modeling 3 1 1 sharp and progressive flow changes fig 4 presents temperature transients modelled for case 1 fig a and b and for case 2 fig c and d for the first case the heat injection at t 0 induces a sharp increase of temperature fig 4a the temperature stabilizes rapidly in around 25 min at 17 42 c depending on experimental conditions thermal properties of fo cable power injected on thermal properties of the porous media but especially on flux q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 after three hours of heating a groundwater flow decrease is modelled to reach q2 1 2 10 5 m s 1 it induces an increase of temperature which is in perfect agreement with expectations for lower groundwater flow heat produced is less dissipated by advection leading to a temperature increase in this case independently of the duration of the hydraulic transition period the temperature increases and stabilizes at 21 26 c which corresponds to the temperature stabilization predicted by the model considering steady flow conditions q2 for the whole heating period dotted grey line thus the temperature stabilization after the flow change clearly depends on the groundwater flow q2 however the duration of the hydraulic transition period also affects the temperature variations and the duration of thermal transition period as detailed in fig 4b which shows temperature evolutions modelled after the start of the flow change δt is calculated here as the difference between the temperature simulated for any t 3 h and the temperature at t 3 h corresponding to the stabilization temperature for q1 for an instantaneous and sharp flow change blue line the temperature elevation does not instantaneously stabilize but progressively increases up to reaching stabilization approximately 3 h after the flow change in this case the superposition principle can be used equation 7 to reproduce the temperature change observed after the flow change results are not shown here to not overload the figure for simulations considering smoothed transition periods of 30 min orange line 1 h yellow line 2 h green line and 4 h brown line results show that reaching steady temperature conditions is longer than reaching steady flow conditions temperature and flow changes are not simultaneous and the temperature response is delayed however although difficult to observe in fig 4b because of the logscale that compress the late times when the transition period increases the delay between the temperature stabilization and the flow stabilization decreases thus if the hydraulic transition period lasts 4 h the temperature stabilization is reached in 4h45min for longer transition periods see for instance purple line corresponding to an 8 hrs transition period the temperature stabilization is reached at the same time as the flow steady conditions meaning that temperature changes are occurring at the same rate as flow changes subsequently if flow changes are smoothed enough it becomes possible to monitor flow changes in real time for these cases using the simplest version of the superposition principle equation 7 does not allow reproducing the thermal response observed in response to flow change however regardless of the shape and duration of the transient flow stage the temperature systematically stabilizes depending on the value of q2 which means that the value of the temperature stabilization can be used to estimate q2 using the mils model equation 2 or its simplified version equation 3 fig 4c and d present thermal response to flow change from q1 3 6 10 5 m s 1 to q2 3 2 10 5 m s 1 temperature responses for the three first hours are similar to thermal responses presented in case 1 identical steady flow conditions then the flow change induces an increase of temperature but the temperature stabilization for this case is lower than case 1 17 81 c in agreement with a greater value of q2 actually as observed for case 1 the temperature stabilizes according to the temperature value expected for q2 dotted grey line this confirms that if steady flow conditions are long enough after the flow change thermal steady conditions temperature stabilization are reached independently of earlier flow conditions however the time required to reach the thermal stabilization depends on the rate of flow variations thus the temperature stabilizes faster for case 2 than for case 1 for an instantaneous flow change blue line temperature approximately stabilizes 18 min after the start of flow change against 3 h for case 1 likewise as soon as the transition period exceeds 1 h the temperature stabilization is reached at the same time as the flow steady conditions thus our results show that the duration of the transient temperature variations depends on the value of q2 but also on the intensity of flow variation the difference between q1 and q2 in complement to previous results simulations were run to simulate an instantaneous change applied at t 3hrs from flow conditions q1 1 2 10 5 m s 1 to no flow conditions q2 0 m s 1 in this case fig 5 the temperature rises progressively and almost 24 hrs are required so that the temperature elevation reaches the temperature curve modelled by considering no flow conditions for the whole heating period the absence of groundwater flow after the change means that heat dissipation occurs only through heat conduction which involves slow and less efficient heat transfers although no temperature stabilization occurs for late times the superposition principle equation 8 can efficiently be used to reproduce the temperature elevation observed after the flow change 3 1 2 periodic groundwater flow variations fig 6a and b present temperature responses modelled in response to periodic flow changes occurring during the heating period in this first case the period of the sine signal is set to 12 h with fluxes varying between 1 2x10 5 and 3 6x10 5 m s 1 blue line in fig 6a brown line corresponds to the associated temperature variations heating period starting at t 0 temperature oscillates between 17 42 and 21 18 c in response to flow changes an increase of flux inducing a temperature decrease and vice versa interestingly a delay in time 20 min can be observed between maximum temperature peaks and minimal fluxes fig 6a on the opposite minimum temperature peaks and maximal fluxes are perfectly synchronized actually as shown in fig 6b while groundwater flow is maximal and therefore the temperature elevation minimal the temperature elevation reaches 17 42 c which corresponds to the stabilization temperature of the model considering steady flow conditions and q 3 6 10 5 m s 1 however while groundwater flow is minimal and therefore the temperature elevation maximal the temperature elevation only reaches 21 18 c which is slightly less than the expected temperature the stabilization temperature of the model considering steady flow conditions and q 1 2 10 5 m s 1 being 21 3 c then the amplitude of the sine signal was decreased with fluxes varying between 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 associated results are presented in fig 6c and d in this case temperature oscillated between 17 42 and 18 26 c contrary to previous flow conditions peaks in temperature are perfectly synchronized with peaks in fluxes fig 6c a shown in fig 6d the minimum and maximum temperatures reached are in perfect agreement with stabilization temperatures obtained while considering steady flow conditions of 2 8 10 5 and 3 6 10 5 m s 1 these results seem very promising concerning the applications of active dts measurements under transient flow conditions it suggests that while flow variations are smoothed temperature elevation changes occur simultaneously to flow variations and can therefore be used to continuously monitor and characterize transient flows these results suggest that the feasibility of monitoring fluxes depends on the values of q1 and q2 and on the difference between them 3 2 laboratory tests fig 7 shows the temperature increase δt measured along the fo cable in response to heat injection red line note that the temperature variations presented here were recorded along a section of the cable positioned perpendicular to the main flow direction at t t0 0 the electrical power is switched on the start of the heating period is associated to a rapid and sharp temperature change that reaches 8 8 c in 2 min after 16 min of heating the temperature stabilizes around 10 c meaning that the thermal steady state is reached at t t1 while the flow is decreased from q1 to q2 a significant temperature rise is measured the temperature first increases rapidly before stabilizing around 10 5 c then at t t2 while the flow is decreased from q2 to q3 another significant temperature rise is observed the temperature increases up to stabilizing at 10 9 c 1 h50 after the flow change finally at t t4 the water flow is turned off no flow conditions which induces a new temperature increase 3 2 1 modeling the temperature stabilization the first three flow changes applied during the heating period induced a transient thermal stage followed by a temperature stabilization stage at higher temperature following equation 5 a the temperature theoretically stabilizes at late times according to flow conditions occurring after each flow stage thus it should be possible to model the temperature of stabilization observed for each stage using the analytical model considering associated groundwater fluxes this is presented in fig 7 which compares the temperature increase measured during the heating period red curve with modelled curves grey lines simulated following equation 2 note that equation 3 can also be used to directly match temperature stabilization values with flow estimates the value of δtfo is set at 7 09 c in accordance with the results of simon et al 2021 and with the heating rate power 15 w m 1 each curve is simulated by considering a specific value of flux q1 q2 q3 or q4 corresponding to the different steps of water flow imposed through the sandbox over the heating period indicated on the top of the figure as expected for the first flow step from t0 to t1 the thermal response can be very well reproduced using the mils model as the flow is constant during this period the rmse between modelled and measured data from t0 to t1 is 0 06 c after the first flow change applied at t t1 the measured temperature progressively increases and stabilizes at the temperature stabilization predicted by the model considering q2 the rmse between modelled and measured data during the associated temperature stabilization stage is 0 06 c this result confirms that during heating periods the temperature of stabilization exclusively depends on the effective groundwater flux at the time of the steady state period and not on fluxes variations that have occurred in earlier times for the third stage the temperature of stabilization reached for the third flow step q3 also corresponds to the temperature of stabilization expected under flow conditions such as q q3 although the experimental curve matches not as well with the modelled curve considering q3 the associated rmse is 0 11 c in this case as discussed further this slight difference between modelled and measured data is due to the fact that the temperature stabilization is not fully reached a longer period would have been required before applying another flow change to be able to perfectly model the temperature stabilization when the last flow change is applied at t t3 imposing no flow conditions in the sandbox the measured temperature starts increasing however contrary to the previous steps a significant difference is observed between the experimental curve and the modelled one considering q4 even after a few additional hours of heating 3 2 2 modeling the real time temperature increase theoretically any instantaneous variation in the groundwater flow should induce a change in the temperature evolution which could be modelled using the superposition principle as described in equation 8 this principle was used to reproduce the temperature evolution measured in the sandbox during the heating period fig 8 presents the step by step reproduction of the measured temperature increase considering each flow change applied over the heating period note that only the temperature variations induced by heat transfer through the porous δtpm calculated as δtpm δt δtfo are presented here in each plot the red line corresponds to the measured temperature increase and the black line to the modelled temperature increase established by considering flow variations applied over the heating period for each case blue line corresponds to the temperature increases that would have been observed if steady flow conditions would have been applied during the whole heating period for instance in fig 8b the blue line called δtpm q2 was modelled using the analytical model equation 2 by considering steady flow conditions and the value of groundwater flux q2 applied during this second stage fig 8a focuses on the temperature increase measured from t0 to t1 over which the flux q1 is constant as the flow is constant during this period the temperature evolution can be very well reproduced using the mils model equation 2 then as shown in fig 8b the temperature increase measured from t t1 to t t2 over which the flux q2 is imposed can be very well reproduced following the equation 8 black line likewise temperature increase measured from t t2 to t t3 over which the flux q3 is imposed can be very well reproduced using the same superposition principle as shown in fig 8c black line interestingly this approach reproduces better the temperature reached at the end of this step than the direct use of the analytical solution for a single value of q blue line the comparison between these two lines confirms that the temperature stabilization is not completely reached at t t3 it would have required around 1 3 additional hours of heating to reach the steady state and for the two curves to overlap finally the superposition principle is applied to model the temperature increase measured for t t3 under no flow conditions q4 0 m s 1 fig 8d even if the model does not perfectly reproduce the temperature increase measured for t t3 black line the modelled curve remains satisfactory the difference between the reproduced curve and experimental data can probably be explained as discussed below by experimental conditions and a longer heating period would certainly have improved the result modelled curves in fig 7 black lines correspond to curves that would be obtained for active dts measurements conducted under steady flow conditions it appears for q1 q2 and q3 that temperature stabilization would be reached in approximatively 0 8 h 4 8 h and 10 3 h however in the experiment durations required to reach temperature stabilizations after flow changes were smaller 4 h from q1 to q2 and 5 5 h from q2 to q3 fig 8b this clearly shows that the duration of the transient period depends on the difference between the times required to reach stabilization for each flow value 4 8 h 0 8 h for q varying between q1 to q2 and 10 3 h 4 8 h for q varying between q2 to q3 this confirms that the duration of the transient temperature stage depends on both the value of the flow after the change which controls the late behavior of the temperature elevation and on the difference of fluxes before and after the flow change thus for a flow change from q1 to q3 9 5 h would be required to reach temperature stabilization while only 4 h are required for fluxes varying from q1 to q2 4 discussions in this study we introduce active dts measurements as a new approach to continuously monitor groundwater fluxes changes over time this approach allows to overcome the limitations of methods that have been proposed in the past decades for monitoring and quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes we introduce the possibility of accurately estimating groundwater flow at high spatial resolution while continuously monitoring the temporal dynamics of groundwater flow at different time scales including rapid flow fluctuations both sandbox experiments and numerical simulations show that any changes in the flow rate instantaneously affect the temperature evolution confirming that temperature elevation measured during active dts measurements is sensitive to flow variations results are in perfect agreement with theoretical expectations in the case of a change from flow conditions to no flow conditions the temperature does not stabilize after the flow change and the time required for temperature to reach the conduction trend fig 5 can be very long almost 24 h in simulations numerical simulations were also made to simulate the effect of a flux increase on temperature response results are not presented here because they are very similar to results presented considering flux decrease the only difference is that any flux increase induces a temperature decrease in addition results show that if the flow change either instantaneous or progressive is followed by a steady state flow period the temperature tends to stabilize at late times the temperature of stabilization exclusively depends on the effective groundwater flux at the time of the steady state flow period and not on flow conditions or fluxes variations that have occurred in earlier times therefore as soon as temperature steady state conditions are measured the mils model equation 2 or it simplified version equation 3 can be used to interpret the stabilization temperature and estimate the groundwater flux if the thermal conductivity value has been already determined however in agreement with theoretical developments results show that the thermal response to instantaneous flow changes is not instantaneous a transient period is systematically observed in temperature evolution depending on the value of the groundwater flux despite this transient period both sandbox experiments and numerical simulations confirm the possibility of modeling the thermal response resulting from an instantaneous flow change by applying the superposition principle eq 7 and using the mils model equation 2 considering the values of fluxes before and after the flow change thus as demonstrated in fig 8 the temperature evolution associated to several changes in flow conditions can be modelled which allows monitoring the temporal dynamic of fluxes even if the temperature stabilization is not yet reached this result is particularly promising because it suggests that an inverse model could be used reproduce temperature variations and assess flow variations over time note however that the flow change should be sufficiently important to induce a significant and measurable temperature change for any flow variation from q1 to q2 the duration of the temperature transient stage depends on the difference between the time required to reach the stabilization for q2 under steady flow conditions and the one required for q1 under steady flow conditions thus the larger the difference between q1 and q2 the longer the time required to reach a new stable temperature stage this is true for a flow decrease as well as for a flow increase for progressive flow changes the flow quantification becomes limited as soon as steady thermal conditions are not reached this can occur if the duration of temperature monitoring following the flow change is too short to reach temperature stabilization or if another flow change happens before the temperature stabilization in this case a qualitative characterization of flow dynamics is possible a temperature increase resulting from flux decrease and vice versa since the transient thermal stage cannot be modelled using the superposition principle introduced for modelling instantaneous flow changes no flow quantification can be achieved as long as the temperature is not stabilized in this case a numerical model should be used to interpret the temperature elevation in order to reach a quantitative assessment of flow this is probably what explains the difficulty for modeling temperature changes monitored during the sandbox experiment for t t3 change from flow conditions to no flow conditions in practice reaching steady flow conditions after the stop of the water injection through the sandbox required some duration it means that groundwater flow did not actually stop instantaneously while the model considers no flow conditions at t t3 a longer heating experiment would probably have permitted to improve modelling results concerning periodic flow changes the ability of monitoring groundwater fluxes variations depends on the difference between maximal and minimum fluxes which controls the temperature changes rate and the time required to reach the maximum or minimum of temperature fig 6 if the difference of temperature stabilization times between the maximal flux and the minimum flux is shorter than the half period of the periodic flow change signal the temperature change rate is comparable to the flow change rate in this scale the time shift between the temperature signal and the flow signal becomes negligible and flow variations can be monitored in real times minimal and maximal temperature recorded can be also used to interpret maximal and minimum water fluxes using the analytical solution equation 2 or its simplified version equation 3 on the opposite if the difference of temperature stabilization times between the maximal flux and the minimum flux is larger than the half period of the periodic flow change signal a time lag is observed between temperature variations and flow variations besides in this case the temperature signal appears attenuated in amplitude fig 6c and d since the period of the signal is not long enough to reach maximal or minimum temperature thus if the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded are interpreted using the analytical approach used in this study minimal and maximal fluxes would be overestimated or underestimated once again in this case a numerical model could help for reproducing temperature variations and estimating the range of groundwater fluxes it should be also noted that we assume in this study that the ambient temperature of the porous media is steady over time it involves that any temperature variations recorded is exclusively induced by the heating experiment in practice natural temperature variations can occur and affect the temperature signal measured during heating periods this would be the case for instance if the method is used under losing stream conditions at the stream aquifer interface where stream temperature variations propagates in depth depending on downward water fluxes it means that the temperature signal recorded during heating experiments should be processed in order to filter natural temperature variations before interpreting induced temperature variations this point will be investigated in further works 5 conclusions we investigated the potential of active dts measurements for characterizing variable groundwater fluxes we demonstrated that temperature signal measured over time is sensitive to groundwater flow conditions and their temporal changes offering very interesting perspectives to quantify and monitor fluxes variations we showed in particular the ability of active dts measurements to monitor groundwater flow changes for different hydrological conditions in complement to the few methods which allow quantifying groundwater flow variations active dts measurements offer the possibility of characterizing fluxes at high spatial resolution meaning that their use under transient flow conditions could allow to address the question of the characterization of both the spatial and the temporal variabilities of groundwater fluxes in addition results show that the method proposed in this study proved to be excellent for monitoring groundwater fluxes variations with a great accuracy these preliminary tests are particularly promising and open new perspectives for monitoring and or quantifying the temporal dynamic of groundwater fluxes for many applications at different temporal scales the approach seems particularly well suited to investigate flow fluctuations occurring over long time scales for instance to study bank storage effects induced by square dam releases or recharge of highly heterogeneous systems which are generally followed by relative long periods few hours of water levels stabilization ferencz et al 2019 likewise the approach would be well suited for characterizing groundwater flow variations occurring over days associated with precipitations for instance or over weeks seasonal fluctuations since very low changes could be quasi continuously monitored active dts seems also very well suited to monitor groundwater fluxes at different depths during a pumping test that last few hours or days pouladi et al 2021a in order to image flow variability and sub surface heterogeneities the method should also be efficient to assess diurnal groundwater fluctuations resulting from evapotranspiration atmospheric pressure effects or tidal effects for example none other field method offers the possibility of quantifying both temporal and spatial variabilities of diurnal groundwater fluctuations

1836,the increase in the frequency and severity of water crises around the world necessitates maintaining or augmenting investments in the hydrologic sciences including in a trained diverse workforce the usda forest service operates a network of 85 experimental forests and ranges experimental watersheds and cooperating sites efrs 31 of which include long term hydrologic studies hydroefrs the hydroefrs are centers for hydrologic science and education and play a key role informing watershed policy and management the goals of this study were to understand 1 how broadly the women associated with the hydroefrs including women in the forest service workforce and women with cooperating agencies or universities who have worked at hydroefrs have contributed to hydrologic sciences and 2 how more specifically the number and roles of women in the forest service workforce associated with the hydroefrs have changed over time data were collected from the efr data explorer the usda forest service human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat literature reviews and questionnaires to usda efr scientists in charge and to women who were or had been involved in hydrologic sciences at efrs results showed that women associated with the hydroefrs have made significant contributions to the hydrologic sciences including authoring or co authoring over 3 000 publications with over 170 000 citations since 1977 and an h index of 181 in their own words the women indicated that they were also active in contributing to hydrologic fieldwork providing stewardship for long term data and contributing to the social capital of the hydroefrs through teamwork collaboration and mentoring for the forest service trends in employment records from 1992 through 2021 showed a 55 contraction of the entire fs r d workforce including a 59 loss in the number of women in the fs r d workforce a 50 loss in the number of women associated with hydroefr duty stations and a 26 loss in the number of women in hydrology positions during this period there was a greater loss of both women and men in lower graded positions relative to higher graded positions in the fs r d workforce with serial implications for the ability of the workforce to collect data produce basic science publications and conduct syntheses although the ratio of women men declined across the forest service and fs r d the ratio of women men increased at the hydroefrs driven by a higher ratio of women men at higher grade levels and for management positions within fs r d and at the hydroefrs when asked women valued their contributions to the hydrologic sciences and envisioned a more equitable future for women in hydrology overall results show that hydroefrs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences who in turn have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long term research sites as

forestry wildlife transportation industry and recreation water quantity and quality on earth is changing in myriad ways for example increasing populations and urbanization are placing more demands on local water supplies increasing point and non point source pollutants are contaminating water resources human alterations including dams fracking irrigation and draining of wetlands are altering local surface and subsurface water flows and a changing global climate is modifying the amount timing distribution and phase of precipitation unevenly across the globe e g grafton et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 vörösmarty et al 2010 as such the need to support the hydrologic sciences and to maintain and grow a trained diverse workforce to address water issues of today and the future has never been more important the usda forest service supports research in the hydrologic sciences and is committed to increasing the diversity of the workforce in this paper we explore the contributions of women to the hydrologic sciences at the forest service experimental forests and ranges the changes in the demography of women in hydrology at the usda forest service and consider future roles and directions for women in hydrology 1 2 the usda forest service supports hydrologic sciences the usda forest service forest service an agency within the department of agriculture is one of the world s largest forestry organizations with over 39 000 employees in 2017 westphal et al 2022 the forest service was established in 1904 with two primary missions 1 to manage the nation s forests and 2 to secure reliable clean water neary et al 2012 in 1908 the research and development deputy area fs r d was established and in 1909 the first forest service catchment study was initiated ice and stednick 2004 thus research to support hydrologic sciences has been part of the forest service s mission since the agency s beginning although fs r d is a relatively small part of the agency 5 of total employees in 2017 westphal et al 2022 its workforce is broadly distributed conducting research at five geographically based research stations as well as the forest products laboratory the international institute of tropical forestry and at the washington dc headquarters forest service r d also maintains and operates 81 experimental forests and ranges and four cooperating sites collectively call efrs distributed broadly across the us fig 1 the efrs represent the largest and longest running hydrological and ecological research network in the us this research network provides a wealth of long term data 100

gender fosters innovation improves performance and leads to more effective problem solving cheruvelil et al 2014 nielsen et al 2017 østergaard et al 2011 rice 2011 a more heterogeneous workforce is also more relevant to the diverse communities they serve batavia et al 2020 more specifically gender diversity is recognized as an important factor for creating a healthy work environment in research groups and at workplaces because women men and non binary individuals bring a multiplicity of thought processes and interpersonal skills to their workplaces nielsen et al 2018 popp et al 2019 despite the high value increasingly placed on diversity women remain underrepresented in science technology engineering and mathematics stem fields especially in the geosciences of which hydrology is a subdiscipline and at more senior roles further studies show that women in science are often the subject of more harassment and more hostile work environments than men in science gonzales 2019 mattheis et al 2022 wilson 2017 and are more often the subject of overt or subtler gender discrimination kern et al 2020 overcoming these and other barriers e g berhe et al 2022 marín spiotta et al 2020 to increasing the participation of women in stem is critical to meeting the socio ecological challenges including threats to water resources that we face in the 21st century 1 5 women in the forest service still an underrepresented group the forest service is committed to diversity in the workplace the agency s vision statement is we are a multicultural and diverse organization all employees are respected accepted and appreciated for their unique and important contribution to the mission usda forest service 2022 despite decadal scale efforts the numbers of women in the forest service as a whole and in fs r d specifically still lag behind those of men in 2017 women represented 34 of the entire forest service workforce and 41 of fs r d westphal et al 2022 across the entire forest service the percentage of women in senior level mid level and entry level positions was 42 40 and 29 respectively westphal et al 2022 although not equitable with men the outlook was better than for other areas of stem for example the percentage of women in senior level positions in the forest service in 2017 42 was higher than that reported for women in faculty positions in the geosciences at us universities in 2015 19 of total positions wilson 2017 the need to hire support and promote women in the environmental sciences at all levels to achieve equal representation with men clearly still exists 1 6 who are the women who have contributed to the hydrologic sciences at efrs although women may not have been involved in the early establishment of efrs they have been essential in maintaining these long term studies green et al 2021 see et al 2020 ensuring the integrity and quality of the data edwards et al 2019 edwards et al 2016 lany et al 2018 laseter et al 2012 developing new forms of analysis and synthesis e g rustad et al 2001 ryan et al 2002 and discovering new findings as the hydrology of forested ecosystems has changed over time e g adams et al 2014 dwire and mellmann brown 2017 eggert et al 2020 johnson et al 2022 knoepp et al 2016 more recently women have also assumed leadership roles at efrs as exemplified by marybeth adams project leader at the fernow efr 1990 to 2011 followed more recently by melissa thomas van gundy 2022 to present lindsey rustad team leader at hubbard brook efr 2007 to 2022 sherri johnson team leader at hj andrews efr 2010 to 2022 followed by brooke penaluna 2022 to present chelcy ford miniat project leader at coweeta hydrologic laboratory 2012 to 2019 and grizelle gonzales project leader at luquillo efr 2012 to present previous studies have examined gender representation in the fs r d kern et al 2015 and specifically the role of discrimination and harassment on job satisfaction within fs r d kern et al 2020 more recently work has been conducted on forest service employee diversity during a period of workforce contraction westphal et al 2022 here our goal was to understand how women have contributed to the hydrologic sciences at forest service efrs and how their role has changed over time we include women employed by the forest service who work at efrs at all career levels as well as those women scientists technicians and other staff from cooperating agencies and universities who have been instrumental to advances in hydrologic watershed science and or stream biogeochemical research at efrs specifically we asked 1 how have the women of hydrology at efrs contributed to hydrologic sciences and 2 how have the number and roles of women at employed specifically by the foret service at efrs changed over time we end with briefly summarizing in their own words how the women of hydrology at efrs view their past and aspire for the future 2 methods this study is based on data collected from an online efr data explorer the usda forest service human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat literature reviews and questionnaires 2 1 identify efr sites with hydrologic research programs we used the efr data explorer to identify efrs where the most recent scientist in charge sic of the efr had self reported that some type of hydrologic data had been collected at their efr hereafter hydroefrs we defined hydrologic data as data collected on precipitation rainfall or snowfall streamflow evaporation transpiration groundwater and or soil moisture the efr data explorer is an online tool documenting major foci of research at the efrs usda forest service 2022 2 2 identify women who have contributed to hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs we identified women who had contributed to the hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs by first emailing the sic for each of the hydroefrs identified by the efr data explorer they were asked to identify women who worked for the forest service or for universities or other agencies who had 1 spent a considerable portion of their career working at the sic s efr and who had 2 made contributions to advance hydrologic science these names are otherwise available but hard to find on publicly facing websites associated with efrs or can be found as authors co authors or in acknowledgment sections of publications associated with efrs we defined the hydrologic sciences broadly as hydrology watershed sciences and stream biogeochemistry specifically we asked each sic to provide information on women in eight categories we asked for information on if such women existed and if yes what their names were the categories included 1 forest service women scientists currently working at the efr 2 forest service women technicians staff currently working at the efr 3 forest service women scientists who had worked at the efr in the past 4 forest service women technicians staff who had worked at the efr in the past 5 university or other agency women scientists currently working at the efr 6 university or other agency women technicians staff currently working at the efr 7 university or other agency women scientists who had worked at the efr in the past 8 university or other agency women technicians staff who had worked at the efr in the past scientists included federal government research grade level 13 15 and 0 st equivalent scientists for government agencies and co principal investigators or collaborating scientists typically tenured or tenure track scientists or equivalents for academic institutions technicians and staff included field technicians information managers laboratory staff and others who spent a significant portion of their time assigned to the efr it was important to gather this information from the sic as not all women who contribute to the hydrologic sciences at efrs are classified as hydrologists office of personnel management opm series 1315 or hydrologic technicians opm series 1316 in the forest service employment database and it can be difficult to identify the many collaborating scientists and staff from universities ngos and other agencies who work at the efrs we were purposefully vague on a specific metric of contribution such as years of service or numbers of publications as the contributions varied widely across the efrs we wanted to include unsung heroes whose works might be critical for the success of the efr but whose names may not appear in journal articles or other more traditional forms of professional acknowledgment we did not ask about administrative staff in this compilation although we recognize and laud the critical support role they provide 2 3 contributions of women at efrs to the academic literature of hydrology and hydrology related sciences we used the web of science wos search tool to conduct a literature review on the names in our compilation of women of hydrology associated with hydroefrs though 2021 each name was entered into the researcher name search bar and search results were checked to confirm that published names included the correct variations of researchers names including known maiden names or hyphenated names that publications were related to hydrology or environmental sciences and that researchers from other fields that shared the same or similar common name were excluded the resulting list of authors and publications was saved as a wos marked list web of science tools were used to summarize the publications in the marked list for total number of academic publications the total number of citations the h index and the number of academic publications by wos research category journal affiliation and funding agency the h index is equal to the number of papers n in the list that has n or more citations the wos is a useful database but it is noteworthy that it is not complete as it may exclude some publications by some authors and it is possible that it includes some publications of women with the same names as those on our list but who are not associated with the hydroefrs 2 4 dmat usda forest service women in the hydrologic pay series although demographic data are not available for the entire hydrologic work force across the country such data are available for the usda forest service we sought to understand how the numbers of women in the forest service as a whole and in fs r d had changed since last reported for the period 1995 to 2017 by westphal et al 2022 we also wanted to understand more specifically how the numbers of women and men associated with hydroefrs and in the hydrologic occupational series 1315 and 1316 had changed over time following methods similar to westphal et al 2022 we obtained data from the personnel history data table from the forest service s human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat digitized data are available and reliable for this data table for each pay period or two weeks for each employee from 1992 through 2021 we pulled data from the single pay period 19 mid september to generate one annual sample for thirty years of records for each anonymized person employed during that specific pay period employees not employed during that pay period were missed for example summer seasonal employees would likely have been underrepresented the data for each anonymized individual included fiscal year fy the organizational code which contains information on deputy area research station region and program or project unit grade or general schedule classification gs level gender position title opm occupational series supervisory code duty station location city and state and pay plan to make inferences on grade level we filtered data by gs level and categorized gs levels 1 8 as lower 9 12 as mid and 13 15 and 0 as upper graded positions while grade and wage are positively correlated grade and career stage are not executives and senior scientists occur in the database as grade 0 to make inferences regarding hydrology we filtered data for the 1315 hydrologist and 1316 hydrologic science technician occupational series by gender fs r d versus non fs r d and year to make inferences regarding women at efrs we asked the sics at each hydroefr to identify the primary duty station locations associated with their sites sics at seven efrs identified multiple primary duty stations associated with their efr in all we had 41 duty locations identified as associated with the 31 hydroefr locations these duty station locations were used to create a new variable efr which assigned efr duty stations as efr and all other duty stations as non efr we recognize that not all individuals at these assigned efr duty stations work at the efr particularly at the larger duty stations similarly we also recognize that individuals at other duty stations are affiliated with efrs and their location may not have been identified by the sic to make inferences regarding supervisory status over time we coded a new variable sup that included all records as supervisor manager and leader including those meeting the legal definition of supervisor in the civil service reform act csra and those not meeting the legal definition but having supervisory duties and defined them as supervisors those listed as non supervisory were coded non supervisors to test for significant linear trends over time we used fiscal year as a continuous variable predicting the number of employees over time and used gender as a covariate to test for differences in slope and intercept we fit a general linear model to the data and used custom contrasts to test for differences in slope and intercept for gender according to zarnoch 2009 proc glm sas v9 4 all residuals were tested for significant autocorrelation proc arima sas v9 4 and while significant autocorrelation was found in most residual series the pattern appeared in most every series and had a similar cyclical pattern thus we feel inferences across regressions are robust 2 5 women of hydrology at efrs questionnaire we wanted to hear from the women themselves in their own words about their experiences working at the efrs our goal was not to conduct social science research but rather to provide an historical perspective on women in the hydrologic sciences who worked at efrs by asking them to tell us about their experiences to do this we sought email addresses from publicly available sources for the women whose names had been provided by the sics we were not able to find email addresses for all the women especially those that had retired for those with emails we contacted each one in accordance with the paperwork reduction act described the project and invited them to fill out a questionnaire on past present and future women in hydrology at efrs asking them about how they viewed their contributions to the hydrologic and other sciences multiple choice and open ended questions their networks and interactions with other women at their efrs multiple choice questions whether they had a woman as a mentor and what this meant to them multiple choice and open ended questions a favorite memory of working at their efr open ended question how they perceived the roles of women in hydrology changing at their efr over the past 50 years open ended question and what their vision was for women in hydrology at their efr for the future open ended question questionnaire in supplementary materials we explained that responding to the question was voluntary and the identities of women responding to the questionnaire would be anonymous we tabulated the answers to multiple choice questions for the open ended questions we developed categories based on the respones assigned the responses to the categories and tabulated the results woike 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hydroefrs studies of hydrologic and watershed processes were major components of work at the time of establishment at several efrs e g coweeta hydrologic laboratory nc hubbard brook ef nh san dimas ef ca hj andrews or gottfried et al 2014 and by 2008 fifteen efrs were considered watershed efrs by vose et al 2014 however many other efrs collect hydrologic and watershed data as part of their ongoing research using the efr data explorer usda forest service 2022 we identified 39 efrs that self identified as having collected some type of hydrologic data since their establishment of these we excluded eight efrs because the data were of limited scope e g precipitation data only or extent e g collection period less than ten years the 31 efr sites with hydrologic data hydroefrs are broadly distributed across the us fig 1 3 2 who are the women who have contributed to hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs a large number and diversity of women from across the country representing different scientific fields occupations career stages and agencies and institutions have contributed to the hydrologic and other sciences at hydroefrs the sics from all 31 hydroefrs provided information on women in hydrology at their efr from these responses we created a compilation of 180 women associated with the hydroefrs we recognize that some sics had better knowledge of current and past scientists technicians and cooperators than others some were more willing than others to consult peers or review past documents from their efrs to identify the women of hydrology at their efrs and none had complete knowledge of all the women who had contributed to the hydrologic sciences at their efr thus our compilation is an underestimate of the number names and roles of women at these hydroefrs and we apologize to those women whose names have not been recognized despite these caveats this compilation does represent a cross section of forest service and collaborating scientists technicians and staff who are contributing or have contributed to hydrologic sciences at these efrs fig 2 several observations about these women include thirty nine percent of the women worked or had worked for the forest service and 61 worked or had worked for universities or other agencies the large number of women from non forest service organizations shows that hydroefrs serve an important role as research and training grounds for women in hydrology across the us and not just within the forest service sixty percent of the women were scientists 40 were technicians or staff this highlights the contributions of women of all levels not just scientists to hydrologic sciences at these sites the women were divided nearly equally between those that currently work at hydroefrs 53 and those that had worked at hydroefrs in the past 47 the percentages were similar for scientists and technicians staff this may reflect the sics knowledge of women currently working at their hydroefr vs those in the past or could reflect an increase in the percentage of women working at the hydroefrs now compared to the past 3 3 what are the contributions of women at hydroefrs to the academic literature of hydrology and hydrology related sciences women associated with hydroefrs have contributed to a substantial and diverse body of research over the past 45 years of 180 names of women associated with hydroefrs we were able to find publications for 136 76 on the wos given that scientists represented 59 of the total number of women in our compilation fig 2 this shows that women in science support roles 41 of compilation were contributing to the published literature alongside scientists examples of these contributions include those by field technicians green et al 2021 see et al 2020 information managers edwards et al 2019 edwards et al 2016 lany et al 2018 laseter et al 2012 chemists brown et al 2021 and laboratory physical scientist technicians hislop and hornbeck 2002 women of hydroefrs were prolific publishers for the 136 women with publications on wos we identified a total of 3 099 publications for the period 1977 to 2021 which had been cited 174 642 times with an h index of 181 through 2021 fig 3 not all of these publications are based on research from the author s hydroefrs however hydroefrs as places to conduct long term research and monitoring and as communities of scientific practice likely helped shape the careers and research of these women and hence contributed directly or indirectly to these publications conversely research of these women conducted elsewhere may have shaped the direction of their work at the hydroefrs it is noteworthy that the early papers in our review were published in the late 1970s meyer 1979 meyer and likens 1979 which was 70 years after the establishment of the first efr in 1909 we suggest this could be due to the sics not having known the names of earlier women pioneers at efrs that women were not generally encouraged nor supported to publish during the early years of the efrs kline 2021 or that few women worked at these sites prior to the 1970s the large number of publications reinforces that hydroefrs are important research and training sites for women across the us although results for the top 15 affiliations showed that 29 of the publications were co authored by scientists affiliated with usda 15 were co authored by scientists affiliated with other federal agencies and 55 were co authored by scientists affiliated with academic institutions fig 4 the women of hydroefrs have been publishing across a broad range of environmental and hydrologic disciplines of the top 15 wos categories 22 of the publications were categorized as environmental science 19 as ecology 10 as geosciences 9 as water resources and 40 as other watershed science related fields fig 5 this range of disciplines is further reflected in the diversity of journals where the women were publishing total of 487 journals which include biogeochemistry forest ecology and management hydrologic processes water resources research ecology ecosystems and more fig 6 collectively the women have co authored 16 publications in science 15 in nature and ten in nature geoscience the research has largely been funded by the us federal government of the top 15 wos funding agencies roughly half of the publications 52 acknowledged the national science foundation as a funding source nineteen percent 14 and 16 acknowledged the usda other federal agencies and international organizations respectively fig 7 it is noteworthy that it has not always been the standard to acknowledge the organization such as the usda forest service responsible for funding the long term datasets and or research sites that are foundational to research papers this is changing as scientists are routinely expected to publish data in publically accessible archives with unique digital object identifiers doi and as more research sites have provided standardized acknowledgements to authors for example all research manuscripts published using foundational data produced by the hubbard brook experimental forest in nh can cite a doi for the underlying data and are expected to include the acknowledgement the hubbard brook experimental forest is operated and maintained by the usda forest service northern research station madison wi 1014507 1114804 it is also noteworthy that in this analysis we include all the papers from a female scientist that has worked at an hydroefr assuming that the scientist has been influenced by the hydroefr or the scientist s work has in turn influenced the work at the efr thus work funded elsewhere by other organizations not supporting the hydroefrs are included although it is beyond the scope of this paper to produce an annotated bibliography of these publications selected highlights include the foundational work on nutrient cycling and metabolism in streams by judy meyer meyer 1979 meyer et al 1988 meyer et al 1998 the impacts of acidic deposition on surface waters by mary beth adams adams et al 1993 adams et al 1997 pamela edwards edwards et al 2002a edwards et al 2002b and lindsey rustad rustad et al 1993 long term trends in hydrology and implications for management by sherri johnson johnson et al 2021 johnson and jones 2000 instream processing of nitrogen by emily bernhardt bernhardt et al 2003 bernhardt et al 2002 novel surface water pollutants such as pharmaceuticals by emma rosi rosi marshall et al 2015 rosi marshall and royer 2012 topographic edaphic and vegetative controls on plant available water by salli dymond dymond et al 2017 and controls on streamflow generation in small catchments by carol hunsaker hunsaker et al 2012 liu et al 2013 women have also led cross site syntheses such as on trends in stream nitrogen in catchments across the usa by alba argerich argerich et al 2013 on regulations of streamflow response to climate change at long term ecological research sites by julia jones jones et al 2012 and on climate change impacts on forest water yield at long term experimental watersheds across north america by irena creed creed et al 2014 in addition to basic research women at hydroefrs have provided practical guidance on management and planning such as the work on water yield following forest grass transitions by katharine elliot elliott et al 2017 on whether management can sustain water based ecosystem services in the face of climate change by chelcy ford miniat ford et al 2011b and the work on ecohydrological disturbances associated with roads by beverley wemple wemple et al 2017 wemple and jones 2003 finally women at the hydroefrs have contributed to commentaries on science and society such as envisioning the next decade of big data in environmental sciences by kathleen weathers and emma rosi ladeau et al 2017b unraveling issues of the peer review process by kate lajtha lajtha 2019 lajtha and baveye 2010 frontiers in ecosystem ecology and leveraging the anthropocene by kathleen weathers weathers et al 2016 weathers et al 2021 and even integrating art and science as in the work of lindsey rustad rustad et al 2018 although impressive we remind the reader that this compilation is an underestimate of the contributions of women to the hydrologic and environmental sciences at hydroefrs because the current sics likely had incomplete knowledge of all the women who had contributed over time to their efrs and the wos has an incomplete listing of all the publications for all the women 3 4 the changing forest service workforce understanding demographic trends across the nation s hydrologic workforce can help agencies and institutions plan for a more equitable diverse and productive future although centralized demographic data from organizations across the country are not available such data are obtainable from the usda forest service one of the largest environmental employers in the nation identifying the women and men who worked at hydroefrs is challenging as no single forest service identifier exists for the efrs or the hydrologic workforce within the efrs the diverse efr workforce which contributes to hydrologic research includes hydrologists series 1315 hydrologic technicians series 1316 ecologists series 0408 foresters series 0460 forestry technicians series 0462 geologists series 1350 biologists series 0401 physical scientists series 1301 and others to explore gender trends we present perspectives on changes in the forest service as a whole the fs r d deputy area within the fs the hydroefrs as defined by duty stations within fs r d and the hydrology series positions within fs r d discussions are based on modelled trends and not absolute values 3 4 1 overall decline in workforce the forest service workforce is large but it has declined significantly 23 over the last 30 years table 1 fig 8 a the fs r d workforce declined more over the last 30 years 55 than the non r d workforce 20 table 1 within fs r d the workforce at hydroefr associated duty stations declined by 53 compared to all other duty stations 57 there are very few hydrologists and hydrologic technicians in fs r d 2 3 of fs r d and these employees have declined over the last 30 years by 39 these trends represent a significant loss of scientific capacity in general and a significant loss of scientific capacity in the hydrologic sciences specifically within fs r d 3 4 1 changes in workforce over time by gender despite decades of change westphal et al 2022 the forest service remains majority male with about twice as many men compared to women as of 2021 table 2 for the entire forest service the rate of workforce decline e g slope of trend line and the absolute numbers of positions lost over the last 30 years were similar by gender table 2 however because the total number of women in the forest service was smaller this resulted in a larger percent decline for women 31 vs men 19 fig 8a and a significant decline in the ratio of women men from 0 61 in 1992 to 0 50 in 2021 table 3 fig 9 within fs r d the number of women in the workforce declined significantly more than men in the workforce 59 for women vs 53 for men fig 8b this resulted in a significant decline in the ratio of women men from 0 73 in 1992 to 0 68 in 2021 table 3 fig 9 within the hydro efr duty stations the percent loss of women in the workforce was less than the percent loss of men 50 vs 56 resulting in a significant increase in the ratio of women to men from 0 68 in 1992 and 0 79 in 2021 table 3 the positions in the relatively small hydrology series workforce in the fs r d are mostly held by men table 2 fig 8c within these hydrology positions the number of women declined less than men in the workforce 26 for women 43 for men but this did not result in a significant increase in the ratio of women men over time table 3 3 4 3 changes in workforce over time by grade level and gender most of the workforce declines since 1992 occurred in lower graded positions these lower graded positions declined by 27 across the entire forest service by 82 in fs r d by 79 at hydroefrs and by 33 for the hydrology series workforce table 1 the mid graded positions were the next most lost positions at 24 34 36 and 52 across the entire forest service fs r d the hydroefrs and hydrology series workforce respectively table 1 for the higher graded positions there was no significant change in the numbers of these positions over time across the entire forest service however there was a 35 26 and 27 loss in these positions in fs r d the hydroefrs and the hydrology series workforce respectively table 1 we suggest caution on interpretation of the hydrology series data due to low numbers more women than men were lost in the lower graded positions across the entire forest service 59 women vs 1 men in fs r d 85 women vs 77 men at the hydroefrs 80 women vs 78 men and in the hydrology series positions 61 women vs 23 men table 2 the number of women in higher graded positions increased and the number of men in higher graded positions decreased across the entire forest service 126 women vs 28 men in fs r d 33 women vs 49 men at the hydroefrs 54 women vs 42 men and the hydrology series positions 331 women vs 50 men the ratio of women men in higher graded positions at the hydroefrs increased from 0 17 in 1992 to 0 50 in 2021 table 3 overall this shows an increase in the number of senior women in the fs r d hydrologic workforce it is noteworthy that the increase in the number of women in the higher graded positions is concomitant with the loss of support at the lower and mid graded positions this could suggest that women who currently occupy the higher graded positions are either performing more basic research and administrative tasks than their earlier men and women counterparts e g more sample measurements data analyses administration etc or conducting more synthetic science vs basic science related research our bibliographic data suggests the latter may be true as there were no publications from 1992 through 2000 with synthesis related key words e g synthesis meta analysis meta regression and fifteen publications with synthesis related key words between 2001 and 2021 if the trend for loss of women and men in lower graded positions continues generating basic science from new data collection may be diminished reducing basic science publications and our ability to conduct synthetic work in the future the loss of women in the lower positions also suggests a diminishing internal pool of applicants i e pipeline for advancement to mid or eventually higher graded positions 3 4 4 changes in workforce over time by supervisory position and gender as with the overall workforce the proportions of managers across the entire forest service and in fs r d were predominantly male in 2021 71 and 61 respectively table 2 during the period 1992 to 2021 the number of managers did not change significantly across the entire forest service or at the hydroefrs but declined by 32 in fs r d in fs r d the number of women managers declined less than men managers 12 and 41 respectively the relationship between the change in the number of managers vs the change in workforce resulted in an increase in the number of managers per capita across the forest service 0 26 managers per capita in 1992 to 0 31 managers per capita in 2021 and fs r d 0 24 managers per capita in 1992 to 0 30 managers per capita in 2021 the increase in managers per capita in fs r d was mostly driven by an increase in the number of women managers per capita 0 07 women managers per capita in 1992 to 0 12 women managers per capita in 2021 this shows a small improvement in the role of women as managers in the fs r d 3 4 5 summary of workforce changes and suggestions for future research taken together these results suggest there has been an overall loss of women across the nested categories from the entire forest service to the hydrology series positions and that these losses were greatest in the lower graded positions at the same time the proportion of women at higher grade levels increased across the nested categories from the entire forest service to the hydrology series positions and the proportion of women managers increased demonstrating an overall increase in the proportion of women in leadership positions although our historical data do not permit us to analyze the causes or impacts of these trends it is likely that these women in leadership roles serve as role models for other women in the forest service and the broader scientific community increase sensitivity of forest service leadership to gender based issues such as wage equity workplace safety and accommodations for family and gender based medical leave and bring their unique perspectives to research and management agendas we suggest that investigating these impacts is a fertile area for future research we also acknowledge that the trends reported for the usda forest service are likely different than those at other federal state and private institutions and thus represent a microcosm of trends across the nation further work to uncover demographic trends at other agencies would complement the work reported here 3 5 voices of women of hydrology at efrs the past present and future women in hydrology at efrs questionnaire offered the women associated with the hydroefrs a unique opportunity to share their experiences we located publicly available emails for 119 of the 180 women identified by the sics of the 119 44 responded to the past present and future women in hydrology at efrs questionnaire 37 return rate table 4 the respondents were roughly evenly divided between those affiliated with the forest sericve and those affiliated with other agencies or universities most of the women 75 were affiliated with the efr at the time they completed the questionnaire approximately half the respondents were scientists 55 23 were technicians or other staff 11 were other professionals and 9 were students the women who responded were or had been actively engaged in many aspects of the hydrologic sciences at their efr ninety three percent self reported that they contributed to fieldwork 73 to making new discoveries 68 to writing manuscripts 50 to information management 50 to laboratory work and 25 to other work in hydrology they were also engaged in other activities at the efr with 64 contributing to training and mentoring others 46 involved in giving tours 43 involved in technology transfer with stakeholders 39 helping to support the infrastructure at the site and 20 contributing in other ways to ongoing science at their efrs the respondents in general had significant and regular interactions with other women of the 44 respondents 27 of the respondents indicated they had 10 other women in their hydrologic social network 14 indicated that number was 6 10 39 indicated that number was 3 5 20 indicated that number was 1 2 and no respondent indicated that they had no other women in their hydrologic social networks when asked how often do you did you collaborate d with other women at your efr with 1 being hardly ever and 5 being every day 7 said hardly ever 34 said every day and the average score was 3 7 slightly more than half 57 of the respondents reported they had had women as mentors 43 said they had not of the 25 women who indicated they had women mentors 22 identified that having a woman mentor influenced their careers fifty five percent indicated that the mentors influenced their careers by providing support and encouragement 45 indicated that their mentors were a role model inspiration 27 indicated that their mentors helped them navigate gender based landscapes and 9 indicated that they had good male and female mentors which we interpreted as having a female mentor was not as important as having a mentor the respondents felt that they had made major contributions to hydrology thirty six responded to a prompt on what they considered their major contribution to the field of hydrology of these the most often cited contribution was related to improving understanding of hydrologic processes 69 followed by contributing to the collection curation and stewardship of long term data 33 and then contributions to land management 22 also the respondents were involved in many activities that contributed to the overall success of their efrs the top two categories were intellectual contributions to other scientific disciplines and studies 40 followed by contributing to collection analysis curation and stewardship of long term data 34 their third most mentioned other major accomplishment was contributing to the social capital of the efr via teamwork networking mentoring 20 some of the most colorful responses related to memorable moments experienced by the respondents while working at their efrs more than three quarters of the respondents offered favorite memories with the most often cited categories of favorite moments dealing with friendships camaraderie and personal encounters 56 followed by overcoming adversity on a challenging field day 35 tales of teamwork 26 encounters with immersion in nature 24 and aha creative moments 21 each one respondent claimed to have no positive memory of her efr finally the respondents reflected on a half century of change for women in hydrology at efrs and described their visions for the future the majority of the respondents 89 reflected on how the number and roles of women in hydrology had changed at efrs over the past 50 years with the most frequently cited observation being that there were more women in hydrologic research 77 this is consistent with the dmat data which showed an increase in the ratio of women men in the fs hydroefrs this was followed in frequency by comments that there was more respect acceptance for women of hydrology 26 and then a range of other comments including more opportunities for research and collaboration for women 10 and change in role from office administrators to field staff 10 only 8 thought there were more women in leadership roles and 5 said they did not know this is contrary to the dmat data for the forest service that showed conclusively an increase in the number of women in leadership positions between 1992 and 2021 including at the hydroefrs more research on lags in recognition of demographic trends is warranted the respondents envisioned a more equitable future for hydrologic research the most frequently cited vision for the future was simply that more women will participate in hydrology at efrs in the future 57 this was followed closely by comments that there will be no need to consider gender issues of equal opportunity access respect and wages at efrs in the future 46 and then by an expectation that there will be more women in leadership roles at efrs in the future 24 two respondents hoped that future considerations would shift from the binary male female conversation to include individuals of non binary physical or sexual orientation as well in sum the voices of the women at the hydroefrs who chose to share their experiences with us reflected a positive attitude towards their work at efrs in general they were actively involved in many aspects of the efrs from research to education and outreach and they were proud of their contributions to their efrs most had networks of other women with whom they interacted frequently and many listed their opportunity to network and for camaraderie as salient features of their experiences only about half indicated they had women mentors in their careers although they generally found these mentors important to their career advancement and satisfaction increasing mentorship for women in hydrology may be an opportunity for the future finally the women sensed that the numbers of women in hydrology had increased over time and they wished for more equity for women in the future 4 conclusions our results show that hydroefrs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences who in turn have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long term research sites this is reflected in their 3 000 publications since 1977 their involvement in all aspects of the research cycle and their voices of appreciation for their work at hydroefrs further hydroefrs are important research and training sites not only for women in hydrology at fs r d but also for women in hydrology at cooperating agencies universities and ngos across the country at the forest service r d scientific capacity in general and for women specifically has declined over the last 30 years including a 59 decline in the numbers of women in the fs r d workforce 50 decline in the numbers of women in the hydroefr workforce and 26 decline in the numbers of women in the hydrologic series workforce such contractions are a threat to the ability of fs r d to continue to sustain high quality hydrologic research training and outreach to mentor women in the existing workforce and to attract qualified women to this workforce in the future despite declines in numbers the hydrologic workforce in fs r d has maintained or increased its gender diversity over the last 30 years specifically the ratio of women men increased at the hydroefrs from 0 68 to 0 79 this was consistent with the voices of the women of hydroefrs where nearly three quarters of the respondents thought there were more women at hydroefrs now than in the past this is in contrast to the declines in the ratio of women men across the entire forest service and across fs r d during this same period further despite the declines in numbers the representation of women in higher grade positions and leadership roles has increased across the entire forest service across fs r d and at hydroefrs the contributions of these women to increasing attention to gender based issues to serving as role models for other women both within and outside the forest service and to shaping science in new ways requires further social science research as water crises around the world continue to escalate building a strong workforce in the hydrologic sciences has never been more important research shows that diversity matters and that increasing the diversity of a workforce can spark innovation improve performance and lead to more effective problem solving cheruvelil et al 2014 nielsen et al 2017 østergaard et al 2011 rice 2011 investment in a diversity of race ethnicity and gender remains a priority in stem fields across the country in general and at the forest service specifically the data presented here suggest that the representation of women in the fs r d hydrologic workforce remains low and 2 investment in the efrs as centers for research and training for women in hydrology and investments in attracting and retaining women in the field of hydrology may benefit this discipline the voices of the women of hydroefrs expressed a hope for a more equitable future and one where gender would no longer need to be a consideration declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

1836,the increase in the frequency and severity of water crises around the world necessitates maintaining or augmenting investments in the hydrologic sciences including in a trained diverse workforce the usda forest service operates a network of 85 experimental forests and ranges experimental watersheds and cooperating sites efrs 31 of which include long term hydrologic studies hydroefrs the hydroefrs are centers for hydrologic science and education and play a key role informing watershed policy and management the goals of this study were to understand 1 how broadly the women associated with the hydroefrs including women in the forest service workforce and women with cooperating agencies or universities who have worked at hydroefrs have contributed to hydrologic sciences and 2 how more specifically the number and roles of women in the forest service workforce associated with the hydroefrs have changed over time data were collected from the efr data explorer the usda forest service human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat literature reviews and questionnaires to usda efr scientists in charge and to women who were or had been involved in hydrologic sciences at efrs results showed that women associated with the hydroefrs have made significant contributions to the hydrologic sciences including authoring or co authoring over 3 000 publications with over 170 000 citations since 1977 and an h index of 181 in their own words the women indicated that they were also active in contributing to hydrologic fieldwork providing stewardship for long term data and contributing to the social capital of the hydroefrs through teamwork collaboration and mentoring for the forest service trends in employment records from 1992 through 2021 showed a 55 contraction of the entire fs r d workforce including a 59 loss in the number of women in the fs r d workforce a 50 loss in the number of women associated with hydroefr duty stations and a 26 loss in the number of women in hydrology positions during this period there was a greater loss of both women and men in lower graded positions relative to higher graded positions in the fs r d workforce with serial implications for the ability of the workforce to collect data produce basic science publications and conduct syntheses although the ratio of women men declined across the forest service and fs r d the ratio of women men increased at the hydroefrs driven by a higher ratio of women men at higher grade levels and for management positions within fs r d and at the hydroefrs when asked women valued their contributions to the hydrologic sciences and envisioned a more equitable future for women in hydrology overall results show that hydroefrs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences who in turn have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long term research sites as

forestry wildlife transportation industry and recreation water quantity and quality on earth is changing in myriad ways for example increasing populations and urbanization are placing more demands on local water supplies increasing point and non point source pollutants are contaminating water resources human alterations including dams fracking irrigation and draining of wetlands are altering local surface and subsurface water flows and a changing global climate is modifying the amount timing distribution and phase of precipitation unevenly across the globe e g grafton et al 2013 taylor et al 2013 vörösmarty et al 2010 as such the need to support the hydrologic sciences and to maintain and grow a trained diverse workforce to address water issues of today and the future has never been more important the usda forest service supports research in the hydrologic sciences and is committed to increasing the diversity of the workforce in this paper we explore the contributions of women to the hydrologic sciences at the forest service experimental forests and ranges the changes in the demography of women in hydrology at the usda forest service and consider future roles and directions for women in hydrology 1 2 the usda forest service supports hydrologic sciences the usda forest service forest service an agency within the department of agriculture is one of the world s largest forestry organizations with over 39 000 employees in 2017 westphal et al 2022 the forest service was established in 1904 with two primary missions 1 to manage the nation s forests and 2 to secure reliable clean water neary et al 2012 in 1908 the research and development deputy area fs r d was established and in 1909 the first forest service catchment study was initiated ice and stednick 2004 thus research to support hydrologic sciences has been part of the forest service s mission since the agency s beginning although fs r d is a relatively small part of the agency 5 of total employees in 2017 westphal et al 2022 its workforce is broadly distributed conducting research at five geographically based research stations as well as the forest products laboratory the international institute of tropical forestry and at the washington dc headquarters forest service r d also maintains and operates 81 experimental forests and ranges and four cooperating sites collectively call efrs distributed broadly across the us fig 1 the efrs represent the largest and longest running hydrological and ecological research network in the us this research network provides a wealth of long term data 100 years and knowledge of ecological change including hydrology in natural and managed forest and grassland ecosystems across the us 1 3 major contributions of efrs to hydrologic science the us forest service efrs have contributed significantly to the hydrologic sciences over the past century hayes et al 2014 wells et al 2009 and the examples set by the efrs are aspired to and emulated by researchers around the world e g deng et al 2011 kaste and skjelkvåle 2002 norton et al 1999 wright and jenkins 2001 the efrs are distinctive for 1 collection and maintenance of long term high quality place based hydrologic climatic soils and vegetation data since as far back as the 1930s which provide irreplaceable resources for the hydrologic science 2 long term watershed experiments which have provided information on the initial and persistent effects of natural disturbance pollution and forestry practices on streamflow and biogeochemical cycling 3 the pioneering of new approaches technologies and types of measurements in the hydrologic sciences and 4 supporting inter generational communities of researchers with long term understanding of the places they are studying more specifically early hydrological research at efrs produced foundational knowledge on the response of streams snowpack and riparian biogeochemistry to forest management and land cover change e g

and the clean water act mcclain et al 2003 vose et al 2014 wells et al 2009 finally efrs also serve as major centers for education and outreach in the form of demonstration projects tours and student and early career scientist training vose et al 2014 wells et al 2009 in all the efrs have been powerhouses for hydrologic science and education in the us over the past century and continue to play a key role hydrologic science and informing watershed policy and management 1 4 the importance of a diverse workforce a growing body of knowledge shows that workforce diversity of race ethnicity and gender fosters innovation improves performance and leads to more effective problem solving cheruvelil et al 2014 nielsen et al 2017 østergaard et al 2011 rice 2011 a more heterogeneous workforce is also more relevant to the diverse communities they serve batavia et al 2020 more specifically gender diversity is recognized as an important factor for creating a healthy work environment in research groups and at workplaces because women men and non binary individuals bring a multiplicity of thought processes and interpersonal skills to their workplaces nielsen et al 2018 popp et al 2019 despite the high value increasingly placed on diversity women remain underrepresented in science technology engineering and mathematics stem fields especially in the geosciences of which hydrology is a subdiscipline and at more senior roles further studies show that women in science are often the subject of more harassment and more hostile work environments than men in science gonzales 2019 mattheis et al 2022 wilson 2017 and are more often the subject of overt or subtler gender discrimination kern et al 2020 overcoming these and other barriers e g berhe et al 2022 marín spiotta et al 2020 to increasing the participation of women in stem is critical to meeting the socio ecological challenges including threats to water resources that we face in the 21st century 1 5 women in the forest service still an underrepresented group the forest service is committed to diversity in the workplace the agency s vision statement is we are a multicultural and diverse organization all employees are respected accepted and appreciated for their unique and important contribution to the mission usda forest service 2022 despite decadal scale efforts the numbers of women in the forest service as a whole and in fs r d specifically still lag behind those of men in 2017 women represented 34 of the entire forest service workforce and 41 of fs r d westphal et al 2022 across the entire forest service the percentage of women in senior level mid level and entry level positions was 42 40 and 29 respectively westphal et al 2022 although not equitable with men the outlook was better than for other areas of stem for example the percentage of women in senior level positions in the forest service in 2017 42 was higher than that reported for women in faculty positions in the geosciences at us universities in 2015 19 of total positions wilson 2017 the need to hire support and promote women in the environmental sciences at all levels to achieve equal representation with men clearly still exists 1 6 who are the women who have contributed to the hydrologic sciences at efrs although women may not have been involved in the early establishment of efrs they have been essential in maintaining these long term studies green et al 2021 see et al 2020 ensuring the integrity and quality of the data edwards et al 2019 edwards et al 2016 lany et al 2018 laseter et al 2012 developing

mellmann brown 2017 eggert et al 2020 johnson et al 2022 knoepp et al 2016 more recently women have also assumed leadership roles at efrs as exemplified by marybeth adams project leader at the fernow efr 1990 to 2011 followed more recently by melissa thomas van gundy 2022 to present lindsey rustad team leader at hubbard brook efr 2007 to 2022 sherri johnson team leader at hj andrews efr 2010 to 2022 followed by brooke penaluna 2022 to present chelcy ford miniat project leader at coweeta hydrologic laboratory 2012 to 2019 and grizelle gonzales project leader at luquillo efr 2012 to present previous studies have examined gender representation in the fs r d kern et al 2015 and specifically the role of discrimination and harassment on job satisfaction within fs r d kern et al 2020 more recently work has been conducted on forest service employee diversity during a period of workforce contraction westphal et al 2022 here our goal was to understand how women have contributed to the hydrologic sciences at forest service efrs and how their role has changed over time we include women employed by the forest service who work at efrs at all career levels as well as those women scientists technicians and other staff from cooperating agencies and universities who have been instrumental to advances in hydrologic watershed science and or stream biogeochemical research at efrs specifically we asked 1 how have the women of hydrology at efrs contributed to hydrologic sciences and 2 how have the number and roles of women at employed specifically by the foret service at efrs changed over time we end with briefly summarizing in their own words how the women of hydrology at efrs view their past and aspire for the future 2 methods this study is based on data collected from an online efr data explorer the usda forest service human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat literature reviews and questionnaires 2 1 identify efr sites with hydrologic research programs we used the efr data explorer to identify efrs where the most recent scientist in charge sic of the efr had self reported that some type of hydrologic data had been collected at their efr hereafter hydroefrs we defined hydrologic data as data collected on precipitation rainfall or snowfall streamflow evaporation transpiration groundwater and or soil moisture the efr data explorer is an online tool documenting major foci of research at the efrs usda forest service 2022 2 2 identify women who have contributed to hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs we identified women who had contributed to the hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs by first emailing the sic for each of the hydroefrs identified by the efr data explorer they were asked to identify women who worked for the forest service or for universities or other agencies who had 1 spent a considerable portion of their career working at the sic s efr and who had 2 made contributions to advance hydrologic science these names are otherwise available but hard to find on publicly facing websites associated with efrs or can be found as authors co authors or in acknowledgment sections of publications associated with efrs we defined the hydrologic sciences broadly as hydrology watershed sciences and stream biogeochemistry specifically we asked each sic to provide information on women in eight categories we asked for information on if such women existed and if yes what their names were the categories included 1 forest service women scientists currently working at the efr 2 forest service women technicians staff currently working at the efr 3 forest service women scientists who had worked at the efr in the past 4 forest service women technicians staff who had worked at the efr in the past 5 university or other agency women scientists currently working at the efr 6 university or other agency women technicians staff currently working at the efr 7 university or other agency women scientists who had worked at the efr in the past 8 university or other agency women technicians staff who had worked at the efr in the past scientists included federal government research grade level 13 15 and 0 st equivalent scientists for government agencies and co principal investigators or collaborating scientists typically tenured or tenure track scientists or equivalents for academic institutions technicians and staff included field technicians information managers laboratory staff and others who spent a significant portion of their time assigned to the efr it was important to gather this information from the sic as not all women who contribute to the hydrologic sciences at efrs are classified as hydrologists office of personnel management opm series 1315 or hydrologic technicians opm series 1316 in the forest service employment database and it can be difficult to identify the many collaborating scientists and staff from universities ngos and other agencies who work at the efrs we were purposefully vague on a specific metric of contribution such as years of service or numbers of publications as the contributions varied widely across the efrs we wanted to include unsung heroes whose works might be critical for the success of the efr but whose names may not appear in journal articles or other more traditional forms of professional acknowledgment we did not ask about administrative staff in this compilation although we recognize and laud the critical support role they provide 2 3 contributions of women at efrs to the academic literature of hydrology and hydrology related sciences we used the web of science wos search tool to conduct a literature review on the names in our compilation of women of hydrology associated with hydroefrs though 2021 each name was entered into the researcher name search bar and search results were checked to confirm that published names included the correct variations of researchers names including known maiden names or hyphenated names that publications were related to hydrology or environmental sciences and that researchers from other fields that shared the same or similar common name were excluded the resulting list of authors and publications was saved as a wos marked list web of science tools were used to summarize the publications in the marked list for total number of academic publications the total number of citations the h index and the number of academic publications by wos research category journal affiliation and funding agency the h index is equal to the number of papers n in the list that has n or more citations the wos is a useful database but it is noteworthy that it is not complete as it may exclude some publications by some authors and it is possible that it includes some publications of women with the same names as those on our list but who are not associated with the hydroefrs 2 4 dmat usda forest service women in the hydrologic pay series although demographic data are not available for the entire hydrologic work force across the country such data are available for the usda forest service we sought to understand how the numbers of women in the forest service as a whole and in fs r d had changed since last reported for the period 1995 to 2017 by westphal et al 2022 we also wanted to understand more specifically how the numbers of women and men associated with hydroefrs and in the hydrologic occupational series 1315 and 1316 had changed over time following methods similar to westphal et al 2022 we obtained data from the personnel history data table from the forest service s human resources management hrm data metrics and analysis team dmat digitized data are available and reliable for this data table for each pay period or two weeks for each employee from 1992 through 2021 we pulled data from the single pay period 19 mid september to generate one annual sample for thirty years of records for each anonymized person employed during that specific pay period employees not employed during that pay period were missed for example summer seasonal employees would likely have been underrepresented the data for each anonymized individual included fiscal year fy the organizational code which contains information on deputy area research station region and program or project unit grade or general schedule classification gs level gender position title opm occupational series supervisory code duty station location city and state and pay plan to make inferences on grade level we filtered data by gs level and categorized gs levels 1 8 as lower 9 12 as mid and 13 15 and 0 as upper graded positions while grade and wage are positively correlated grade and career stage are not executives and senior scientists occur in the database as grade 0 to make inferences regarding hydrology we filtered data for the 1315 hydrologist and 1316 hydrologic science technician occupational series by gender fs r d versus non fs r d and year to make inferences regarding women at efrs we asked the sics at each hydroefr to identify the primary duty station locations associated with their sites sics at seven efrs identified multiple primary duty stations associated with their efr in all we had 41 duty locations identified as associated with the 31 hydroefr locations these duty station locations were used to create a new variable efr which assigned efr duty stations as efr and all other duty stations as non efr we recognize that not all individuals at these assigned efr duty stations work at the efr particularly at the larger duty stations similarly we also recognize that individuals at other duty stations are affiliated with efrs and their location may not have been identified by the sic to make inferences regarding supervisory status over time we coded a new variable sup that included all records as supervisor manager and leader including those meeting the legal definition of supervisor in the civil service reform act csra and those not meeting the legal definition but having supervisory duties and defined them as supervisors those listed as non supervisory were coded non supervisors to test for significant linear trends over time we used fiscal year as a continuous variable predicting the number of employees over time and used gender as a covariate to test for differences in slope and intercept we fit a general linear model to the data and used custom contrasts to test for differences in slope and intercept for gender according to zarnoch 2009 proc glm sas v9 4 all residuals were tested for significant autocorrelation proc arima sas v9 4 and while significant autocorrelation was found in most residual series the pattern appeared in most every series and had a similar cyclical pattern thus we feel inferences across regressions are robust 2 5 women of hydrology at efrs questionnaire we wanted to hear from the women themselves in their own words about their experiences working at the efrs our goal was not to conduct social science research but rather to provide an historical perspective on women in the hydrologic sciences who worked at efrs by asking them to tell us about their experiences to do this we sought email addresses from publicly available sources for the women whose names had been provided by the sics we were not able to find email addresses for all the women especially those that had retired for those with emails we contacted each one in accordance with the paperwork reduction act described the project and invited them to fill out a questionnaire on past present and future women in hydrology at efrs asking them about how they viewed their contributions to the hydrologic and other sciences multiple choice and open ended questions their networks and interactions with other women at their efrs multiple choice questions whether they had a woman as a mentor and what this meant to them multiple choice and open ended questions a favorite memory of working at their efr open ended question how they perceived the roles of women in hydrology changing at their efr over the past 50 years open ended question and what their vision was for women in hydrology at their efr for the future open ended question questionnaire in supplementary materials we explained that responding to the question was voluntary and the identities of women responding to the questionnaire would be anonymous we tabulated the answers to multiple choice questions for the open ended questions we developed categories based on the respones assigned the responses to the categories and tabulated the results woike 2007 3 results and discussion 3 1 the hydroefrs studies of hydrologic and watershed processes were major components of work at the time of establishment at several efrs e g coweeta hydrologic laboratory nc hubbard brook ef nh san dimas ef ca hj andrews or gottfried et al 2014 and by 2008 fifteen efrs were considered watershed efrs by vose et al 2014 however many other efrs collect hydrologic and watershed data as part of their ongoing research using the efr data explorer usda forest service 2022 we identified 39 efrs that self identified as having collected some type of hydrologic data since their establishment of these we excluded eight efrs because the data were of limited scope e g precipitation data only or extent e g collection period less than ten years the 31 efr sites with hydrologic data hydroefrs are broadly distributed across the us fig 1 3 2 who are the women who have contributed to hydrologic sciences at hydroefrs a large number and diversity of women from across the country representing different scientific fields occupations career stages and agencies and institutions have contributed to the hydrologic and other sciences at hydroefrs the sics from all 31 hydroefrs provided information on women in hydrology at their efr from these responses we created a compilation of 180 women associated with the hydroefrs we recognize that some sics had better knowledge of current and past scientists technicians and cooperators than others some were more willing than others to consult peers or review past documents from their efrs to identify the women of hydrology at their efrs and none had complete knowledge of all the women who had contributed to the hydrologic sciences at their efr thus our compilation is an underestimate of the number names and roles of women at these hydroefrs and we apologize to those women whose names have not been recognized despite these caveats this compilation does represent a cross section of forest service and collaborating scientists technicians and staff who are contributing or have contributed to hydrologic sciences at these efrs fig 2 several observations about these women include thirty nine percent of the women worked or had worked for the forest service and 61 worked or had worked for universities or other agencies the large number of women from non forest service organizations shows that hydroefrs serve an important role as research and training grounds for women in hydrology across the us and not just within the forest service sixty percent of the women were scientists 40 were technicians or staff this highlights the contributions of women of all levels not just scientists to hydrologic sciences at these sites the women were divided nearly equally between those that currently work at hydroefrs 53 and those that had worked at hydroefrs in the past 47 the percentages were similar for scientists and technicians staff this may reflect the sics knowledge of women currently working at their hydroefr vs those in the past or could reflect an increase in the percentage of women working at the hydroefrs now compared to the past 3 3 what are the contributions of women at hydroefrs to the academic literature of hydrology and hydrology related sciences women associated with hydroefrs have contributed to a substantial and diverse body of research over the past 45 years of 180 names of women associated with hydroefrs we were able to find publications for 136 76 on the wos given that scientists represented 59 of the total number of women in our compilation fig 2 this shows that women in science support roles 41 of compilation were contributing to the published literature alongside scientists examples of these contributions include those by field technicians green et al 2021 see et al 2020 information managers edwards et al 2019 edwards et al 2016 lany et al 2018 laseter et al 2012 chemists brown et al 2021 and laboratory physical scientist technicians hislop and hornbeck 2002 women of hydroefrs were prolific publishers for the 136 women with publications on wos we identified a total of 3 099 publications for the period 1977 to 2021 which had been cited 174 642 times with an h index of 181 through 2021 fig 3 not all of these publications are based on research from the author s hydroefrs however hydroefrs as places to conduct long term research and monitoring and as communities of scientific practice likely helped shape the careers and research of these women and hence contributed directly or indirectly to these publications conversely research of these women conducted elsewhere may have shaped the direction of their work at the hydroefrs it is noteworthy that the early papers in our review were published in the late 1970s meyer 1979 meyer and likens 1979 which was 70 years after the establishment of the first efr in 1909 we suggest this could be due to the sics not having known the names of earlier women pioneers at efrs that women were not generally encouraged nor supported to publish during the early years of the efrs kline 2021 or that few women worked at these sites prior to the 1970s the large number of publications reinforces that hydroefrs are important research and training sites for women across the us although results for the top 15 affiliations showed that 29 of the publications were co authored by scientists affiliated with usda 15 were co authored by scientists affiliated with other federal agencies and 55 were co authored by scientists affiliated with academic institutions fig 4 the women of hydroefrs have been publishing across a broad range of environmental and hydrologic disciplines of the top 15 wos categories 22 of the publications were categorized as environmental science 19 as ecology 10 as geosciences 9 as water resources and 40 as other watershed science related fields fig 5 this range of disciplines is further reflected in the diversity of journals where the women were publishing total of 487 journals which include biogeochemistry forest ecology and management hydrologic processes water resources research ecology ecosystems and more fig 6 collectively the women have co authored 16 publications in science 15 in nature and ten in nature geoscience the research has largely been funded by the us federal government of the top 15 wos funding agencies roughly half of the publications 52 acknowledged the national science foundation as a funding source nineteen percent 14 and 16 acknowledged the usda other federal agencies and international organizations respectively fig 7 it is noteworthy that it has not always been the standard to acknowledge the organization such as the usda forest service responsible for funding the long term datasets and or research sites that are foundational to research papers this is changing as scientists are routinely expected to publish data in publically accessible archives with unique digital object identifiers doi and as more research sites have provided standardized acknowledgements to authors for example all research manuscripts published using foundational data produced by the hubbard brook experimental forest in nh can cite a doi for the underlying data and are expected to include the acknowledgement the hubbard brook experimental forest is operated and maintained by the usda forest service northern research station madison wi 1014507 1114804 it is also noteworthy that in this analysis we include all the papers from a female scientist that has worked at an hydroefr assuming that the scientist has been influenced by the hydroefr or the scientist s work has in turn influenced the work at the efr thus work funded elsewhere by other organizations not supporting the hydroefrs are included although it is beyond the scope of this paper to produce an annotated bibliography of these publications selected highlights include the foundational work on nutrient cycling and metabolism in streams by judy meyer meyer 1979 meyer et al 1988 meyer et al 1998 the impacts of acidic deposition on surface waters by mary beth adams adams et al 1993 adams et al 1997 pamela edwards edwards et al 2002a edwards et al 2002b and lindsey rustad rustad et al 1993 long term trends in hydrology and implications for management by sherri johnson johnson et al 2021 johnson and jones 2000 instream processing of nitrogen by emily bernhardt bernhardt et al 2003 bernhardt et al 2002 novel surface water pollutants such as pharmaceuticals by emma rosi rosi marshall et al 2015 rosi marshall and royer 2012 topographic edaphic and vegetative controls on plant available water by salli dymond dymond et al 2017 and controls on streamflow generation in small catchments by carol hunsaker hunsaker et al 2012 liu et al 2013 women have also led cross site syntheses such as on trends in stream nitrogen in catchments across the usa by alba argerich argerich et al 2013 on regulations of streamflow response to climate change at long term ecological research sites by julia jones jones et al 2012 and on climate change impacts on forest water yield at long term experimental watersheds across north america by irena creed creed et al 2014 in addition to basic research women at hydroefrs have provided practical guidance on management and planning such as the work on water yield following forest grass transitions by katharine elliot elliott et al 2017 on whether management can sustain water based ecosystem services in the face of climate change by chelcy ford miniat ford et al 2011b and the work on ecohydrological disturbances associated with roads by beverley wemple wemple et al 2017 wemple and jones 2003 finally women at the hydroefrs have contributed to commentaries on science and society such as envisioning the next decade of big data in environmental sciences by kathleen weathers and emma rosi ladeau et al 2017b unraveling issues of the peer review process by kate lajtha lajtha 2019 lajtha and baveye 2010 frontiers in ecosystem ecology and leveraging the anthropocene by kathleen weathers weathers et al 2016 weathers et al 2021 and even integrating art and science as in the work of lindsey rustad rustad et al 2018 although impressive we remind the reader that this compilation is an underestimate of the contributions of women to the hydrologic and environmental sciences at hydroefrs because the current sics likely had incomplete knowledge of all the women who had contributed over time to their efrs and the wos has an incomplete listing of all the publications for all the women 3 4 the changing forest service workforce understanding demographic trends across the nation s hydrologic workforce can help agencies and institutions plan for a more equitable diverse and productive future although centralized demographic data from organizations across the country are not available such data are obtainable from the usda forest service one of the largest environmental employers in the nation identifying the women and men who worked at hydroefrs is challenging as no single forest service identifier exists for the efrs or the hydrologic workforce within the efrs the diverse efr workforce which contributes to hydrologic research includes hydrologists series 1315 hydrologic technicians series 1316 ecologists series 0408 foresters series 0460 forestry technicians series 0462 geologists series 1350 biologists series 0401 physical scientists series 1301 and others to explore gender trends we present perspectives on changes in the forest service as a whole the fs r d deputy area within the fs the hydroefrs as defined by duty stations within fs r d and the hydrology series positions within fs r d discussions are based on modelled trends and not absolute values 3 4 1 overall decline in workforce the forest service workforce is large but it has declined significantly 23 over the last 30 years table 1 fig 8 a the fs r d workforce declined more over the last 30 years 55 than the non r d workforce 20 table 1 within fs r d the workforce at hydroefr associated duty stations declined by 53 compared to all other duty stations 57 there are very few hydrologists and hydrologic technicians in fs r d 2 3 of fs r d and these employees have declined over the last 30 years by 39 these trends represent a significant loss of scientific capacity in general and a significant loss of scientific capacity in the hydrologic sciences specifically within fs r d 3 4 1 changes in workforce over time by gender despite decades of change westphal et al 2022 the forest service remains majority male with about twice as many men compared to women as of 2021 table 2 for the entire forest service the rate of workforce decline e g slope of trend line and the absolute numbers of positions lost over the last 30 years were similar by gender table 2 however because the total number of women in the forest service was smaller this resulted in a larger percent decline for women 31 vs men 19 fig 8a and a significant decline in the ratio of women men from 0 61 in 1992 to 0 50 in 2021 table 3 fig 9 within fs r d the number of women in the workforce declined significantly more than men in the workforce 59 for women vs 53 for men fig 8b this resulted in a significant decline in the ratio of women men from 0 73 in 1992 to 0 68 in 2021 table 3 fig 9 within the hydro efr duty stations the percent loss of women in the workforce was less than the percent loss of men 50 vs 56 resulting in a significant increase in the ratio of women to men from 0 68 in 1992 and 0 79 in 2021 table 3 the positions in the relatively small hydrology series workforce in the fs r d are mostly held by men table 2 fig 8c within these hydrology positions the number of women declined less than men in the workforce 26 for women 43 for men but this did not result in a significant increase in the ratio of women men over time table 3 3 4 3 changes in workforce over time by grade level and gender most of the workforce declines since 1992 occurred in lower graded positions these lower graded positions declined by 27 across the entire forest service by 82 in fs r d by 79 at hydroefrs and by 33 for the hydrology series workforce table 1 the mid graded positions were the next most lost positions at 24 34 36 and 52 across the entire forest service fs r d the hydroefrs and hydrology series workforce respectively table 1 for the higher graded positions there was no significant change in the numbers of these positions over time across the entire forest service however there was a 35 26 and 27 loss in these positions in fs r d the hydroefrs and the hydrology series workforce respectively table 1 we suggest caution on interpretation of the hydrology series data due to low numbers more women than men were lost in the lower graded positions across the entire forest service 59 women vs 1 men in fs r d 85 women vs 77 men at the hydroefrs 80 women vs 78 men and in the hydrology series positions 61 women vs 23 men table 2 the number of women in higher graded positions increased and the number of men in higher graded positions decreased across the entire forest service 126 women vs 28 men in fs r d 33 women vs 49 men at the hydroefrs 54 women vs 42 men and the hydrology series positions 331 women vs 50 men the ratio of women men in higher graded positions at the hydroefrs increased from 0 17 in 1992 to 0 50 in 2021 table 3 overall this shows an increase in the number of senior women in the fs r d hydrologic workforce it is noteworthy that the increase in the number of women in the higher graded positions is concomitant with the loss of support at the lower and mid graded positions this could suggest that women who currently occupy the higher graded positions are either performing more basic research and administrative tasks than their earlier men and women counterparts e g more sample measurements data analyses administration etc or conducting more synthetic science vs basic science related research our bibliographic data suggests the latter may be true as there were no publications from 1992 through 2000 with synthesis related key words e g synthesis meta analysis meta regression and fifteen publications with synthesis related key words between 2001 and 2021 if the trend for loss of women and men in lower graded positions continues generating basic science from new data collection may be diminished reducing basic science publications and our ability to conduct synthetic work in the future the loss of women in the lower positions also suggests a diminishing internal pool of applicants i e pipeline for advancement to mid or eventually higher graded positions 3 4 4 changes in workforce over time by supervisory position and gender as with the overall workforce the proportions of managers across the entire forest service and in fs r d were predominantly male in 2021 71 and 61 respectively table 2 during the period 1992 to 2021 the number of managers did not change significantly across the entire forest service or at the hydroefrs but declined by 32 in fs r d in fs r d the number of women managers declined less than men managers 12 and 41 respectively the relationship between the change in the number of managers vs the change in workforce resulted in an increase in the number of managers per capita across the forest service 0 26 managers per capita in 1992 to 0 31 managers per capita in 2021 and fs r d 0 24 managers per capita in 1992 to 0 30 managers per capita in 2021 the increase in managers per capita in fs r d was mostly driven by an increase in the number of women managers per capita 0 07 women managers per capita in 1992 to 0 12 women managers per capita in 2021 this shows a small improvement in the role of women as managers in the fs r d 3 4 5 summary of workforce changes and suggestions for future research taken together these results suggest there has been an overall loss of women across the nested categories from the entire forest service to the hydrology series positions and that these losses were greatest in the lower graded positions at the same time the proportion of women at higher grade levels increased across the nested categories from the entire forest service to the hydrology series positions and the proportion of women managers increased demonstrating an overall increase in the proportion of women in leadership positions although our historical data do not permit us to analyze the causes or impacts of these trends it is likely that these women in leadership roles serve as role models for other women in the forest service and the broader scientific community increase sensitivity of forest service leadership to gender based issues such as wage equity workplace safety and accommodations for family and gender based medical leave and bring their unique perspectives to research and management agendas we suggest that investigating these impacts is a fertile area for future research we also acknowledge that the trends reported for the usda forest service are likely different than those at other federal state and private institutions and thus represent a microcosm of trends across the nation further work to uncover demographic trends at other agencies would complement the work reported here 3 5 voices of women of hydrology at efrs the past present and future women in hydrology at efrs questionnaire offered the women associated with the hydroefrs a unique opportunity to share their experiences we located publicly available emails for 119 of the 180 women identified by the sics of the 119 44 responded to the past present and future women in hydrology at efrs questionnaire 37 return rate table 4 the respondents were roughly evenly divided between those affiliated with the forest sericve and those affiliated with other agencies or universities most of the women 75 were affiliated with the efr at the time they completed the questionnaire approximately half the respondents were scientists 55 23 were technicians or other staff 11 were other professionals and 9 were students the women who responded were or had been actively engaged in many aspects of the hydrologic sciences at their efr ninety three percent self reported that they contributed to fieldwork 73 to making new discoveries 68 to writing manuscripts 50 to information management 50 to laboratory work and 25 to other work in hydrology they were also engaged in other activities at the efr with 64 contributing to training and mentoring others 46 involved in giving tours 43 involved in technology transfer with stakeholders 39 helping to support the infrastructure at the site and 20 contributing in other ways to ongoing science at their efrs the respondents in general had significant and regular interactions with other women of the 44 respondents 27 of the respondents indicated they had 10 other women in their hydrologic social network 14 indicated that number was 6 10 39 indicated that number was 3 5 20 indicated that number was 1 2 and no respondent indicated that they had no other women in their hydrologic social networks when asked how often do you did you collaborate d with other women at your efr with 1 being hardly ever and 5 being every day 7 said hardly ever 34 said every day and the average score was 3 7 slightly more than half 57 of the respondents reported they had had women as mentors 43 said they had not of the 25 women who indicated they had women mentors 22 identified that having a woman mentor influenced their careers fifty five percent indicated that the mentors influenced their careers by providing support and encouragement 45 indicated that their mentors were a role model inspiration 27 indicated that their mentors helped them navigate gender based landscapes and 9 indicated that they had good male and female mentors which we interpreted as having a female mentor was not as important as having a mentor the respondents felt that they had made major contributions to hydrology thirty six responded to a prompt on what they considered their major contribution to the field of hydrology of these the most often cited contribution was related to improving understanding of hydrologic processes 69 followed by contributing to the collection curation and stewardship of long term data 33 and then contributions to land management 22 also the respondents were involved in many activities that contributed to the overall success of their efrs the top two categories were intellectual contributions to other scientific disciplines and studies 40 followed by contributing to collection analysis curation and stewardship of long term data 34 their third most mentioned other major accomplishment was contributing to the social capital of the efr via teamwork networking mentoring 20 some of the most colorful responses related to memorable moments experienced by the respondents while working at their efrs more than three quarters of the respondents offered favorite memories with the most often cited categories of favorite moments dealing with friendships camaraderie and personal encounters 56 followed by overcoming adversity on a challenging field day 35 tales of teamwork 26 encounters with immersion in nature 24 and aha creative moments 21 each one respondent claimed to have no positive memory of her efr finally the respondents reflected on a half century of change for women in hydrology at efrs and described their visions for the future the majority of the respondents 89 reflected on how the number and roles of women in hydrology had changed at efrs over the past 50 years with the most frequently cited observation being that there were more women in hydrologic research 77 this is consistent with the dmat data which showed an increase in the ratio of women men in the fs hydroefrs this was followed in frequency by comments that there was more respect acceptance for women of hydrology 26 and then a range of other comments including more opportunities for research and collaboration for women 10 and change in role from office administrators to field staff 10 only 8 thought there were more women in leadership roles and 5 said they did not know this is contrary to the dmat data for the forest service that showed conclusively an increase in the number of women in leadership positions between 1992 and 2021 including at the hydroefrs more research on lags in recognition of demographic trends is warranted the respondents envisioned a more equitable future for hydrologic research the most frequently cited vision for the future was simply that more women will participate in hydrology at efrs in the future 57 this was followed closely by comments that there will be no need to consider gender issues of equal opportunity access respect and wages at efrs in the future 46 and then by an expectation that there will be more women in leadership roles at efrs in the future 24 two respondents hoped that future considerations would shift from the binary male female conversation to include individuals of non binary physical or sexual orientation as well in sum the voices of the women at the hydroefrs who chose to share their experiences with us reflected a positive attitude towards their work at efrs in general they were actively involved in many aspects of the efrs from research to education and outreach and they were proud of their contributions to their efrs most had networks of other women with whom they interacted frequently and many listed their opportunity to network and for camaraderie as salient features of their experiences only about half indicated they had women mentors in their careers although they generally found these mentors important to their career advancement and satisfaction increasing mentorship for women in hydrology may be an opportunity for the future finally the women sensed that the numbers of women in hydrology had increased over time and they wished for more equity for women in the future 4 conclusions our results show that hydroefrs have played an important role in advancing the careers of women in the hydrologic sciences who in turn have contributed to the groundbreaking hydrologic research that occurs at these long term research sites this is reflected in their 3 000 publications since 1977 their involvement in all aspects of the research cycle and their voices of appreciation for their work at hydroefrs further hydroefrs are important research and training sites not only for women in hydrology at fs r d but also for women in hydrology at cooperating agencies universities and ngos across the country at the forest service r d scientific capacity in general and for women specifically has declined over the last 30 years including a 59 decline in the numbers of women in the fs r d workforce 50 decline in the numbers of women in the hydroefr workforce and 26 decline in the numbers of women in the hydrologic series workforce such contractions are a threat to the ability of fs r d to continue to sustain high quality hydrologic research training and outreach to mentor women in the existing workforce and to attract qualified women to this workforce in the future despite declines in numbers the hydrologic workforce in fs r d has maintained or increased its gender diversity over the last 30 years specifically the ratio of women men increased at the hydroefrs from 0 68 to 0 79 this was consistent with the voices of the women of hydroefrs where nearly three quarters of the respondents thought there were more women at hydroefrs now than in the past this is in contrast to the declines in the ratio of women men across the entire forest service and across fs r d during this same period further despite the declines in numbers the representation of women in higher grade positions and leadership roles has increased across the entire forest service across fs r d and at hydroefrs the contributions of these women to increasing attention to gender based issues to serving as role models for other women both within and outside the forest service and to shaping science in new ways requires further social science research as water crises around the world continue to escalate building a strong workforce in the hydrologic sciences has never been more important research shows that diversity matters and that increasing the diversity of a workforce can spark innovation improve performance and lead to more effective problem solving cheruvelil et al 2014 nielsen et al 2017 østergaard et al 2011 rice 2011 investment in a diversity of race ethnicity and gender remains a priority in stem fields across the country in general and at the forest service specifically the data presented here suggest that the representation of women in the fs r d hydrologic workforce remains low and 2 investment in the efrs as centers for research and training for women in hydrology and investments in attracting and retaining women in the field of hydrology may benefit this discipline the voices of the women of hydroefrs expressed a hope for a more equitable future and one where gender would no longer need to be a consideration declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

1837,lumped hydrological models lhms are useful tools for simulating catchment runoff q owing to their low data requirements high computational efficiency and robust performance however most lhms are purposely conceptualized for rainfall runoff modeling with over simplified consideration of other water balance components especially evapotranspiration e the generalized complementary relationship gcr can reliably estimate the regional e using only routine meteorological observations here a lumped hydrological model xinanjiang model xaj was integrated with the gcr xaj gcr to improve the accuracy of the water balance partitioning of lhms long term daily observations of q and e in the seolmacheon experimental watershed 8 54 km2 in south korea were collected to test the capability of the xaj gcr model to capture q and e dynamics with three different integration schemes and three different calibration strategies single or multi objective results show that xaj gcr model obtained excellent results in simulating q nseq 0 91 0 02 and markedly improves simulating e with nsee from 0 35 0 27 mean standard deviation to 0 56 0 10 the multi objective calibration strategy achieves better simulation results for q and e simultaneously with nseq 0 93 and nsee 0 69 0 01 in which the built in structure of the xaj model is the optimal scheme this study demonstrated that the integration of gcr into lhms is feasible and applicable for improving water balance partitioning the integration maintains all the advantages of lhm and does not increase the model complexity and data

used in water resource assessment drought assessment impact evaluation of climate change and human activities related to floods and soil erosion alazzy et al 2015 yang et al 2020 physically based distributed hydrological models dhms and lumped hydrological models lhms are two types of hydrological models commonly used dhms consider the spatial heterogeneity of watershed characteristics and require many biological chemical soil and vegetation parameters thus they are challenging to apply in areas with sparse data ewen et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 lhms are widely used in practice and scientific research with sufficient accuracy owing to their simple structures few parameters and high robustness however lhms tend to oversimplify some key processes e g evapotranspiration e and soil moisture content s and lead to inaccurate partitioning of water balance components coron et al 2014 which is particularly important for water resource planning and management in changing environments lhms poorly represent e and s because of the need of efficient modeling methods at the watershed scale herman et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 wanders et al 2014 resulting in unreliable water balance partitioning most studies that improve the simulation of various water balance elements involve the better use of existing hydrological theories or more observed data to constrain hydrological variables andini et al 2020 rajib et al 2016 the extensive establishment of eddy covariance systems provides reliable observations of actual e which supports the multi objective optimization of both catchment runoff q and e in hydrological models several approaches for calculating e have been developed and are widely used to estimate regional or global e with sufficient accuracy numerous studies have attempted to improve e estimation of lhms to accurately simulate water balance components deng and sun 2012 integrated the land surface models ssib and topmodel and obtained better water and energy balance estimates by introducing the parameters of soil properties and underlying surface conditions yuan et al 2008 coupled the dual source e model and the xinanjiang model xaj and achieved a better q simulation although these methods have achieved certain degrees of success the performance of lhms was improved at the expense of increasing the model complexity and data requirements recent research shows that the complementary relationship of e bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 is a reliable and robust alternative for regional e estimation relying solely on routinely observed meteorological variables as the latest development of complementary theory asymmetric and non linear generalized complementary relationship gcr has solved the problem of negative e values under extremely dry conditions in a linear equation by imposing three additional boundary conditions required by physical constraints hao et al 2019 szilagyi et al 2017 the gcr has four different typical functions i e polynomial brutsaert 2015 denoted b15 sigmoid han et al 2012 han and tian 2018 denoted h18 exponential gao and xu 2021 denoted g21 and power functions szilagyi et al 2022 denoted s22 the simplest polynomial function is b15 with one parameter αc all other three functions are two parameter αpt and an additional parameter gcr has been applied for regional e estimation across various time scales from half hour to multi years using flux data and watershed meteorological observation data to obtain good performance li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 therefore it is feasible and practical to integrate gcr and lhms which can improve e estimation and retain the simplicity of lhms in this study the method and effectiveness of integrating the gcr into lhms to improve the accuracy of water balance modeling were investigated the xaj model zhao 1980 which is the most widely used watershed hydrological model in china li et al 2018 was selected as the case model the integration of xaj and gcr sets three schemes to determine where the water loss for e originates three calibration strategies i e a conventional single objective calibration strategy with only q m1 an alternative single objective strategy only with e m2 for watersheds with no or sparse data and a multi objective scheme with q and e m3 are tested in this study the performances of the integrated models were investigated using both q and e observations in korea s seolmacheon experimental watershed sew 8 5 km2 one of the international hydrological programme ihp pilot watersheds the primary objectives of this study were 1 to integrate gcr into a lumped hydrological xaj model xaj gcr 2 to test the applicability of the xaj gcr model in an experimental watershed of humid regions and 3 to seek the best integration schemes for more realistic water balance partitioning this study is the first attempt to integrate gcr into a lumped hydrological model 2 data and methodology 2 1 generalized complementary relationship gcr describes the relationship between three types of e terms the first type is actual e the second type is potential e under the condition of an adequate water supply in the area or e from wet surfaces denoted as epo the third type is the atmospheric evaporative demand epa that would occur from a very small saturated surface inside larger areas subject to non potential atmospheric conditions the gcr presumes that when a dry hot air mass passes over the area 1 100 km2 with adequate water supply and in the absence of large scale advection an increase in e reduces epa through changes in air temperature and humidity bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 the schematic representation of gcr polynomial function is shown in fig 1 different functions change the shape but not nonlinear complementary behavior this study adopts the nomenclature of brutsaert 2015 the gcr has four different typical functions based on different understandings of the complementarity principle and boundary conditions i e b15 h18 g21 and s22 amongst them the polynomial function b15 is the simplest with one parameter αc all the other three functions have two parameters table 1 lists different functions of generalized complementary relationship epo and epa need to be properly characterized to calculate e using gcr method brutsaert et al 2020 indicated that epo is difficult to estimate using only the information and observations of ambient conditions thus recommending a more flexible form of potential e namely αc ee in which αc is an adjustable parameter and ee is the equilibrium evaporation and can be calculated as follows slatyer and mciroy 1961 1 e e δ δ γ r n g the atmospheric evaporative demand epa can be directly measured by evaporation pans epan in practice or estimated in several ways a good approximation can be obtained using the penman 1948 equation 2 e pa δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 d where δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve at a given air temperature γ kpa 1 is the psychrometric constant d hpa is the saturated water vapor pressure deficit rn and g are net radiation at the land surface and ground heat flux in water equivalent of millimeters per day respectively g can be ignored at a daily time scale u2 m s is the mean wind speed at 2 m above ground level as previously shown by liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2017 epa with daily average values of atmospheric variables are not sensitive to the choice of wind function f u 2 thus penman s simple empirical formula is adopted 3 f u 2 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 2 2 description of the xaj model the xaj model proposed by zhao 1980 has a single saturation runoff generation mechanism li et al 2019 which means that for each location in the watershed q is not generated until the soil water moisture storage reaches field capacity bai et al 2017 fang et al 2017 therefore the xaj model is more suited to humid and semi humid watersheds and has been extensively and successfully applied the xaj model with three runoff components is adopted in this study this model has 15 parameters table 2 and consists of four submodules three layer evaporation submodule runoff generation submodule runoff separation submodule and runoff confluence submodule the total q is the sum of simulated surface runoff interflow and groundwater surface runoff is obtained by unit hydrograph uh interflow and groundwater are derived by linear reservoir routing method the inputs to the xaj model include daily precipitation p and pan evaporation epan and the outputs are q e and s the xaj model assumes that e is uniformly distributed over the watershed e is estimated from epa based on an empirical relationship in this study because of the absence of available epan data epa was calculated from weather variables using the penman equation instead considering the vertical difference of water storage and evaporation capacity in the soil the soil was divided into upper lower and deep layers to calculate e was first supplied by s of the upper layer followed by the lower and deepest layers when s of the lower soil layer was reduced to a certain proportion of storage capacity bai et al 2017 li et al 2018 and the equations are as follows when wu p e pa 4 eu e pa 5 el 0 6 ed 0 when wu p e pa 7 eu w u p 8 el e pa e u wl wlm w l c w l m c e pa e u c e pa e u w l c w l m w l w l c e pa e u 9 ed 0 w l c e pa e u c e pa e u e l w l c e pa e u 10 e e u e l e d where eu el and ed are the soil e of the upper lower and deep layers respectively wu wl and wd are the soil moisture contents of the upper lower and deep layers respectively and wum wlm and wdm are the tension water storage capacities of the upper lower and deep soil layers respectively c is evapotranspiration coefficient of deeper layer and adjustable parameter 2 3 integration scheme of the xaj gcr model the key issue of integration is to determine where the water loss for e originates i e how soil water is depleted by e from different layers here three integration schemes were tested as shown in fig 2 i e depleting three layers and simultaneously proportioning to soil water storage of each layer l3 p depleting three layers from upper to lower l3 d and depleting three layers as the original xaj model l3 o the three integration schemes have

and difficulty in fully draining the deeper soil layer f3 plant roots absorb water from deeper layers as shown in table 3 for the l3 p scheme the egcr was partitioned among the three layers as follows

of parameters for the xaj gcr models with the three integration schemes is not more than that of original xaj model indicating that integration with gcr does not increase model complexity 2 4 description of the experimental watershed and observations the seolmacheon experimental watershed sew located upstream of the imjin river in korea one of the pilot watersheds of the international hydrological programme ihp was selected for this study for being a rare experimental small watershed with both observed q and e it is a typical humid small watershed with an area of 8 5 km2 and a stream length of 5 8 km fig 3 the annual mean temperature p q and e of this watershed during the study period 2008 2012 were 11 25 c 1661 mm 1189 mm and 416 mm respectively sew is affected by the monsoons and most of p occurs in summer the dominant soil in the watershed is sandy loam with thin topsoil high permeability and poor water storage capacity birhanu et al 2019 shin et al 2019 this catchment is a typical steep slope mountainous meandering stream with a channel slope of 2 the elevation varies from 55 m to 640 m the elevation of the experimental watershed and location of the eddy covariance flux tower are shown in fig 3 b the sew has long term continuous observation series of variables required for model simulation and verification i e p q e and routine meteorological variables the common daily sequence of all observed variables ranged from 2007 9 to 2012 12 p was calculated by the thiessen polygon method using the measured rainfall of four rainfall stations within the sew q was provided by the korea institute of civil engineering and construction technology e was measured using the eddy covariance flux tower 37 56 20 n 126 57 17 e close to the central point of the catchment park et al 2015 representing the mean value from a footprint of a few square kilometers around the tower the observed water balance closure in the sew is quite good with only a 4 error for the mean annual p e and q i e p e q thus the observed e from the flux tower is used to represent catchment e of sew considering the small water balance close error and matched spatial range of tower footprint and catchment area in addition high quality meteorological data for temperature t air relative humidity rh wind speed ws sunshine duration sd and air pressure press were measured by a weather station located in the watershed in sew approximately 72 and 25 of p were converted to q and e respectively and the change in s is small owing to poor soil water storage capacity shin et al 2019 yoo et al 2021 2 5 parameter estimation and model evaluation the parameters of the gcr xaj and xaj gcr models were calibrated using a genetic algorithm whitley 1994 three calibration strategies were tested in this study a single objective scheme with only q m1 or e m2 and a multi objective scheme with both q and e m3 m1 is the conventional calibration strategy for the lhms m2 is a general alternative for watersheds with sparse or no data m3 can test the model performance by adjusting e simulation and supplementing e observation as a calibration objective simultaneously nine tests were investigated in this study viz three integration schemes l3 p l3 d and l3 o multiplied by three calibration strategies m1 m2 and m3 the gcr and hydrological model under m2 and m3 calibration strategies require parameter calibration against the observed e using the eddy covariance technique excluding rainy day data owing to additional observation errors ershadi et al 2014 mccabe et al 2016 the runoff confluence parameters an and ak associated with the unit hydrograph only depend on the channel characteristics and hydraulic properties thus the same values were adopted for all xaj and xaj gcr models all other parameters were recalibrated in each of the nine tests including the adjustable parameter αc of the original gcr the warm up calibration and validation periods were from 2007 9 2007 12 2008 2010 and 2011 2012 respectively this study selected a number of statistical criteria to quantify the performance of hydrological models such as the nash efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r square r2 kling gupta coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 normalized root mean square error nrmse and bias in percentage pbias kge consists of three distinctive components α is the measure of relative variability β is the standard deviation ratio and θ indicates the linear correlation between the simulated and observed sequences bai et al 2018 gupta et al 2009 statistical

deviations for the observed and simulated values respectively and c o v y obs y sim is the covariance between the observed and simulated values nse and kge range from to 1 the closer nse or kge approaches 1 0 the better the model performs the optimal values of pbias and nrmse are zero different statistical criteria emphasize the different capabilities of the model the nse criterion focuses on the performance of the high values the kge criterion considers high value and low value simulations equivalently r2 criterion represents the correlation between the simulation and observations the nrmse and pbias criteria characterize the mean and total errors respectively maximizing nse with log bias constraints was selected as an objective function viney et al 2009 that can simultaneously consider consistency and deviation as follows 24 f n s e 5 0 ln 1 0 0 01 p b i a s 2 5 3 results 3 1 performance of the xaj model and gcr fig 4 shows model performance of the gcr and xaj models in the sew results of the xaj model in fig 4 are obtained by conventional single objective calibration against q only i e m1 the performance of the xaj model in q simulation is excellent with an nseq of 0 93 for e simulation nsee is 0 0 93 indicating that the xaj model cannot capture daily dynamics of catchment e results of m2 and m3 calibration strategies showed similar performance in q and e see fig s1 nseq of both m2 and m3 was 0 9 whereas nsee were 0 03 and 0 05 respectively simulating q is excellent and simulating e remains unreliable this highlights the limitation of rainfall runoff models in estimating e all four functions of gcr reproduced the observed daily e with nse 0 71 although they underestimated the high e 4 0 mm per day fig 4 and fig s2 the performances of one parameter b15 function and the two parameter h18 g21 and s22 functions were almost equivalent thus result of one parameter b15 function only was further analyzed and presented only to retain the simplicity of integrated model the parameters αc of the gcr were calibrated against the measured e using the eddy covariance flux system excluding rainy days the optimized value of αc is 0 63 which was the reference value for subsequent evaluation this suggested that the gcr can successfully estimate the daily e of the sew and has the potential to be integrated with xaj to improve the modeling capability of watershed water balance partitioning 3 2 performance of integrated xaj gcr models 3 2 1 runoff simulation fig 5 shows the performance of xaj gcr models in simulating q and e under m1 m2 and m3 calibration strategies for runoff simulation all three xaj gcr models performed excellently under three different calibration strategies nseq were 0 84 with a range of 0 84 0 93 for the m1 calibration strategy nseq of all three xaj gcr models was 0 93 which were the same as the performance of the xaj model fig 4 b for the m2 calibration strategy nseq of the xaj model was 0 91 whereas xaj gcr models underperformed marginally with nseq in the range of 0 84 0 89 the l3 o had the highest nseq 0 88 followed by l3 d 0 87 and l3 p 0 84 for the m3 calibration strategy nseq of all three xaj gcr models was 0 93 which was marginally greater than the performance of the xaj model nseq 0 92 fig s1 a the performance of q simulation under the m2 calibration strategy to the three xaj gcr models was marginally worse than that under m1 and m3 strategies in summary xaj was always superior in q simulation for the sew the integration of the gcr and xaj models maintains excellent capability in q simulation 3 2 2 evapotranspiration simulation the performance of integrated xaj gcr models in e simulation outperformed the original xaj model fig 5 b d and f under the conventional m1 calibration strategy the l3 o scheme had the maximum nsee 0 44 followed by the l3 d 0 30 and l3 p 0 20 schemes the performances of both the xaj and xaj gcr models under the m1 strategy in simulating e were unsatisfactory with nsee 0 5 for the m2 calibration strategy the nsee of the l3 o scheme was 0 71 and that of the other schemes was 0 67 for the m3 calibration strategy the performance of the l3 o scheme in simulating e was the best nsee 0 71 followed by l3 p nsee 0 67 and l3 d nsee 0 66 comparing the three different calibration strategies the model performance in simulating e under m2 nsee m2 0 683 0 01 was better than that under m1 nsee m1 0 3 0 06 and marginally better than that under m3 nsee m3 0 680 0 01 therefore the performance of integrated models in e simulation under the m2 and m3 strategies was credible 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of the integration method fig 6 summarizes the performance of the xaj and xaj gcr models in simulating q and e concerning nse r2 kge nrmse and pbias under the m1 m2 and m3 calibration strategies the five criteria focus on different aspects of model performance and can comprehensively evaluate the xaj and xaj gcr models the model performance in simulating q and e evaluated by the nse criterion is described in detail in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 the model performance of both q and e evaluated by r2 criterion is similar to that of nse criterion for the m1 calibration strategy the integrated xaj gcr models marginally outperformed the xaj model in simulating q fig 6 a and remarkably in simulating e fig 6 b for the performance of q δkgeq was 0 07 nrmseq was almost unchanged before and after integration and pbias q of all three schemes was 2 in terms of the performance of e the δkgee of the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes increased by 0 39 0 46 and 0 52 respectively in terms of nrmse criterion nrmsee of the xaj model was as high as 138 9 and the xaj gcr models reduced nrmse e to 82 6 3 5 75 1 89 1 the pbias e of the three schemes decreased from 30 6 to 22 1 l3 p 14 8 l3 d and 6 1 l3 o for the m2 strategy the performance of the xaj gcr models in simulating q and e evaluated using different criteria was not superior to that of the original xaj model fig 6 c and d for the performance of q in terms of kge criterion the l3 d scheme was slightly worse δkgeq 0 02 and l3 p and l3 o improved noticeably δkgeq 0 10 nrmseq of the xaj gcr models deteriorated slightly compared with that of the xaj model however they were all 40 pbias q of all three schemes was also 2 for the performance of e the xaj gcr models were superior to the xaj model except for pbias e of the l3 p scheme δkgee of the three schemes have marginal differences in the range of 0 23 0 24 nrmsee decreased from 101 6 by the xaj model to 57 6 by l3 p 57 5 by l3 d and 54 by l3 o for the m3 calibration strategy the xaj gcr models maintained excellent capability in q simulation fig 6 e and markedly improved capability in e simulation fig 6 f regarding the performance of q there was little change before and after integration for the performance of e the δkgee of the three schemes had marginal differences in the range of 0 22 0 23 the mean error of the simulation was markedly reduced with δnrmsee values of 45 2 43 8 and 48 5 by the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes respectively the pbias e of the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes increased from 0 6 to 18 9 17 8 and 17 7 respectively a comprehensive comparison of the three calibration strategies and five statistical criteria showed that the xaj and xaj gcr models had excellent q simulation capabilities there were small differences in simulating q under different calibration strategies and integration schemes models had the best performance in simulating q under the m1 calibration strategy followed by m3 and finally m2 the reproduction of q was excellent even in the m2 calibration strategy without q indicating that the structures of the xaj and xaj gcr models were sound in contrast the simulated daily e dynamics by the xaj model were poor in the sew even nse was only 0 03 under the m2 calibration strategy which performed best in simulating e the e simulation was greatly influenced by calibration strategies and integration schemes the models performed best in simulating e under the m3 calibration strategy followed by m2 and m1 the integrated xaj gcr models obtained an acceptable simulation of daily e and the built in method of s depletion by e in the xaj model l3 o was optimal these results showed that single objective calibration leads to deterioration of uncalibrated hydrological variables whereas m3 calibration strategy with multi objective achieves equilibrium of q and e simulations resulting in satisfactory performance of both multi objective calibration can optimize model performance by avoiding wrongly adjusted parameters however it cannot obtain reliable e results for the xaj model in summary regardless of the integration schemes and calibration strategies the integrated xaj gcr models maintained excellent q simulation and improved e simulation when compared with the original xaj model in the sew multi objective calibration with both observed q and e does not guarantee that the original xaj model produces reliable daily e variations however the integrated xaj gcr model could effectively and simultaneously simulate both q and e this suggested that the integration of gcr into the xaj model improves the modeling capability of the xaj model and that such modification is both necessary and successful 4 discussion 4 1 water balance modeling of hydrological models lhms based on the rainfall runoff relationship and watershed water balance should theoretically satisfy the basic equation p e q δs where δs is typically ignored at the multi year scale the xaj gcr models with different integration schemes and calibration strategies perform excellently in water balance as shown in fig 7 for the lhms based on water balance p is input and if q and e are accurately estimated δs is residual the xaj gcr models performs relatively poorly in terms of s with nse from 0 39 to 0 48 0 46 0 50 of xaj model see fig s4 soil moisture performance varies markedly with different calibration strategies but less with different integration schemes under the same calibration strategy amongst all tested scenarios xaj model under m2 calibration strategy has optimal simulations boundary conditions or physical meaning restrictions can result abnormal points distributed along the horizontal axis in fig 5 such as the soil tension water capacity non negative e and non negative s etc for any timestep simulated e are greater than soil water left soil water can be completely depleted in the xaj model and estimated e will be set as zero if precipitation is zero in the next time step table 4 summarizes the proportion of abnormal zero e values obtained by original and integrated models when e was incorporated into calibration objectives xaj and xaj gcr models produce fewer e anomalies which indicates a more rational model structure in particular the l3 o scheme under the m3 calibration strategy had an optimal overall performance with non anomalous simulated e zero values and a smaller water balance error the integrated xaj gcr models outperformed the original xaj model in reproducing the water balance and e process regardless of integration schemes or calibration strategies the introduction of gcr added a reasonable e estimation mechanism to the xaj model greatly relieving the negative e forced to zero even the simplest scheme with the least parameters also had satisfactory performance in other words appropriate adjustment of the model structure can improve the model performance in modeling q e and water balance 4 2 impact of the calibration strategy on model performance the parameters of lhms cannot be observed easily in the watershed thus parameter calibration is necessary mostafaie et al 2018 parameter calibration is a continuous optimization process that matches as closely as possible simulated hydrological processes with observed hydrological behaviors calibration objectives affect the performance of a model and its parameters krol 2010 nemri and kinnard 2020 in this study the original xaj model performed best in simulating q with single objective calibration against observed q i e m1 and performed slightly worse with the multi objective calibration strategy i e m3 and observed e calibration i e m2 simulating e in a single objective calibration with e m2 was optimal with marginal and clear deteriorations appearing in m3 and m1 respectively for both the original xaj and integrated xaj gcr models single objective calibrations with either q or e alone could achieve a high accuracy simulation of the calibration variable however this may lead to increasing simulation errors of other hydrological processes a single objective calibration strategy always leads to the deterioration of the simulation performance for non calibrated hydrological variables it is difficult for conventional single objective calibration strategies in lhms to reflect different aspects of model simulations because parameter optimization only considers the characteristics of a certain watershed hydrological process vrugt et al 2003 the application of multi objective calibration can solve the above limitations the results of this study showed that incorporating q and e observations simultaneously into parameter calibration can realize a consistent optimization simulation of both and improve the reality of water balance partitioning 4 3 parameters in the xaj gcr the differences in simulation performance partly stems from the ability of model structure to reproduce hydrological processes and selection of calibration objectives gupta et al 2012 most of parameters have different values obtained from different model structures and calibration objectives see table s1 it shows an equifinality problems as other models beven 2006 but all the parameters are within the empirical range of their physical meaning tension water capacity wm surface free water capacity sm and parameters b and ex that reflect spatial inhomogeneity of both varied considerably under different integration schemes and calibration strategies but all are within reasonable ranges zhao 1984 pointed b is 0 2 0 3 in watersheds with an area of several to several hundred km2 and sm 50 mm in watersheds with high soil permeability and dense vegetation optimal parameter sets of sew in l3 o integration schemes was consistent with these of typical humid watershed as suggested by zhao 1984 the parameter αc varying with multiple environmental factors affects the accuracy of the generalized complementary relationship brutsaert et al 2020 pointed out that epo estimated by meteorological data under nonpotential conditions is not expected reference of complementary deviations in other words αc has different physical meaning from the constant αpt of priestly taylor equation the αc is essentially just an adjustable coefficient it is around 1 3 under very humid conditions as expected potential conditions in accordance with the typical values of about 1 26 in the calibration by priestlry and taylor 1972 for epo on the other hand αc can approach zero under extremely arid conditions to satisfy boundary conditions liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 showed that αc has noteworthy spatial heterogeneity and is strongly correlated with the aridity index ai the ratio of annual e capacity to annual precipitation and established the empirical formula as α c l 1 15 a i 0 14 and α c b 1 496 1 0 2948 a i 0 6697 the ai of the sew was 0 70 and the empirical α c l and α c b were 1 21 and 1 11 respectively the optimal αc calibrated against the observed e of the eddy covariance flux tower was 0 63 the αc of xaj gcr models ranged from 0 72 to 0 83 table s1 the difference in calibrated αc was evident however they were within a reasonable range of 0 1 1 5 reported by brutsaert et al 2020 the much smaller αc derived here may be due to two reasons first previous studies by liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 suggested the spatial variation of αc in general from hundreds of catchments which may not apply to a specific watershed the sew is a mountainous watershed with a steep slope where most of the precipitation runs away as streamflow and a small fraction as e its unique topographic conditions may lead to catchment αc deviating from the general expectation the other reason is that the xaj and gcr parameters influence each other in the integrated models when they are optimized against different observations noted that αc was insensitive to integration schemes when e was incorporated into the calibration objectives i e m2 and m3 calibration strategies estimated e by xaj gcr models under different calibration strategies has systematic differences with that estimated by the gcr method and thus points line up along different lines and not along the 1 1 line in fig 8 the randomly distributed points are due to simulated e are greater than the sum of soil water left and precipitation of those timesteps 4 4 advantages and applicability of the integrated model e is an important component of the watershed water balance which is one of the most difficult variables to simulate owing to its very high spatio temporal heterogeneity aminzadeh and or 2017 loukas et al 2004 demonstrated that the independent and accurate estimation of e can greatly improve water balance simulation however the xaj model provides inaccurate estimates of e fang et al 2017 in this study the gcr with strict physical mechanism was integrated into lhms to improve empirical e estimation module and further improve water balance partitioning without increasing the number of model parameters and data requirements because gcr is a reliable and robust alternative for regional e estimation relying solely on routinely observed meteorological variables and it has only one adjustable parameter αc replacing pan coefficient ke of xaj model it was shown that the integrated hydrological models could better reproduce water balance components such as q and e given that the model performance was primarily enhanced by the modified e module the integrated xaj gcr model may be more applicable than the original model under different hydro geo meteorological conditions the other forms of gcr possibly have same potential for integration without considering parameter numbers further studies investigating the performance of incorporating gcr into other lhms under different hydroclimatic conditions should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions generalized complementary relationships and lumped hydrological models are reliable methods for simulating e and q respectively to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to integrate a generalized complementary relationship into a lumped hydrological model the integrated xaj gcr models showed excellent performance regardless of the integration schemes and calibration strategies when tested in a humid experimental catchment using q and e measurements the integrated xaj gcr model maintained excellent simulated runoff results nseq 0 84 more importantly the integrated models have significantly improved the performance of e simultaneously one of the main advantages of the integration method is that it does not increase the complexity of the lumped hydrological model or data requirements this integration is feasible and appropriate for improving the water balance partitioning capability and reliability of lumped hydrological models for water balance modeling water resource management and climate change impact studies moreover since the obtainable results are strictly based on physical mechanisms they can be useful for independent checks in a wide range of lhms and other climatic zones analysis of global applicability to different lhms gcr in the current method is ongoing and will be the subject of future communication funding this research was funded by the national natural science

1837,lumped hydrological models lhms are useful tools for simulating catchment runoff q owing to their low data requirements high computational efficiency and robust performance however most lhms are purposely conceptualized for rainfall runoff modeling with over simplified consideration of other water balance components especially evapotranspiration e the generalized complementary relationship gcr can reliably estimate the regional e using only routine meteorological observations here a lumped hydrological model xinanjiang model xaj was integrated with the gcr xaj gcr to improve the accuracy of the water balance partitioning of lhms long term daily observations of q and e in the seolmacheon experimental watershed 8 54 km2 in south korea were collected to test the capability of the xaj gcr model to capture q and e dynamics with three different integration schemes and three different calibration strategies single or multi objective results show that xaj gcr model obtained excellent results in simulating q nseq 0 91 0 02 and markedly improves simulating e with nsee from 0 35 0 27 mean standard deviation to 0 56 0 10 the multi objective calibration strategy achieves better simulation results for q and e simultaneously with nseq 0 93 and nsee 0 69 0 01 in which the built in structure of the xaj model is the optimal scheme this study demonstrated that the

distributed hydrological models dhms and lumped hydrological models lhms are two types of hydrological models commonly used dhms consider the spatial heterogeneity of watershed characteristics and require many biological chemical soil and vegetation parameters thus they are challenging to apply in areas with sparse data ewen et al 2012 hrachowitz et al 2013 lhms are widely used in practice and scientific research with sufficient accuracy owing to their simple structures few parameters and high robustness however lhms tend to oversimplify some key processes e g evapotranspiration e and soil moisture content s and lead to inaccurate partitioning of water balance components coron et al 2014 which is particularly important for water resource planning and management in changing environments lhms poorly represent e and s because of the need of efficient modeling methods at the watershed scale herman et al 2018 jiang et al 2020 wanders et al 2014 resulting in unreliable water balance partitioning most studies that improve the simulation of various water balance elements involve the better use of existing hydrological theories or more observed data to constrain hydrological variables andini et al 2020 rajib et al 2016 the extensive establishment of eddy covariance systems provides reliable observations of actual e which supports the multi objective optimization of both catchment runoff q and e in hydrological models several approaches for calculating e have been developed and are widely used to estimate regional or global e with sufficient accuracy numerous studies have attempted to improve e estimation of lhms to accurately simulate water balance components deng and sun 2012 integrated the land surface models ssib and topmodel and obtained better water and energy balance estimates by introducing the parameters of soil properties and underlying surface conditions yuan et al 2008 coupled the dual source e model and the xinanjiang model xaj and achieved a better q simulation although these methods have achieved certain degrees of success the performance of lhms was improved at the expense of increasing the model complexity and data requirements recent research shows that the complementary relationship of e bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 brutsaert and stricker 1979 morton 1983 is a reliable and robust alternative for regional e estimation relying solely on routinely observed meteorological variables as the latest development of complementary theory asymmetric and non linear generalized complementary relationship gcr has solved the problem of negative e values under extremely dry conditions in a linear equation by imposing three additional boundary conditions required by physical constraints hao et al 2019 szilagyi et al 2017 the gcr has four different typical functions i e polynomial brutsaert 2015 denoted b15 sigmoid han et al 2012 han and tian 2018 denoted h18 exponential gao and xu 2021 denoted g21 and power functions szilagyi et al 2022 denoted s22 the simplest polynomial function is b15 with one parameter αc all other three functions are two parameter αpt and an additional parameter gcr has been applied for regional e estimation across various time scales from half hour to multi years using flux data and watershed meteorological observation data to obtain good performance li et al 2020 liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 therefore it is feasible and practical to integrate gcr and lhms which can improve e estimation and retain the simplicity of lhms in this study the method and effectiveness of integrating the gcr into lhms to improve the accuracy of water balance modeling were investigated the xaj model zhao 1980 which is the most widely used watershed hydrological model in china li et al 2018 was selected as the case model the integration of xaj and gcr sets three schemes to determine where the water loss for e originates three calibration strategies i e a conventional single objective calibration strategy with only q m1 an alternative single objective strategy only with e m2 for watersheds with no or sparse data and a multi objective scheme with q and e m3 are tested in this study the performances of the integrated models were investigated using both q and e observations in korea s seolmacheon experimental watershed sew 8 5 km2 one of the international hydrological programme ihp pilot watersheds the primary objectives of this study were 1 to integrate gcr into a lumped hydrological xaj model xaj gcr 2 to test the applicability of the xaj gcr model in an experimental watershed of humid regions and 3 to seek the best integration schemes for more realistic water balance partitioning this study is the first attempt to integrate gcr into a lumped hydrological model 2 data and methodology 2 1 generalized complementary relationship gcr describes the relationship between three types of e terms the first type is actual e the second type is potential e under the condition of an adequate water supply in the area or e from wet surfaces denoted as epo the third type is the atmospheric evaporative demand epa that would occur from a very small saturated surface inside larger areas subject to non potential atmospheric conditions the gcr presumes that when a dry hot air mass passes over the area 1 100 km2 with adequate water supply and in the absence of large scale advection an increase in e reduces epa through changes in air temperature and humidity bouchet 1963 brutsaert and parlange 1998 the schematic representation of gcr polynomial function is shown in fig 1 different functions change the shape but not nonlinear complementary behavior this study adopts the nomenclature of brutsaert 2015 the gcr has four different typical functions based on different understandings of the complementarity principle and boundary conditions i e b15 h18 g21 and s22 amongst them the polynomial function b15 is the simplest with one parameter αc all the other three functions have two parameters table 1 lists different functions of generalized complementary relationship epo and epa need to be properly characterized to calculate e using gcr method brutsaert et al 2020 indicated that epo is difficult to estimate using only the information and observations of ambient conditions thus recommending a more flexible form of potential e namely αc ee in which αc is an adjustable parameter and ee is the equilibrium evaporation and can be calculated as follows slatyer and mciroy 1961 1 e e δ δ γ r n g the atmospheric evaporative demand epa can be directly measured by evaporation pans epan in practice or estimated in several ways a good approximation can be obtained using the penman 1948 equation 2 e pa δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 d where δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve at a given air temperature γ kpa 1 is the psychrometric constant d hpa is the saturated water vapor pressure deficit rn and g are net radiation at the land surface and ground heat flux in water equivalent of millimeters per day respectively g can be ignored at a daily time scale u2 m s is the mean wind speed at 2 m above ground level as previously shown by liu et al 2018 and zhang et al 2017 epa with daily average values of atmospheric variables are not sensitive to the choice of wind function f u 2 thus penman s simple empirical formula is adopted 3 f u 2 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 2 2 description of the xaj model the xaj model proposed by zhao 1980 has a single saturation runoff generation mechanism li et al 2019 which means that for each location in the watershed q is not generated until the soil water moisture storage reaches field capacity bai et al 2017 fang et al 2017 therefore the xaj model is more suited to humid and semi humid watersheds and has been extensively and successfully applied the xaj model with three runoff components is adopted in this study this model has 15 parameters table 2 and consists of four submodules three layer evaporation submodule runoff generation submodule runoff separation submodule and runoff confluence submodule the total q is the sum of simulated surface runoff interflow and groundwater surface runoff is obtained by unit hydrograph uh interflow and groundwater are derived by linear reservoir routing method the inputs to the xaj model include daily precipitation p and pan evaporation epan and the outputs are q e and s the xaj model assumes that e is uniformly distributed over the watershed e is estimated from epa based on an empirical relationship in this study because of the absence of available epan data epa was calculated from weather variables using the penman equation instead considering the vertical difference of water storage and evaporation capacity in the soil the soil was divided into upper lower and deep layers to calculate e was first supplied by s of the upper layer followed by the lower and deepest layers when s of the lower soil layer was reduced to a certain proportion of storage capacity bai et al 2017 li et al 2018 and the equations are as follows when wu p e pa 4 eu e pa 5 el 0 6 ed 0 when wu p e pa 7 eu w u p 8 el e pa e u wl wlm

layers respectively wu wl and wd are the soil moisture contents of the upper lower and deep layers respectively and wum wlm and wdm are the tension water storage capacities of the upper lower and deep soil layers respectively c is evapotranspiration coefficient of deeper layer and adjustable parameter 2 3 integration scheme of the xaj gcr model the key issue of integration is to determine where the water loss for e originates i e how soil water is depleted by e from different layers here three integration schemes were tested as shown in fig 2 i e depleting three layers and simultaneously proportioning to soil water storage of each layer l3 p depleting three layers from upper to lower l3 d and depleting three layers as the original xaj model l3 o the three integration schemes have different physical considerations for the three main factors affecting e the differentiated water storage capacity of different soil layers f1 unequal evaporation capacity of different soil layers f2 and difficulty in fully draining the deeper soil layer f3 plant roots absorb water from deeper layers as shown in table 3 for the l3 p scheme the egcr was partitioned among the three layers as follows

s values of the three layers are sufficient in the case of s of a certain layer being less than soil e the e deficit should be compensated as much as possible and insufficient water for e will be supplied by available layers in the same way for example under a shortage of upper soil water content eqs 11 13 can be written as follows 14 eu w u p 15 el e gcr p wlm wm e g c r p w u m w m w u wlm

replaces epa the l3 d scheme does not consider the difficulty of fully draining the deeper soil layer and eqs 8 and 9 can be adjusted as follows 17 el e gcr e u w l e gcr e u w l w l e gcr e u 18 ed 0

sophisticated the integration of the gcr into the xaj model does not increase the number of model parameters as the gcr has only one adjustable parameter and the pan coefficient ke of the xaj model was abandoned in the integrated model the xaj gcr models with the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes have 14 14 and 15 parameters respectively in which the l3 p and l3 d schemes abandon parameter c the number of parameters for the xaj gcr models with the three integration schemes is not more than that of original xaj model indicating that integration with gcr does not increase model complexity 2 4 description of the experimental watershed and observations the seolmacheon experimental watershed sew located upstream of the imjin river in korea one of the pilot watersheds of the international hydrological programme ihp was selected for this study for being a rare experimental small watershed with both observed q and e it is a typical humid small watershed with an area of 8 5 km2 and a stream length of 5 8 km fig 3 the annual mean temperature p q and e of this watershed during the study period 2008 2012 were 11 25 c 1661 mm 1189 mm and 416 mm respectively sew is affected by the monsoons and most of p occurs in summer the dominant soil in the watershed is sandy loam with thin topsoil high permeability and poor water storage capacity birhanu et al 2019 shin et al 2019 this catchment is a typical steep slope mountainous meandering stream with a channel slope of 2 the elevation varies from 55 m to 640 m the elevation of the experimental watershed and location of the eddy covariance flux tower are shown in fig 3 b the sew has long term continuous observation series of variables required for model simulation and verification i e p q e and routine meteorological variables the common daily sequence of all observed variables ranged from 2007 9 to 2012 12 p was calculated by the thiessen polygon method using the measured rainfall of four rainfall stations within the sew q was provided by the korea institute of civil engineering and construction technology e was measured using the eddy covariance flux tower 37 56 20 n 126 57 17 e close to the central point of the catchment park et al 2015 representing the mean value from a footprint of a few square kilometers around the tower the observed water balance closure in the sew is quite good with only a 4 error for the mean annual p e and q i e p e q thus the observed e from the flux tower is used to represent catchment e of sew considering the small water balance close error and matched spatial range of tower footprint and catchment area in addition high quality meteorological data for temperature t air relative humidity rh wind speed ws sunshine duration sd and air pressure press were measured by a weather station located in the watershed in sew approximately 72 and 25 of p were converted to q and e respectively and the change in s is small owing to poor soil water storage capacity shin et al 2019 yoo et al 2021 2 5 parameter estimation and model evaluation the parameters of the gcr xaj and xaj gcr models were calibrated using a genetic algorithm whitley 1994 three calibration strategies were tested in this study a single objective scheme with only q m1 or e m2 and a multi objective scheme with both q and e m3 m1 is the conventional calibration strategy for the lhms m2 is a general alternative for watersheds with sparse or no data m3 can test the model performance by adjusting e simulation and supplementing e observation as a calibration objective simultaneously nine tests were investigated in this study viz three integration schemes l3 p l3 d and l3 o multiplied by three calibration strategies m1 m2 and m3 the gcr and hydrological model under m2 and m3 calibration strategies require parameter calibration against the observed e using the eddy covariance technique excluding rainy day data owing to additional observation errors ershadi et al 2014 mccabe et al 2016 the runoff confluence parameters an and ak associated with the unit hydrograph only depend on the channel characteristics and hydraulic properties thus the same values were adopted for all xaj and xaj gcr models all other parameters were recalibrated in each of the nine tests including the adjustable parameter αc of the original gcr the warm up calibration and validation periods were from 2007 9 2007 12 2008 2010 and 2011 2012 respectively this study selected a number of statistical criteria to quantify the performance of hydrological models such as the nash efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 r square r2 kling gupta coefficient kge gupta et al 2009 normalized root mean square error nrmse and bias in percentage pbias kge consists of three distinctive components α is the measure of relative variability β is the standard deviation ratio and θ indicates the linear correlation between the simulated and observed sequences bai et al 2018 gupta et al 2009 statistical criteria were calculated as follows 19 nse 1 i 1 n y obs i y sim i 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 20 r 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs y sim i y sim i 1 n y sim i y sim 2 i 1 n y obs i y obs 2 2 21 kge 1 α 1 2 β 1 2 θ

simulated values respectively y obs and y s im are the averages of the observed and simulated values respectively n is the total number of days of the time series σ s and σ o are the standard deviations for the observed and simulated values respectively and c o v y obs y sim is the covariance between the observed and simulated values nse and kge range from to 1 the closer nse or kge approaches 1 0 the better the model performs the optimal values of pbias and nrmse are zero different statistical criteria emphasize the different capabilities of the model the nse criterion focuses on the performance of the high values the kge criterion considers high value and low value simulations equivalently r2 criterion represents the correlation between the simulation and observations the nrmse and pbias criteria characterize the mean and total errors respectively maximizing nse with log bias constraints was selected as an objective function viney et al 2009 that can simultaneously consider consistency and deviation as follows 24 f n s e 5 0 ln 1 0 0 01 p b i a s 2 5 3 results 3 1 performance of the xaj model and gcr fig 4 shows model performance of the gcr and xaj models in the sew results of the xaj model in fig 4 are obtained by conventional single objective calibration against q only i e m1 the performance of the xaj model in q simulation is excellent with an nseq of 0 93 for e simulation nsee is 0 0 93 indicating that the xaj model cannot capture daily dynamics of catchment e results of m2 and m3 calibration strategies showed similar performance in q and e see fig s1 nseq of both m2 and m3 was 0 9 whereas nsee were 0 03 and 0 05 respectively simulating q is excellent and simulating e remains unreliable this highlights the limitation of rainfall runoff models in estimating e all four functions of gcr reproduced the observed daily e with nse 0 71 although they underestimated the high e 4 0 mm per day fig 4 and fig s2 the performances of one parameter b15 function and the two parameter h18 g21 and s22 functions were almost equivalent thus result of one parameter b15 function only was further analyzed and presented only to retain the simplicity of integrated model the parameters αc of the gcr were calibrated against the measured e using the eddy covariance flux system excluding rainy days the optimized value of αc is 0 63 which was the reference value for subsequent evaluation this suggested that the gcr can successfully estimate the daily e of the sew and has the potential to be integrated with xaj to improve the modeling capability of watershed water balance partitioning 3 2 performance of integrated xaj gcr models 3 2 1 runoff simulation fig 5 shows the performance of xaj gcr models in simulating q and e under m1 m2 and m3 calibration strategies for runoff simulation all three xaj gcr models performed excellently under three different calibration strategies nseq were 0 84 with a range of 0 84 0 93 for the m1 calibration strategy nseq of all three xaj gcr models was 0 93 which were the same as the performance of the xaj model fig 4 b for the m2 calibration strategy nseq of the xaj model was 0 91 whereas xaj gcr models underperformed marginally with nseq in the range of 0 84 0 89 the l3 o had the highest nseq 0 88 followed by l3 d 0 87 and l3 p 0 84 for the m3 calibration strategy nseq of all three xaj gcr models was 0 93 which was marginally greater than the performance of the xaj model nseq 0 92 fig s1 a the performance of q simulation under the m2 calibration strategy to the three xaj gcr models was marginally worse than that under m1 and m3 strategies in summary xaj was always superior in q simulation for the sew the integration of the gcr and xaj models maintains excellent capability in q simulation 3 2 2 evapotranspiration simulation the performance of integrated xaj gcr models in e simulation outperformed the original xaj model fig 5 b d and f under the conventional m1 calibration strategy the l3 o scheme had the maximum nsee 0 44 followed by the l3 d 0 30 and l3 p 0 20 schemes the performances of both the xaj and xaj gcr models under the m1 strategy in simulating e were unsatisfactory with nsee 0 5 for the m2 calibration strategy the nsee of the l3 o scheme was 0 71 and that of the other schemes was 0 67 for the m3 calibration strategy the performance of the l3 o scheme in simulating e was the best nsee 0 71 followed by l3 p nsee 0 67 and l3 d nsee 0 66 comparing the three different calibration strategies the model performance in simulating e under m2 nsee m2 0 683 0 01 was better than that under m1 nsee m1 0 3 0 06 and marginally better than that under m3 nsee m3 0 680 0 01 therefore the performance of integrated models in e simulation under the m2 and m3 strategies was credible 3 3 comprehensive evaluation of the integration method fig 6 summarizes the performance of the xaj and xaj gcr models in simulating q and e concerning nse r2 kge nrmse and pbias under the m1 m2 and m3 calibration strategies the five criteria focus on different aspects of model performance and can comprehensively evaluate the xaj and xaj gcr models the model performance in simulating q and e evaluated by the nse criterion is described in detail in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 the model performance of both q and e evaluated by r2 criterion is similar to that of nse criterion for the m1 calibration strategy the integrated xaj gcr models marginally outperformed the xaj model in simulating q fig 6 a and remarkably in simulating e fig 6 b for the performance of q δkgeq was 0 07 nrmseq was almost unchanged before and after integration and pbias q of all three schemes was 2 in terms of the performance of e the δkgee of the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes increased by 0 39 0 46 and 0 52 respectively in terms of nrmse criterion nrmsee of the xaj model was as high as 138 9 and the xaj gcr models reduced nrmse e to 82 6 3 5 75 1 89 1 the pbias e of the three schemes decreased from 30 6 to 22 1 l3 p 14 8 l3 d and 6 1 l3 o for the m2 strategy the performance of the xaj gcr models in simulating q and e evaluated using different criteria was not superior to that of the original xaj model fig 6 c and d for the performance of q in terms of kge criterion the l3 d scheme was slightly worse δkgeq 0 02 and l3 p and l3 o improved noticeably δkgeq 0 10 nrmseq of the xaj gcr models deteriorated slightly compared with that of the xaj model however they were all 40 pbias q of all three schemes was also 2 for the performance of e the xaj gcr models were superior to the xaj model except for pbias e of the l3 p scheme δkgee of the three schemes have marginal differences in the range of 0 23 0 24 nrmsee decreased from 101 6 by the xaj model to 57 6 by l3 p 57 5 by l3 d and 54 by l3 o for the m3 calibration strategy the xaj gcr models maintained excellent capability in q simulation fig 6 e and markedly improved capability in e simulation fig 6 f regarding the performance of q there was little change before and after integration for the performance of e the δkgee of the three schemes had marginal differences in the range of 0 22 0 23 the mean error of the simulation was markedly reduced with δnrmsee values of 45 2 43 8 and 48 5 by the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes respectively the pbias e of the l3 p l3 d and l3 o schemes increased from 0 6 to 18 9 17 8 and 17 7 respectively a comprehensive comparison of the three calibration strategies and five statistical criteria showed that the xaj and xaj gcr models had excellent q simulation capabilities there were small differences in simulating q under different calibration strategies and integration schemes models had the best performance in simulating q under the m1 calibration strategy followed by m3 and finally m2 the reproduction of q was excellent even in the m2 calibration strategy without q indicating that the structures of the xaj and xaj gcr models were sound in contrast the simulated daily e dynamics by the xaj model were poor in the sew even nse was only 0 03 under the m2 calibration strategy which performed best in simulating e the e simulation was greatly influenced by calibration strategies and integration schemes the models performed best in simulating e under the m3 calibration strategy followed by m2 and m1 the integrated xaj gcr models obtained an acceptable simulation of daily e and the built in method of s depletion by e in the xaj model l3 o was optimal these results showed that single objective calibration leads to deterioration of uncalibrated hydrological variables whereas m3 calibration strategy with multi objective achieves equilibrium of q and e simulations resulting in satisfactory performance of both multi objective calibration can optimize model performance by avoiding wrongly adjusted parameters however it cannot obtain reliable e results for the xaj model in summary regardless of the integration schemes and calibration strategies the integrated xaj gcr models maintained excellent q simulation and improved e simulation when compared with the original xaj model in the sew multi objective calibration with both observed q and e does not guarantee that the original xaj model produces reliable daily e variations however the integrated xaj gcr model could effectively and simultaneously simulate both q and e this suggested that the integration of gcr into the xaj model improves the modeling capability of the xaj model and that such modification is both necessary and successful 4 discussion 4 1 water balance modeling of hydrological models lhms based on the rainfall runoff relationship and watershed water balance should theoretically satisfy the basic equation p e q δs where δs is typically ignored at the multi year scale the xaj gcr models with different integration schemes and calibration strategies perform excellently in water balance as shown in fig 7 for the lhms based on water balance p is input and if q and e are accurately estimated δs is residual the xaj gcr models performs relatively poorly in terms of s with nse from 0 39 to 0 48 0 46 0 50 of xaj model see fig s4 soil moisture performance varies markedly with different calibration strategies but less with different integration schemes under the same calibration strategy amongst all tested scenarios xaj model under m2 calibration strategy has optimal simulations boundary conditions or physical meaning restrictions can result abnormal points distributed along the horizontal axis in fig 5 such as the soil tension water capacity non negative e and non negative s etc for any timestep simulated e are greater than soil water left soil water can be completely depleted in the xaj model and estimated e will be set as zero if precipitation is zero in the next time step table 4 summarizes the proportion of abnormal zero e values obtained by original and integrated models when e was incorporated into calibration objectives xaj and xaj gcr models produce fewer e anomalies which indicates a more rational model structure in particular the l3 o scheme under the m3 calibration strategy had an optimal overall performance with non anomalous simulated e zero values and a smaller water balance error the integrated xaj gcr models outperformed the original xaj model in reproducing the water balance and e process regardless of integration schemes or calibration strategies the introduction of gcr added a reasonable e estimation mechanism to the xaj model greatly relieving the negative e forced to zero even the simplest scheme with the least parameters also had satisfactory performance in other words appropriate adjustment of the model structure can improve the model performance in modeling q e and water balance 4 2 impact of the calibration strategy on model performance the parameters of lhms cannot be observed easily in the watershed thus parameter calibration is necessary mostafaie et al 2018 parameter calibration is a continuous optimization process that matches as closely as possible simulated hydrological processes with observed hydrological behaviors calibration objectives affect the performance of a model and its parameters krol 2010 nemri and kinnard 2020 in this study the original xaj model performed best in simulating q with single objective calibration against observed q i e m1 and performed slightly worse with the multi objective calibration strategy i e m3 and observed e calibration i e m2 simulating e in a single objective calibration with e m2 was optimal with marginal and clear deteriorations appearing in m3 and m1 respectively for both the original xaj and integrated xaj gcr models single objective calibrations with either q or e alone could achieve a high accuracy simulation of the calibration variable however this may lead to increasing simulation errors of other hydrological processes a single objective calibration strategy always leads to the deterioration of the simulation performance for non calibrated hydrological variables it is difficult for conventional single objective calibration strategies in lhms to reflect different aspects of model simulations because parameter optimization only considers the characteristics of a certain watershed hydrological process vrugt et al 2003 the application of multi objective calibration can solve the above limitations the results of this study showed that incorporating q and e observations simultaneously into parameter calibration can realize a consistent optimization simulation of both and improve the reality of water balance partitioning 4 3 parameters in the xaj gcr the differences in simulation performance partly stems from the ability of model structure to reproduce hydrological processes and selection of calibration objectives gupta et al 2012 most of parameters have different values obtained from different model structures and calibration objectives see table s1 it shows an equifinality problems as other models beven 2006 but all the parameters are within the empirical range of their physical meaning tension water capacity wm surface free water capacity sm and parameters b and ex that reflect spatial inhomogeneity of both varied considerably under different integration schemes and calibration strategies but all are within reasonable ranges zhao 1984 pointed b is 0 2 0 3 in watersheds with an area of several to several hundred km2 and sm 50 mm in watersheds with high soil permeability and dense vegetation optimal parameter sets of sew in l3 o integration schemes was consistent with these of typical humid watershed as suggested by zhao 1984 the parameter αc varying with multiple environmental factors affects the accuracy of the generalized complementary relationship brutsaert et al 2020 pointed out that epo estimated by meteorological data under nonpotential conditions is not expected reference of complementary deviations in other words αc has different physical meaning from the constant αpt of priestly taylor equation the αc is essentially just an adjustable coefficient it is around 1 3 under very humid conditions as expected potential conditions in accordance with the typical values of about 1 26 in the calibration by priestlry and taylor 1972 for epo on the other hand αc can approach zero under extremely arid conditions to satisfy boundary conditions liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 showed that αc has noteworthy spatial heterogeneity and is strongly correlated with the aridity index ai the ratio of annual e capacity to annual precipitation and established the empirical formula as α c l 1 15 a i 0 14 and α c b 1 496 1 0 2948 a i 0 6697 the ai of the sew was 0 70 and the empirical α c l and α c b were 1 21 and 1 11 respectively the optimal αc calibrated against the observed e of the eddy covariance flux tower was 0 63 the αc of xaj gcr models ranged from 0 72 to 0 83 table s1 the difference in calibrated αc was evident however they were within a reasonable range of 0 1 1 5 reported by brutsaert et al 2020 the much smaller αc derived here may be due to two reasons first previous studies by liu et al 2016 and brutsaert et al 2020 suggested the spatial variation of αc in general from hundreds of catchments which may not apply to a specific watershed the sew is a mountainous watershed with a steep slope where most of the precipitation runs away as streamflow and a small fraction as e its unique topographic conditions may lead to catchment αc deviating from the general expectation the other reason is that the xaj and gcr parameters influence each other in the integrated models when they are optimized against different observations noted that αc was insensitive to integration schemes when e was incorporated into the calibration objectives i e m2 and m3 calibration strategies estimated e by xaj gcr models under different calibration strategies has systematic differences with that estimated by the gcr method and thus points line up along different lines and not along the 1 1 line in fig 8 the randomly distributed points are due to simulated e are greater than the sum of soil water left and precipitation of those timesteps 4 4 advantages and applicability of the integrated model e is an important component of the watershed water balance which is one of the most difficult variables to simulate owing to its very high spatio temporal heterogeneity aminzadeh and or 2017 loukas et al 2004 demonstrated that the independent and accurate estimation of e can greatly improve water balance simulation however the xaj model provides inaccurate estimates of e fang et al 2017 in this study the gcr with strict physical mechanism was integrated into lhms to improve empirical e estimation module and further improve water balance partitioning without increasing the number of model parameters and data requirements because gcr is a reliable and robust alternative for regional e estimation relying solely on routinely observed meteorological variables and it has only one adjustable parameter αc replacing pan coefficient ke of xaj model it was shown that the integrated hydrological models could better reproduce water balance components such as q and e given that the model performance was primarily enhanced by the modified e module the integrated xaj gcr model may be more applicable than the original model under different hydro geo meteorological conditions the other forms of gcr possibly have same potential for integration without considering parameter numbers further studies investigating the performance of incorporating gcr into other lhms under different hydroclimatic conditions should be conducted in the future 5 conclusions generalized complementary relationships and lumped hydrological models are reliable methods for simulating e and q respectively to the best of our knowledge this study is the first attempt to integrate a generalized complementary relationship into a lumped hydrological model the integrated xaj gcr models showed excellent performance regardless of the integration schemes and calibration strategies when tested in a humid experimental catchment using q and e measurements the integrated xaj gcr model maintained excellent simulated runoff results nseq 0 84 more importantly the integrated models have significantly improved the performance of e simultaneously one of the main advantages of the integration method is that it does not increase the complexity of the lumped hydrological model or data requirements this integration is feasible and appropriate for improving the water balance partitioning capability and reliability of lumped hydrological models for water balance modeling water resource management and climate change impact studies moreover since the obtainable results are strictly based on physical mechanisms they can be useful for independent checks in a wide range of lhms and other climatic zones analysis of global applicability to different lhms gcr in the current method is ongoing and will be the subject of future communication funding this research was funded by the national natural science

1838,studying impacts of the co2 effect on potential evapotranspiration pet and offline drought indices from surface resistance perspective is significant for understanding and accessing droughts this study comprehensively investigated impacts of the co2 effect on pet and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei over china during 1971 2010 based on two simulations with and without co2 effect respectively we found that the co2 effect led to decreased pet and increased spei and decreased drought which showed strong spatial variations with the greatest impact over northern china excluding westernmost part for pet such spatial variations had functional relationships not only with co2 concentration but also climatological conditions i e climatological wind speed u and slope of vapour pressure curve s for pet but climatological u s and precipitation p for spei further analyses implied that climatological u climatological u and p determined the spatial variations in the co2

not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is an extreme case of dry wet condition and usually characterized by below normal water availability from month to decade scales sheffield et al 2012 as one of the most disastrous climate extremes seneviratne et al 2010 drought can negatively impact socioeconomics and natural environments wilhite 2000 therefore there have been a wide of scientific affords focusing on changes of drought characters its impact the underlying mechanisms and drought monitoring and forecasting sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 williams et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2015 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 scheff et al 2021 yang et al 2020 essentially drought is an issue of water balance and consequently the most efficient way to measure drought from climate data requires a combination of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet scheff et al 2021 various indices have been proposed and widely used for quantifying the dry wet conditions particularly droughts globally e g palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 2012 2015 trenberth et al 2014 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 scheff et al 2021 as an important input for computing drought indices pet in most cases is neither observable nor a direct output from climate models yang et al 2019 but is estimated by theoretical formulas with meteorological dataset however due to the difference in the pet calculation selections the results in the drought indices based studies can vary a lot and even show opposite trends e g with thornthwaite method versus with penman monteith method hobbins et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 milly and dunne 2016 scheff 2018 among these methods the standard penman monteith method is considered the better one due to its comprehensive physical considerations of evapotranspiration processes mcvicar et al 2007 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2022 however the standard penman monteith method also has its weakness such as assuming a constant surface resistance resistance to vapour flow through stomata openings it has been evidenced by many studies that the plant stomatal resistance increased with the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration medlyn et al 2001 gedney et al 2006 sun et al 2014 lin et al 2015 zhao and cao 2022 zhan et al 2022 therefore the standard penman monteith method neglecting this physiological response to the elevated co2 may cause an overestimation of pet as the global mean co2 concentration has been increasing milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 this overestimation may also be able to propagate to the calculated drought indices resulting in an overestimation of terrestrial drying especially for the future with high co2 emission scheff et al 2017 scheff 2018 yang et al 2019 when compared with the results based on offline drought indices climate model simulates the opposite results i e so called index impact gap e g increases in runoff yang et al 2019 photosynthesis greve et al 2019 mankin et al 2018 scheff et al 2017 2021 and leaf coverage mankin et al 2019 studies argued that this discrepancy can be largely attributed to the neglection of the co2 impact on plant stomatal in the pet estimation methods roderick et al 2015 greve et al 2019 milly and dunne 2016 scheff et al 2017 yang et al 2019 to that end yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 improved the standard penman monteith equation by incorporating an empirical function to represent surface resistance with co2 concentration and found that the resulting drought indices agreed much better with models hydrologic simulations incorporating the surface resistance response to the increasing co2 concentration into the pet calculation and into the offline drought indices is crucial to obtain more accurate assessments of changes and impacts of pet and drought whereas a systematic assessment of the impacts of co2 effect on pet is missing to date including 1 how strong the impacts of co2 effect on pet and drought are 2 whether such impacts are homogenous spatially and 3 if not what factors are the reasons for spatial variations to fill these knowledge gaps we took china as the study region to conduct a comprehensive analysis and the objectives of this study are threefold 1 to quantitatively assess the impacts of co2 effect on pet and meteorological droughts 2 to identify spatial differences in these impacts and 3 to physically explain such spatial differences to represent dryness wetness and obtain meteorological drought characteristics indicators we selected the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei here vicente serrano et al 2010 this index is used mainly because it is easy to calculate and can effectively track meteorological droughts at various time scales which will benefit us to further understand differences in the impacts of co2 effect on meteorological droughts among different time scales overall our results will be helpful for an in depth understanding of the co2 effect on the pet estimation and associated applications in drought indices from the perspective of surface resistance response to co2 2 data and methodology 2 1 data for computing pet and spei the routinely observed meteorological measurements from approximately 2000 sites over china are used including monthly precipitation p mm mean maximum and minimum air temperatures at 2 m height c wind speed at 10 m height m s sunshine duration hr month and relative humidity rh during 1969 2010 fig 1 this dataset has been conducted quality control i e inhomogeneous and missing values according to previous studies sun et al 2017 considering the potential influences caused by the uneven spatial site distributions we follow zhang et al 2016 and process these sites into 1433 grid cells of 0 25 0 25 longitude by latitude fig 1 each grid cell contains at least one site with continuous meteorological measurements if the grid includes more than one site the average of these sites is taken as the final grid value the monthly gridded co2 concentration ρ co2 ppm dataset https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5021361 at 1 1 spatial resolution during 1850 2013 was used in this study cheng et al 2022 to match the meteorological grids we bilinearly interpolated the monthly ρ co2 dataset to the meteorological grids 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 pet equation in this study two equations were used to calculate pet one considering co2 while the other one not first is the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which has been widely used to estimate pet but does not consider co2 1 pe t n o c o 2 0 408 s rn g γ 900 t 273 e s 1 r h s γ 1 0 34 u where rn mj m2 day is net radiation g mj m2 day is soil heat flux density which can be neglected at monthly scale γ 0 665 kpa oc is the psychometric constant u denotes wind speed at 2 m height derived from wind speed at 10 m height es kpa and s kpa c are the saturation vapour pressure and the slope of the vapour pressure curve respectively and t c refers to the mean temperature detailed computations about rn es s and u can be found in text s1 or allen et al 1998 in this equation there exists a critical assumption that the surface insistence rs is a constant of 70 s m which goes to the value 0 34 70 208 in eq 1 therefore this equation cannot reflect the physiological effect of co2 on pet via decreasing plant stomatal to consider of the co2 effect on pet yang et al 2019 proposed an empirical function to represent rs changes with co2 concentration i e rs 70 0 05 ρ co2 300 eq 1 is therefore rewritten as 2 pe t c o 2 0 408 s rn g γ 900 t 273 e s 1 r h s γ 1 u 0 34 0 00024 ρ c o 2 300 both petnoco2 and petco2 were calculated at monthly scale according to allen et al 1998 to quantify the co2 effect on pet we calculated the multi year mean annual differences between pet co2 and pet noco2 divided by the multi year mean annual pet noco2 δ pet the δ pet were also computed at 1 3 9 and 24 month time scales to match the spei time scales 2 2 2 spei and identifications of drought characteristics indicators our study adopted this spei model vicente serrano et al 2010 to represent dryness wetness and further determine drought characteristics indicators including drought intensity di drought duration dd and drought area da monthly p and pet data are used to estimate the climatic water balance p pet for a certain month before they are aggregated at various time scales a three parameter log logistic distribution is recommended to fit the p pet time series for each month then an inverse normal function is employed to standardize the probabilities vicente serrano et al 2010 negative spei value typically indicates dry conditions while positive spei for wet conditions two spei scenarios were run i e using pet noco2 and pet co2 respectively at 1 3 9 and 24 month scales during 1969 2010 notably to rule out the impacts from the spei parameters the parameters obtained from the scenario of pet noco2 were applied to the scenario with pet co2 moreover considering that the data in 1969 and or 1970 was used to compute spei at 1 month scales the study period was set during 1971 2010 i e 480 months a monthly spei threshold of 0 5 was selected to identify droughts if spei 0 5 at a certain grid in a given month drought appears and vice versa accordingly spei dd and di corresponding to their values averaged during 1971 2010 at each grid were extracted from the monthly spei time series spei was the average of all spei values in 480 months dd was the total number of months with spei 0 5 di was the sum of spei values 0 5 divided by dd for a given region the monthly da value was the ratio between the total area of grids with spei 0 5 and the area of all grids within this region while da represents the average of all monthly da values during 1971 2010 here we calculated the differences in spei di dd and da between the two scenarios with co2 effect minus without co2 effect δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da to quantify the impacts of co2 on droughts 3 results 3 1 spatial differences in co2 effects on pet and drought as shown in fig 2 a the 40 year mean annual ρ co2 i e ρ c o 2 was around 358 0 ppm for china at each time scale but presented clear regional differences with the maxima in huai river basin rb and the minima in northwest rb spatially ρ c o 2 at each time scale was mainly characterized by larger values generally 357 6 ppm in eastern china excluding northern part fig 3 a1 6 due to the elevated co2 induced increases in rs it is no surprising to see that relative to petnoco2 the 40 year mean annual petco2 declined with δ pet ranging between 0 88 and 0 45 fig 2b generally the greater δ pet 0 60 values were mainly observed in northern china excluding westernmost part fig 3b1 6 as the pet changes spei and associated drought characteristic indicators responded to change at each time scale the mean δ spei δ di over china varied between 0 017 0 021 at 1 month scale and 0 048 0 050 at 24 month scale while the δ dd δ da ranged between 8 months 1 7 at 1 month scale and 4 months 0 8 at 24 month scale fig 2c f on the regional scale δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da were generally larger in the northern rbs than the southern specially the greatest magnitude δ spei 0 04 δ di 0 045 δ dd 8 months and δ da 1 7 was found in northwest rb while pearl rb had the smallest magnitude δ spei 0 032 δ di 0 025 δ dd 4 months and δ da 0 7 moreover it can be seen that with increasing time scales these variables magnitudes all increased implying a stronger co2 effect at a longer time scale fig 2c f 3c1 6 3d1 6 and 3e1 6 spatially northern china showed greater positive δ spei and δ di 0 02 but greater negative δ dd 6 months fig 3c1 6 3d1 6 and 3e1 6 overall the co2 effect led to declined pet and consequently drying conditions such effect showed considerable spatial variations with stronger in northern china excluding westernmost part for δ pet and strengthened with increasing time scales 3 2 spatial function relationships of δ p e t and δ s p e i with ρ c o 2 and climatological conditions taking all grids across china together we computed explanatory variance r 2 between ρ c o 2 and δ pet at 1 24 month time scales the r 2 0 05 indicated that the spatial difference in ρ c o 2 could not explain that in δ pet to understand the potential causes we performed related analyses based on eqs 1 and 2 the monthly δpet was written as 3a δ p e t 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 s γ 1 0 34 u 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 3b 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 s γ 1 0 34 u obviously the monthly δpet did not increase with ρ co2 in a linear manner because denominator within eq 3a also involved ρ co2 when comparing the first term that within square bracket and the second term in the eq 3a denominator over 1433 grids the former was always much larger than the latter with a median of the ratio i e the former divided by the latter higher than 40 we hereby removed the second term in denominator from eq 3a and rewrote it as eq 3b which explained 95 of the spatial variance of the monthly δpet apparently the new equation indicated that the monthly δpet was not only dependent on ρ co2 but also u and s here we defined the sensitivity of the monthly δpet to ρ co2 sδpet as 4 s δ p e t 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u considering the non linearity of eq 4 we re evaluated whether this equation was suitable for the long period analysis i e 1971 2010 fig 4 a1 6 showed the scatter plots of s δ p e t i e δ pet divided by ρ c o 2 300 versus 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u where u and s represented respectively climatological u and s obviously s δ p e t was not be equal to 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u however a certain function relationship existed between s δ p e t and 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u and moreover the power function fitted the best at each time scale with r 2 0 95 therefore s δ p e t at i month scale s δ p e t i was expressed as 5 s δ p e t i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i where ai and bi were the estimated parameters shown in fig 4a1 6 accordingly δ pet at i month scale δ pet i was written as 6 δ pet i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i ρ c o 2 i 300 considering the two scenarios no co2 effect versus co2 effect use the same p the spatial difference in δ spei should result from δ pet caused by the co2 effect however the r 2 values between δ spei and δ pet fig 4b1 6 were all smaller than 0 50 at all the time scales implying the distribution of δ pet cannot explain the distribution of δ spei well previous studies e g vicente serrano et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 sun et al 2018 stated that the spatial distribution of the dryness wetness sensitivity to pet was closely associated with climatological p p to figure out the influence of p we classified this country into seven regions based on p where each bin had the equal number of grids results suggested that for each p bin the co2 effect induced δ pet could generally explain 50 of the δ spei spatial variance at each time scale with the largest r 2 0 80 fig 4b1 6 thus we took previous studies as the reference and defined the δ spei sensitivity to δ pet s δ s p e i as δ spei divided by 100 δ pet here representing changes in δ spei induced by per percentage of δ pet the s δ s p e i regression slopes in fig 4b1 6 was estimated for each p bin at each time scale and it increases with the decline of p suggesting an obvious influence of p on s δ s p e i fig 4c1 6 illustrated the scatter plots of s δ s p e i versus p evidently the s δ s p e i was strongly dependent on p the magnitudes of s δ s p e i decreased dramatically with increasing p indicating the higher the p the smaller the s δ s p e i magnitude among four different linear power exponential and logarithmic regressions the logarithmic function between s δ s p e i and p fitted the best at each time scale with r 2 between 0 86 at 24 month scale and 0 93 at 9 month scale thus the s δ s p e i at i month time scale s δ s p e i i was expressed as 7 s δ s p e i i c i l n p i d i where ci and di were the estimated parameters shown in fig 4c1 6 to sum up the function of the sensitivity of δ spei to ρ c o 2 s δ s p e i c o 2 i and δspei on i month scale δ spei i could be expressed as 8 δ spei i c i ln p i d i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i s spei c o 2 i ρ c o 2 i 300 to further validate eq 8 we calculated r 2 between estimated and observed δ spei across china at all the time scales results showed that found r 2 values were generally 0 90 implying the robustness of eq 8 3 3 explanations for spatial differences in δ p e t and δ s p e i to understand the causes for the strong spatial variations in δ pet and δ spei over china we firstly took the national mean value i e δ pet cn δ spei cn as the baseline to define d δ pet d δ spei as δ pet δ pet cn δ spei δ spei cn for each grid the spatial distribution of d δ pet and d δ spei at different time scales was shown in fig s1 then we applied the attribution method developed by sun et al 2014 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2022 to separate contributions of each influential factor to δ pet and δ spei based on eqs 6 and 8 figs s1 and s2 and identified the related dominants fig 5 the details of the attribution method were explained in appendix a fig 5a1 4 depicted the spatial distribution of factors dominating the negative and the positive d δ pet the d u u minus national mean was the dominant factor for d δ pet at 93 of grids while d s s minus national mean and d ρ c o 2 ρ c o 2 minus national mean only dominated at about 5 of grids sporadically across the country as for the d u dominated regions the negative d δ pet was attributed to the positive d u mainly in northern china excluding westernmost part and in the other grids the positive d δ pet were due to the negative d u when it comes to spei d p p minus national mean and d u together determined d δ spei over 99 of china at each time scale fig 5b1 4 there was a consistency in the spatial pattern of these dominant factors at all the time scales the negative d u was responsible for the negative d δ spei over western part of southern china while the positive d u decided the positive d δ spei over eastern part of northern china over northern china except for eastern part the positive d δ spei could be attributed to the negative d p however the positive d p generally determined the negative d δ spei over southern china except for western part 4 discussion based on comprehensive analyses of δ pet δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da we found that the co2 effect induced increases in rs decreased pet and subsequently eased the drought and these findings are consistent with past studies milly and dunne 2016 scheff et al 2021 vremec et al 2022 yang et al 2019 2020 zhou et al 2022 for example zhou et al 2022 suggested that the increases in pet without co2 effect were larger than those with co2 effect during 2015 2100 across china moreover the finding that neglecting the elevated co2 effect can lead to an overestimation of pet is indirectly supported by the observed co2 induced evapotranspiration reductions vremec et al 2022 yang et al 2020 compared future drought changes from two palmer drought severity index pdsi simulations the first coupled simulation pdsi cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 used the cmip5 models direct outputs to maintain the hydrologic consistency the second offline simulation pdsi offline was based on the standard penman monteith method and the traditional offline approach they found that the drought increases of the pdsi offline were much larger than those of the pdsi cmip5 suggesting that this overestimation of drought increases in the pdsi offline could be attributed to the neglect of the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration several limitations of this study should be kept in mind first the empirical function used here to represent the rs changes with co2 concentration was developed by yang et al 2019 and has the same response coefficient value for all vegetation types however many observation based studies have found that the response of plant stomatal conductance to elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations can vary significantly among different vegetation types medlyn et al 2001 lin et al 2015 gardner et al 2022 second although the fao 56 penman monteith equation is widely used to estimate pet from meteorological data it relies on several assumptions that may introduce uncertainties in the estimated pet values two such assumptions are the uniform spatial distribution of assumed vegetation and land surface albedo vegetation types and land surface albedo can vary significantly in space and time depending on various environmental conditions such as soil properties and climate liang et al 1998 harrison and prentice 2003 zhang et al 2012 nie et al 2019 third this study did not consider the co2 fertilization effect on vegetation many studies have reported that the elevated co2 can increase vegetation productivity by stimulating photosynthesis reducing stomatal conductance and enhancing water use efficiency which could be reflected by increases in vegetation indices gross primary productivity and net primary productivity toreti et al 2020 wang et al 2020 davis et al 2022 considering rs responses to co2 concentration among interspecies and the co2 fertilization effect need to be examined in future studies fourth the selections of different drought indices could introduce uncertainties into the study to examine this issue we compared the co2 effect induced changes in different drought indices including pdsi self calibrated pdsi and spei and found a similar spatial distribution not shown here which suggests that the conclusions are not significantly affected by the choice of drought index overall by comprehensively analyzing the impacts of the co2 effect on pet and drought conditions from a surface resistance perspective our study provides valuable insights into associated applications in drought indices and drought mechanisms 5 conclusions in recognition of the importance of co2 physiological effect this study investigated how the co2 effect influenced the estimations of pet and of drought indices across china by comparing the estimations with and without the co2 effect we found that through increasing rs the co2 effect led to decreased δ pet and increased δ spei and then weakened the estimated drought during 1971 2010 across the country however there were the evident spatial differences within the research domain that a stronger effect showed in northern china while a weaker effect in southern china the derived spatial function relationships of δ pet δ spei with ρ c o 2 and climatological conditions at each time scale suggested that the co2 effect induced δ pet δ spei was equal to ρ c o 2 multiplied by the sensitivity of δ pet δ spei to ρ c o 2 which heavily relied on u and s u s and p at last we employed these functions to attribute the spatial differences in impacts of the co2 effect across china generally the stronger weaker impacts on δ pet in northern china except for westernmost part remaining regions could be attributed to higher lower u regarding dominants of δ spei lower higher u was over western part of southern china eastern part of northern china while lower higher p was over northern china except for eastern part eastern part of southern china our study further confirmed that the co2 effect induced increases in rs indeed decrease pet and subsequently ease drought conditions more importantly we found that such impacts vary spatially and are strongly influenced by climatological conditions such as u and p the impacts of co2 effect on pet and drought conditions are stronger in regions with higher u and or lower p these findings highlight the need for region specific assessments of drought risks and vulnerability especially for regions with higher u and or lower p where the drought and drying conditions could be considerably overestimated if the co2 effect is neglected declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

factor and was applied to attribute changes including linear trends and anomalies in hydrological variables and drought indices on national and regional scales therefore this method was employed here for attributing d δ pet and d δ spei three and four sensitivity experiments for attributing d δ pet and d δ spei respectively were performed based on their influential factors and eqs 6 and 8 taking sensitivity experiment of d δ pet i e exp d δ p e t x x is for u s and ρ c o 2 as an example the x factor value was replaced by xcn and other factors remained original values afterward the contribution of each factor to d δ pet was estimated at each grid using the separation algorithm below with the assumption that the differences between x original value and xcn induced exp d δ p e t x d δ pet at a given grid an equation can be established as follows a1 i x n c i δ pet e x p d δ p e t x 1 n j 1 n δ pet j e x p d δ p e t x where k x n c i represents the sum d δ pet contributed from the influential factors excluding x factor n is the number of sensitivity experiments of d δ pet here being 3 n is the number of grids across china here being 1433 and the right term of eq a1 denotes exp d δ p e t x d δ pet thus we could get a set of simultaneous equations with three unknown numbers i e c u c s and c ρ c o 2 by solving these equations the respective contribution for each factor to

algorithm could also be employed for attributing d δ spei however it should be noted that n should be changed as 4 because 4 factors influenced d δ spei the validation of this method was shown in fig s2 while the estimated contributions of each factor to d δ pet and d δ spei could be found in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively lastly by comparing the contributions of each factor the dominants of d δ

1838,studying impacts of the co2 effect on potential evapotranspiration pet and offline drought indices from surface resistance perspective is significant for understanding and accessing droughts this study comprehensively investigated impacts of the co2 effect on pet and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei over china during 1971 2010 based on two simulations with and without co2 effect respectively we found that the co2 effect led to decreased pet and increased spei and decreased drought which showed strong spatial variations with the greatest impact over northern china excluding westernmost part for pet such spatial variations had functional relationships not only with co2 concentration but also climatological conditions i e climatological wind speed u and slope of vapour pressure curve s for pet but climatological u s and precipitation p for spei further analyses implied that climatological u climatological u and p determined the spatial variations in the co2 effect induced pet spei changes over china during 1971 2010 keywords drought co2 effect surface resistance standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index china data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction drought is an extreme case of dry wet condition and usually characterized by below normal water availability from month to decade scales sheffield et al 2012 as one of the most disastrous climate extremes seneviratne et al 2010 drought can negatively impact socioeconomics and natural environments wilhite 2000 therefore there have been a wide of scientific affords focusing on changes of drought characters its impact the underlying mechanisms and drought monitoring and forecasting sheffield et al 2012 trenberth et al 2014 williams et al 2015 scheff and frierson 2015 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 hasanzadeh saray et al 2022 scheff et al 2021 yang et al 2020 essentially drought is an issue of water balance and consequently the most efficient way to measure drought from climate data requires a combination of precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration pet scheff et al 2021 various indices have been proposed and widely used for quantifying the dry wet conditions particularly droughts globally e g palmer 1965 vicente serrano et al 2010 2012 2015 trenberth et al 2014 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2017 scheff et al 2021 as an important input for computing drought indices pet in most cases is neither observable nor a direct output from climate models yang et al 2019 but is estimated by theoretical formulas with meteorological dataset however due to the difference in the pet calculation selections the results in the drought indices based studies can vary a lot and even show opposite trends e g with thornthwaite method versus with penman monteith method hobbins et al 2008 sheffield et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 milly and dunne 2016 scheff 2018 among these methods the standard penman monteith method is considered the better one due to its comprehensive physical considerations of evapotranspiration processes mcvicar et al 2007 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2022 however the standard penman monteith method also has its weakness such as assuming a constant surface resistance resistance to vapour flow through stomata openings it has been evidenced by many studies that the plant stomatal resistance increased with the elevated atmospheric co2 concentration medlyn et al 2001 gedney et al 2006 sun et al 2014 lin et al 2015 zhao and cao 2022 zhan et al 2022 therefore the standard penman monteith method neglecting this physiological response to the elevated co2 may cause an overestimation of pet as the global mean co2 concentration has been increasing milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 this overestimation may also be able to propagate to the calculated drought indices resulting in an overestimation of terrestrial drying especially for the future with high co2 emission scheff et al 2017 scheff 2018 yang et al 2019 when compared with the results based on offline drought indices climate model simulates the opposite results i e so called index impact gap e g increases in runoff yang et al 2019 photosynthesis greve et al 2019 mankin et al 2018 scheff et al 2017 2021 and leaf coverage mankin et al 2019 studies argued that this discrepancy can be largely attributed to the neglection of the co2 impact on plant stomatal in the pet estimation methods roderick et al 2015 greve et al 2019 milly and dunne 2016 scheff et al 2017 yang et al 2019 to that end yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 improved the standard penman monteith equation by incorporating an empirical function to represent surface resistance with co2 concentration and found that the resulting drought indices agreed much better with models hydrologic simulations incorporating the surface resistance response to the increasing co2 concentration into the pet calculation and into the offline drought indices is crucial to obtain more accurate assessments of changes and impacts of pet and drought whereas a systematic assessment of the impacts of co2 effect on pet is missing to date including 1 how strong the impacts of co2 effect on pet and drought are 2 whether such impacts are homogenous spatially and 3 if not what factors are the reasons for spatial variations to fill these knowledge gaps we took china as the study region to conduct a comprehensive analysis and the objectives of this study are threefold 1 to quantitatively assess the impacts of co2 effect on pet and meteorological droughts 2 to identify spatial differences in these impacts and 3 to physically explain such spatial differences to represent dryness wetness and obtain meteorological drought characteristics indicators we selected the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei here vicente serrano et al 2010 this index is used mainly because it is easy to calculate and can effectively track meteorological droughts at various time scales which will benefit us to further understand differences in the impacts of co2 effect on meteorological droughts among different time scales overall our results will be helpful for an in depth understanding of the co2 effect on the pet estimation and associated applications in drought indices from the perspective of surface resistance response to co2 2 data and methodology 2 1

into 1433 grid cells of 0 25 0 25 longitude by latitude fig 1 each grid cell contains at least one site with continuous meteorological measurements if the grid includes more than one site the average of these sites is taken as the final grid value the monthly gridded co2 concentration ρ co2 ppm dataset https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 5021361 at 1 1 spatial resolution during 1850 2013 was used in this study cheng et al 2022 to match the meteorological grids we bilinearly interpolated the monthly ρ co2 dataset to the meteorological grids 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 pet equation in this study two equations were used to calculate pet one considering co2 while the other one not first is the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 which has been widely used to estimate pet but does not consider co2 1 pe t n o c o 2 0 408 s rn g γ 900 t 273 e s 1 r h s γ 1 0 34 u where rn mj m2 day is net radiation g mj m2 day is soil heat flux density which can be neglected at monthly scale γ 0 665 kpa oc is the psychometric constant u denotes wind speed at 2 m height derived from wind speed at 10 m height es kpa and s kpa c are the saturation vapour pressure and the slope of the vapour pressure curve respectively and t c refers to the mean temperature detailed computations about rn es s and u can be found in text s1 or allen et al 1998 in this equation there exists a critical assumption that the surface insistence rs is a constant of 70 s m which goes to the value 0 34 70 208 in eq 1 therefore this equation cannot reflect the physiological effect of co2 on pet via decreasing plant stomatal to consider of the co2 effect on pet yang et al 2019 proposed an empirical function to represent rs changes with co2 concentration i e rs 70 0 05 ρ co2 300 eq 1 is therefore rewritten as 2 pe t c o 2 0 408 s rn g γ 900 t 273 e s 1 r h s γ 1 u 0 34 0 00024 ρ c o 2 300 both petnoco2 and petco2 were calculated at monthly scale according to allen et al 1998 to quantify the co2 effect on pet we calculated the multi year mean annual differences between pet co2 and pet noco2 divided by the multi year mean annual pet noco2 δ pet the δ pet were also computed at 1 3 9 and 24 month time scales to match the spei time scales 2 2 2 spei and identifications of drought characteristics indicators our study adopted this spei model vicente serrano et al 2010 to represent dryness wetness and further determine drought characteristics indicators including drought intensity di drought duration dd and drought area da monthly p and pet data are used to estimate the climatic water balance p pet for a certain month before they are aggregated at various time scales a three parameter log logistic distribution is recommended to fit the p pet time series for each month then an inverse normal function is employed to standardize the probabilities vicente serrano et al 2010 negative spei value typically indicates dry conditions while positive spei for wet conditions two spei scenarios were run i e using pet noco2 and pet co2 respectively at 1 3 9 and 24 month scales during 1969 2010 notably to rule out the impacts from the spei parameters the parameters obtained from the scenario of pet noco2 were applied to the scenario with pet co2 moreover considering that the data in 1969 and or 1970 was used to compute spei at 1 month scales the study period was set during 1971 2010 i e 480 months a monthly spei threshold of 0 5 was selected to identify droughts if spei 0 5 at a certain grid in a given month drought appears and vice versa accordingly spei dd and di corresponding to their values averaged during 1971 2010 at each grid were extracted from the monthly spei time series spei was the average of all spei values in 480 months dd was the total number of months with spei 0 5 di was the sum of spei values 0 5 divided by dd for a given region the monthly da value was the ratio between the total area of grids with spei 0 5 and the area of all grids within this region while da represents the average of all monthly da values during 1971 2010 here we calculated the differences in spei di dd and da between the two scenarios with co2 effect minus without co2 effect δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da to quantify the impacts of co2 on droughts 3 results 3 1 spatial differences in co2 effects on pet and drought as shown in fig 2 a the 40 year mean annual ρ co2 i e ρ c o 2 was around 358 0 ppm for china at each time scale but presented clear regional differences with the maxima in huai river basin rb and the minima in northwest rb spatially ρ c o 2 at each time scale was mainly characterized by larger values generally 357 6 ppm in eastern china excluding northern part fig 3 a1 6 due to the elevated co2 induced increases in rs it is no surprising to see that relative to petnoco2 the 40 year mean annual petco2 declined with δ pet ranging between 0 88 and 0 45 fig 2b generally the greater δ pet 0 60 values were mainly observed in northern china excluding westernmost part fig 3b1 6 as the pet changes spei and associated drought characteristic indicators responded to change at each time scale the mean δ spei δ di over china varied between 0 017 0 021 at 1 month scale and 0 048 0 050 at 24 month scale while the δ dd δ da ranged between 8 months 1 7 at 1 month scale and 4 months 0 8 at 24 month scale fig 2c f on the regional scale δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da were generally larger in the northern rbs than the southern specially the greatest magnitude δ spei 0 04 δ di 0 045 δ dd 8 months and δ da 1 7 was found in northwest rb while pearl rb had the smallest magnitude δ spei 0 032 δ di 0 025 δ dd 4 months and δ da 0 7 moreover it can be seen that with increasing time scales these variables magnitudes all increased implying a stronger co2 effect at a longer time scale fig 2c f 3c1 6 3d1 6 and 3e1 6 spatially northern china showed greater positive δ spei and δ di 0 02 but greater negative δ dd 6 months fig 3c1 6 3d1 6 and 3e1 6 overall the co2 effect led to declined pet and consequently drying conditions such effect showed considerable spatial variations with stronger in northern china excluding westernmost part for δ pet and strengthened with increasing time scales 3 2 spatial function relationships of δ p e t and δ s p e i with ρ c o 2 and climatological conditions taking all grids across china together we computed explanatory variance r 2 between ρ c o 2 and δ pet at 1 24 month time scales the r 2 0 05 indicated that the spatial difference in ρ c o 2 could not explain that in δ pet to understand the potential causes we performed related analyses based on eqs 1 and 2 the monthly δpet was written as 3a δ p e t 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 s γ 1 0 34 u 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 3b 0 00024 γ u ρ c o 2 300 s γ 1 0 34 u obviously the monthly δpet did not increase with ρ co2 in a linear manner because denominator within eq 3a also involved ρ co2 when comparing the first term that within square bracket and the second term in the eq 3a denominator over 1433 grids the former was always much larger than the latter with a median of the ratio i e the former divided by the latter higher than 40 we hereby removed the second term in denominator from eq 3a and rewrote it as eq 3b which explained 95 of the spatial variance of the monthly δpet apparently the new equation indicated that the monthly δpet was not only dependent on ρ co2 but also u and s here we defined the sensitivity of the monthly δpet to ρ co2 sδpet as 4 s δ p e t 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u considering the non linearity of eq 4 we re evaluated whether this equation was suitable for the long period analysis i e 1971 2010 fig 4 a1 6 showed the scatter plots of s δ p e t i e δ pet divided by ρ c o 2 300 versus 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u where u and s represented respectively climatological u and s obviously s δ p e t was not be equal to 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u however a certain function relationship existed between s δ p e t and 0 00024 γ u s γ 1 0 34 u and moreover the power function fitted the best at each time scale with r 2 0 95 therefore s δ p e t at i month scale s δ p e t i was expressed as 5 s δ p e t i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i where ai and bi were the estimated parameters shown in fig 4a1 6 accordingly δ pet at i month scale δ pet i was written as 6 δ pet i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i ρ c o 2 i 300 considering the two scenarios no co2 effect versus co2 effect use the same p the spatial difference in δ spei should result from δ pet caused by the co2 effect however the r 2 values between δ spei and δ pet fig 4b1 6 were all smaller than 0 50 at all the time scales implying the distribution of δ pet cannot explain the distribution of δ spei well previous studies e g vicente serrano et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2016 sun et al 2018 stated that the spatial distribution of the dryness wetness sensitivity to pet was closely associated with climatological p p to figure out the influence of p we classified this country into seven regions based on p where each bin had the equal number of grids results suggested that for each p bin the co2 effect induced δ pet could generally explain 50 of the δ spei spatial variance at each time scale with the largest r 2 0 80 fig 4b1 6 thus we took previous studies as the reference and defined the δ spei sensitivity to δ pet s δ s p e i as δ spei divided by 100 δ pet here representing changes in δ spei induced by per percentage of δ pet the s δ s p e i regression slopes in fig 4b1 6 was estimated for each p bin at each time scale and it increases with the decline of p suggesting an obvious influence of p on s δ s p e i fig 4c1 6 illustrated the scatter plots of s δ s p e i versus p evidently the s δ s p e i was strongly dependent on p the magnitudes of s δ s p e i decreased dramatically with increasing p indicating the higher the p the smaller the s δ s p e i magnitude among four different linear power exponential and logarithmic regressions the logarithmic function between s δ s p e i and p fitted the best at each time scale with r 2 between 0 86 at 24 month scale and 0 93 at 9 month scale thus the s δ s p e i at i month time scale s δ s p e i i was expressed as 7 s δ s p e i i c i l n p i d i where ci and di were the estimated parameters shown in fig 4c1 6 to sum up the function of the sensitivity of δ spei to ρ c o 2 s δ s p e i c o 2 i and δspei on i month scale δ spei i could be expressed as 8 δ spei i c i ln p i d i a i 0 00024 γ u i s i γ 1 0 34 u i b i s spei c o 2 i ρ c o 2 i 300 to further validate eq 8 we calculated r 2 between estimated and observed δ spei across china at all the time scales results showed that found r 2 values were generally 0 90 implying the robustness of eq 8 3 3 explanations for spatial differences in δ p e t and δ s p e i to understand the causes for the strong spatial variations in δ pet and δ spei over china we firstly took the national mean value i e δ pet cn δ spei cn as the baseline to define d δ pet d δ spei as δ pet δ pet cn δ spei δ spei cn for each grid the spatial distribution of d δ pet and d δ spei at different time scales was shown in fig s1 then we applied the attribution method developed by sun et al 2014 sun et al 2017 sun et al 2022 to separate contributions of each influential factor to δ pet and δ spei based on eqs 6 and 8 figs s1 and s2 and identified the related dominants fig 5 the details of the attribution method were explained in appendix a fig 5a1 4 depicted the spatial distribution of factors dominating the negative and the positive d δ pet the d u u minus national mean was the dominant factor for d δ pet at 93 of grids while d s s minus national mean and d ρ c o 2 ρ c o 2 minus national mean only dominated at about 5 of grids sporadically across the country as for the d u dominated regions the negative d δ pet was attributed to the positive d u mainly in northern china excluding westernmost part and in the other grids the positive d δ pet were due to the negative d u when it comes to spei d p p minus national mean and d u together determined d δ spei over 99 of china at each time scale fig 5b1 4 there was a consistency in the spatial pattern of these dominant factors at all the time scales the negative d u was responsible for the negative d δ spei over western part of southern china while the positive d u decided the positive d δ spei over eastern part of northern china over northern china except for eastern part the positive d δ spei could be attributed to the negative d p however the positive d p generally determined the negative d δ spei over southern china except for western part 4 discussion based on comprehensive analyses of δ pet δ spei δ di δ dd and δ da we found that the co2 effect induced increases in rs decreased pet and subsequently eased the drought and these findings are consistent with past studies milly and dunne 2016 scheff et al 2021 vremec et al 2022 yang et al 2019 2020 zhou et al 2022 for example zhou et al 2022 suggested that the increases in pet without co2 effect were larger than those with co2 effect during 2015 2100 across china moreover the finding that neglecting the elevated co2 effect can lead to an overestimation of pet is indirectly supported by the observed co2 induced evapotranspiration reductions vremec et al 2022 yang et al 2020 compared future drought changes from two palmer drought severity index pdsi simulations the first coupled simulation pdsi cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 used the cmip5 models direct outputs to maintain the hydrologic consistency the second offline simulation pdsi offline was based on the standard penman monteith method and the traditional offline approach they found that the drought increases of the pdsi offline were much larger than those of the pdsi cmip5 suggesting that this overestimation of drought increases in the pdsi offline could be attributed to the neglect of the vegetation response to elevated atmospheric co2 concentration several limitations of this study should be kept in mind first the empirical function used here to represent the rs changes with co2 concentration was developed by yang et al 2019 and has the same response coefficient value for all vegetation types however many observation based studies have found that the response of plant stomatal conductance to elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations can vary significantly among different vegetation types medlyn et al 2001 lin et al 2015 gardner et al 2022 second although the fao 56 penman monteith equation is widely used to estimate pet from meteorological data it relies on several assumptions that may introduce uncertainties in the estimated pet values two such assumptions are the uniform spatial distribution of assumed vegetation and land surface albedo vegetation types and land surface albedo can vary significantly in space and time depending on various environmental conditions such as soil properties and climate liang et al 1998 harrison and prentice 2003 zhang et al 2012 nie et al 2019 third this study did not consider the co2 fertilization effect on vegetation many studies have reported that the elevated co2 can increase vegetation productivity by stimulating photosynthesis reducing stomatal conductance and enhancing water use efficiency which could be reflected by increases in vegetation indices gross primary productivity and net primary productivity toreti et al 2020 wang et al 2020 davis et al 2022 considering rs responses to co2 concentration among interspecies and the co2 fertilization effect need to be examined in future studies fourth the selections of different drought indices could introduce uncertainties into the study to examine this issue we compared the co2 effect induced changes in different drought indices including pdsi self calibrated pdsi and spei and found a similar spatial distribution not shown here which suggests that the conclusions are not significantly affected by the choice of drought index overall by comprehensively analyzing the impacts of the co2 effect on pet and drought conditions from a surface resistance perspective our study provides valuable insights into associated applications in drought indices and drought mechanisms 5 conclusions in recognition of the importance of co2 physiological effect this study investigated how the co2 effect influenced the estimations of pet and of drought indices across china by comparing the estimations with and without the co2 effect we found that through increasing rs the co2 effect led to decreased δ pet and increased δ spei and then weakened the estimated drought during 1971 2010 across the country however there were the evident spatial differences within the research domain that a stronger effect showed in northern china while a weaker effect in southern china the derived spatial function relationships of δ pet δ spei with ρ c o 2 and climatological conditions at each time scale suggested that the co2 effect induced δ pet δ spei was equal to ρ c o 2 multiplied by the sensitivity of δ pet δ spei to ρ c o 2 which heavily relied on u and s u s and p at last we employed these functions to attribute the spatial differences in impacts of the co2 effect across china generally the stronger weaker impacts on δ pet in northern china except for westernmost part remaining regions could be attributed to higher lower u regarding dominants of δ spei lower higher u was over western part of southern china eastern part of northern china while lower higher p was over northern china except for eastern part eastern part of southern china our study further confirmed that the co2 effect induced increases in rs indeed decrease pet and subsequently ease drought conditions more importantly we found that such impacts vary spatially and are strongly influenced by climatological conditions such as u and p the impacts of co2 effect on pet and drought conditions are stronger in regions with higher u and or lower p these findings highlight the need for region specific assessments of drought risks and vulnerability especially for regions with higher u and or lower p where the drought and drying conditions could be considerably overestimated if the co2 effect is neglected declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

factor and was applied to attribute changes including linear trends and anomalies in hydrological variables and drought indices on national and regional scales therefore this method was employed here for attributing d δ pet and d δ spei three and four sensitivity experiments for attributing d δ pet and d δ spei respectively were performed based on their influential factors and eqs 6 and 8 taking sensitivity experiment of d δ pet i e exp d δ p e t x x is for u s and ρ c o 2 as an example the x factor value was replaced by xcn and other factors remained original values afterward the contribution of each factor to d δ pet was estimated at each grid using the separation algorithm below with the assumption that the differences between x original value and xcn induced exp d δ p e t x d δ pet at a given grid an equation can be established as follows a1 i x n c i δ pet e x p d δ p e t x 1 n j 1 n δ pet j e x p d δ p e t x where k x n c i represents the sum d δ pet contributed from the influential factors excluding x factor n is the number of sensitivity experiments of d δ pet here being 3 n is the number of grids across china here being 1433 and the right term of eq a1 denotes exp d δ p e t x d δ pet thus we could get a set of simultaneous equations with three unknown numbers i e c u c s and c ρ c o 2 by solving these equations the respective contribution for each factor to d δ pet was obtained as follows a2 c k i x n δ pet e x p d δ p e t i 1 n j 1 n δ pet j e x p d δ p e t i n 1 n 2 δ pet e x p d δ p e t k 1 n j 1 n δ pet j e x p d δ p e t k n 1 the aforementioned algorithm could also be employed for attributing d δ spei however it should be noted that n should be changed as 4 because 4 factors influenced d δ spei the validation of this method was shown in fig s2 while the estimated contributions of each factor to d δ pet and d δ spei could be found in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively lastly by comparing the contributions of each factor the dominants of d δ

1839,the jing river is a secondary tributary of the yellow river which flows through the middle of the loess plateau in china severe water scarcity and soil erosion in the basin have threatened sustainable social and economic development to assess and solve the region s water resource problems it is important to understand its historical hydrological climate change accordingly we used five machine learning models and simple linear regression to reconstruct the january june streamflow of the jing river based on the tree ring width of pinus tabulaeformis and pinus armandii by combining six models into an ensemble streamflow reconstruction we obtained a more accurate reconstruction and streamflow variability information than with a single model over the past nearly four centuries the jing river has experienced seven high streamflow periods and ten low streamflow periods the main atmospheric forcing factors driving the streamflow variability are the pacific decadal oscillation and the el niño southern oscillation which regulate the climate and hydrology of the region by affecting water vapor fluxes and the asian monsoon the different climate scenarios revealed the continued reduction in the future jing river streamflow and a worsening water resource situation this new streamflow reconstruction can serve as a valuable reference for analyzing regional hydrology and informing water resource management and policy formulations keywords tree rings machine learning streamflow reconstruction jing river 1 introduction semi humid to semi arid regions are susceptible to the effects of global climate change on water resources the water problems in these regions are becoming more serious and frequent posing a significant threat to the sustainable development of society and economy di baldassarre et al 2019 guo shen 2015 haile et al 2020 rivers are one of the direct water sources for human production activities milner et al 2017 therefore it is important to accurately assess streamflow variations to manage water resources and plan and assess flood risk dawadi ahmad 2012 eum et al 2012 however long term and high quality hydrological instrumental records are usually limited to the last century cook et al 2013 li et al 2022 this creates uncertainty and limitations when exploring streamflow variability over historical periods especially in areas with poor spatial and temporal data coverage consequently comprehensive understanding of the natural streamflow variability at long interannual and interdecadal time scales has become particularly urgent tree rings regulated by environmental factors can provide an annual proxy for reconstruct hydrology and climate change over historical periods büntgen et al 2010 razavi et al 2015 in particular tree rings can be used to capture variations in river streamflow in areas strongly affected by precipitation chen et al 2021 from there long term seasonal or annual streamflow records is constructed to analyze the periodicity and the tendency to understand the dynamic variability of water resources hwang et al 2021 studies based on tree rings have been widely used to obtain information on past streamflow variations ballesteros canovas et al 2020 chen et al 2022 ferrero et al 2015 gangopadhyay et al 2022 martin et al 2019 mokria et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 yang et al 2011 of particular interest is the complex nonlinear relationships between tree rings and streamflow and climate variables hughes ammann 2009 application of traditional transfer function and linear regression may not adequately address the complexity in areas with intense human activities and complex climate variability it may not be possible to establish more accurate connections briffa 2000 however they are widely used in reconstruction studies for their advantages of simple structure and high modeling efficiency d arrigo et al 2001 fang et al 2012 under these circumstances more advanced and effective modeling methods are needed to accurately and reliably reconstruct streamflow with the successful introduction of machine learning algorithms from artificial intelligence science in dendrochronological studies reconstruction methods have been extended and improved in recent years fang li 2019 jevšenak and levanič 2016 in particular the nonparametric methods such as long short term memory lstm nasreen et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 random forest rf li et al 2019a zhao et al 2022 and artificial neural network ann salehnia ahn 2022 zhang et al 2000 algorithms have been applied to overcome the limitations of traditional linear models bring higher accuracy and extensibility nevertheless their application of nonparametric methods is restrictive and the single algorithm is not universally applicable in every tree ring reconstruction the information contained in models built using different algorithms can vary making it difficult to interpretation complex relationships among variables sahour et al 2021 therefore further exploration and development of non parametric methods are still needed to evaluate the overall performance and reliability of multiple machine learning models in tree ring reconstruction the jing river is the wei river s primary tributary and the yellow river s secondary tributary in the middle of the loess plateau the jing river streamflow in the densely population basin is mainly influenced by precipitation under rainfed or mixed rain zheng et al 2019 the basin is densely populated and water resource are the basis for agricultural and industrial activities zhao et al 2019 since the 20th century the ecological environment has been experienced symptoms of fragility due to the influences of global climate change and human activities huang et al 2021 regional water resources variations showed a fluctuating downward trend and are accompanied by frequent floods and droughts influenced by the east asian summer monsoon easm xu et al 2015 these changes represent a critical challenge to human safety and threatens agricultural and hydraulic engineering infrastructure short term streamflow records limit our understanding of the hydrological characteristics and climate change mechanisms in the jing river basin and extended records of long term streamflow are an imperative current requirement hu et al 2021 relatively few efforts have been made to reconstruct the climate or hydrology of the jing river from tree rings so the current availability of streamflow records are insufficient for analyzing patterns of streamflow variation in the basin over historical periods to this end we applied multiple machine learning model ensembles to develop a reconstruction of the average streamflow of the jing river in the loess plateau the main objectives of this study are to 1 reconstruct the streamflow variation of the jing river over the past four centuries using ensemble machine learning algorithms and linear regression models based on tree ring width as a proxy 2 analyze the periodicity variation of the jing river streamflow and estimate future trends 3 explore the correlation between tree ring growth and hydrological climate change and 4 identify the connection between streamflow variation and large scale climate forcing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jing river originates from the eastern foot of the liupan mountains flows through ningxia gansu and shaanxi merges with wei river at xi an and eventually empties into the western pacific ocean gao et al 2020 the jing river is 455 10 km long and has a watershed area of 45 421 km2 with tributaries that form a fan shaped distribution fig 1 a the study area straddles the semi humid and semi arid zones and has a temperate continental monsoon climate with hot summers and cold winters xu et al 2022 the multi year mean of annual precipitation in the basin is 478 5 mm fluctuating from 324 6 mm to 691 9 mm precipitation is mainly concentrated in june september accounting for 68 07 of the annual total the average multi year temperature is 8 94 c with high temperatures in summer and often below 0 c in winter fig 1b 2 2 hydrometeorological and cmip6 simulation data there are a large number of missing data from the three meteorological stations near the basin especially from 1933 to 1955 therefore we collected a

year window revealed a significant decreasing trend and the stable after 1986 fig 1c the average sliding variance from 1933 to 1986 was 444 83 m3 s while it decreased to 99 40 m3 s in 1987 2012 moreover hydraulic projects within the jing river basin increased rapidly after the 1980 s the construction of a large number of reservoirs allowed the seasonal streamflow to be redistributed improving the dry season streamflow and reducing the frequency of floods the application of dendrochronology to reconstruct streamflow in historical periods should follow the principle of proceeding without human interference liu et al 2020 therefore we truncated the instrumental streamflow record and treated the post 1987 jing river streamflow as not the natural situation the 1933 1986

simulations pr precipitation rate all phases mm day 1 and mrro total runoff including drainage through the base of the soil model mm day 1 although limited by the need to provide pr and mrro variables and four ssps scenarios for each model nine models provided a consistent number of integrated members before using the models to calculate streamflow and precipitation we downscaled the data to 0 5 0 5 grid used a bilinear interpolation method di virgilio et al 2022 the cdo library was also applied to extract the nc data pr and mrro for an average based on the jing river basin shapefiles to remove the uncertainty of individual patterns and filter out noisy signals we applied the multi model ensemble mme and extracted the nonlinear trends from it using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd xu et al 2021 the mme trends changes of the variables were then calculated after calibration bias processing here we calculated standardized scores for each runoff simulation using the mean value and standard deviation historical and ssps experiment and then scaled these standardized scores in m3 s using the streamflow mean value and standard deviation for 1933 1986 as the base period rao et al 2020 finally the streamflow anomalies was obtained for the period 2015 2100 according to the mean value of the base period 2 3 tree ring chronology development tree ring samples were collected from two different locations in the jing river basin table 1 the tree species were pinus tabulaeformis zwl and pinus armandii kt two cores were taken from each tree using increment borers the tree ring samples were fixed in wooden supports and then naturally air dried and sanded according to basic analysis procedures stokes smiley 1968 each tree ring width was measured using the cdendro 9 4 analysis system cross dating was performed using the cofecha program holmes 1983 to obtain highly accurate data on tree age and ring width the arstan program cook 1985 was applied to generate chronologies of the two sites after comparative analysis the negative exponential function was used to eliminate tree growth trends as the tree species in the chronology of the two sites differed we examined the consistency of their responses to climate the correlations of pinus tabulaeformis and pinus armandii with climate factors were very close and trended similarly from october of the previous year to october of the current year which allowed for the combined analysis moreover the close linear distance 187 22 km and high correlation kt and zwl r 0 54 p 0 01 between the two sampling sites combined the two chronologies into one regional chronology the standard version of the regional chronology rc was selected for subsequent analysis in order to better preserve the climate signal in tree growth the statistical characteristics of the rc revealed the reliability and the stronger climate response of the chronology the express population signal eps value above 0 85 and sample cores above 6 was chosen as the threshold to establish the reliable period of the rc in the period 1615 2013 fig 2 2 4 machine learning model and streamflow reconstruction the algorithms rf k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm gradient boosting regression trees gbrt extreme gradient boosting xgboost and simple linear regression slr were included in the reconstruction the svm is a class of generalized linear classifier that performs binary classification of data in a supervised learning manner where the decision boundary is the maximum margin hyperplane solved for the learned samples vapnik et al 1995 the knn was used to determine the class of unknown samples and the distance between unlabeled samples and all labeled samples is calculated according to the nearest neighbor rule with all samples of known class as reference cover hart 1967 according to the majority voting rule the unmarked samples and the samples closest to k were grouped into a category with a larger share of the categories garcía laencina et al 2009 the rf is based on an improved decision tree with better tolerance for outliers and noise handling it was considered as a representative integrated learning breiman 2001 the gbrt employs base learner training for each layer to give higher weights to the samples wrongly divided by the previous layer of base learners improving on the errors at each layer of base learners friedman 2001 the simulation results were finally weighted according to the output of each layer of base learners zounemat kermani et al 2021 the xgboost is an efficient and improved implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm the algorithm integrates multiple weak learners into a single stronger learner decision tree the result of each learner is the difference between the target value and the predicted result of all previous decision trees with the final output is obtained by summing all the results resulting in improved overall model effect chen guestrin 2016 the slr is one of the traditional regression methods which uses linear relationships between variables to construct functional relations for predicting the output weisberg 2005 since the different algorithms have independent parameters we subjected each model s algorithm to hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best fit and prediction for regression all machine learning models are modeled based on the python 3 scikit learn library and the parameter settings of each model are shown in table 3 to assess performance and differences between models various performance evaluation metrics were used for calibration and validation of each model including pearson correlation coefficients r explained variance r2 reduction in error re product means test pmt sign test st nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lognse and root mean square error rmse to show the low frequency variability of the streamflow we calculated 21 years of the low pass filter spatial correlation analysis was performed to demonstrate the spatial significance of the reconstruction the multi taper method mtm therrell et al 2006 and wavelet analysis torrence compo 1998 were used to evaluate the periodicity structure of the reconstruction an 850 hpa water vapor flux analysis was implemented using ncar command language ncl for five extreme drought and flood events selected during the period 1950 2013 to demonstrate the connection between the reconstructions and atmospheric circulation patterns the structural content of this study is described in fig 3 the prepared tree ring width and hydro climatic data were subjected to statistical and correlation analysis and the months with significant correlation between tree ring and streamflow r 0 65 were selected for reconstruction the model was further constructed and its hyperparameters were optimizated to produce simulation results for the base period here performance metrics were used to assess the performance capability of the model and the results derived from the model were pooled and averaged the generated series were used to analyze streamflow variation characteristics regional reconstruction comparison and driving mechanism 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic and tree growth response analysis the rc chronology was negatively correlated with temperature from november of the previous year to september of the current year but only the months from may to july reached significance p 0 05 fig 4 this phenomenon demonstrates that drought stress caused by high temperatures had a passive effect on the trees dotzler et al 2015 the soil near the sampling site is shallow and has a little capacity to retain water the pet was much higher than the actual evaporation and the tree growth was more sensitive to the water demand drought caused by insufficient water plays a more important role in tree growth the same detrimental effect of temperature on tree growth was also found in studies in the surrounding areas liu et al 2009 yang et al 2013 the precipitation from october of the previous year to august of the current year positively affected tree growth in the study area and the influence was amplified in april and may fig 4 the abundance of precipitation brought by the rainy season raised the soil water content and relieved pet depletion caused by abnormally high temperatures sabaté et al 2002 notably the positive correlation between winter precipitation and tree growth was reflected through indirect effects clarke et al 2005 while winter does not provide ideal conditions for tree growth it promotes storing of meltwater and nutrients which are essential for earlywood formation the following year williams et al 2015 winter and spring streamflow demonstrated a significant positive correlation with tree rings p 0 01 fig 4 most coniferous tree growth in northern china depends on water limitation with trees using their root systems to absorb water from the surface and vertical infiltration of soil groundwater cheng et al 2021 when winter temperatures drop precipitation is stored at the surface in the form of snow nijssen et al 2001 that prepares the ground for the following spring when the snow melts to recharge river and soil moisture thus providing sufficient water for tree growth along with the increased precipitation and rising temperature in june the warm and humid climate positively contributes to the formation of tree rings the correlation of monthly combinations revealed the connection between climate and the streamflow while the strongest correlation between the rc and january june streamflow was found r 0 65 p 0 01 reconstruction of low streamflow periods january june are more likely to reflect extreme streamflow changes during historical periods in particular within watersheds with developed agricultural production the variation in low river streamflow periods is important for water resources regulation and allocation accordingly the jing river streamflow from january to june was the best predictor variable of the reconstruction 3 2 streamflow reconstruction the slr has the advantage of being easy to understand and interpret and the machine learning algorithms can effectively learn the non linear regression relationships exhibited by tree growth with hydroclimatic factors khan et al 2020 however overfitting in machine learning models degrades the predictive power which usually occurs when the model is complex e g too many parameters cross validation is a powerful approach to prevent overfitting of machine learning models calibration and validation period are divided with a time point of 1966 60 of the sample size in all training models the rc was the feature variable x and january june jing river streamflow was the predictor variable y the comparisons were performed using instrumental data and the reconstruction to evaluate the capability of the six models fig 5 the slr equations are as follows y 30 73 x 3 30 during calibration and validation the instrumental data and reconstruction matched well table 4 the correlation coefficients r and explained variances r2 of the rf xgboost and gbrt models were higher indicating that these models were more realistic the svm and slr models revealed large errors in the rmse and the nse performance in contrast the nse values of the rf xgboost and gbrt models all reached above 0 70 illustrating that the simulation results were satisfactory for the st the knn model displayed superior consistency at low frequency variations all six models passed the pmt and re value tests conveying that the reconstructed models are reasonable and dependable the rf model outperformed all the other models on lognse illustrating its ability to perform on extremely low streamflow data although the rf xgboost and gbrt models showed better results in comprehensive performance it might represent a marginal superiority for the extreme events indicated by the reconstructed sequences and the driving mechanisms of drought and flood changes in the study area we cannot obtain all the information from individual model consequently the results of the six models with highest correlations were averaged to obtain the new ensemble reconstruction series for further analysis table 5 this preserved more information and reduced the uncertainty of the ensemble reconstruction 3 3 streamflow characteristics of the ensemble reconstruction to investigate the extreme high and low streamflow years among the reconstructed data we chose the upper 95 quantile and lower 5 quantile as the high and low streamflow years respectively table 6 o brien and burn 2014 in addition dry wet period was detected if the low pass filtered reconstructed values were continuously below above the long term average for 10 years büntgen et al 2008 during the past 399 years 20 extreme high and low streamflow years occurred in the jing river basin respectively fig 6 dry periods occurred in 1631 1646 1681 1691 1704 1735 1762 1776 1825 1836 1873 1884 1893 1918 1925 1947 1973 1983 and 1990 2004 whereas wet periods occurred during the periods 1647 1680 1692 1703 1746 1761 1777 1805 1812 1824 1837 1860 and 1958 1972 the mtm analysis identified two major periodicities in the reconstruction 22 year and 2 5 year cycles at the 0 05 significance level fig 7 a the wavelet analysis results support many of the conclusions of the mtm analysis and demonstrate that the most significant periodicity occurred at 22 year fig 7b in addition the cru self calibrated pdsi grid data 1933 2013 showed a high spatial correlation with the observed 1933 1986 and reconstructed sequences 1933 2013 fig 7c d the regions with the highest correlation values were located in the loess plateau and the central yellow river basin 4 discussion 4 1 regional comparison reconstruction comparisons can be applied to investigate and analyze the spatial and temporal consistency of hydrological climate change at large scales treydte et al 2006 here reconstructed records from different reaches within the yellow river basin are used for comparative analysis fig 8 streamflow reconstructions of the middle yellow river by li et al 2019b and chen et al 2020 the headwaters reconstruction by wang et al 2022 and pdsi reconstruction from the guiqing mountains by fang et al 2010 are included despite some variability in the magnitude of fluctuation there has been synergistic consistency of dry and wet changes in the jing river and other regions within the yellow river basin the wet periods occurred in the 1660 s 1680 s 1730 s 1760 s 1790 s 1820 s 1940 s 1950 s and 1980 s whereas dry periods occurred in the 1640 s 1700 s 1730 s 1870 s 1880 s 1920 s 1930 s and early 20th century though the correlation between the streamflow in the jing river and the headwaters catchment is not strong the common fluctuating pattern gives confidence to our results it is noteworthy that the drought period in the 1630 s to 1640 s was not limited to the yellow river basin but was reflected in the reconstruction of the yangtze river basin where extreme low streamflow was found wu et al 2022 during this period prolonged drought led to frequent famines epidemics and wars which were the main external factors that accelerated the fall of ming dynasty liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 moreover the dingwu famine 1877 1878 that killed millions of people in the northern china was also captured in these reconstructions singh et al 2018 sun et al 2018 hydrological and climatic variations in the basin were not the main factors that dominated the progress and development of civilization but the public signals between them reflect the changes in society similar interannual and interdecadal variations have been found in these records in the middle reaches of the yellow river with slightly different manifestations in the headwaters the variations may result from the origin of the yellow river in the tibetan plateau where regional differences cause precipitation anomalies which are reflected in streamflow variability in the headwaters and midstream regions gobena and gan 2006 wang et al 2020 however common climate patterns at large scales provide similar interdecadal streamflow variability across the basin this is important for improving water resources management and regulation at the basin scale voisin et al 2013 in particular high water supply to agricultural and industrial production sites in the increasingly anthropogenically intensive middle and lower reaches is an important non climatic factor contributing to the declining streamflow liu et al 2020 omer et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 although streamflow has shown a decreasing trend in the yellow river source area in recent years due to global warming the variations in streamflow vary widely between different reaches of the river allen ingram 2002 gou et al 2007 han et al 2019 consequently the long term streamflow in the jing river basin under non anthropogenic disturbance is a more representative record at a wide range of spatial scales 4 2 possible driving forces for jing river streamflow the 22 year and 2 5 year main cycle changes observed in the jing river streamflow are possibly correlated with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the el niño southern oscillation enso respectively this phenomenon was further confirmed by the high correlation of streamflow reconstruction with the pdo shen et al 2006 fig 9 b and the enso cook et al 2008 fig 9c moreover the results of the wavelet analysis explained the apparent inverse phase signals of the streamflow and the pdo on the quasi 22 year scale within the common interval of 1615 1800 and 1900 1988 fig 9d significant inverse phase signals were found for the streamflow and enso on the 2 5 and 48 year time scales fig 9e interestingly the results of both wavelet analyses revealed positive phase relationships on the time scale between 1750 and 1800 reflecting the apparent instability of the phase relationship between the streamflow and the sea air circulation during the reconstruction period the study area is located at the asian summer monsoon boundary and the main source of precipitation is water vapor transport from the pacific ocean maher 2016 multiple studies have shown that easm has exhibited a weakening trend in recent years whereas the frequency of extreme enso events is increasing goodkin et al 2019 ha et al 2012 wang yan 2011 the correlation between the streamflow and global sea surface temperature explains the presence of teleconnection influenced by pdo and enso fig 9a consequently to further understanding the important driving mechanisms of hydrological dynamics in the jing river basin we selected the upper 80 and lower 20 quantile as the extreme high 1964 1967 2002 2012 2013 and low 1960 1973 1995 2000 2005 streamflow years of the enso events from 1950 to 2013 respectively for water vapor flux analysis fig 10 during high streamflow years the warm humid airflow from the pacific ocean influences the hydroclimatic conditions in north central china controlled by anticyclones over the northwest pacific the weaker and southerly subtropical high implies the arrival of a stronger easm which usually corresponds to a negative pdo phase and an enso cold phase chen et al 2015 ionita et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 on the contrary it is influenced by a constantly continental air mass anomaly from the high latitude sources water vapor from the ocean was cut off and weakened to reach the study area usually with drought events corresponding to periods of the positive pdo phase and the warm enso phase sun liu 2019 4 3 water resource management and future streamflow change the jing river basin is located in an ecologically fragile region of the loess plateau and is marred by natural disasters such as droughts and soil erosion bashir et al 2022 he et al 2022 since 1950 afforestation reforestation and pasture restoration policies have been implemented in response to ecological and environmental problems yu et al 2022 moreover the decrease in water resources increase in river sediment content and water pollution continue to be important factors threatening the sustainable development of human in the region stevenson et al 2022 in the yellow river basin and central asia where groundwater and rainfall are the main types of river recharge climate warming has significantly reduced the streamflow bissenbayeva et al 2021 wang and sun 2021 accordingly it is crucial to predict changes in the streamflow of the jing river under future climate scenarios can provide a better understanding of the water resource dynamics the common results of the 10 models revealed the trend of decreasing streamflow for all four future climate scenarios by the end of the 21st century relative to the historical period the streamflow is expected to decrease by approximately 16 33 24 68 30 33 and 38 33 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios respectively as can be shown from fig 11 the decreasing trend of streamflow was significantly slower under the ssp126 scenario compared with the ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios in addition changes in precipitation under future climate scenarios were strongly correlated with the streamflow the correlations were as high as 0 62 0 41 and 0 38 p 0 01 for the ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios respectively the strong association between streamflow and precipitation was not observed under the ssp245 scenario based on the results if the global warming scenario continues persists to the future the water resources in the jing river basin are expected to continue deteriorating and it is necessary to establish a reasonable streamflow management program 5 conclusion in this study an ensemble streamflow reconstruction based on tree ring widths and six synthesizing models were utilized to display the trends and characteristics of the jing river over the past four centuries the statistical analysis of the models showed that the five machine learning algorithms were superior to the simple linear regression the ensemble reconstruction reduced the uncertainty of individual model results and carried more detailed information during the 1615 2013 period the jing river streamflow experienced ten dry periods and seven wet periods with the main periodicities at the frequency of 22 and 2 5 years the reconstruction was not only representative of the dry and wet variability over a large area of the loess plateau but also revealed that pdo and enso are important drivers of the hydrological variability in the jing river basin by the end of 21st century the predicted future climate scenarios showed a decreasing trend in the streamflow of the jing river the development of scientifically sound water resource management plans is an immediate need tree growth and river streamflow should be understood as a nonlinear relationship machine learning algorithms have great advantage for processing non linear factors it is desirable that the development of a reconstruction is not be limited to single indicator but can include meteorological factors in the range of model variables essential to optimize the accuracy of the reconstruction results this paper provides preliminary analysis of the application of machine learning to tree ring reconstruction and presents reference data for further depth regional studies on the hydrological and climate variability along the jing river basin streamflow data availability the streamflow

1839,the jing river is a secondary tributary of the yellow river which flows through the middle of the loess plateau in china severe water scarcity and soil erosion in the basin have threatened sustainable social and economic development to assess and solve the region s water resource problems it is important to understand its historical hydrological climate change accordingly we used five machine learning models and simple linear regression to reconstruct the january june streamflow of the jing river based on the tree ring width of pinus tabulaeformis and pinus armandii by combining six models into an ensemble streamflow reconstruction we obtained a more accurate reconstruction and streamflow variability information than with a single model over the past nearly four centuries the jing river has experienced seven high streamflow periods and ten low streamflow periods the main atmospheric forcing factors driving the streamflow variability are the pacific decadal oscillation and the el niño southern oscillation which regulate the climate and hydrology of the region by affecting water vapor fluxes and the asian monsoon the different climate scenarios revealed the continued reduction in the future jing river streamflow and a worsening water resource situation this new streamflow reconstruction can serve as a valuable reference for analyzing regional hydrology and informing water resource management and policy formulations keywords tree rings machine learning streamflow reconstruction jing river 1 introduction semi humid to semi arid regions are susceptible to the effects of global climate change on water resources the water problems in these regions are becoming more serious and frequent posing a significant threat to the sustainable development of society and economy di baldassarre et al 2019 guo shen 2015 haile et al 2020 rivers are one of the direct water sources for human production activities milner et al 2017 therefore it is important to accurately assess streamflow variations to manage water resources and plan and assess flood risk dawadi ahmad 2012 eum et al 2012 however long term and high quality hydrological instrumental records are usually limited to the last century cook et al 2013 li et al 2022 this creates uncertainty and limitations when exploring streamflow variability over historical periods especially in areas with poor spatial and temporal data coverage consequently comprehensive understanding of the natural streamflow variability at long interannual and interdecadal time scales has become particularly urgent tree rings regulated by environmental factors can provide an annual proxy for reconstruct hydrology and climate change over historical periods büntgen et al 2010 razavi et al 2015 in particular tree rings can be used to capture variations in river streamflow in areas strongly affected by precipitation chen et al 2021 from there long term seasonal or annual streamflow records is constructed to analyze the periodicity and the tendency to understand the dynamic variability of water resources hwang et al 2021 studies based on tree rings have been widely used to obtain information on past streamflow variations ballesteros canovas et al 2020 chen et al 2022 ferrero et al 2015 gangopadhyay et al 2022 martin et al 2019 mokria et al 2018 woodhouse et al 2016 yang et al 2011 of particular interest is the complex nonlinear relationships between tree rings and streamflow and climate variables hughes ammann 2009 application of traditional transfer function and linear regression may not adequately address the complexity in areas with intense human activities and complex climate variability it may not be possible to establish more accurate connections briffa 2000 however they are widely used in reconstruction studies for their advantages of simple structure and high modeling efficiency d arrigo et al 2001 fang et al 2012 under these circumstances more advanced and effective modeling methods are needed to accurately and reliably reconstruct streamflow with the successful introduction of machine learning algorithms from artificial intelligence science in dendrochronological studies reconstruction methods have been extended and improved in recent years fang li 2019 jevšenak and levanič 2016 in particular the nonparametric methods such as long short term memory lstm nasreen et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 random forest rf li et al 2019a zhao et al 2022 and artificial neural network ann salehnia ahn 2022 zhang et al 2000 algorithms have been applied to overcome the limitations of traditional linear models bring higher accuracy and extensibility nevertheless their application of nonparametric methods is restrictive and the single algorithm is not universally applicable in every tree ring reconstruction the information contained in models built using different algorithms can vary making it difficult to interpretation complex relationships among variables sahour et al 2021 therefore further exploration and development of non parametric methods are still needed to evaluate the overall performance and reliability of multiple machine learning models in tree ring reconstruction the jing river is the wei river s primary tributary and the yellow river s secondary tributary in the middle of the loess plateau the jing river streamflow in the densely population basin is mainly influenced by precipitation under rainfed or mixed rain zheng et al 2019 the basin is densely populated and water resource are the basis for agricultural and industrial activities zhao et al 2019 since the 20th century the ecological environment has been experienced symptoms of fragility due to the influences of global climate change and human activities huang et al 2021 regional water resources variations showed a fluctuating downward trend and are accompanied by frequent floods and droughts influenced by the east asian summer monsoon easm xu et al 2015 these changes represent a critical challenge to human safety and threatens agricultural and hydraulic engineering infrastructure short term streamflow records limit our understanding of the hydrological characteristics and climate change mechanisms in the jing river basin and extended records of long term streamflow are an imperative current requirement hu et al 2021 relatively few efforts have been made to reconstruct the climate or hydrology of the jing river from tree rings so the current availability of streamflow records are insufficient for analyzing patterns of streamflow variation in the basin over historical periods to this end we applied multiple machine learning model ensembles to develop a reconstruction of the average streamflow of the jing river in the loess plateau the main objectives of this study are to 1 reconstruct the streamflow variation of the jing river over the past four centuries using ensemble machine learning algorithms and linear regression models based on tree ring width as a proxy 2 analyze the periodicity variation of the jing river streamflow and estimate future trends 3 explore the correlation between tree ring growth and hydrological climate change and 4 identify the connection between streamflow variation and large scale climate forcing 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the jing river originates from the eastern foot of the liupan mountains flows through ningxia gansu and shaanxi merges with wei river at xi an and eventually empties into the western pacific ocean gao et al 2020 the jing river is 455 10 km long and has a watershed area of 45 421 km2 with tributaries that form a fan shaped distribution fig 1 a the study area straddles the semi humid and semi arid zones and has a temperate continental monsoon climate with hot summers and cold winters xu et al 2022 the multi year mean of annual precipitation in the basin is 478 5 mm fluctuating from 324 6 mm to 691 9 mm precipitation is mainly concentrated in june september accounting for 68 07 of the annual total the average multi year temperature is 8 94 c with high temperatures in summer and often below 0 c in winter fig 1b 2 2 hydrometeorological and cmip6 simulation data there are a large number of missing data from the three meteorological stations near the basin especially from 1933 to 1955 therefore we collected a gridded data from the climate research unit cru 4 04 harris et al 2020 time series ts averaged over the 34 38 n 106 109 e with spatial resolution of 0 5 x 0 5 for the period between 1933 and 2013 https climexp knmi nl these included monthly mean temperature temp and precipitation pre monthly mean maximum temperature tmax monthly mean minimum temperature tmin palmer drought severity index pdsi and potential evapotranspiration pet data the monthly streamflow data were obtained from the zhangjiashan station which is located in the lower reaches of the jing river 34 63 n 108 60 e 1933 2012 480 02 m a s l the location and type of measurements made at the hydrological station did not change during the streamflow observation period the sliding average variance and the annual streamflow with 10 year window revealed a significant decreasing trend and the stable after 1986 fig 1c the average sliding variance from 1933 to 1986 was 444 83 m3 s while it decreased to 99 40 m3 s in 1987 2012 moreover hydraulic projects within the jing river basin increased rapidly after the 1980 s the construction of a large number of reservoirs allowed the seasonal streamflow to be redistributed improving the dry season streamflow and reducing the frequency of floods the application of dendrochronology to reconstruct streamflow in historical periods should follow the principle of proceeding without human interference liu et al 2020 therefore we truncated the instrumental streamflow record and treated the post 1987 jing river streamflow as not the natural situation the 1933 1986 streamflow was used as the base period for the reconstruction analysis to avoid possible spurious results due to anthropogenic disturbances the diagnostic outputs of the climate models were downloaded from the cmip6 the phase six of the coupled model intercomparison project database https esgf node llnl gov search cmip6 four shared socioeconomic pathways ssps climate scenarios from scenario mip 1850 2100 were chosen to account for the likelihood and uncertainties of future climate change compared to representative concentration pathways rcps ssps are new emission scenarios driven by

simulations pr precipitation rate all phases mm day 1 and mrro total runoff including drainage through the base of the soil model mm day 1 although limited by the need to provide pr and mrro variables and four ssps scenarios for each model nine models provided a consistent number of integrated members before using the models to calculate streamflow and precipitation we downscaled the data to 0 5 0 5 grid used a bilinear interpolation method di virgilio et al 2022 the cdo library was also applied to extract the nc data pr and mrro for an average based on the jing river basin shapefiles to remove the uncertainty of individual patterns and filter out noisy signals we applied the multi model ensemble mme and extracted the nonlinear trends from it using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd xu et al 2021 the mme trends changes of the variables were then calculated after calibration bias processing here we calculated standardized scores for each runoff simulation using the mean value and standard deviation historical and ssps experiment and then scaled these standardized scores in m3 s using the streamflow mean value and standard deviation for 1933 1986 as the base period rao et al 2020 finally the streamflow anomalies was obtained for the period 2015 2100 according to the mean value of the base period 2 3 tree ring chronology development tree ring samples were collected from two different locations in the jing river basin table 1 the tree species were pinus tabulaeformis zwl and pinus armandii kt two cores were taken from each tree using increment borers the tree ring samples were fixed in wooden supports and then naturally air dried and sanded according to basic analysis procedures stokes smiley 1968 each tree ring width was measured using the cdendro 9 4 analysis system cross dating was performed using the cofecha program holmes 1983 to obtain highly accurate data on tree age and ring width the arstan program cook 1985 was applied to generate chronologies of the two sites after comparative analysis the negative exponential function was used to eliminate tree growth trends as the tree species in the chronology of the two sites differed we examined the consistency of their responses to climate the correlations of pinus tabulaeformis and pinus armandii with climate factors were very close and trended similarly from october of the previous year to october of the current year which allowed for the combined analysis moreover the close linear distance 187 22 km and high correlation kt and zwl r 0 54 p 0 01 between the two sampling sites combined the two chronologies into one regional chronology the standard version of the regional chronology rc was selected for subsequent analysis in order to better preserve the climate signal in tree growth the statistical characteristics of the rc revealed the reliability and the stronger climate response of the chronology the express population signal eps value above 0 85 and sample cores above 6 was chosen as the threshold to establish the reliable period of the rc in the period 1615 2013 fig 2 2 4 machine learning model and streamflow reconstruction the algorithms rf k nearest neighbor knn support vector machine svm gradient boosting regression trees gbrt extreme gradient boosting xgboost and simple linear regression slr were included in the reconstruction the svm is a class of generalized linear classifier that performs binary classification of data in a supervised learning manner where the decision boundary is the maximum margin hyperplane solved for the learned samples vapnik et al 1995 the knn was used to determine the class of unknown samples and the distance between unlabeled samples and all labeled samples is calculated according to the nearest neighbor rule with all samples of known class as reference cover hart 1967 according to the majority voting rule the unmarked samples and the samples closest to k were grouped into a category with a larger share of the categories garcía laencina et al 2009 the rf is based on an improved decision tree with better tolerance for outliers and noise handling it was considered as a representative integrated learning breiman 2001 the gbrt employs base learner training for each layer to give higher weights to the samples wrongly divided by the previous layer of base learners improving on the errors at each layer of base learners friedman 2001 the simulation results were finally weighted according to the output of each layer of base learners zounemat kermani et al 2021 the xgboost is an efficient and improved implementation of the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm the algorithm integrates multiple weak learners into a single stronger learner decision tree the result of each learner is the difference between the target value and the predicted result of all previous decision trees with the final output is obtained by summing all the results resulting in improved overall model effect chen guestrin 2016 the slr is one of the traditional regression methods which uses linear relationships between variables to construct functional relations for predicting the output weisberg 2005 since the different algorithms have independent parameters we subjected each model s algorithm to hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best fit and prediction for regression all machine learning models are modeled based on the python 3 scikit learn library and the parameter settings of each model are shown in table 3 to assess performance and differences between models various performance evaluation metrics were used for calibration and validation of each model including pearson correlation coefficients r explained variance r2 reduction in error re product means test pmt sign test st nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and lognse and root mean square error rmse to show the low frequency variability of the streamflow we calculated 21 years of the low pass filter spatial correlation analysis was performed to demonstrate the spatial significance of the reconstruction the multi taper method mtm therrell et al 2006 and wavelet analysis torrence compo 1998 were used to evaluate the periodicity structure of the reconstruction an 850 hpa water vapor flux analysis was implemented using ncar command language ncl for five extreme drought and flood events selected during the period 1950 2013 to demonstrate the connection between the reconstructions and atmospheric circulation patterns the structural content of this study is described in fig 3 the prepared tree ring width and hydro climatic data were subjected to statistical and correlation analysis and the months with significant correlation between tree ring and streamflow r 0 65 were selected for reconstruction the model was further constructed and its hyperparameters were optimizated to produce simulation results for the base period here performance metrics were used to assess the performance capability of the model and the results derived from the model were pooled and averaged the generated series were used to analyze streamflow variation characteristics regional reconstruction comparison and driving mechanism 3 results 3 1 hydroclimatic and tree growth response analysis the rc chronology was negatively correlated with temperature from november of the previous year to september of the current year but only the months from may to july reached significance p 0 05 fig 4 this phenomenon demonstrates that drought stress caused by high temperatures had a passive effect on the trees dotzler et al 2015 the soil near the sampling site is shallow and has a little capacity to retain water the pet was much higher than the actual evaporation and the tree growth was more sensitive to the water demand drought caused by insufficient water plays a more important role in tree growth the same detrimental effect of temperature on tree growth was also found in studies in the surrounding areas liu et al 2009 yang et al 2013 the precipitation from october of the previous year to august of the current year positively affected tree growth in the study area and the influence was amplified in april and may fig 4 the abundance of precipitation brought by the rainy season raised the soil water content and relieved pet depletion caused by abnormally high temperatures sabaté et al 2002 notably the positive correlation between winter precipitation and tree growth was reflected through indirect effects clarke et al 2005 while winter does not provide ideal conditions for tree growth it promotes storing of meltwater and nutrients which are essential for earlywood formation the following year williams et al 2015 winter and spring streamflow demonstrated a significant positive correlation with tree rings p 0 01 fig 4 most coniferous tree growth in northern china depends on water limitation with trees using their root systems to absorb water from the surface and vertical infiltration of soil groundwater cheng et al 2021 when winter temperatures drop precipitation is stored at the surface in the form of snow nijssen et al 2001 that prepares the ground for the following spring when the snow melts to recharge river and soil moisture thus providing sufficient water for tree growth along with the increased precipitation and rising temperature in june the warm and humid climate positively contributes to the formation of tree rings the correlation of monthly combinations revealed the connection between climate and the streamflow while the strongest correlation between the rc and january june streamflow was found r 0 65 p 0 01 reconstruction of low streamflow periods january june are more likely to reflect extreme streamflow changes during historical periods in particular within watersheds with developed agricultural production the variation in low river streamflow periods is important for water resources regulation and allocation accordingly the jing river streamflow from january to june was the best predictor variable of the reconstruction 3 2 streamflow reconstruction the slr has the advantage of being easy to understand and interpret and the machine learning algorithms can effectively learn the non linear regression relationships exhibited by tree growth with hydroclimatic factors khan et al 2020 however overfitting in machine learning models degrades the predictive power which usually occurs when the model is complex e g too many parameters cross validation is a powerful approach to prevent overfitting of machine learning models calibration and validation period are divided with a time point of 1966 60 of the sample size in all training models the rc was the feature variable x and january june jing river streamflow was the predictor variable y the comparisons were performed using instrumental data and the reconstruction to evaluate the capability of the six models fig 5 the slr equations are as follows y 30 73 x 3 30 during calibration and validation the instrumental data and reconstruction matched well table 4 the correlation coefficients r and explained variances r2 of the rf xgboost and gbrt models were higher indicating that these models were more realistic the svm and slr models revealed large errors in the rmse and the nse performance in contrast the nse values of the rf xgboost and gbrt models all reached above 0 70 illustrating that the simulation results were satisfactory for the st the knn model displayed superior consistency at low frequency variations all six models passed the pmt and re value tests conveying that the reconstructed models are reasonable and dependable the rf model outperformed all the other models on lognse illustrating its ability to perform on extremely low streamflow data although the rf xgboost and gbrt models showed better results in comprehensive performance it might represent a marginal superiority for the extreme events indicated by the reconstructed sequences and the driving mechanisms of drought and flood changes in the study area we cannot obtain all the information from individual model consequently the results of the six models with highest correlations were averaged to obtain the new ensemble reconstruction series for further analysis table 5 this preserved more information and reduced the uncertainty of the ensemble reconstruction 3 3 streamflow characteristics of the ensemble reconstruction to investigate the extreme high and low streamflow years among the reconstructed data we chose the upper 95 quantile and lower 5 quantile as the high and low streamflow years respectively table 6 o brien and burn 2014 in addition dry wet period was detected if the low pass filtered reconstructed values were continuously below above the long term average for 10 years büntgen et al 2008 during the past 399 years 20 extreme high and low streamflow years occurred in the jing river basin respectively fig 6 dry periods occurred in 1631 1646 1681 1691 1704 1735 1762 1776 1825 1836 1873 1884 1893 1918 1925 1947 1973 1983 and 1990 2004 whereas wet periods occurred during the periods 1647 1680 1692 1703 1746 1761 1777 1805 1812 1824 1837 1860 and 1958 1972 the mtm analysis identified two major periodicities in the reconstruction 22 year and 2 5 year cycles at the 0 05 significance level fig 7 a the wavelet analysis results support many of the conclusions of the mtm analysis and demonstrate that the most significant periodicity occurred at 22 year fig 7b in addition the cru self calibrated pdsi grid data 1933 2013 showed a high spatial correlation with the observed 1933 1986 and reconstructed sequences 1933 2013 fig 7c d the regions with the highest correlation values were located in the loess plateau and the central yellow river basin 4 discussion 4 1 regional comparison reconstruction comparisons can be applied to investigate and analyze the spatial and temporal consistency of hydrological climate change at large scales treydte et al 2006 here reconstructed records from different reaches within the yellow river basin are used for comparative analysis fig 8 streamflow reconstructions of the middle yellow river by li et al 2019b and chen et al 2020 the headwaters reconstruction by wang et al 2022 and pdsi reconstruction from the guiqing mountains by fang et al 2010 are included despite some variability in the magnitude of fluctuation there has been synergistic consistency of dry and wet changes in the jing river and other regions within the yellow river basin the wet periods occurred in the 1660 s 1680 s 1730 s 1760 s 1790 s 1820 s 1940 s 1950 s and 1980 s whereas dry periods occurred in the 1640 s 1700 s 1730 s 1870 s 1880 s 1920 s 1930 s and early 20th century though the correlation between the streamflow in the jing river and the headwaters catchment is not strong the common fluctuating pattern gives confidence to our results it is noteworthy that the drought period in the 1630 s to 1640 s was not limited to the yellow river basin but was reflected in the reconstruction of the yangtze river basin where extreme low streamflow was found wu et al 2022 during this period prolonged drought led to frequent famines epidemics and wars which were the main external factors that accelerated the fall of ming dynasty liu et al 2018 zheng et al 2014 moreover the dingwu famine 1877 1878 that killed millions of people in the northern china was also captured in these reconstructions singh et al 2018 sun et al 2018 hydrological and climatic variations in the basin were not the main factors that dominated the progress and development of civilization but the public signals between them reflect the changes in society similar interannual and interdecadal variations have been found in these records in the middle reaches of the yellow river with slightly different manifestations in the headwaters the variations may result from the origin of the yellow river in the tibetan plateau where regional differences cause precipitation anomalies which are reflected in streamflow variability in the headwaters and midstream regions gobena and gan 2006 wang et al 2020 however common climate patterns at large scales provide similar interdecadal streamflow variability across the basin this is important for improving water resources management and regulation at the basin scale voisin et al 2013 in particular high water supply to agricultural and industrial production sites in the increasingly anthropogenically intensive middle and lower reaches is an important non climatic factor contributing to the declining streamflow liu et al 2020 omer et al 2020 zhao et al 2014 although streamflow has shown a decreasing trend in the yellow river source area in recent years due to global warming the variations in streamflow vary widely between different reaches of the river allen ingram 2002 gou et al 2007 han et al 2019 consequently the long term streamflow in the jing river basin under non anthropogenic disturbance is a more representative record at a wide range of spatial scales 4 2 possible driving forces for jing river streamflow the 22 year and 2 5 year main cycle changes observed in the jing river streamflow are possibly correlated with the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and the el niño southern oscillation enso respectively this phenomenon was further confirmed by the high correlation of streamflow reconstruction with the pdo shen et al 2006 fig 9 b and the enso cook et al 2008 fig 9c moreover the results of the wavelet analysis explained the apparent inverse phase signals of the streamflow and the pdo on the quasi 22 year scale within the common interval of 1615 1800 and 1900 1988 fig 9d significant inverse phase signals were found for the streamflow and enso on the 2 5 and 48 year time scales fig 9e interestingly the results of both wavelet analyses revealed positive phase relationships on the time scale between 1750 and 1800 reflecting the apparent instability of the phase relationship between the streamflow and the sea air circulation during the reconstruction period the study area is located at the asian summer monsoon boundary and the main source of precipitation is water vapor transport from the pacific ocean maher 2016 multiple studies have shown that easm has exhibited a weakening trend in recent years whereas the frequency of extreme enso events is increasing goodkin et al 2019 ha et al 2012 wang yan 2011 the correlation between the streamflow and global sea surface temperature explains the presence of teleconnection influenced by pdo and enso fig 9a consequently to further understanding the important driving mechanisms of hydrological dynamics in the jing river basin we selected the upper 80 and lower 20 quantile as the extreme high 1964 1967 2002 2012 2013 and low 1960 1973 1995 2000 2005 streamflow years of the enso events from 1950 to 2013 respectively for water vapor flux analysis fig 10 during high streamflow years the warm humid airflow from the pacific ocean influences the hydroclimatic conditions in north central china controlled by anticyclones over the northwest pacific the weaker and southerly subtropical high implies the arrival of a stronger easm which usually corresponds to a negative pdo phase and an enso cold phase chen et al 2015 ionita et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 on the contrary it is influenced by a constantly continental air mass anomaly from the high latitude sources water vapor from the ocean was cut off and weakened to reach the study area usually with drought events corresponding to periods of the positive pdo phase and the warm enso phase sun liu 2019 4 3 water resource management and future streamflow change the jing river basin is located in an ecologically fragile region of the loess plateau and is marred by natural disasters such as droughts and soil erosion bashir et al 2022 he et al 2022 since 1950 afforestation reforestation and pasture restoration policies have been implemented in response to ecological and environmental problems yu et al 2022 moreover the decrease in water resources increase in river sediment content and water pollution continue to be important factors threatening the sustainable development of human in the region stevenson et al 2022 in the yellow river basin and central asia where groundwater and rainfall are the main types of river recharge climate warming has significantly reduced the streamflow bissenbayeva et al 2021 wang and sun 2021 accordingly it is crucial to predict changes in the streamflow of the jing river under future climate scenarios can provide a better understanding of the water resource dynamics the common results of the 10 models revealed the trend of decreasing streamflow for all four future climate scenarios by the end of the 21st century relative to the historical period the streamflow is expected to decrease by approximately 16 33 24 68 30 33 and 38 33 under the ssp126 ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios respectively as can be shown from fig 11 the decreasing trend of streamflow was significantly slower under the ssp126 scenario compared with the ssp245 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios in addition changes in precipitation under future climate scenarios were strongly correlated with the streamflow the correlations were as high as 0 62 0 41 and 0 38 p 0 01 for the ssp126 ssp370 and ssp585 scenarios respectively the strong association between streamflow and precipitation was not observed under the ssp245 scenario based on the results if the global warming scenario continues persists to the future the water resources in the jing river basin are expected to continue deteriorating and it is necessary to establish a reasonable streamflow management program 5 conclusion in this study an ensemble streamflow reconstruction based on tree ring widths and six synthesizing models were utilized to display the trends and characteristics of the jing river over the past four centuries the statistical analysis of the models showed that the five machine learning algorithms were superior to the simple linear regression the ensemble reconstruction reduced the uncertainty of individual model results and carried more detailed information during the 1615 2013 period the jing river streamflow experienced ten dry periods and seven wet periods with the main periodicities at the frequency of 22 and 2 5 years the reconstruction was not only representative of the dry and wet variability over a large area of the loess plateau but also revealed that pdo and enso are important drivers of the hydrological variability in the jing river basin by the end of 21st century the predicted future climate scenarios showed a decreasing trend in the streamflow of the jing river the development of scientifically sound water resource management plans is an immediate need tree growth and river streamflow should be understood as a nonlinear relationship machine learning algorithms have great advantage for processing non linear factors it is desirable that the development of a reconstruction is not be limited to single indicator but can include meteorological factors in the range of model variables essential to optimize the accuracy of the reconstruction results this paper provides preliminary analysis of the application of machine learning to tree ring reconstruction and presents reference data for further depth regional studies on the hydrological and climate variability along the jing river basin streamflow data availability the streamflow reconstruction can be obtained from mendeley data repository center http dx doi org 10 17632 ndchfttcnh 1 credit authorship contribution statement xiaoen zhao methodology software visualization
