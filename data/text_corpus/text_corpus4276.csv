21380,the dramatic changes of temperatures ph values dissolved oxygen contents and nutrients typically occur in marine thermocline which are the key factors giving rise to the corrosion of metals exploitation of offshore oil and gas has made marine metals gradually moving into deep sea and increased their penetration into the marine thermocline this study investigates the corrosion of x70 pipeline steel in marine thermocline by simulating seawater thermocline identical to the formation mechanism of marine thermocline specifically the corrosion of x70 pipeline steel was analyzed by means of wire beam electrode wbe technique linear polarization lp corrosion morphology and weight loss measurement results indicated that the steel s galvanic currents increased with experimental time and the galvanic corrosion got worse vertically from the top to the bottom of the marine thermocline simulator corrosion on the upper part of the long steel was due to the temperature and dissolved oxygen in the upper thermocline regime and on the lower part primarily due to the galvanic corrosion in the lower regime the corrosion products of x70 pipeline steel were high valence iron compounds for the high content of dissolved oxygen in upper thermocline layer but low valence iron compounds in the anoxic middle and lower layers the rusts were composed of two layers namely a fluffy outer layer with poor adhesion and a thin inner layer with strong adhesion the inner layer rust of the x70 pipeline was covering a smaller steel area in the lower part of the thermocline for the anodic activation of galvanic corrosion keywords galvanic corrosion simulated marine thermocline pipeline steel dissolved oxygen exploitation of ocean resource 1 introduction there are a number of zones in marine environment as atmospheric splash and spray tidal submerged and bottom sediments to which materials may be exposed and suffer corrosion in marine atmosphere the thin electrolyte layer tel environment is recognized as a severe threat to metal materials with the accompanying short distance of diffusion and increased concentration of salinity the corrosion behavior induced by tel is quite different from that induced by bulk solutions which often results in serious localized corrosion zhang et al 2008 zhou et al 2009 zvirko 2017 the marine tidal zone is a strong corrosion environment leading to severe corrosion of materials such as sheets and other pilings used in seawater harbors for continuous vertical steel strips the most severe corrosion loss named accelerated low water corrosion alwc occurs at around the high water mark and the least in the mid tide zone considerable research attentions are involved in the mechanisms of alwc tan et al 2001 beech and campbell 2008 melchers and jeffrey 2012 melchers et al 2014 james and hattingh 2015 interestingly the deep sea environment is greatly different from the surface seawater environment and is mainly characterized by total absence of sunlight high hydrostatic pressure increasing by 1 atm at each depth interval of 10 m and low water temperature of approximately 3 c apart from the hydrothermal vent fields thus the scientific and business communities increasingly take interest in the great performances of structural materials i e metals and alloys in such environment traverso and canepa 2014 beccaria et al 1995 liu et al 2012 yang et al 2013 thermocline refers to a thin but distinct layer in a large body of fluid e g water such as an ocean or a lake or air such as an atmosphere in which temperature changes more rapidly with depth than it does in the layers above or below ren and riser 2010 alvera azcarate et al 2011 marine thermocline located nearly 30 150 m of water depth exists all year in the tropical and subtropical oceans zhang et al 2012 described by features of high hydrostatic pressure and dramatic changes in the concentrations of dissolved oxygen hydrogen ion ph and nutrients fig 1 paul et al 2007 temperature nevshupa et al 2018 melchers 2014 dissolved oxygen choe and lee 2017 ph value asadi and melchers 2018 and nutrients chaves et al 2016 are important factors of metal corrosion although much effort has been devoted to the research into the corrosion of metal material in marine environment in recent decades very few studies have been dedicated to the corrosion in marine thermocline with the exploitation of offshore oil and gas gradually moving to deep sea more and more marine metal structures such as oil casing run through the thermocline therefore the study of metal corrosion in the oceanic layer is significant in terms of both the theoretical and practical aspects in this study a marine thermocline simulator mts is designed and fabricated according to the formation mechanism of marine thermocline for the purpose of investigating x70 pipeline steel corrosion in that regime leech et al 2013 seawater from the south china sea served as the electrolyte for the creation of a simulated seawater thermocline a removable and chain type wire beam electrode rcwbe was invented to understand corrosion of the steel specimen with the aid of wire beam electrode

of the constructed mts as follows 1 single heat the temperature was 35 c and cold sources the temperature was 5 c located in the upper right portion and bottom section provide the stability of the simulated marine thermocline the forming process of simulated marine thermocline is slow so the temperature distribution of simulated marine thermocline was measured after 10 days fig 3 describes the temperature distribution of simulated marine thermocline after 10 days 2 a few insulation layers were installed on the outside of the mts to reduce the heat transport 3 a thermocouple moving up and down was installed in the mts to monitor the temperature variations the seawater was taken from the south china sea in which the salinity was 33 8 g kg the c din the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen 9 12 0 02 μmol l and the c dip the concentration of dissolved inorganic phosphorus 0 37 0 02 μmol l the seawater was aged for a month in the glass tank before constructing the simulated thermocline in laboratory studies it was not possible to duplicate all the in situ variables then both the simulated and real thermoclines were assumed to exhibit a similar variation rule of seawater quality after the one month aging period 2 2 rcwbe a single electrode from the array of electrodes fig 4 is fabricated from metal coupon rubber ring pvc screw and wires similar to such array the rcwbe was comprised of many individual electrodes with an adjacent separation of 10 cm fig 4 a and b display the two kinds of rcwbe in response to purpose namely a used for electrochemical measurements and b for morphology observation and corrosion weightless rates measurements respectively 2 3 electrochemical measurement the rcwbes were vertically placed in the simulated thermocline where the bottom single electrode was 10 cm above the bottom section from bottom up each electrode was numbered from 1 to 13 with no 13 kept just above the seawater surface in situ measurements for the galvanic currents and lp were carried out at the 5th 10th 15th 20th and 30th days of the simulation period 2 3 1 measurement of rcwbe galvanic currents galvanic currents of the rcwbes were measured by the electrochemical noise ecn method via pgstat302n autolab potentiostat and nova1 11 software two work electrodes w1 w2 and one reference electrode the saturated calomel electrode sce were considered as the ecn measurement a single electrode of one column of rcwbe was connected with w1 while the other electrodes of the same column were simultaneously connected with w2 the ecn of the first single electrode was measured for 30 s and then the electrodes connected with w1 and w2 were replaced subsequently the ecn of the whole rcwbe was measured and the galvanic current of each electrode of the array was determined from the analyzed ecn data as shown in figs 5 and 6 2 3 2 measurement of instantaneous icorr and ecorr subsequently the single electrodes were each subjected under lp on a three electrode cell which was comprised of the single electrode as the working electrode a 2 2 cm2 pt plate as the counter electrode and a sce as the reference electrode the lp curves were measured via potential scanning from 15 to 15 mv against open circuit potentials at the rate of 0 00167 mv s instantaneous values of i corr and e corr of each electrode were obtained from the analysis of the lp data 2 4 morphology observation the b type rcwbe was taken out of the simulated thermocline at the 10th 20th and 30th days of the simulation period and then observed under a stereo microscope zeiss discovery v12 the floating rust of metal coupons was removed following repeated observation of the morphology final observation was conducted after derusting and drying each electrode 2 5 wt loss measurement pre weighed x70 pipeline steel coupons were installed in the b type rcwbes and then immersed in the simulated thermocline succeeding the morphology observation of the coupons they were cleaned with acetone and reweighed the collated weight loss data were used for determining the corrosion rate cr of the x70 pipeline steel as follows c r m g c m 2 y e a r 87500 w a t where w means weight loss mg a is the area contacted with sea water of the coupon cm2 and t represents time h 3 results and discussion 3 1 galvanic corrosion of x70 pipeline steel in simulated thermocline fig 7 a depicts the variation of galvanic current igalv with the number of wbes in the simulated thermocline on the 5th day the galvanic currents of wbes in the lower part of the thermocline were negative while those in the upper part were positive at this stage galvanic corrosion occurred between the upper and lower wbes on the 10th day galvanic corrosion developed anodic and cathodic regions fig 7 b and expanded between the adjacent wbes from the 15th day to the 30th galvanic corrosion occurred between the upper and lower wbes but with the former exhibiting negative currents the location of the anode and the cathode were vertically reversed on the 10th day moreover igalv increased with experimental time from 20 μa cm2 on the 5th day to 150 μa cm2 on the 30th day indicating that the galvanic corrosion gradually worsened vertically from the top to the bottom of the marine thermocline simulator 3 2 instantaneous corrosion behavior of x70 pipeline steel in the simulated thermocline in reference to section 2 3 2 fig 8 describes the instantaneous values of i corr and e corr of x70 pipeline steel in the simulated thermocline fig 8 b depicts the increase in e corr from top to bottom on the 5th day on the 10th and 15th day the difference in the e corr values between the upper and lower single electrodes lessened after 20 days the e corr decreased from top to bottom and the difference of the e corr values showed tendency for increase thus such variation of e corr was consistent with the change of the anode and cathode locations the e corr s of electrodes were approximate each other at the 5th 10th and 15th days after reversing the anode and cathode all electrodes were covered by corrosion products the oxidation of corrosion products propelled the e corr s to increase on the 20th day with the consumption of oxygen the e corr s decreased on the 25th day fig 8 a illustrates the increasing i corr of the single electrodes with experimental time it s interesting that the i corr values of nos 8 to 12 electrodes in the upper part of the simulated thermocline were higher than those of nos 1 to 7 futhermore the electrodes in the upper part became cathodes after 15 days whereas they should have been protected by the anode in the galvanic corrosion system from these results galvanic corrosion was not the primary cause of electrode corrosion in the upper region but most likely in the lower part given that the i corr and i galv for nos 1 to 7 electrodes were considerably equal 3 3 corrosion rate of x70 pipeline steel in the simulated thermocline fig 9 shows the variation in crs of the x70 pipeline steel substrates in the simulated thermocline as a function of thermocline depth note that crs decreased with thermocline depth on the 10th day which infers that the x70 pipeline steel located in the lower part of the thermocline was a cathode and protected by the anode in the galvanic corrosion system before 10 days a substantial difference in the cr of the adjacent coupons was observed in the lower part which prolonged such that the anode and the cathode were reciprocally spaced in the galvanic corrosion on the 20th and 30th days a slight difference of the crs was observable in the lower part and the crs of nos 9 and 10 were particularly smaller than those of the other electrodes galvanic corrosion of wbes in the simulated thermocline occurred between electrode nos 1 through no 8 lower wbes and nos 9 to 12 upper wbes after 10 days more specifically nos 9 to 12 electrodes were cathodes protected by the anodes in the galvanic corrosion system with the stratification of seawater in the simulated thermocline the layer where nos 9 and 10 were located exhibited low content of dissolved oxygen therefore electrode nos 9 and 10 had smaller crs than the other electrodes in contrast the upper layer was characterized by higher temperature and high amount of dissolved oxygen as a result of electrodes nos 11 and 12 having bigger crs 3 4 morphology of x70 pipeline steel in simulated thermocline table 1 presents the morphology of coupons with rust in the simulated thermocline as a function of thermocline depth the corrosion products of no 12 at the top of the simulated thermocline were reddish brown while the others were blackish green or light yellow a stable stratification of seawater existed in the simulated thermocline and only the upper seawater could exchange gas with air based on our experience the reddish brown corrosion products were high valence iron compounds i e feooh and fe2o3 h2o for the high content of dissolved oxygen of the upper seawater regime while the blackish green corrosion products of steel were low valence iron compounds i e fe3o4 and fe oh 2 the middle and lower layers were anoxic environments the x70 pipeline steel sample developed two rust layers namely the outer layer described by fluffy rusts and poor adhesion and thin and strong adhesion of the inner layer rusts in particullar the inner layer rusts of coupons at the lower layers of the simulated thermocline covered a smaller part of the coupon surface than those located at the upper layer in the galvanic corrosion system coupons located at the lower layers were anodes for a long time and most of the coupons surface was activated 4 conclusions offshore oil and gas exploitation enabled their seepage to develop into the deep sea along with the penetration of a growing number of marine metal structures through the thermocline aimed to realize the scientific and practical values of galvanic corrosion in marine thermocline this study searched for the corrosion of x70 pipeline steel through a simulated seawater thermocline designed and fabricated by a developed rcwbe below is a summary of the major findings of this first test study 1 galvanic corrosion occurs after intrusion of the x70 pipeline steel into the marine thermocline in the first 10 days the part of the long x70 pipeline steel located underneath the thermocline was negative and the other part above it was an anode on the 10th day the location of the anode and cathode reversed and the galvanic currents increased with experimental time the galvanic corrosion of the steel got worse vertically 2 galvanic corrosion was the major reason for corrosion of the part of the long x70 pipeline steel below the thermocline in contrast temperature and dissolved oxygen were the corrosion elements on the upper part of thermocline 3 the corrosion products of the x70 pipeline steel were high valence iron compounds owing to high content of dissolved oxygen in the upper thermocline regime hence such products were low valence iron compounds in anoxic middle and lower layers especially the rusts of x70 pipeline steel had two layers namely a fluffy outer layer with poor adhesion and a thin inner layer with strong adhesion besides the steel s inner layer in the lower layers of the thermocline coated a smaller area owing to the anodic activation of galvanic corrosion

21381,the conventional objective of rudder roll stabilization is to control the ship course and roll motion simultaneously nevertheless the ship course control is not competent for advanced requirement nowadays on controlling the position which motivates the present study this paper proposes an efficient model predictive control mpc for path following and roll stabilization of marine vessels by rudder in waves it is a typical underactuated problem with multi objectives in addition the control input is constrained in both amplitude and rate mpc is one of the most favorable solutions for this problem given its capability of solving optimization problem with constraints however there are two major challenges existed in the implementation of mpc i e the computational intensity and closed loop stability in this paper a neurodynamic system based on the projection neural network pnn which is well known for the parallel computational capability is established to optimize the objective function formulated by mpc method thereby improving the computational efficiency the closed loop stability is guaranteed by including a quadratic terminal cost derived from the solution of a lyapunov equation various simulations are conducted to illustrate the advantages of control design proposed herein in which the model uncertainty and wave disturbances are taken into account keywords rudder roll stabilization path following model predictive control neurodynamic optimization 1 introduction wave induced roll motion can cause negative effects on the comfort and stability of ships increasing the risk factor and safety issues in severe environments perez and blanke 2012 yin et al 2018 it is therefore essential to control the roll motion of ship while performing missions in waves especially for containers and naval ships the idea of using a rudder as the stabilizer originates from observations of unusual roll responses of ship under autopilot tests at sea cowley and lambert 1972 1975 when a ship is steered by the rudder the ship heels to its inboard side due to the roll moments caused by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the rudder surface which indicates that yaw roll and rudder motions are coupled with each other thus if the roll responses to rudder could be tuned by an appropriate controller the roll motion can be reduced by the rudder rudder roll stabilization rrs is an attractive solution for reduction of roll motion because no extra devices and spaces are required to a ship amerongen et al 1987 1990 oda et al 1992 1996 perez 2005 kapitanyuk et al 2016 wang et al 2017 conventionally the course control and roll reduction are the two principal control objectives of rrs problem and the rudder is the only available control input in addition both the amplitude and rate of the rudder are constrained due to the saturation of steering machine the rrs problem has attracted considerable attentions from the field of ship motion control because of the possibly economic savings and scientific challenges linear quadratic regulation lqg an optimal method was used to address the issue of multi objectives for rrs by amerongen et al 1987 1990 then the automatic gain controller agc was included to handle the phase lag caused by the constraint of rudder rate taking the multivariate nature of rrs into account oda et al 1992 1996 proposed a control design model based on the multivariate auto regressive mar to predict the motions of yaw and roll and then the optimal control theory was also incorporated into the control design reasonably the optimal control method was chosen by both aforementioned pioneering studies to handle the problem of multi objectives with trade offs in rrs as the development of optimal control theory the model predictive control mpc a modern optimization control method with advantages in dealing with constraints was employed to design the controller for rrs perez et al 2000 2005 nevertheless the course control which is the primary objective of conventional rrs in above studies is not competent for advanced requirement nowadays on controlling the position the regulatory scoping exercise for maritime autonomous surface ships mass was discussed at 100th maritime safety committee msc of the international maritime organization imo on december 2018 the development of mass brings new challenges into the traditional design of ship autopilot it is therefore necessary to extend course control of rrs into path following for missions such as towing cable laying and dredging the objective of path following is to ensure the ship can follow a desired geometric path automatically which is a fundamental marine application for safe navigation and efficient transportation it is a typical underactuated control problem due to lack of the direct sway actuator numerous studies have contributed promising tools and solutions to the path following of underactuated marine vessels ashrafiuon et al 2010 do and pan 2006 li et al 2009 oh and sun 2010 fossen et al 2015 peng and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 in earlier studies nonlinear control theory were favored to be used to tackle the underactuated problem of path following e g the recursive technique proposed for chain systems and the lyapunov based backstepping method jiang and nijmeijer 1999 do and pan 2006 however the forms of the resultant controllers were complex and hence they were not prone to be widely applied recently guidance methods such as line of sight los pure pursuit and constant bearing are popularly incorporated into the control designs of path following for obtaining the practical controllers breivik and fossen 2005 fossen and pettersen 2014 los in particular has been proved to be effective in the control designs of path following of underactuated marine vessels peng et al 2013 fossen et al 2015 caharija et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the fundamental concept of los is that provided a ship can follow the so called los angle which can be calculated delicately by minimizing the cross track error the position of ship would converge to the desired path eventually in this way the control outputs of path following can be reduced into the course control for geometric task and the speed control for dynamic task apparently the los guidance can be added into the traditional autopilot easily serving the purpose to extend the course control into path following all aforementioned literatures focus on either path following or rrs and they are traditionally studied separately in fact the problems of path following and rrs are closely coupled in waves since the roll motion could cause safety issues in operations of path following and actions of path following could also lead to undesirable roll motion fortunately this problem has gained attentions in the field of ship motion control recently taking roll angle as the output constraints the mpc design was proposed for path following of underactuated surface vessels li et al 2009b 2010 to our best knowledge this was the first time that the roll motion control was considered during the design of path following in waves motivated by the li et al 2009b 2010 a robust mpc design was proposed for the problem of path following with roll constraints using the disturbance observer zhang et al 2017 but only the straight line path following was achieved by li et al 2009b 2010 and zhang et al 2017 in order to fulfill the curved line path following of underactuated marine vessels the line of sight los method was incorporated into the mpc design and the roll rate which was an important factor of roll motion together with the roll angle were treated as the control outputs of roll reduction in liu et al 2015 understandably the model predictive control which belongs to optimization control method is the natural solution for extending conventional rrs problem into integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization li et al 2009b 2010 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the basic idea of mpc is to use an explicit model to predict the future responses of plant on a finite horizon and then the control sequence is calculated on line by minimizing the objective function formed by the future responses the first item in the control sequence is then applied and the entire process repeats at subsequent sampling instants mayne 2014 such mechanism enables that 1 the control problem with multi objectives i e path following and roll reduction can be formulated into the standard quadratic programing qp problem 2 the saturation of rudder can be treated as the constraints of control input and can be incorporated into the qp problem naturally 3 the further responses of the yaw and roll motions can be predicted by the control design model and then the control action can be made in advance so most of initial studies of integrated path following and roll stabilization by rudder are based on the standard mpc method li et al 2009b 2010 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 it is worth stressing that the controller using the standard mpc does not guarantee the closed loop stability additionally the mechanism of repeatedly calculating an optimization problem on line for computational reason leads that the standard mpc to be applied mainly into the process control which is rather slow above all the main obstacles of standard mpc to be applied widely are the closed loop stability and the computational requirements sun et al 2007 motivated by the above considerations an efficient mpc design for integrated path following and roll stabilization in which the stability is guaranteed is proposed in this paper a quasi infinite horizon technique is incorporated into the standard mpc design to ensure the closed loop stability chen et al 1998 yu et al 2014 specifically a terminal cost function whose terminal matrix is calculated from an appropriate lyapunov equation is added into the objective function formulated by the standard mpc method the recurrent neural network rnn is considered as a powerful tool for the real time optimization due to the inherent nature of distributed information processing and parallel computing structure hagan et al 2002 in 1980s tank and hopfield proposed a neural network for solving programming problem and implemented on the analog circuits successfully hopfield 1982 1984 which have inspired many researchers to invent other types of neural network for solving problems of both linear and nonlinear programming generally speaking there are three kinds of recurrent neural network for solving optimization problem namely the kennedy chua network the rodríguez vázquez network and the projection neural network pnn the kennedy chua network extends the tank hopfield network by employing a penalty parameter that fulfills the kuhn tucker conditions however it is difficult to apply if the penalty becomes too large kennedy and chua 1988 a switched capacitor neural network for constrained nonlinear optimization problem was therefore presented by rodríguez vázquez 1990 but its solution bounces back and forth in a neighborhood of minimizer considering the significance of stability the projection neural network with single layer structure xia et al 1998 2002 pan and wang 2012 li et al 2015 yan et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which is convenient for implementation is employed in this paper to solve the quadratic problem qp formulated by the quasi infinite horizon mpc method for the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization the main contributions can be summarized as follows 1 the conventional rrs problem is extended into the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization the control problem with multi objectives is then formulated into qp problem within constraints in this way the control objectives of path following and roll stabilization can be realized simultaneously which is more advanced for navigation safety and efficient transportation 2 the closed loop stability which is normally ignored in the design of standard mpc is guaranteed herein using the quasi infinite horizon technique specifically the terminal cost in which the core part the terminal matrix is derived from the solution of the lyapunov equation is incorporated into the objective function formulated by standard mpc 3 a neurodynamic system taking advantage of the parallel structure of pnn is established to handle the computational burden caused by solving the optimization problem repeatedly in the implementation of standard mpc the computational efficiency is then improved significantly that makes the proposed control design more practical this paper is organized as follows

the computational efficiency the neurodynamic optimization is introduced to solve the quadratic problem formulated by the quasi infinite horizon mpc method for path following and roll stabilization the idea of using neural network to solve the optimization problem originates from prominent performance of the neurodynamic optimization particularly it can be applied physically by application specific circuits where the optimization is truly parallel and distributed xia et al 1998 2002 yan et al 2016 the essence of neurodynamic optimization lies in the facts that the optimality conditions could be realized by the recurrent neural network particularly the pnn the main distinction of pnn is with feedback loop which enables that the system established based on the pnn could converge to the optimal solution with appropriately design xia et al 2002 cheng et al 2008 yu et al 2018 the parallel structure of pnn is given in fig 2 it consists of m integrators m processors ω ν and the state variable is defined as follows 4 d ν d t α p ω ν ω ν ν where ν ν 1 ν 2 ν m t r m represents the state vector α 0 denotes a scale parameter and ω ν is assumed to be the continuous symmetric function the projection operator is defined as 5 p ω ν arg min υ ω ν υ where is the l 2 norm of r m in order to prove the stability of system 4 it is required to introduce a few definitions let ν t be a solution of the system ν f ν the equilibrium point ν i e f ν 0 is deemed to be stable in the sense of lyapunov provided that for any ν 0 ν t 0 and scalar ε 0 there exists σ 0 such that if ν t 0 ν σ then ν t ν ε for all t 0 the lyapunov function can be defined by ω 6 v ν 0 1 ν ν t ω ν t ν ν d t because ω is symmertic then it can be obtained 7 d v ν d ν v ν t ω ν where v is the gradient of v then the following relation 8 d v d t d v d ν t d ν d t α ω ν t p ω ν ω ν ν can be deduced because ω ν t p ω ν ω ν ν α p ω ν ω ν ν 2 xia et al 2002 it is found 9 d v d t 0 according to the lyapunov theorem khalil 2002 the neural network 4 is stable i e the proposed neural network is capable to converge to the equilibrium point eventually note that the equilibrium point equals to the solution of optimization problem and it has been analyzed widely xia et al 1998 2002 cheng et al 2008 2 3 problem formulation the path following and roll stabilization by means of rudder is a classical underactuated control problem subject to input saturation it can be first formulated into problem with multi objectives by mpc method to address the trade offs between path following and roll stabilization second the control outputs of path following can be further simplified as the tracking and heading errors by employing the los guidance overall the model of control design can be summarized as follows liu et al 2015 fossen and lauvdal 1994 10 e ψ φ v p r 0 u 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 0 0 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 0 0 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 e ψ φ v p r 0 0

stability the quasi infinite horizon mpc method is employed by adding the terminal cost function into the objective function fourth a neurodynamic optimization system based on pnn is established to solve the objective function formed by the quasi infinite horizon mpc parallelly in this way an efficient mpc controller with guaranteed stability for path following and roll stabilization can be obtained finally in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller a high fidelity 4 dof model of container together with wave model is implemented as simulation model in which the robustness of proposed controller to uncertainties of model and external disturbances are also tested the whole process can be depicted by fig 3 3 controller design the design procedures are characterized by the following key steps first the objective function based on the predicted responses of path following and roll stabilization is designed by virtue of the standard mpc method second the terminal cost designed according to the lyapunov theory is added into the resultant objective function then a neurodynamic system is established to solve the final objective function parallelly

the terminal matrix p in eq 24 remains to be determined a linear state feedback law for eq 11 is first designed 25 δ k ξ where k is obtained by using linear quadratic method with q l and r l as output

effectiveness of the proposed optimization controller for integrated path following and roll stabilization by rudder in waves in order to show advantage of the computational efficiency over liu et al 2015 the comparative studies are also conducted and the simulation condition is set the same as the liu et al 2015 all simulations are conducted on the same 4 dof high fidelity model of container ship s 175 fossen 1994 2011 li et al 2010 liu et al 2015 the rudder angle is set δ 35 deg normally the rudder rate is set δ 2 7 deg s for maneuvering whereas the rate of the modern rudder could be δ 20 deg s for roll stabilization fossen and lauvdal 1994 wave disturbance is simulated by using modified pierson moskowitz spectrum at sea state 5 liu et al 2015 fossen 2011 the weighting matrices on outputs and input are given by q and ℜ where q d i a g p e i n p n p p ψ i n p n p p φ i n p n p p p i n p n p and ℜ i n c n c sampling time is set as t s 0 1 s and the commanded shaft speed is set to n c 70 r p m the parameters of terminal cost function are given by q l d i a g 0 0001 1 1 1 r l 0 1 and κ 0 9976 respectively the projection operator of pnn is set as 36 p ω ω i δ δ max ω i δ δ max ω i δ δ min ω i δ δ max δ δ min ω i δ δ min where ω i δ δ i j δ δ i and the parameter related to the convergent speed is set as α 0 01 4 1 straight line path following and roll stabilization this case aims to investigate the performance of straight line path following and roll stabilization by rudder in which the performances with and without design of roll stabilization are compared for scenario without roll stabilization rrs off the control parameters are set as p e 0 0001 p ψ 1000 p φ 0 p p 0 for scenario with roll stabilization rrs on the control parameters are set as p e 0 0001 p ψ 1000 p φ 1000 p p 1000 the mpc parameters are set as n c 2 n p 60 the performance of straight line path following is given by fig 4 the performance of roll stabilization is given by fig 5 the control input rudder angle is demonstrated in fig 6 it can be seen from figs 4 and 5 the straight line path following can be achieved in both scenarios while the roll angle and roll rate are reduced greatly when rrs is on it can be concluded that the straight line path following and roll stabilization can be achieved by the proposed controller 4 2 curved line path following and roll stabilization the performance of curved line path following and roll stabilization by rudder is investigated in this case the same parameters as section 4 1 are employed the performance of curved line path following is given by fig 7 the performance of roll stabilization in curved line scenario is given by fig 8 fig 9 shows response of the rudder angle in this scenario it can be seen from figs 4 and 7 both straight line and curved line path following are achieved furthermore figs 5 and 8 indicate that the roll angle and roll rate are reduced when the roll stabilization is initiated rrs on and hence the objective of roll reduction is also achieved but it is challenging to show the control performance of roll reduction due to high frequency of roll motion one can appeal to a quantitative method to characterize the performance of roll reduction fossen 1994 37 r o l l r e d u c t i o n a p r r s a p 100 where a p represents standard deviation of the roll angle and roll rate with roll stabilization off rrs off and r r s denotes the standard deviation of the roll angle and roll rate with roll stabilization on rrs on note that the wave disturbance is simulated via the modified pierson moskowitz spectrum in which a random mechanism is included it indicates that the wave disturbance is different in each simulation whereas the sea state is the same i e the same main parameters these aspects imply that they are just slightly different in statistics the results are shown in table 1 to be realistic the numbers except the roll reduction rate in table 1 are the standard deviation over the time period it can be found that roll rate and roll angle are reduced in both straight line and curved line scenarios it can be therefore concluded that the objectives of integrated path following and roll stabilization can be achieved by the proposed optimization controller 4 3 comparative studies on computational time the computational time is one of important factors for real time implementation in this case various simulations are conducted to illustrate advantage of the proposed optimization controller based on pnn from section 4 2 it can be seen that the control performance of proposed optimization controller is equivalent with that of liu et al 2015 liu et al 2015 used fmincon function of matlab to solve the objective function eq 22 and hence there exists a significant computational burden as shown in table 2 this is also one of main motivations to conduct this research in addition to liu et al 2015 other representative optimization techniques such as the quadprog function of matlab and the hopfield neural network are also compared in this case under the same simulation condition these optimization techniques are used to solve the optimization problem of integrated path following and roll stabilization respectively the results of simulation time are given in table 2 it can be concluded that the projection neural network is the most efficient one because of its parallel computing structure characterized by fig 2 note that in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design there is no terminal cost in the objective function in liu et al 2015 and hopfield neural network scenarios while the terminal cost is included in the scenarios of quadprog and pnn 5 conclusions in this paper the conventional rrs problem is extended into the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization which is more advanced for navigation safety and efficient transportation in the control design a neurodynamic optimization system based on pnn is established to solve the objective function formulated by mpc parallelly in this way the computational efficiency of standard mpc is improved significantly the closed loop stability is guaranteed by incorporating the terminal cost function derived from the lyapunov equation into the objective function the simulation results have validated that the controller proposed herein can achieve the objectives of path following and roll stabilization simultaneously the comparative studies have shown the advantages of the proposed controller in efficiency indicating that the proposed mpc design is promising to be used in practical application in future the authors will focus on conducting the investigations on techniques that would help to smooth the rudder motion acknowledgement this work is supported in part by the

21381,the conventional objective of rudder roll stabilization is to control the ship course and roll motion simultaneously nevertheless the ship course control is not competent for advanced requirement nowadays on controlling the position which motivates the present study this paper proposes an efficient model predictive control mpc for path following and roll stabilization of marine vessels by rudder in waves it is a typical underactuated problem with multi objectives in addition the control input is constrained in both amplitude and rate mpc is one of the most favorable solutions for this problem given its capability of solving optimization problem with constraints however there are two major challenges existed in the implementation of mpc i e the computational intensity and closed loop stability in this paper a neurodynamic system based on the projection neural network pnn which is well known for the parallel computational capability is established to optimize the objective function formulated by mpc method thereby improving the computational efficiency the closed loop stability is guaranteed by including a quadratic terminal cost derived from the solution of a lyapunov equation various simulations are conducted to illustrate the advantages of control design proposed herein in which the model uncertainty and wave disturbances are taken into account keywords rudder roll stabilization path following model predictive control neurodynamic optimization 1 introduction wave induced roll motion can cause negative effects on the comfort and stability of ships increasing the risk factor and safety issues in severe environments perez and blanke 2012 yin et al 2018 it is therefore essential to control the roll motion of ship while performing missions in waves especially for containers and naval ships the idea of using a rudder as the stabilizer originates from observations of unusual roll responses of ship under autopilot tests at sea cowley and lambert 1972 1975 when a ship is steered by the rudder the ship heels to its inboard side due to the roll moments caused by the hydrodynamic forces acting on the rudder surface which indicates that yaw roll and rudder motions are coupled with each other thus if the roll responses to rudder could be tuned by an appropriate controller the roll motion can be reduced by the rudder rudder roll stabilization rrs is an attractive solution for reduction of roll motion because no extra devices and spaces are required to a ship amerongen et al 1987 1990 oda et al 1992 1996 perez 2005 kapitanyuk et al 2016 wang et al 2017 conventionally the course control and roll reduction are the two principal control objectives of rrs problem and the rudder is the only available control input in addition both the amplitude and rate of the rudder are constrained due to the saturation of steering machine the rrs problem has attracted considerable attentions from the field of ship motion control because of the possibly economic savings and scientific challenges linear quadratic regulation lqg an optimal method was used to address the issue of multi objectives for rrs by amerongen et al 1987

et al 2010 do and pan 2006 li et al 2009 oh and sun 2010 fossen et al 2015 peng and wang 2018 liu et al 2019 in earlier studies nonlinear control theory were favored to be used to tackle the underactuated problem of path following e g the recursive technique proposed for chain systems and the lyapunov based backstepping method jiang and nijmeijer 1999 do and pan 2006 however the forms of the resultant controllers were complex and hence they were not prone to be widely applied recently guidance methods such as line of sight los pure pursuit and constant bearing are popularly incorporated into the control designs of path following for obtaining the practical controllers breivik and fossen 2005 fossen and pettersen 2014 los in particular has been proved to be effective in the control designs of path following of underactuated marine vessels peng et al 2013 fossen et al 2015 caharija et al 2016 liu et al 2019 the fundamental concept of los is that provided a ship can follow the so called los angle which can be calculated delicately by minimizing the cross track error the position of ship would converge to the desired path eventually in this way the control outputs of path following can be reduced into the course control for geometric task and the speed control for dynamic task apparently the los guidance can be added into the traditional autopilot easily serving the purpose to extend the course control into path following all aforementioned literatures focus on either path following or rrs and they are traditionally studied separately in fact the problems of path following and rrs are closely coupled in waves since the roll motion could cause safety issues in operations of path following and actions of path following could also lead to undesirable roll motion fortunately this problem has gained attentions in the field of ship motion control recently taking roll angle as the output constraints the mpc design was proposed for path following of underactuated surface vessels li et al 2009b 2010 to our best knowledge this was the first time that the roll motion control was considered during the design of path following in waves motivated by the li et al 2009b 2010 a robust mpc design was proposed for the problem of path following with roll constraints using the disturbance observer zhang et al 2017 but only the straight line path following was achieved by li et al 2009b 2010 and zhang et al 2017 in order to fulfill the curved line path following of underactuated marine vessels the line of sight los method was incorporated into the mpc design and the roll rate which was an important factor of roll motion together with the roll angle were treated as the control outputs of roll reduction in liu et al 2015 understandably the model predictive control which belongs to optimization control method is the natural solution for extending conventional rrs problem into integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization li et al 2009b 2010 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the basic idea of mpc is to use an explicit model to predict the future responses of plant on a finite horizon and then the control sequence is calculated on line by minimizing the objective function formed by the future responses the first item in the control sequence is then applied and the entire process repeats at subsequent sampling instants mayne 2014 such mechanism enables that 1 the control problem with multi objectives i e path following and roll reduction can be formulated into the standard quadratic programing qp problem 2 the saturation of rudder can be treated as the constraints of control input and can be incorporated into the qp problem naturally 3 the further responses of the yaw and roll motions can be predicted by the control design model and then the control action can be made in advance so most of initial studies of integrated path following and roll stabilization by rudder are based on the standard mpc method li et al 2009b 2010 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 it is worth stressing that the controller using the standard mpc does not guarantee the closed loop stability additionally the mechanism of repeatedly calculating an optimization problem on line for computational reason leads that the standard mpc to be applied mainly into the process control which is rather slow above all the main obstacles of standard mpc to be applied widely are the closed loop stability and the computational requirements sun et al 2007 motivated by the above considerations an efficient mpc design for integrated path following and roll stabilization in which the stability is guaranteed is proposed in this paper a quasi infinite horizon technique is incorporated into the standard mpc design to ensure the closed loop stability chen et al 1998 yu et al 2014 specifically a terminal cost function whose terminal matrix is calculated from an appropriate lyapunov equation is added into the objective function formulated by the standard mpc method the recurrent neural network rnn is considered as a powerful tool for the real time optimization due to the inherent nature of distributed information processing and parallel computing structure hagan et al 2002 in 1980s tank and hopfield proposed a neural network for solving programming problem and implemented on the analog circuits successfully hopfield 1982 1984 which have inspired many researchers to invent other types of neural network for solving problems of both linear and nonlinear programming generally speaking there are three kinds of recurrent neural network for solving optimization problem namely the kennedy chua network the rodríguez vázquez network and the projection neural network pnn the kennedy chua network extends the tank hopfield network by employing a penalty parameter that fulfills the kuhn tucker conditions however it is difficult to apply if the penalty becomes too large kennedy and chua 1988 a switched capacitor neural network for constrained nonlinear optimization problem was therefore presented by rodríguez vázquez 1990 but its solution bounces back and forth in a neighborhood of minimizer considering the significance of stability the projection neural network with single layer structure xia et al 1998 2002 pan and wang 2012 li et al 2015 yan et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 liu et al 2019 which is convenient for implementation is employed in this paper to solve the quadratic problem qp formulated by the quasi infinite horizon mpc method for the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization the main contributions can be summarized as follows 1 the conventional rrs problem is extended into the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization the control problem with multi objectives is then formulated into qp problem within constraints in this way the control objectives of path following and roll stabilization can be realized simultaneously which is more advanced for navigation safety and efficient transportation 2 the closed loop stability which is normally ignored in the design of standard mpc is guaranteed herein using the quasi infinite horizon technique specifically the terminal cost in which the core part the terminal matrix is derived from the solution of the lyapunov equation is incorporated into the objective function formulated by standard mpc 3 a neurodynamic system taking advantage of the parallel structure of pnn is established to handle the computational burden caused by solving the optimization problem repeatedly in the implementation of standard mpc the computational efficiency is then improved significantly that makes the proposed control design more practical this paper is organized as follows

the computational efficiency the neurodynamic optimization is introduced to solve the quadratic problem formulated by the quasi infinite horizon mpc method for path following and roll stabilization the idea of using neural network to solve the optimization problem originates from prominent performance of the neurodynamic optimization particularly it can be applied physically by application specific circuits where the optimization is truly parallel and distributed xia et al 1998 2002 yan et al 2016 the essence of neurodynamic optimization lies in the facts that the optimality conditions could be realized by the recurrent neural network particularly the pnn the main distinction of pnn is with feedback loop which enables that the system established based on the pnn could converge to the optimal solution with appropriately design xia et al 2002 cheng et al 2008 yu et al 2018 the parallel structure of pnn is given in fig 2 it consists of m integrators m processors ω ν and the state variable is defined as follows 4 d ν d t α p ω ν ω ν ν where ν ν 1 ν 2 ν m t r m represents the state vector α 0 denotes a scale parameter and ω ν is assumed to be the continuous symmetric function the projection operator is defined as 5 p ω ν arg min υ ω ν υ where is the l 2 norm of r m in order to prove the stability of system 4 it is required to introduce a few definitions let ν t be a solution of the system ν f ν the equilibrium point ν i e f ν 0 is deemed to be stable in the sense of lyapunov provided that for any ν 0 ν t 0 and scalar ε 0 there exists σ 0 such that if ν t 0 ν σ then ν t ν ε for all t 0 the lyapunov function can be defined by ω 6 v ν 0 1 ν ν t ω ν t ν ν d t because ω is symmertic then it can be obtained 7 d v ν d ν v ν t ω ν where v is the gradient of v then the following relation 8 d v d t d v d ν t d ν d t α ω ν t p ω ν ω ν ν can be deduced because ω ν t p ω ν ω ν ν α p ω ν ω ν ν 2 xia et al 2002 it is found 9 d v d t 0 according to the lyapunov theorem khalil 2002 the neural network 4 is stable i e the proposed neural network is capable to converge to the equilibrium point eventually note that the equilibrium point equals to the solution of optimization problem and it has been analyzed widely xia et al 1998 2002 cheng et al 2008 2 3 problem formulation the path following and roll stabilization by means of rudder is a classical underactuated control problem subject to input saturation it can be first formulated into problem with multi objectives by mpc method to address the trade offs between path following and roll stabilization second the control outputs of path following can be further simplified as the tracking and heading errors by employing the los guidance overall the model of control design can be summarized as follows liu et al 2015 fossen and lauvdal 1994 10 e ψ φ v p r 0 u 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 14 0 0 a 21 a 22 a 23 a 24 0 0 a 31 a 32 a 33 a 34 e ψ φ v p r 0 0

stability the quasi infinite horizon mpc method is employed by adding the terminal cost function into the objective function fourth a neurodynamic optimization system based on pnn is established to solve the objective function formed by the quasi infinite horizon mpc parallelly in this way an efficient mpc controller with guaranteed stability for path following and roll stabilization can be obtained finally in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller a high fidelity 4 dof model of container together with wave model is implemented as simulation model in which the robustness of proposed controller to uncertainties of model and external disturbances are also tested the whole process can be depicted by fig 3 3 controller design the design procedures are characterized by the following key steps first the objective function based on the predicted responses of path following and roll stabilization is designed by virtue of the standard mpc method second the terminal cost designed according to the lyapunov theory is added into the resultant objective function then a neurodynamic system is established to solve the final objective function parallelly based on pnn step 1 standard mpc design the error dynamics eq 10 can be rewritten in a compact form 11 ξ α ξ β δ ξ χ ξ where the state variables are ξ e ψ φ v p r t the control outputs are ξ e ψ φ p t

r 6 1 ξ r 4 1 χ r 4 6 and k is the index of the sampled point it is straightforward to perform difference operation on both sides of eq 12 for the purpose of deriving a rate based model the rate based model gains advantage of handling the constraints on rudder rate 13 ξ k 1 ξ k α ξ k ξ k 1 β δ k δ k 1 and hence it is employed in the present paper to proceed the state variable and the control input can be redefined as 14 δ ξ k ξ k ξ k 1 δ δ k δ k δ k 1 such that eq 13 is recast into the form 15 δ ξ k 1 α δ ξ k b δ δ k note that the relation 16 ξ k 1 ξ k χ ξ k 1 ξ k χ δ ξ k 1 χ α δ ξ k χ β δ δ k holds the use of eq 13 eq 14 eq 15 and eq 16 can transform eq 12 into the following rated based model 17 δ ξ k 1 ξ k 1 α ο 6 4 χ α 1 δ ξ k ξ k β χ β δ δ k ξ k ο 6 4 t 1 δ ξ k ξ k where ο 6 4 is the

q ψ δ u t ℜ δ u subject to the constraints 23 δ min δ i δ max i 1 2 n p δ δ min δ δ i δ δ max i 1 2 n p where q and ℜ are the weighting matrices eq 23 reflects the constraints of rudder angel and rudder rate wang 2009 step 2 terminal cost function design in order to ensure closed loop stability the terminal cost is added into the objective function eq 22 24 j t ξ k n p k t p ξ k n p k where the terminal matrix p in eq 24 remains to be determined a linear state feedback law for eq 11 is first designed 25 δ k ξ where k is obtained by using linear quadratic method with q l and r l as output and input weight matrices respectively then the terminal matrix p can be determined by solving the following lyapunov equation 26 a k κ i t p p a k κ i q where q q l k t r l k a k α β k and κ is chosen by following principle 27 κ γ max a k where γ max a k denotes the real part of the largest eigenvalues chen et al 1998 yu et al 2014 step 3 neurodynamic optimization design once the terminal

formulated in the form of 33 j δ u t h δ u σ δ u c the objective function eq 33 can be solved by establishing a neurodynamic system which is given by 34 d δ u d t α p ω δ u j δ u δ u thus the control sequence δ u can be obtained iteratively the principle of neurodynamic optimization design is that the equilibrium points of network should be the exacted or approximate solution of the optimization problem the first item δ δ k of the control sequence δ u is used in 35 δ k δ k 1 δ δ k to obtain the control input δ k 4 simulation results various simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization controller for integrated path following and roll stabilization by rudder in waves in order to show advantage of the computational efficiency over liu et al 2015 the comparative studies are also conducted and the simulation condition is set the same as the liu et al 2015 all simulations are conducted on the same 4 dof high fidelity model of container ship s 175 fossen 1994 2011 li et al 2010 liu et al 2015 the rudder angle is set δ 35 deg normally the rudder rate is set δ 2 7 deg s for maneuvering whereas the rate of the modern rudder could be δ 20 deg s for roll stabilization fossen and lauvdal 1994 wave disturbance is simulated by using modified pierson moskowitz spectrum at sea state 5 liu et al 2015 fossen 2011 the weighting matrices on outputs and input are given by q and ℜ where q d i a g p e i n p n p p ψ i n p n p p φ i n p n p p p i n p n p and ℜ i n c n c sampling time is set as t s 0 1 s and the commanded shaft speed is set to n c 70 r p m the parameters of terminal cost function are given by q l d i a g 0 0001 1 1 1 r l 0 1 and κ 0 9976 respectively the projection operator of pnn is set as 36 p ω ω i δ δ max ω i δ δ max ω i δ δ min ω i δ δ max δ δ min ω i δ δ min where ω i δ δ i j δ δ i and the parameter related to the convergent speed is set as α 0 01 4 1 straight line path following and roll stabilization this case aims to investigate the performance of straight line path following and roll stabilization by rudder in which the performances with and without design of roll stabilization are compared for scenario without roll stabilization rrs off the control parameters are set as p e 0 0001 p ψ 1000 p φ 0 p p 0 for scenario with roll stabilization rrs on the control parameters are set as p e 0 0001 p ψ 1000 p φ 1000 p p 1000 the mpc parameters are set as n c 2 n p 60 the performance of straight line path following is given by fig 4 the performance of roll stabilization is given by fig 5 the control input rudder angle is demonstrated in fig 6 it can be seen from figs 4 and 5 the straight line path following can be achieved in both scenarios while the roll angle and roll rate are reduced greatly when rrs is on it can be concluded that the straight line path following and roll stabilization can be achieved by the proposed controller 4 2 curved line path following and roll stabilization the performance of curved line path following and roll stabilization by rudder is investigated in this case the same parameters as section 4 1 are employed the performance of curved line path following is given by fig 7 the performance of roll stabilization in curved line scenario is given by fig 8 fig 9 shows response of the rudder angle in this scenario it can be seen from figs 4 and 7 both straight line and curved line path following are achieved furthermore figs 5 and 8 indicate that the roll angle and roll rate are reduced when the roll stabilization is initiated rrs on and hence the objective of roll reduction is also achieved but it is challenging to show the control performance of roll reduction due to high frequency of roll motion one can appeal to a quantitative method to characterize the performance of roll reduction fossen 1994 37 r o l l r e d u c t i o n a p r r s a p 100 where a p represents standard deviation of the roll angle and roll rate with roll stabilization off rrs off and r r s denotes the standard deviation of the roll angle and roll rate with roll stabilization on rrs on note that the wave disturbance is simulated via the modified pierson moskowitz spectrum in which a random mechanism is included it indicates that the wave disturbance is different in each simulation whereas the sea state is the same i e the same main parameters these aspects imply that they are just slightly different in statistics the results are shown in table 1 to be realistic the numbers except the roll reduction rate in table 1 are the standard deviation over the time period it can be found that roll rate and roll angle are reduced in both straight line and curved line scenarios it can be therefore concluded that the objectives of integrated path following and roll stabilization can be achieved by the proposed optimization controller 4 3 comparative studies on computational time the computational time is one of important factors for real time implementation in this case various simulations are conducted to illustrate advantage of the proposed optimization controller based on pnn from section 4 2 it can be seen that the control performance of proposed optimization controller is equivalent with that of liu et al 2015 liu et al 2015 used fmincon function of matlab to solve the objective function eq 22 and hence there exists a significant computational burden as shown in table 2 this is also one of main motivations to conduct this research in addition to liu et al 2015 other representative optimization techniques such as the quadprog function of matlab and the hopfield neural network are also compared in this case under the same simulation condition these optimization techniques are used to solve the optimization problem of integrated path following and roll stabilization respectively the results of simulation time are given in table 2 it can be concluded that the projection neural network is the most efficient one because of its parallel computing structure characterized by fig 2 note that in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design there is no terminal cost in the objective function in liu et al 2015 and hopfield neural network scenarios while the terminal cost is included in the scenarios of quadprog and pnn 5 conclusions in this paper the conventional rrs problem is extended into the integrated problem of path following and roll stabilization which is more advanced for navigation safety and efficient transportation in the control design a neurodynamic optimization system based on pnn is established to solve the objective function formulated by mpc parallelly in this way the computational efficiency of standard mpc is improved significantly the closed loop stability is guaranteed by incorporating the terminal cost function derived from the lyapunov equation into the objective function the simulation results have validated that the controller proposed herein can achieve the objectives of path following and roll stabilization simultaneously the comparative studies have shown the advantages of the proposed controller in efficiency indicating that the proposed mpc design is promising to be used in practical application in future the authors will focus on conducting the investigations on techniques that would help to smooth the rudder motion acknowledgement this work is supported in part by the

turbines fowts are pollution free space saving and flexible in large scale construction compared with fossil generators and onshore facilities uzunoglu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a hallowell et al 2018 kang et al 2019 overall 23 1 gw of offshore power have been installed by the end of 2018 and 82 of them were installed in three leading markets united kingdom over 7 8 gw germany over 6 4 gw and china over 4 6 gw global wind energy council 2019 as a consequence of larger size higher wind speed and more available workdays the power of fowts can be 50 100 higher than onshore wind turbines karlõševa et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 larger fowts in size however tend to fail more frequently than smaller onshore facilities due mainly to system complexity and harsh working conditions pérez et al 2013 carroll et al 2016 2017 moreover high operation and maintenance cost severely restricts the development of fowts hereby the advantages of installing fowts rely on guaranteeing their high reliability with good design and optimized maintenance planning jeon et al 2013 muliawan et al 2013 guanche et al 2016 reliability analysis is a promising way of reducing high failure rate and downtime of fowts by seeking their weak links ascertaining mean time to failure mttf of fowts and then suggesting preventive maintenance actions ahead of malfunctions occur castro santos et al 2016 santos et al 2016 li et al 2018 aiming at providing a comprehensive perspective on reliability analysis of fowts alhmoud et al 2017 and jiang et al 2017 reviewed reliability analysis models from system and structure perspectives respectively while jin et al 2016 summarized tools with respect to reliability analysis of fowts generally the reliability analysis of fowts has three targets sultania and manuel 2018 bhardwaj et al 2019 du et al 2019 i compute reliability or failure probability failure rate and mttf of fowts ii ascertain critical components or failure modes or failure causes that probably give rise to the most malfunctions of fowts such as shutdown unstable electricity production etc iii present suggestions on design corrections or maintenance two means are expected to address the aforementioned targets that are field data collection and model based reliability analysis zhang et al 2013 bagbanci et al 2015 colone et al 2018 the former explores the reliability of fowts by data collected from wind farms while the later theoretically calculates the reliability of fowts according to structural relationships and failure data of their components kang et al 2017 sant et al 2018 unfortunately until now no publication has comprehensively presented failure probability or failure rate of fowts from field data collection point of view instead researches took failure rate of fixed foundation offshore wind turbines reported in carroll et al 2016 8 3 failures per turbine annually with the mttf of 1055 42h as analogous fowts failure rate for instance in kang et al 2019 while as for model based reliability analysis kang et al 2019 modeled and analyzed the reliability of a fowt by the fault tree analysis fta method and concluded that failure rate of the analyzed fowt is 7 3 failures per year with the predicted mttf is 1199h which however was substantiated to be 13 larger than that from data collection in carroll et al 2016 for identifying critical components that lead to malfunctions of fowts target ii kang et al 2017 considered the correlations among failure modes of a fowt and proposed a correlated failure modes and effects analysis fmea methodology as a basis determined that the generator is the most critical and risky component of the fowt at the failure causes level arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 applied the fmea method to determine the top failure modes of a typical 2 mw indirect drive variable speed wind turbine r80 which are materials failure fracture rupture and electrical failure among others regarding suggestions on corrections and maintenance of fowts the target iii zhang et al 2016a conducted reliability analysis of a fowt by dynamic fta method the results indicated that maintenance interval of the fowt should be less than 576h as a consequence of system simplification however the error of the predicted results in zhang et al 2016a by dynamic fta may be larger than that what been concluded in kang et al 2019 by conventional fta bharatbha 2015 applied failure modes effects and criticality analysis fmeca to identify key areas susceptible to failures of an offshore wind turbine and suggested to implement condition monitoring to the offshore wind turbine blades and lubrication system fischer et al 2011 developed a multitrack empirical approach to analyze the failure behavior of converters of offshore wind turbines and sufficient protection of converters was recommended however the uppermost drawback of using the present methods to theoretically compute reliability characteristics of fowts is the unneglectable analytic error for instance 13 in kang et al 2019 generally the conventional fta and its derived methods are naturally unprecise methodologies for reliability analysis of fowts since they can be used to calculate either the upper bound by minimum path set or the lower bound recurring to minimum cut set of reliability of fowts decision making according to such large errors may be unconvincing and risky moreover conventionally the reliability analysis of fowts call for different methods which is time and cost consuming for instance to estimate the reliability characteristics target i by fta and then ascertain critical components target ii by fmea arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 fmeca scheu et al 2019 or importance measure technique kang et al 2019 generally bayesian networks bns are more computationally precise than the fta method as they can deal better with correlated data secondly the predictive and diagnostic information propagation capabilities enable bns to accomplish reliability estimation and critical components identification of fowts within one model hence employing bns to carry out reliability analysis of fowts may benefit for both error reduction and analysis simplification on the other hand the correctness and efficiency of bns have been proved by their tremendous implantations such as in tien and kiureghian 2016 zhang et al 2016b khakzad and van gelder 2018 sýkora et al 2018 chang et al 2019 to this end as an extension of kang et al 2019 this paper presents a bn model to estimate reliability failure probability failure rate and mttf of a fowt and to ascertain critical systems components and reliability affecting factors of the fowt the well established software genie in version 2 1 was applied to construct the bn model in this study the software is widely used in bn modeling and calculation e g in cai et al 2018 and in meng et al 2019 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the fowt considered in this paper section 3 presents the reliability analysis of the fowt at the system level results discussion and comparisons with fta at the global level of the fowt are provided in section 4 conclusions are provided in section 5 2 the fowt considered in this study the fowt considered in this study is the same as that what has been introduced in kang et al 2019 specifically the fowt consists of 5 systems with 34 components including some subsystems overall 80 root failure causes that lead to malfunctions of the fowt were considered in this study the 5 systems of the fowt are support structure s1 pitch system s2 gearbox s3 generator s4 and auxiliary system s5 the support structure provides support to the nacelle and consist of mooring subsystem tower and floating foundation uzunoglu et al 2016 the pitch system which is hydraulic driven is responsible for adjusting the angle of attack of the blades and consists of hydraulic subsystem alarm facilities and meteorological units the gearbox transforms high torque and low rotational speed from the main shaft to low torque and high rotating speed to the generator primarily assembled by gears and bearings the generator an assembly of rotor and stator converts mechanical energy to electricity the auxiliary system is a combination of speed train electrical components blades and yaw subsystem designed for ensuring high efficiency of energy production of the fowt the hierarchical structure of the fowt the fowt systems components considered in this study is shown in fig 1 the failure propagation of the fowt is represented in a fault tree ft model that was constructed in kang et al 2019 see fig 2 the ft is a hierarchical logic diagram that demonstrates how failures propagate through the fowt for instance the malfunction of the fowt is logically caused by a certain subsystem or a component which results from a combination of failure causes the malfunction of the fowt failures of components or subsystems and failure causes are top event intermediate events and basic events in the ft model respectively the hierarchical relationships among events are represented by logic gates e g and and or gates specifically and gate denotes the output event occurs only if all input events happened for instance alarm power failure a20 in the pitch system occur only if both the main power b40 and the backup power b41 fail an or gate reflects the output event occur if at least one input event happened for example the support structure fails s1 if one of its components fails that are mooring subsystem a01 tower a02 and floating foundation a03 the events definition of the ft model are listed in appendix a lifetime distributions of components as well as root causes of the fowt are preconditions for completing the reliability analysis of systems by using bns however the data of this study is insufficient to estimate the aforementioned distributions and likelihoods instead constant failure rate model see eq 1 was employed to transform the failure rates available reported in kang et al 2019 and as listed in appendix a of root failure causes to whose failure probabilities as a basis to drive the bn model that been created in this study specifically failure rates come from following sectors i offshore onshore reliability data oreda ii published references including arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 faulstich et al 2011 fischer et al 2011 pérez et al 2013 bharatbhai 2015 and santos et al 2015 iii experts opinions 1 p t 1 e λ t where p t is the failure probability of a failure cause at time t λ represents the failure rate of the corresponding failure cause two assumptions of estimating probabilities of failure causes of the fowt should be highlighted i the applied data can represent the failure characteristics of the fowt even though they may come from different offshore wind turbines installed in various wind farms ii failure data of root causes are independent the procedure of conducting reliability analysis of the fowt using bn as shown in fig 3 3 reliability analysis of the fowt at systems level using bayesian network 3 1 bayesian networks bns bns are composed of nodes and directed edges edges for short nodes represent random variables and edges are causal relationships between linked nodes nodes are split into parent nodes the one an edge starts with and child nodes the one an edge points to bobbio et al 2001 specifically root nodes without any parent are allocated marginal probability distributions while intermediate nodes are assigned with conditional probabilistic tables cpts borunda et al 2016 an edge pointing from a to b denotes the value of child node b probabilistically relies on the value of the parent node a roughly to say a influences on b and the strength of the influence defend by the cpt of node a parent node langseth and portinale 2007 top down predictive support reasoning and bottom up diagnostic support reasoning reasoning patterns are two typical information propagation processes of bns rebello et al 2018 specifically the top down reasoning pattern propagates information by the joint probability function as 2 p x 1 x 2 x n p x n x n 1 x n 2 x 1 p x n 1 x n 2 x n 3 x 1 p x 2 x 1 p x 1 i 1 n p x i x i 1 x i 2 x 1 however the conditional independence assumption of bns defines the state of a node only depends on the state s of its parent s on this basis the joint probability distribution of n independent variables in bns can be written as 3 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a r e n t s x i while the bottom up reasoning pattern propagates information by conditional probability function or bayesian inference langseth et al 2009 li and mahadevan 2018 as 4 p x i x j p x i x j p x j p x j x i p x i p x j p x j x i p x i i p x j x i p x i where x 1 x 2 x n are independent variables p x 1 x 2 x n is their joint probability distribution and p a r e n t s x i represents parent nodes of x i the bns have been developed maturely aiming at modeling various engineering cases with practical restrictions for instance hierarchical bayesian networks hbns are developed to model the reliability of highly hierarchical structure of systems li and guedes soares 2019 dynamic bayesian networks dbns are created to consider and reasonably bring in dynamics to the reliability analysis or estimation of systems liu et al 2015 multi state bayesian networks mbns are proved to be flexible tools for representing systems with more than two states or whose failure can be divided into several phases mi et al 2018 however the complexity in the reasoning process of bn derived methodologies aforementioned are quite high compared with the standard bns jun and kim 2017 features e g the configuration of systems and the data available should be clarified to select a suitable tool from the group of bns including its derived technologies for the reliability analysis of an engineering case concerning the computational complexity and features of the fowt analyzed the standard bn was selected as an extension of conventional and popularly used fta methodology to model the reliability of the fowt the mapping algorithm from a ft to a bn is introduced as the following steps and is displayed in fig 4 the constructed bn model of the fowt malfunction is demonstrated in fig 5 nodes definition together with the root nodes failure rates are listed in appendix a step 1 map events in ft into nodes in bn draw nodes in bn for all events in ft labels and represented meanings of nodes are equal to the corresponding events for instance create 47 nodes in the sub bn model for 47 events in the ft model of the support structure step 2 map causal relationships in ft into edges in bn link nodes in bn by edges according to the causal relationships among events in ft an edge starts from a parent node an input event of a gate and points to a child node an output event of the gate for instance link a01 a02 and a03 start from to s1 points to separately for that a01 a02 and a03 are input events in the ft and s1 is the output event obey the same logic until all nodes in the sub bn are linked step 3 map logic of gates in ft into cpts in bn transform gates in ft into cpts of child nodes output events of the gate in bn specifically for an and gate the failure probability of a child node equal to 1 only if all parent nodes fail while for an or gate the failure probability of a child node equal to 1 if one of the parent nodes fails for instance a2 is an or gate for b02 b03 b04 and a06 and the cpt of which can be represented by 5 p a 02 w o r k 1 o n l y i f b 02 b 03 b 04 a n d a 06 w o r k p a 02 w o r k 0 e l s e additionally for an and gate such as a10 the son of b17 b18 and b19 whose cpt can be constructed as 6 p a 10 f a i l 1 o n l y i f b 17 b 18 a n d b 19 f a i l p a 10 f a i l 0 e l s e 3 2 the support structure the support structure of the fowt consists of a tower a floating foundation and a mooring subsystem the tower provides support to the nacelle the mooring subsystem and the floating foundation provide stable buoyancy and positioning to the upper structures diagnosis analysis of the sub bn model see fig 5 was conducted to test the contributors that result in malfunctions of the support structure according to the results calculated the malfunctions of the support structure mostly contribute by tower failures the probability of which is about 36 followed by mooring subsystem failure 34 and floating foundation failure 30 specifically the tower failures are most likely caused by tower collapse that resulted from harsh weather conditions such as strong wind strong waves and storms the probability of which is 83 the mooring subsystems failures most probably caused by mooring lines broken as a consequence of abnormal stress typhoon or storm carry dropped objects hitting floating foundation acts as the most crucial event since which contributes over 89 failures to the floating foundation from the probability point of view detailed primary contributors to the support structure s1 failure are represented in fig 6 with the results harsh environmental conditions such as strong wind strong waves storms typhoons and abnormal working conditions like abnormal stress should be considered when conducting failure analysis of the fowt at both design and operation stages precise and in time weather prediction is recommended for which allows implementation of preventive activities before extreme weather conditions happen besides reinforcing mooring lines and clean superfluous objects on the floating foundation are also suggested 3 3 the pitch system the hydraulic blade pitch system pitch system for short is the main part of the fowt which helps to minimize the risk of undesirable accidents under extreme weather conditions the pitch system guarantees high efficiency energy generation of the fowt by adjusting attack angle of the blades according to the diagnosis analysis of the pitch system the hydraulic system failure gives rise to the largest percentage of the pitch system failure about 83 followed by alarm facilities failure about 17 and wrong pitch angle around 0 01 hydraulic oil failure leads to more than 51 of hydraulic system failures oil leakage 1 6 times in probability of the second factor namely overpressure is an important contributor to hydraulic oil failures lightning protection failure and limit switch failure contribute equally to the alarm failures power failure and wrong pitch angle logically caused by abnormal vibration vane damage and anemometer damage have a very low impact on the failure of the pitch system numerically less than 0 3 and 0 1 respectively primary contributors to pitch system s2 failure are shown in fig 7 hydraulic oil failure lightning protection failure limit switch failure oil leakage and overpressure are primary contributors to pitch system failures periodic inspection to hydraulic oil may benefit for securing the safe and reliable operations to this system 3 4 gearbox the gearbox transforms high torque and low rotational speed from the main shaft to low torque and high rotational speed to the generator failures of gearboxes generally contribute considerable downtimes and cause a huge economic loss for the fowt the diagnosis analysis of the gearbox shows that gearbox stoppages mainly result from bearings failures the probability is more than 70 followed by gears failure 20 and lubrication failure 10 bearings failures are mainly the consequences of corrosion the probability of which is over 44 and abrasive wear 37 the riskiest failure mode for gearbox however is the gears failure result from abnormal vibration tooth wear cracks pitting and glued abnormal filter poor quality lubrication oil and dirty oil contribute 36 36 and 28 of lubrication failures of the gearbox respectively contributors to gearbox failure s3 are shown in fig 8 in terms of suggestions to avoid the gearbox failure measures like contacting stiffness reinforcement for gears before their installation and periodical inspection and replacement of hydraulic oil are highly recommended 3 5 generator the generator is an assembly of mechanical and electrical components which transforms mechanical energy into electricity the energy production efficiency of the fowt relies on high reliability high availability and low failure rate of the generator the leak is the most crucial failure mode for which is identified to give rise to over 77 failures to the generator compared with measurement facilities failure 15 and bearings failures around 8 from the probability standpoint in detail the bearings failures mainly caused by asymmetry 64 rotor and stator failures are complex but they contribute fewer malfunctions to the generator primary contributors to the generator s4 failure are listed in fig 9 with the results environmental factors and hardware failures have fewer impacts on malfunction of the generator since it is installed within the nacelle however failures such as leak measurement facilities and asymmetry are the main causes of the generator failures hence good manufacturing of the generator is of importance and which may helpful for avoiding failures of the generator 3 6 auxiliary system auxiliary system is an integration of speed train subsystem electric components blade subsystem and yaw subsystem speed train subsystem including low speed and high speed trains and a brake which controls axes rotational speed electric components are a collection of controllers sensors a converter and a transformer which adjust the energy production efficiency of the fowt blade subsystem consists of rotor hub rotor bearing and three blades which is assembled for receiving wind energy yaw subsystem is designed for turning blades directly facing the wind the results of diagnosis indicate that electric components failures mainly including controller failure sensors failure and converter failure contribute some 61 of auxiliary system failures followed by blade subsystem failure yaw subsystem failure and speed train subsystem failure which contribute 24 11 and 4 stoppages to the auxiliary system respectively specifically the hub brings about 61 of failures to the blade subsystem and drive trains result in 76 of speed train subsystem failures primary contributors to the auxiliary system s5 electric components blade subsystem yaw subsystem and speed train subsystem failure are listed in fig 10 robust design and optimized maintenance strategy for electric components are recommended for ensuring the safety of the auxiliary system since the failure frequency of which are quite high compared with other components and subsystems 4 results comparisons and discussion 4 1 reliability characteristics failure probability and reliability of the fowt and its systems were predicted according to the global bn model and the results are plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively a power function with the expression f x a i x b i c i was selected among others due to its lowest root mean square error rmse when modeling the expressions of reliability and failure probability of systems of the fowt the results are listed table 1 this study concludes that the failure rate of the fowt is 7 9 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1103 26h by the end of 5 years working the predicted failure rate in this study was also compared with the one that has been concluded by fta method in kang et al 2019 7 3 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1199h and that from data collection in carroll et al 2016 8 3 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1055h see fig 13 the comparison reveals that reliability analysis for the fowt using bn is more precise than using fta for which decreased the error of the predicted failure rate from 13 to 4 5 the failure rate of offshore wind turbines published in carroll et al 2016 is mainly collected from fixed foundation offshore wind turbines and the failure rate of those should be smaller than the fowt considered in this study since the latter is more complicated than the former however limited by data size only 80 root failure causes of the fowt malfunction were considered in this study as a result the predicted failure rate of the fowt is smaller than that what been published in carroll et al 2016 indicating more failure causes and components are required to be analyzed for seeking a more precise reliability analysis result 4 2 importance measure importance measures are proposed to identify critical failure causes components and factors that expedite the fowt malfunctions the target ii of the reliability analysis of the fowt márquez et al 2016 a higher value of importance represents a more critical component or a failure factor of the fowt painuly 2001 kang et al 2019 this paper utilizes the diagnostic support information propagation capability of the constructed bn model to derive an importance measure for the fowt as 7 i b n i t p f c i f a i l u r e f o w t f a i l u r e where i b n i t is the importance of component i at the service time t measured by the bn model f o w t and f c i are the fowt and its component i by eq 7 critical systems components together with factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions can be identified and the results are listed in figs 14 and 15 it should be highlighted that this study accomplished the reliability analysis of the fowt in one bn model which is advanced than conventional reliability analysis methods since the latter require multiple methods to accomplish the same goal for instance conventional studies predict the reliability of fowts by fta method and seek their critical components by employing importance measure methods kang et al 2019 fmea arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 or fmeca scheu et al 2019 in terms of importance measure of systems and factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions i the support structure has the highest probability of failure given that the fowt has been failed followed by the pitch system electric components generator etc see fig 14 the total importance of all systems components exceeds 1 indicating that dependent failures are existing ii structural defects or poor design such as abnormal stress is the most prominent factor leads to the fowt malfunctions which contributes 44 malfunctions to the fowt meanwhile 32 malfunctions of the fowt result from harsh environmental conditions like storms operational factors contribute 13 malfunctions to the fowt such as human errors and materials damage or degeneration contribute 11 malfunctions to the fowt such as materials wear and fatigue are the third and fourth primary factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions see fig 15 with the results of the importance measure of assembly units of the fowt see fig 16 i the tower devices of the mooring subsystem and others are recognized to be critical assembly units ii floating foundation failure caused by dropped objects hitting and others is identified to be a critical failure of the fowt moreover fig 16 reveals a negative correlation relationship between events reliability and their importance which could be said that a component or a system or a reliability affecting factor with low reliability would contribute more failure to the fowt and they require more attention in both design and operation stages of the fowt according to the type of data that been used in this study other importance measure methods that are birnbaum s method andrews and beeson 2003 structural importance and fussell vesely method meng 2000 márquez et al 2016 are computed and which to be compared with bn diagnosis results calculated in this study note that structural importance is a particular case of birnbaum s method coping with the situation of unavailable components probabilities the structural importance usually employed in design stage of fowts 8 i b i t r s t r i t f s t f i t 9 i s t r i t r s t r i t f s t f i t r i t f i t 0 5 in eqs 8 and 9 i b i t and i s t r i t are the importance of component i measured by birnbaum s method and structural importance method r s t and f s t are reliability and failure probability functions of the fowt while r i t and f i t are reliability and failure probability functions of component i all variables in these equations are defined at the serves time t 10 i f v i t f i d i t f s t where i f v i t is the importance of component i measured by the fussell vesely method f i d i t denotes the probability of at least one minimum cut set contains component i occurred f s t is failure probability function of the fowt all variables in this equation are defined at the serves time t a comparison between bn diagnosis proposed in this study structural importance birnbaum s importance and fussell vesely importance is conducted see fig 17 the results of structural importance and birnbaum importance are almost the same since both methods are unconditional algorithms the analogous conclusion can be drawn from the results calculated by the fussell vesely method and bn diagnosis both are conditional algorithms slight differences were found between structural importance and birnbaum importance and between fussell vesely importance and bn diagnosis however the evidence is insufficient to prove that the importance calculated by each method is excessive or inadequate but it is obvious that conditional algorithms are more sensitive to failure probabilities of basic events the results of comparison reveal that bn diagnosis can be employed as an elaborate importance measure method when data sufficient from the analysis other conclusions as follows are recommended 1 structural and birnbaum importance are suggested to be used in the system design stage of fowts since data in this stage is usually insufficient while fussell vesely importance and bn diagnosis are recommended to be applied in the operational stage of fowts for the data sufficient reason moreover bn diagnosis has the same accuracy as fussell vesely importance however is not highly recommended for the complexity in modeling and calculation reasons 2 typhoon leak of generator storm strong wind and waves control failure oil leakage abnormal stress sensors failure overpressure of hydraulic system yaw subsystem failure and the hub failure are the top 10 important events that should be focused on and preventive actions are recommended to be implemented to avoid their occurrences it should be pointed out that the top 10 critical events for malfunctions of the fowt are concluded from only failure probability point of view failure severity downtime the complexity of maintenances and cost of failure are unneglectable factors required to be considered for the further comprehensive reliability analysis reliability of the fowt will increase given that its components are upgraded components upgrade however are always costly a balance should be made between the costs of components upgrade and the reliability improvement of the fowt which is a big concern to all stakeholders to this end the relations between failure probabilities of top 10 failure factors according to the results of importance measure and that of the fowt s are accomplished see fig 18 according to fig 18 approximate linear relation between failure probability of each in top 10 failure factors and that of the fowt s with the slope of 0 1 are determined indicating that 10 reliability improvement of each component brings a mere 1 reliability improvement to the fowt hence quality upgrading for all components likely has the same contribution to the reliability improvement of fowts indicating that components with low value should be considered firstly when upgrade or redesign the fowt however it should be highlighted that other than failure probability of the fowt other factors like the severity of failure modes as well as profit loss not limited to are of importance factors that call for serious consideration when upgrade or redesign the fowt 5 conclusions this paper established a bn model to conduct reliability analysis of a fowt failure probability reliability failure rate and mttf at certain working time of the fowt and its systems were concluded by using the bn model the support structure was identified as the most failure prone system experiencing around 3 5 failures per year followed by the auxiliary system 1 7 failures per year pitch system 1 4 failures per year generator 0 97 failures per year and gearbox 0 32 failures per year 7 9 failures per year with the mttf of 1103h of the fowt was predicted indicating that reliability analysis using bn is more precise than the fta method where the error of predicted mttf decreased from 13 to about 4 5 moreover importance measures were determined based on bn diagnosis by which critical systems components as well as the failure modes of the fowt were determined furthermore the origins of the fowt failures e g structural defect or bad design contributes 44 of the fowt failures harsh environment conditions 32 operational factors 13 and materials damage and degeneration 11 were obtained a comparison analysis between traditional importance measure methods and the bn diagnosis was implemented for proving the correctness of utilizing bn diagnosis to conduct importance measure for the fowt the results revealed that very fewer difference exist between the results of bn diagnosis and the outcomes of fussell vesely method however the following aspects should be considered in the future i correlations among failure causes such as common cause components failures and the dependence of various weather conditions ii probabilistic relationships between nodes in the bn model will apply instead of determined relationships form the ft logic iii

21382,a bayesian network is adopted to model and analyze the reliability of a floating offshore wind turbine reliability characteristics such as failure probability failure rate and mean time to failure of the floating offshore wind turbine are determined according to the bayesian network predictive analysis in addition critical systems components and reliability influencing factors of the floating offshore wind turbine are identified by the bayesian network diagnostic analysis moreover the relationships between failure probabilities of critical reliability affecting factors and that of floating offshore wind turbine are obtained the computed results in this paper are more conformity with statistical data for that the error of predicted failure rate of this study is 4 5 which can be compared with that of 13 concluded by fault tree analysis keywords reliability analysis bayesian network floating offshore wind turbine importance measure 1 introduction floating offshore wind turbines fowts are pollution free space saving and flexible in large scale construction compared with fossil generators and onshore facilities uzunoglu et al 2016 zhang et al 2016a hallowell et al 2018 kang et al 2019 overall 23 1 gw of offshore power have been installed by the end of 2018 and 82 of them were installed in three leading markets united kingdom over 7 8 gw germany over 6 4 gw and china over 4 6 gw global wind energy council 2019 as a consequence of larger size higher wind speed and more available workdays the power of fowts can be 50 100 higher than onshore wind turbines karlõševa et al 2016 kumar et al 2016 larger fowts in size however tend to fail more frequently than smaller onshore facilities due mainly to system complexity and harsh working conditions pérez et al 2013 carroll et al 2016 2017 moreover high operation and maintenance cost severely restricts the development of fowts hereby the advantages of installing fowts rely on guaranteeing their high reliability with good design and optimized maintenance planning jeon et al 2013 muliawan et al 2013 guanche et al 2016 reliability analysis is a promising way of reducing high failure rate and downtime of fowts by seeking their weak links ascertaining mean time to failure mttf of fowts and then suggesting preventive maintenance actions ahead of malfunctions occur castro santos et al 2016 santos et al 2016 li et al 2018 aiming at providing a comprehensive perspective on reliability analysis of fowts alhmoud et al 2017 and jiang et al 2017 reviewed reliability analysis models from system and structure perspectives respectively while jin et al 2016 summarized tools with respect to reliability analysis of fowts generally the reliability analysis of fowts has three targets sultania and manuel 2018 bhardwaj et al 2019 du et al 2019 i compute reliability or failure probability failure rate and mttf of fowts ii ascertain critical components or failure modes or failure causes that probably give rise to the most malfunctions of fowts such as shutdown unstable electricity production etc iii present suggestions on design corrections or maintenance two means are expected to address the aforementioned targets that are field data collection and model based reliability analysis zhang et al 2013 bagbanci et al 2015 colone et al 2018 the former explores the reliability of fowts by data collected from wind farms while the later theoretically calculates the reliability of fowts according to structural relationships and failure data of their components kang et al 2017 sant et al 2018 unfortunately until now no publication has comprehensively presented failure probability or failure rate of fowts from field data collection point of view instead researches took failure rate of fixed foundation offshore wind turbines reported in carroll et al 2016 8 3 failures per turbine annually with the mttf of 1055 42h as analogous fowts failure rate for instance in kang et al 2019 while as for model based reliability analysis kang et al 2019 modeled and analyzed the reliability of a fowt by the fault tree analysis fta method and concluded that failure rate of the analyzed fowt is 7 3 failures per year with the predicted mttf is 1199h which however was substantiated to be 13 larger than that from data collection in carroll et al 2016 for identifying critical components that lead to malfunctions of fowts target ii kang et al 2017 considered the correlations among failure modes of a fowt and proposed a correlated failure modes and effects analysis fmea methodology as a basis determined that the generator is the most critical and risky component of the fowt at the failure causes level arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 applied the fmea method to determine the top failure modes of a typical 2 mw indirect drive variable speed wind turbine r80 which are materials failure fracture rupture and electrical failure among others regarding suggestions on corrections and maintenance of fowts the target iii zhang et al 2016a conducted reliability analysis of a fowt by dynamic fta method the results indicated that maintenance interval of the fowt should be less than 576h as a consequence of system simplification however the error of the predicted results in zhang et al 2016a by dynamic fta may be larger than that what been concluded in kang et al 2019 by conventional fta bharatbha 2015 applied failure modes effects and criticality analysis fmeca to identify key areas susceptible to failures of an offshore wind turbine and suggested to implement condition monitoring to the offshore wind turbine blades and lubrication system fischer et al 2011 developed a multitrack empirical approach to analyze the failure behavior of converters of offshore wind turbines and sufficient protection of converters was recommended however the uppermost drawback of using the present methods to theoretically compute reliability characteristics of fowts is the unneglectable analytic error for instance 13 in kang et al 2019 generally the conventional fta and its derived methods are naturally unprecise methodologies for reliability analysis of fowts since they can be used to calculate either the upper bound by minimum path set or the lower bound recurring to minimum cut set of reliability of fowts decision making according to such large errors may be unconvincing and risky moreover conventionally the reliability analysis of fowts call for different methods which is time and cost consuming for instance to estimate the reliability characteristics target i by fta and then ascertain critical components target ii by fmea arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 fmeca scheu et al 2019 or importance measure technique kang et al 2019 generally bayesian networks bns are more computationally precise than the fta method as they can deal better with correlated data secondly the predictive and diagnostic information propagation capabilities enable bns to accomplish reliability estimation and critical components identification of fowts within one model hence employing bns to carry out reliability analysis of fowts may benefit for both error reduction and analysis simplification on the other hand the correctness and efficiency of bns have been proved by their tremendous implantations such as in tien and kiureghian 2016 zhang et al 2016b khakzad and van gelder 2018 sýkora et al 2018 chang et al 2019 to this end as an extension of kang et al 2019 this paper presents a bn model to estimate reliability failure probability failure rate and mttf of a fowt and to ascertain critical systems components and reliability affecting factors of the fowt the well established software genie in version 2 1 was applied to construct the bn model in this study the software is widely used in bn modeling and calculation e g in cai et al 2018 and in meng et al 2019 the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the fowt considered in this paper section 3 presents the reliability analysis of the fowt at the system level results discussion and comparisons with fta at the global level of the fowt are provided in section 4 conclusions are provided in section 5 2 the fowt considered in this study the fowt considered in this study is the same as that what has been introduced in kang et al 2019 specifically the fowt consists of 5 systems with 34 components including some subsystems overall 80 root failure causes that lead to malfunctions of the fowt were considered in this study the 5 systems of the fowt are support structure s1 pitch system s2 gearbox s3 generator s4 and auxiliary system s5 the support structure provides support to the nacelle and consist of mooring subsystem tower and floating foundation uzunoglu et al 2016 the pitch system which is hydraulic driven is responsible for adjusting the angle of attack of the blades and consists of hydraulic subsystem alarm facilities and meteorological units the gearbox transforms high torque and low rotational speed from the main shaft to low torque and high rotating speed to the generator primarily assembled by gears and bearings the generator an assembly of rotor and stator converts mechanical energy to electricity the auxiliary system is a combination of speed train electrical components blades and yaw subsystem designed for ensuring high efficiency of energy production of the fowt the hierarchical structure of the fowt the fowt systems components considered in this study is shown in fig 1 the failure propagation of the fowt is represented in a fault tree ft model that was constructed in kang et al 2019 see fig 2 the ft is a hierarchical logic diagram that demonstrates how failures propagate through the fowt for instance the malfunction of the fowt is logically caused by a certain subsystem or a component which results from a combination of failure causes the malfunction of the fowt failures of components or subsystems and failure causes are top event intermediate events and basic events in the ft model respectively the hierarchical relationships among events are represented by logic gates e g and and or gates specifically and gate denotes the output event occurs only if all input events happened for instance alarm power failure a20 in the pitch system occur only if both the main power b40 and the backup power b41 fail an or gate reflects the output event occur if at least one input event happened for example the support structure fails s1 if one of its components fails that are mooring subsystem a01 tower a02 and floating foundation a03 the events definition of the ft model are listed in appendix a lifetime distributions of components as well as root causes of the fowt are preconditions for completing the reliability analysis of systems by using bns however the data of this study is insufficient to estimate the aforementioned distributions and likelihoods instead constant failure rate model see eq 1 was employed to transform the failure rates available reported in kang et al 2019 and as listed in appendix a of root failure causes to whose failure probabilities as a basis to drive the bn model that been created in this study specifically failure rates come from following sectors i offshore onshore reliability data oreda ii published references including arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 faulstich et al 2011 fischer et al 2011 pérez et al 2013 bharatbhai 2015 and santos et al 2015 iii experts opinions 1 p t 1 e λ t where p t is the failure probability of a failure cause at time t λ represents the failure rate of the corresponding failure cause two assumptions of estimating probabilities of failure causes of the fowt should be highlighted i the applied data can represent the failure characteristics of the fowt even though they may come from different offshore wind turbines installed in various wind farms ii failure data of root causes are independent the procedure of conducting reliability analysis of the fowt using bn as shown in fig 3 3 reliability analysis of the fowt at systems level using bayesian network 3 1 bayesian networks bns bns are composed of nodes and directed edges edges for short nodes represent random variables and edges are causal relationships between linked nodes nodes are split into parent nodes the one an edge starts with and child nodes the one an edge points to bobbio et al 2001 specifically root nodes without any parent are allocated marginal probability distributions while intermediate nodes are assigned with conditional probabilistic tables cpts borunda et al 2016 an edge pointing from a to b denotes the value of child node b probabilistically relies on the value of the parent node a roughly to say a influences on b and the strength of the influence defend by the cpt of node a parent node langseth and portinale 2007 top down predictive support reasoning and bottom up diagnostic support reasoning reasoning patterns are two typical information propagation processes of bns rebello et al 2018 specifically the top down reasoning pattern propagates information by the joint probability function as 2 p x 1 x 2 x n p x n x n 1 x n 2 x 1 p x n 1 x n 2 x n 3 x 1 p x 2 x 1 p x 1 i 1 n p x i x i 1 x i 2 x 1 however the conditional independence assumption of bns defines the state of a node only depends on the state s of its parent s on this basis the joint probability distribution of n independent variables in bns can be written as 3 p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a r e n t s x i while the bottom up reasoning pattern propagates information by conditional probability function or bayesian inference langseth et al 2009 li and mahadevan 2018 as 4 p x i x j p x i x j p x j p x j x i p x i p x j p x j x i p x i i p x j x i p x i where x 1 x 2 x n are independent variables p x 1 x 2 x n is their joint probability distribution and p a r e n t s x i represents parent nodes of x i the bns have been developed maturely aiming at modeling various engineering cases with practical restrictions for instance hierarchical bayesian networks hbns are developed to model the reliability of highly hierarchical structure of systems li and guedes soares 2019 dynamic bayesian networks dbns are created to consider and reasonably bring in dynamics to the reliability analysis or estimation of systems liu et al 2015 multi state bayesian networks mbns are proved to be flexible tools for representing systems with more than two states or whose failure can be divided into several phases mi et al 2018 however the complexity in the reasoning process of bn derived methodologies aforementioned are quite high compared with the standard bns jun and kim 2017 features e g the configuration of systems and the data available should be clarified to select a suitable tool from the group of bns including its derived technologies for the reliability analysis of an engineering case concerning the computational complexity and features of the fowt analyzed the standard bn was selected as an extension of conventional and popularly used fta methodology to model the reliability of the fowt the mapping algorithm from a ft to a bn is introduced as the following steps and is displayed in fig 4 the constructed bn model of the fowt malfunction is demonstrated in fig 5 nodes definition together with the root nodes failure rates are listed in appendix a step 1 map events in ft into nodes in bn draw nodes in bn for all events in ft labels and represented meanings of nodes are equal to the corresponding events for instance create 47 nodes in the sub bn model for 47 events in the ft model of the support structure step 2 map causal relationships in ft into edges in bn link nodes in bn by edges according to the causal relationships among events in ft an edge starts from a parent node an input event of a gate and points to a child node an output event of the gate for instance link a01 a02 and a03 start from to s1 points to separately for that a01 a02 and a03 are input events in the ft and s1 is the output event obey the same logic until all nodes in the sub bn are linked step 3 map logic of gates in ft into cpts in bn transform gates in ft into cpts of child nodes output events of the gate in bn specifically for an and gate the failure probability of a child node equal to 1 only if all parent nodes fail while for an or gate the failure probability of a child node equal to 1 if one of the parent nodes fails for instance a2 is an or gate for b02 b03 b04 and a06 and the cpt of which can be represented by 5 p a 02 w o r k 1 o n l y i f b 02 b 03 b 04 a n d a 06 w o r k p a 02 w o r k 0 e l s e additionally for an and gate such as a10 the son of b17 b18 and b19 whose cpt can be constructed as 6 p a 10 f a i l 1 o n l y i f b 17 b 18 a n d b 19 f a i l p a 10 f a i l 0 e l s e 3 2 the support structure the support structure of the fowt consists of a tower a floating foundation and a mooring subsystem the tower provides support to the nacelle the mooring subsystem and the floating foundation provide stable buoyancy and positioning to the upper structures diagnosis analysis of the sub bn model see fig 5 was conducted to test the contributors that result in malfunctions of the support structure according to the results calculated the malfunctions of the support structure mostly contribute by tower failures the probability of which is about 36 followed by mooring subsystem failure 34 and floating foundation failure 30 specifically the tower failures are most likely caused by tower collapse that resulted from harsh weather conditions such as strong wind strong waves and storms the probability of which is 83 the mooring subsystems failures most probably caused by mooring lines broken as a consequence of abnormal stress typhoon or storm carry dropped objects hitting floating foundation acts as the most crucial event since which contributes over 89 failures to the floating foundation from the probability point of view detailed primary contributors to the support structure s1 failure are represented in fig 6 with the results harsh environmental conditions such as strong wind strong waves storms typhoons and abnormal working conditions like abnormal stress should be considered when conducting failure analysis of the fowt at both design and operation stages precise and in time weather prediction is recommended for which allows implementation of preventive activities before extreme weather conditions happen besides reinforcing mooring lines and clean superfluous objects on the floating foundation are also suggested 3 3 the pitch system the hydraulic blade pitch system pitch system for short is the main part of the fowt which helps to minimize the risk of undesirable accidents under extreme weather conditions the pitch system guarantees high efficiency energy generation of the fowt by adjusting attack angle of the blades according to the diagnosis analysis of the pitch system the hydraulic system failure gives rise to the largest percentage of the pitch system failure about 83 followed by alarm facilities failure about 17 and wrong pitch angle around 0 01 hydraulic oil failure leads to more than 51 of hydraulic system failures oil leakage 1 6 times in probability of the second factor namely overpressure is an important contributor to hydraulic oil failures lightning protection failure and limit switch failure contribute equally to the alarm failures power failure and wrong pitch angle logically caused by abnormal vibration vane damage and anemometer damage have a very low impact on the failure of the pitch system numerically less than 0 3 and 0 1 respectively primary contributors to pitch system s2 failure are shown in fig 7 hydraulic oil failure lightning protection failure limit switch failure oil leakage and overpressure are primary contributors to pitch system failures periodic inspection to hydraulic oil may benefit for securing the safe and reliable operations to this system 3 4 gearbox the gearbox transforms high torque and low rotational speed from the main shaft to low torque and high rotational speed to the generator failures of gearboxes generally contribute considerable downtimes and cause a huge economic loss for the fowt the diagnosis analysis of the gearbox shows that gearbox stoppages mainly result from bearings failures the probability is more than 70 followed by gears failure 20 and lubrication failure 10 bearings failures are mainly the consequences of corrosion the probability of which is over 44 and abrasive wear 37 the riskiest failure mode for gearbox however is the gears failure result from abnormal vibration tooth wear cracks pitting and glued abnormal filter poor quality lubrication oil and dirty oil contribute 36 36 and 28 of lubrication failures of the gearbox respectively contributors to gearbox failure s3 are shown in fig 8 in terms of suggestions to avoid the gearbox failure measures like contacting stiffness reinforcement for gears before their installation and periodical inspection and replacement of hydraulic oil are highly recommended 3 5 generator the generator is an assembly of mechanical and electrical components which transforms mechanical energy into electricity the energy production efficiency of the fowt relies on high reliability high availability and low failure rate of the generator the leak is the most crucial failure mode for which is identified to give rise to over 77 failures to the generator compared with measurement facilities failure 15 and bearings failures around 8 from the probability standpoint in detail the bearings failures mainly caused by asymmetry 64 rotor and stator failures are complex but they contribute fewer malfunctions to the generator primary contributors to the generator s4 failure are listed in fig 9 with the results environmental factors and hardware failures have fewer impacts on malfunction of the generator since it is installed within the nacelle however failures such as leak measurement facilities and asymmetry are the main causes of the generator failures hence good manufacturing of the generator is of importance and which may helpful for avoiding failures of the generator 3 6 auxiliary system auxiliary system is an integration of speed train subsystem electric components blade subsystem and yaw subsystem speed train subsystem including low speed and high speed trains and a brake which controls axes rotational speed electric components are a collection of controllers sensors a converter and a transformer which adjust the energy production efficiency of the fowt blade subsystem consists of rotor hub rotor bearing and three blades which is assembled for receiving wind energy yaw subsystem is designed for turning blades directly facing the wind the results of diagnosis indicate that electric components failures mainly including controller failure sensors failure and converter failure contribute some 61 of auxiliary system failures followed by blade subsystem failure yaw subsystem failure and speed train subsystem failure which contribute 24 11 and 4 stoppages to the auxiliary system respectively specifically the hub brings about 61 of failures to the blade subsystem and drive trains result in 76 of speed train subsystem failures primary contributors to the auxiliary system s5 electric components blade subsystem yaw subsystem and speed train subsystem failure are listed in fig 10 robust design and optimized maintenance strategy for electric components are recommended for ensuring the safety of the auxiliary system since the failure frequency of which are quite high compared with other components and subsystems 4 results comparisons and discussion 4 1 reliability characteristics failure probability and reliability of the fowt and its systems were predicted according to the global bn model and the results are plotted in figs 11 and 12 respectively a power function with the expression f x a i x b i c i was selected among others due to its lowest root mean square error rmse when modeling the expressions of reliability and failure probability of systems of the fowt the results are listed table 1 this study concludes that the failure rate of the fowt is 7 9 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1103 26h by the end of 5 years working the predicted failure rate in this study was also compared with the one that has been concluded by fta method in kang et al 2019 7 3 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1199h and that from data collection in carroll et al 2016 8 3 failures per turbine per year with the mttf is 1055h see fig 13 the comparison reveals that reliability analysis for the fowt using bn is more precise than using fta for which decreased the error of the predicted failure rate from 13 to 4 5 the failure rate of offshore wind turbines published in carroll et al 2016 is mainly collected from fixed foundation offshore wind turbines and the failure rate of those should be smaller than the fowt considered in this study since the latter is more complicated than the former however limited by data size only 80 root failure causes of the fowt malfunction were considered in this study as a result the predicted failure rate of the fowt is smaller than that what been published in carroll et al 2016 indicating more failure causes and components are required to be analyzed for seeking a more precise reliability analysis result 4 2 importance measure importance measures are proposed to identify critical failure causes components and factors that expedite the fowt malfunctions the target ii of the reliability analysis of the fowt márquez et al 2016 a higher value of importance represents a more critical component or a failure factor of the fowt painuly 2001 kang et al 2019 this paper utilizes the diagnostic support information propagation capability of the constructed bn model to derive an importance measure for the fowt as 7 i b n i t p f c i f a i l u r e f o w t f a i l u r e where i b n i t is the importance of component i at the service time t measured by the bn model f o w t and f c i are the fowt and its component i by eq 7 critical systems components together with factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions can be identified and the results are listed in figs 14 and 15 it should be highlighted that this study accomplished the reliability analysis of the fowt in one bn model which is advanced than conventional reliability analysis methods since the latter require multiple methods to accomplish the same goal for instance conventional studies predict the reliability of fowts by fta method and seek their critical components by employing importance measure methods kang et al 2019 fmea arabian hoseynabadi et al 2010 or fmeca scheu et al 2019 in terms of importance measure of systems and factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions i the support structure has the highest probability of failure given that the fowt has been failed followed by the pitch system electric components generator etc see fig 14 the total importance of all systems components exceeds 1 indicating that dependent failures are existing ii structural defects or poor design such as abnormal stress is the most prominent factor leads to the fowt malfunctions which contributes 44 malfunctions to the fowt meanwhile 32 malfunctions of the fowt result from harsh environmental conditions like storms operational factors contribute 13 malfunctions to the fowt such as human errors and materials damage or degeneration contribute 11 malfunctions to the fowt such as materials wear and fatigue are the third and fourth primary factors that lead to the fowt malfunctions see fig 15 with the results of the importance measure of assembly units of the fowt see fig 16 i the tower devices of the mooring subsystem and others are recognized to be critical assembly units ii floating foundation failure caused by dropped objects hitting and others is identified to be a critical failure of the fowt moreover fig 16 reveals a negative correlation relationship between events reliability and their importance which could be said that a component or a system or a reliability affecting factor with low reliability would contribute more failure to the fowt and they require more attention in both design and operation stages of the fowt according to the type of data that been used in this study other importance measure methods that are birnbaum s method andrews and beeson 2003 structural importance and fussell vesely method meng 2000 márquez et al 2016 are computed and which to be compared with bn diagnosis results calculated in this study note that structural importance is a particular case of birnbaum s method coping with the situation of unavailable components probabilities the structural importance usually employed in design stage of fowts 8 i b i t r s t r i t f s t f i t 9 i s t r i t r s t r i t f s t f i t r i t f i t 0 5 in eqs 8 and 9 i b i t and i s t r i t are the importance of component i measured by birnbaum s method and structural importance method r s t and f s t are reliability and failure probability functions of the fowt while r i t and f i t are reliability and failure probability functions of component i all variables in these equations are defined at the serves time t 10 i f v i t f i d i t f s t where i f v i t is the importance of component i measured by the fussell vesely method f i d i t denotes the probability of at least one minimum cut set contains component i occurred f s t is failure probability function of the fowt all variables in this equation are defined at the serves time t a comparison between bn diagnosis proposed in this study structural importance birnbaum s importance and fussell vesely importance is conducted see fig 17 the results of structural importance and birnbaum importance are almost the same since both methods are unconditional algorithms the analogous conclusion can be drawn from the results calculated by the fussell vesely method and bn diagnosis both are conditional algorithms slight differences were found between structural importance and birnbaum importance and between fussell vesely importance and bn diagnosis however the evidence is insufficient to prove that the importance calculated by each method is excessive or inadequate but it is obvious that conditional algorithms are more sensitive to failure probabilities of basic events the results of comparison reveal that bn diagnosis can be employed as an elaborate importance measure method when data sufficient from the analysis other conclusions as follows are recommended 1 structural and birnbaum importance are suggested to be used in the system design stage of fowts since data in this stage is usually insufficient while fussell vesely importance and bn diagnosis are recommended to be applied in the operational stage of fowts for the data sufficient reason moreover bn diagnosis has the same accuracy as fussell vesely importance however is not highly recommended for the complexity in modeling and calculation reasons 2 typhoon leak of generator storm strong wind and waves control failure oil leakage abnormal stress sensors failure overpressure of hydraulic system yaw subsystem failure and the hub failure are the top 10 important events that should be focused on and preventive actions are recommended to be implemented to avoid their occurrences it should be pointed out that the top 10 critical events for malfunctions of the fowt are concluded from only failure probability point of view failure severity downtime the complexity of maintenances and cost of failure are unneglectable factors required to be considered for the further comprehensive reliability analysis reliability of the fowt will increase given that its components are upgraded components upgrade however are always costly a balance should be made between the costs of components upgrade and the reliability improvement of the fowt which is a big concern to all stakeholders to this end the relations between failure probabilities of top 10 failure factors according to the results of importance measure and that of the fowt s are accomplished see fig 18 according to fig 18 approximate linear relation between failure probability of each in top 10 failure factors and that of the fowt s with the slope of 0 1 are determined indicating that 10 reliability improvement of each component brings a mere 1 reliability improvement to the fowt hence quality upgrading for all components likely has the same contribution to the reliability improvement of fowts indicating that components with low value should be considered firstly when upgrade or redesign the fowt however it should be highlighted that other than failure probability of the fowt other factors like the severity of failure modes as well as profit loss not limited to are of importance factors that call for serious consideration when upgrade or redesign the fowt 5 conclusions this paper established a bn model to conduct reliability analysis of a fowt failure probability reliability failure rate and mttf at certain working time of the fowt and its systems were concluded by using the bn model the support structure was identified as the most failure prone system experiencing around 3 5 failures per year followed by the auxiliary system 1 7 failures per year pitch system 1 4 failures per year generator 0 97 failures per year and gearbox 0 32 failures per year 7 9 failures per year with the mttf of 1103h of the fowt was predicted indicating that reliability analysis using bn is more precise than the fta method where the error of predicted mttf decreased from 13 to about 4 5 moreover importance measures were determined based on bn diagnosis by which critical systems components as well as the failure modes of the fowt were determined furthermore the origins of the fowt failures e g structural defect or bad design contributes 44 of the fowt failures harsh environment conditions 32 operational factors 13 and materials damage and degeneration 11 were obtained a comparison analysis between traditional importance measure methods and the bn diagnosis was implemented for proving the correctness of utilizing bn diagnosis to conduct importance measure for the fowt the results revealed that very fewer difference exist between the results of bn diagnosis and the outcomes of fussell vesely method however the following aspects should be considered in the future i correlations among failure causes such as common cause components failures and the dependence of various weather conditions ii probabilistic relationships between nodes in the bn model will apply instead of determined relationships form the ft logic iii

21383,a 3d experimental investigation is conducted to simultaneously measure the motions of tunnel and pontoon of a tunnel immersion system under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the importance of wave incident direction on coupled dynamics of the system tunnel motion pontoon motion relative motion suspension tensions and mooring tensions is discussed in terms of various wave periods and immersion depths it is concluded that the sensitivity of the system dynamics to the wave incident direction is strongly dependent on wave period and immersion depth the wave heading angle plays a more important role in smaller immersion depth and when the wave period is close to certain natural periods or in relatively long wave regime for the small immersion depth the oblique wave excitations compared to the beam waves can incur higher tensile forces in the suspension lines and the mooring lines of the tunnel keywords coupled dynamics tunnel pontoon system oblique waves immersion depth 3d experiments 1 introduction the immersed tunnels have attracted broad interests worldwide for underwater transportations with distinct advantages including less visual and environmental impact greater efficiency of the construction and installation better adaptability to the seabed bathymetry etc nowadays the immersed tunnel concept confronts more complex engineering conditions and higher technical standards with the developing trend towards large scale element increased water depth and with sites further from shore during the construction in offshore sites the controlled lowering of tunnel elements is a complex and crucial process to reduce the cost of offshore installation one primary challenge is to increase the weather window and to avoid unexpected delays to achieve this accurate assessment for the performance of immersed tunnel and installation rigs is desired although considerable research efforts have been exerted to the immersed tunnel technologies most of the reported literature is focused on seismic response and foundation treatment as described in aono et al 2004 ding et al 2006 kasper et al 2008 and li et al 2014 regarding tunnel element immersion under wave action only a few experimental and numerical studies were carried out in the case of the experimental models zhou et al 2001 zhan and wang 2001 and xiao et al 2010 performed model tests to measure the tensions in the mooring and suspension lines for the towing and immersion of the tunnel element across rivers under a few wave and current conditions moreover extensive 3d experimental studies have been conducted by song et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 and huang et al 2015 2016 2019 on the tunnel motions and suspending tensions during the immersion standby and immersion stages considering the effects of negative buoyancy wave height and wave period with regard to the numerical models chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn et al 2009 applied motsim to investigate the motions of the tunnel during immersion but only limited numerical data were presented however most research work is devoted on the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel in beam waves and therefore have limited application in oblique seas scenarios recently yang et al 2018 built a numerical model within orcaflex and presented the sway heave and roll of the tunnel element barge in regular waves of various incident directions but the effect of the incident wave period and immersion depth on the sensitivity of the system dynamics to the wave heading angle was not analyzed in terms of the immersion process the tunnel motions are closely correlated to the pontoon motions which are both affected by wave loads mooring system and mechanical couplings this is essentially the hydrodynamic response of a multi floater system under wave actions which has been investigated by many researchers koo and kim et al 2005 applied a time domain multi hull mooring riser coupled dynamics analysis program to analyze the hydrodynamic interaction and mechanical coupling effects of two floating platforms connected by elastic lines martinelli 2008 and michailides 2013 performed experimental and numerical study to examine the effect of the floating breakwaters layouts on its hydrodynamic performance under normal and oblique waves sun et al 2012 investigated numerically the interaction effects between a substructure and an installation barge during the float over installation in a directional sea state loukogeorgaki et al 2014 assessed the structural response of a modular floating breakwater under the action of perpendicular and oblique regular and irregular waves as evidenced by the above analysis there is currently a lack of specific study on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system exposed to oblique waves and further research is need to de risk and advance installation methods to fill this major research gap a 3d experimental investigation is conducted to measure the motions of the tunnel and pontoon simultaneously under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the emphasis is on the combined effects of the wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth on the coupled dynamics of the system tunnel motion pontoon motion relative motion suspension tensions and mooring tensions moreover special attention is also paid to capture the worst case scenario for the tunnel immersion system with various wave heading angles and wave periods in long wave regime the paper is structured as section 2 provide detailed introduction of the experimental setup and typical test conditions the combined effects of the wave period and wave heading angle on the coupling behavior of the tunnel immersion system for different immersion depths are evaluated in section 3 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental facility and the physical model experiments are carried out in the wave basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40m long 24m wide and 1 2m deep it is equipped with a piston type wave maker at one end of the basin capable of generating designed waves ranging from simple small amplitude monochromatic waves to large amplitude random waves in multi directions the wave maker consists of 70 active pistons which further absorbed wave energy reflected back to it moreover to minimize the undesirable wave reflections and to achieve unidirectional incident waves a gravel beach and wave absorbers are also placed respectively on the other end and the two lateral sides of the basin sketches of the plan and the side view of the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 knowing that the dynamic motion of the structure is governed by the gravitational effect and inertia forces the froude s law was employed for relating the model to prototype the scale of 1 60 is chosen by considering important factors such as water depth and wave generating capability the sketch of the models is shown in fig 2 the geometrical and structural characteristics of the tunnel and pontoon are presented in table 1 to achieve the similarity of mass dimensions and other key mechanical parameters the tunnel element model is constructed with concrete and acrylic while light wood was used to fabricate the immersion rig model during the tests the water depth is fixed as 60 cm moreover two immersion depths of the tunnel element d 1 7 cm and 17 cm are considered corresponding to the relative immersion depth d d max 0 04 and 0 40 d is the distance measured from the free surface to the top surface of the element and d max is the maximum of this distance which happens when the element is at rest on seabed as shown in fig 1b the purpose of a mooring system is to limit the movement of a floating structure such that it remains in its operational region in this study the tunnel and immersion rigs are positioned by four mooring lines for each the mooring system consists of 12 mooring lines in total as illustrated in fig 1 for each floater the four mooring lines are symmetrically placed along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis the pretension on the mooring lines is set as 1n to achieve a better constraint on the floaters moreover each pontoon is connected with the tunnel model with two suspending lines according to the relative immersion depths of d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the lengths of the suspension lines are l 14 3 cm and 29 3 cm respectively and are calibrated by linear springs in the experiments for the suspension lines the initial tension is set as 8 8n due to the 1 5 overweight of the element more detailed parameters regarding the mooring lines and suspending line are presented in table 2 in the experiments mooring lines are made of stiff cotton ropes combined with clump weights such that the mass per unit length would satisfy the gravity similarity in addition several segmented linear springs are used to match the targeted axial elasticity of the mooring lines based on eqn 1 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 where t m is the model tension and c p the elasticity modulus δs s the relative elongation and n 1 5 for the prototype wire fig 3 gives the theoretical and simulated tension deformation curves for the mooring and suspending lines it can be seen that excellent agreements are achieved for the mooring system 2 2 measurement equipment prior to the installation of the floating bodies the wave elevations and wave lengths are measured by wave probes of resistance type placed where the structure is to be installed the wave height and the wave period are checked till errors are within 5 to address the coupling effects of the tunnel pontoon system the movements of the tunnel pontoon and tensile forces in mooring suspension lines are measured synchronously for each test as plotted in fig 1 sixteen tensile gauges are separately arranged in the mooring suspension lines to measure the tensions in addition the six degrees of freedom of the tunnel and the seaward pontoon are measured using an electromagnetic motion system as shown in fig 4 two transmitters are fastened on the central surface of the tunnel element and pontoon and the receiver is fixed upon the tunnel pontoon system which achieve a non contact measurement the motion measuring apparatus records the real time six dofs with an accuracy better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 for rotations the defined coordinate system of the six dofs is given in fig 5 considering the present experimental setup the sampling frequency of all the measurements is set as 50hz to acquire the responses with good temporal resolution 2 3 experimental conditions as mentioned before in the experiments two immersion depths of the tunnel element d 1 5 cm and 16 7 cm are chosen and for each immersion depth a series of tests have been conducted for the variety of wave periods and wave heading angles four wave directions described with heading angle θ are investigated turning from beam seas to quartering seas including 0 15 30 and 45 in the case of θ 90 the tunnel immersion model is placed in the basin with its longitudinal axis parallel to the wave maker fig 1 the cases of oblique waves are achieved by the appropriate counter clockwise rotation of the whole immersion system the tunnel rigs and mooring lines around the origin of coordinates fig 5 for each wave direction ten wave periods t were considered varying from 0 77s to 2 58s the wave conditions in the test are tabulated in table 3 fig 6 provides the plan view of the experimental set up for θ 30 as an example and also a snapshot from the experiments are included in fig 7 2 4 analysis method the motion amplitude of the tunnel pontoon is defined as the oscillation amplitude relative to its mean position in waves for instance sway amplitude maximum sway value minimum sway value 2 the tensions of the mooring and suspension lines are analyzed with the maximum values measured in time series moreover in section 3 the results of the motions and tensions are all normalized by the wave amplitude a fixed as 1 66 cm in this study moreover it is pointed out that the natural periods of the coupled immersion system have been determined through the implementation of modal analysis by numerical model built in ansys aqwa considering the given wave conditions of t 0 77s 2 58s the natural periods of modes 10 14 are within the range of the test scope the natural periods and eigenvectors of these modes for different immersion depth d d max 0 04 and 0 40 are tabulated in table 4 the whole results of the modal analysis can be referred to song et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions of the coupled tunnel immersion system figs 8 13 include amplitudes of the six dofs of the tunnel pontoon and their synchronous relative motion for different immersion depths d d max 0 04 and 0 40 with various wave heading angles θ 0 45 the wave periods are taken to be 0 77s 2 58s and the wave height is 3 33 cm as shown by figs 8 13 it can be concluded that all of the motion responses are very sensitive to the wave incident angle and this sensitivity varies with immersion depth and wave period fig 8 indicates that for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the beam waves θ 0 introduce the largest amplitude of the tunnel sway in the full range of wave periods which can be due to the fact that the wave obliquity drives down the wave excitation force in the sway direction for all the examined wave incident directions the tunnel s sway gets a gradual increasing trend with the enlarge of the wave period specifically for d d max 0 40 a local peak is observed at t 1 56s which can be attributed to the existence of the roll resonance with regard to the sway of the pontoon the obliquity of the incident wave increase of θ leads to generally smaller amplitude for d d max 0 04 as the wave period increases the pontoon sway presents a subtle local peak at t 1 03s which can be due to the excitation of the amplified roll and an increasing trend is observed in relatively long waves of t 1 29s in contrast for d d max 0 40 as the wave period enlarges the sway amplitude of the pontoon has a slight downward trend until it reaches its minimum value at t 1 16s followed by a noticeable upward trend the relative sway exhibits a similar tendency towards the wave period as the pontoon sway for relatively short waves t 1 29s however for longer wave the increasing trend of the relative sway is much smoother than that of the tunnel pontoon sway additionally the results also show that the obliquity of the incident waves induce a general reduction in the relative sway for t 1 29s while for a long wave regime of t 1 81s the relative sway between the tunnel and pontoon is more significant in oblique waves compared to the beam waves the largest relative sway occurs at t 1 29 s and θ 0 for d d max 0 04 this should be considered carefully during the operation since it raises the risk of collision between the tunnel and pontoons given the narrow space between the tunnel and pontoon 3 3 cm from fig 9 it is indicated that for d d max 0 04 the surge of the tunnel pontoon slightly affected by the wave incident direction for relatively short waves of t 1 29 except for the diminished surge of the pontoon with increasing wave heading angle at t 1 03s however when t 1 58s increasing wave heading angle leads to greater surge amplitude in both the tunnel and pontoon for example compared to the results in beam waves the tunnel s surge with θ 45 approaches five times larger and it is triple for the pontoon s surge for d d max 0 40 the influence of the wave incident direction is limited on the surge of the tunnel pontoon for t 1 29 while for longer waves the oblique waves induce significantly enlarged amplitudes than the beam waves furthermore it can be seen that in the beam and oblique waves the curves of the tunnel pontoon s surge behave in an analogous manner against the wave period for d d max 0 04 the variation of the surge amplitude of the tunnel pontoon is small for relatively short waves of t 1 03s and a local peak is observed around t 1 03s 1 16s corresponding to the natural frequency of mode no 12 the in phase roll of the tunnel and pontoons while an enlarge of the surge amplitude is induced by further longer waves getting another local peak at t 2 32 s which can be associated with the response amplification of mode no 11 the antiphase surge of the two pontoons on the other hand for d d max 0 40 the wave period has quite limited influence on the tunnel pontoon surge when exposed to short waves of t 1 29s while the surge amplitude is greater under longer wave actions and it fluctuates with the wave period getting its maximum value at t 1 56s 1 81s close to the natural frequency of mode no 12 or t 2 58s close to the natural frequency of mode no 11 correspondingly due to the tunnel s surge smaller than the pontoon s surge the relative surge exhibits similar tendencies against the impact factors wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth as the pontoon s surge comparing the statistical results for different immersion depths in fig 10 it can be found that the heave amplitude of the tunnel tends to decrease as the immersion depth enlarges and this also affects the pontoon through the connecting suspension lines this fact is primarily due to the appreciable reduction in the wave induced forces with larger water depth moreover it can also be seen that by increasing the wave period the heave of the tunnel pontoon and the relative heave are initially increased rapidly and then decreased getting their maximum at t 1 56s followed by a slight decrease this trend can be related to the excitation of the heave resonance when the wave period close to the heave period of the rigid connected tunnel pontoon system as reported by song et al 2018 regarding the effect of the wave heading angle one can note that larger θ causes smaller heave amplitude of the tunnel this trend is most intensified when the wave period is close to the heave period which demonstrates that the wave obliquity the enlarge of θ attenuate the resonant excitation of the heave particularly for d d max 0 04 the reduction of the tunnel s heave is prominent as 50 at t 1 55s from θ 0 to θ 45 and it is 38 for d d max 0 40 in contrast the effect of the wave heading angle on the heave amplitude of the pontoon is much smaller as θ enlarges there is only an evident downward trend in the pontoon s heave at t 1 55s 1 81s with respect to the relative heave the wave incident direction shows limited effect within the wave period range of t 0 77s 1 03s for d d max 0 04 and d d max 0 40 whereas for longer wave of t 1 29s the relative heave is substantially increased with increasing wave heading angle especially for oblique waves of θ 30 and 45 the relative heave amplitudes can be duple or triple of those in beam waves this can be attributed to the more significant diminish of the tunnel s heave amplitude compared to the pontoon heave and the widened phase lag between the tunnel and pontoon due to oblique waves in fig 11 as the wave period enlarges the tunnel pontoon s roll shows firstly an upward trend and then a downward trend getting its largest magnitude at t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 81s for d d max 0 40 which corresponds to the in phase roll period of the tunnel and pontoons mode no 12 meanwhile the increasing of the wave heading angle causes a decrease in the tunnel pontoon roll most importantly it can also be found that the wave obliquity is more influential with smaller immersion depth and the diminish is most significant with the incident wave period around the roll period for d d max 0 04 and t 1 16s compared to the beam waves the rolls of the tunnel and pontoon can be cut by 75 and 84 with θ 45 respectively whereas with d d max 0 40 the maximum reduction occurring at t 1 81s is 45 for the tunnel roll and 50 for the pontoon roll in addition with larger immersion depth the influential scope of the wave heading angle on the tunnel pontoon roll also becomes narrower for d d max 0 04 by increasing wave heading angle the tunnel pontoon rolls are reduced within a relatively wide range of wave period t 0 90 1 81s however for d d max 0 40 the reduction only focuses when the wave period close to the roll period t 1 55 1 81s and for wave period far away from the roll period it is much smaller and even negligible moreover this further results in the fact the curve trend of the roll amplitude against the wave period is somewhat changed with the varying wave incident direction for example for d d max 0 04 the tunnel pontoon rolls get their maximum amplitudes at t 1 16s with θ 0 and 15 while the peak are shifted to t 1 81s for θ 30 and 45 accordingly the relative roll also reaches its peak values around the coupled roll period of system t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 55s for d d max 0 40 it is also seen that the peak value is significantly enlarged with larger immersion depth which can be attributed to the increased roll resonance amplitude of the tunnel for d d max 0 04 the relative roll is not very sensitive to the wave incident direction however for d d max 0 40 a noticeable decrease with increased wave heading angle can be observed at the roll period t 1 55 s as revealed in fig 12 for d d max 0 04 the oblique waves can introduce larger pitch amplitude in the tunnel compared to beam waves and this observation is most notable in a long wave period domain of t 1 29 s this could result in greater bending moment on the long tunnel element and also exert an undesirable effect on the operability of the tunnel immersion in contrast with the enlarged immersion depth d d max 0 40 the effect of the wave heading angle on the tunnel s pitch only focus in a slight increase within the wave period range t 1 29 1 58s and for the other wave periods it is found to be limited on the other hand the pitch amplitude of the pontoon is affected significantly by the resonance phenomenon of mode no 13 the anti phase pitch of the two pontoons and exhibits local peaks around t 0 90 s except for the cases of θ 30 45 and d d max 0 40 it can also be seen that compared to the tunnel s pitch the oblique wave contributes more to enlarge the pitch amplitude of the pontoon for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the greatest amplitude of the pontoon pitch occurs at t 0 90 s and θ 15 consequently under the combined effects of the wave heading angle wave period and immersion depth the relative pitch behaves in an analogous manner as the pontoon pitch it is evident in fig 13 that for yaw amplitude of the tunnel than the beam waves for different immersion depths this is especially true for the long wave domain t 1 16 s where the tunnel yaw of θ 45 approaches 5 times that of θ 0 considering the large size of the tunnel element the enlarged yaw would raise the risk of the collision between the tunnel and pontoon for relatively small immersion depth with respect to the effect of the wave period the tunnel yaw is enlarged with increasing wave period for t 1 56 s and the increasing tendency is much more rapid exposed to the oblique waves than to beam waves however for further longer waves the tunnel yaw remains almost steady it can also be found in fig 13 that the yaw of the pontoon is affected by the roll resonance and gets its local peak around the roll period t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 81s for d d max 0 40 the oblique waves also induce greater yaw amplitude of the pontoon especially for t 1 03s with d d max 0 04 and t 1 29s with d d max 0 40 subsequently the amplitude of the relative yaw is close to the pontoon s yaw and they also share similar tendency towards wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth 3 2 tensile forces in the suspension and mooring lines to investigate the tension distribution of the four suspension lines their average values avg and standard deviation std are discussed in this study the avg and std values are obtained respectively by eqn 2 and 3 2 f a v g 1 4 i 1 4 f i 3 f s t d 1 4 i 1 4 f i f a v g 2 where f i represents the single suspension tension in the four suspension lines fig 14 displays the statistical results in the maximum suspension tensions with the average and standard deviation values for different wave incident directions it can be seen that as the wave period enlarges the maximum suspension tension f max fig 14a and the standard deviation f std fig 14c gain a general increase and reach their largest values around the roll period t 1 03s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 56 s for d d max 0 40 followed by a decrease moreover for the average values of the suspension tension f avg in fig 14b the increase of the wave period leads to a subtle peak for short wave regime of t 0 77 1 58 s but it has no significant influence for further longer waves for the effect of the wave incident direction it can be concluded the wave heading angle has a considerable influence on the suspension tensions and this effect varies with the wave period and immersion depth for the small immersion depth d d max 0 04 the obliquity of the incident waves introduces greater f max along with enlarged standard deviation values f std compared to the beam waves for example the waves of θ 15 induces the largest f max and f std for t 0 77 0 90s and for t 1 03 s and 2 58s the greatest tension locates at θ 45 for the other wave periods the waves of θ 30 introduce larger values than other wave heading angles with regard to f avg the results do not allow a conclusive diagnosis most importantly in the examined range of wave periods the maximum suspension tension f max for d d max 0 04 is observed to be most drastic at t 1 03s with θ 45 which is 30 greater than the greatest f max due to beam waves t 1 03s and θ 0 this is probably because the oblique wave excitations incur greater relative roll in fig 11 and the consequent larger standard deviation in fig 14c thus the condition of t 1 03s with θ 45 can be regarded as the worst case scenario for the dynamic responses of the system at d d max 0 04 it further demonstrates that the importance of the oblique waves should be considered carefully to ensure the worst case scenario captured for an accurate prediction of the system dynamics furthermore for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the enlarge of the wave heading angle leads to smaller suspension tensions f max f avg and f std for most cases of the wave periods this implies that the oblique waves contribute to a more even tension distribution among the four suspension lines and consequently the maximum suspension tension f max occurs at θ 0 and t 1 56 s the maximum mooring line tensions of the tunnel and pontoon are included in fig 15 with various wave heading angels θ 0 45 for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the other wave conditions are t 0 77s 2 58s and h 3 33 cm for d d 0 04 the mooring line tension of the tunnel shows different trend against the wave period for various wave heading angles for relatively short waves of t 1 29s as for longer waves of t 1 55s the mooring line tension shows a significant increase with the enlarged wave period besides it can be also seen that for t 1 29 s the mooring tension of the tunnel has greater values for θ 30 and 45 than that of θ 0 and 15 for example at t 1 16s the mooring tension at θ 30 is increased by 80 compared to the case of θ 0 in contrast for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the increase of the wave heading angle causes a slight reduction in the mooring tension of the tunnel moreover the mooring tension of the tunnel exhibits a general upward trend as the wave period enlarges except for a small drop at t 1 55s on the other hand the mooring line tension of the pontoon has a general increasing trend with the increased wave period for d d max 0 04 whereas for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the mooring tension of the pontoon gains an evident increase with the increase of wave period for t 1 55s while for t 1 29s the influence of the wave period becomes insignificant furthermore it is also worthy to point out that for small immersion depth d d max 0 04 the wave incident direction plays a more important role in the mooring tension of the pontoon than the cases of d d max 0 40 for d d max 0 04 and t 1 29s 2 32s the beam waves generate the largest mooring tension of the pontoon however for other cases of wave periods the oblique waves can introduce larger mooring tension of the pontoon than the beam waves for example for t 0 90s the mooring tension of the pontoon at θ 45 is 28 greater than that of θ 0 with regard to the cases of d d max 0 40 the increase of the wave period does not lead to any significant change on the mooring tension of the pontoon for t 1 29s similar phenomenon can also be observed with the enlarge of the wave heading angle whereas in long wave domain of t 1 55s the mooring tension of the pontoon exhibits a gradual increase with increasing wave period a significant influence of the wave incident direction can be observed at t 1 55s and t 2 58s and the mooring tension of the pontoon is increased by 35 for θ 15 at t 1 55s and by 32 at θ 45 for t 2 58 s at t 2 58s 4 conclusions a 3d experimental study was implemented for assessing the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the main conclusions of this investigation are given as the below the coupled motions of the tunnel and pontoons and the tensions of the suspension and mooring lines are very sensitive to the wave incident angle and this sensitivity varies with immersion depth and wave period the sway heave and roll of the tunnel pontoon exhibit a general decreasing trend with the increase of the wave heading angle the wave obliquity the enlarge of the heading angle θ significantly weaken the resonant excitations of the tunnel pontoon in the heave and roll directions with regard to the surge pitch and yaw of the tunnel pontoon the oblique waves could introduce larger amplitude than the cases of beam waves and this is especially true in long wave regime of t 1 55s this may exert an undesirable effect on the operability of the tunnel immersion for t 1 29s greater relative sway and yaw are observed in oblique waves compared to beam waves this should be considered carefully during the preliminary immersion stage since it could raise the risk of the collision between the tunnel and pontoon meanwhile the relative heave is substantially increased with the increase of wave heading angle the wave incident direction plays a more important role in the coupled dynamics of the system with smaller immersion depth for d d max 0 04 the maximum suspension tension f max is largest at t 1 03s with θ 45 which is 30 greater than the greatest f max due to beam waves t 1 03s and θ 0 this could be attributed to the greater relative roll and the consequent larger standard deviation of the suspension line tensions moreover the oblique wave excitations can also introduce higher mooring tension of the tunnel than the beam waves these further demonstrated that the importance of the oblique waves should be considered carefully to ensure the worst case scenario captured for an accurate prediction of the system dynamics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

21383,a 3d experimental investigation is conducted to simultaneously measure the motions of tunnel and pontoon of a tunnel immersion system under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the importance of wave incident direction on coupled dynamics of the system tunnel motion pontoon motion relative motion suspension tensions and mooring tensions is discussed in terms of various wave periods and immersion depths it is concluded that the sensitivity of the system dynamics to the wave incident direction is strongly dependent on wave period and immersion depth the wave heading angle plays a more important role in smaller immersion depth and when the wave period is close to certain natural periods or in relatively long wave regime for the small immersion depth the oblique wave excitations compared to the beam waves can incur higher tensile forces in the suspension lines and the mooring lines of the tunnel keywords coupled dynamics tunnel pontoon system oblique waves immersion depth 3d experiments 1 introduction the immersed tunnels have attracted broad interests worldwide for underwater transportations with distinct advantages including less visual and environmental impact greater efficiency of the construction and installation better adaptability to the seabed bathymetry etc nowadays the immersed tunnel concept confronts more complex engineering conditions and higher technical standards with the developing trend towards large scale element increased water depth and with sites further from shore during the construction in offshore sites the controlled lowering of tunnel elements is a complex and crucial process to reduce the cost of offshore installation one primary challenge is to increase the weather window and to avoid unexpected delays to achieve this accurate assessment for the performance of immersed tunnel and installation rigs is desired although considerable research efforts have been exerted to the immersed tunnel technologies most of the reported literature is focused on seismic response and foundation treatment as described in aono et al 2004 ding et al 2006 kasper et al 2008 and li et al 2014 regarding tunnel element immersion under wave action only a few experimental and numerical studies were carried out in the case of the experimental models zhou et al 2001 zhan and wang 2001 and xiao et al 2010 performed model tests to measure the tensions in the mooring and suspension lines for the towing and immersion of the tunnel element across rivers under a few wave and current conditions moreover extensive 3d experimental studies have been conducted by song et al 2015 2016 2018 2019 and huang et al 2015 2016 2019 on the tunnel motions and suspending tensions during the immersion standby and immersion stages considering the effects of negative buoyancy wave height and wave period with regard to the numerical models chakrabarti et al 2008 and cozijn et al 2009 applied motsim to investigate the motions of the tunnel during immersion but only limited numerical data were presented however most research work is devoted on the hydrodynamic responses of the tunnel in beam waves and therefore have limited application in oblique seas scenarios recently yang et al 2018 built a numerical model within orcaflex and presented the sway heave and roll of the tunnel element barge in regular waves of various incident directions but the effect of the incident wave period and immersion depth on the sensitivity of the system dynamics to the wave heading angle was not analyzed in terms of the immersion process the tunnel motions are closely correlated to the pontoon motions which are both affected by wave loads mooring system and mechanical couplings this is essentially the hydrodynamic response of a multi floater system under wave actions which has been investigated by many researchers koo and kim et al 2005 applied a time domain multi hull mooring riser coupled dynamics analysis program to analyze the hydrodynamic interaction and mechanical coupling effects of two floating platforms connected by elastic lines martinelli 2008 and michailides 2013 performed experimental and numerical study to examine the effect of the floating breakwaters layouts on its hydrodynamic performance under normal and oblique waves sun et al 2012 investigated numerically the interaction effects between a substructure and an installation barge during the float over installation in a directional sea state loukogeorgaki et al 2014 assessed the structural response of a modular floating breakwater under the action of perpendicular and oblique regular and irregular waves as evidenced by the above analysis there is currently a lack of specific study on the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system exposed to oblique waves and further research is need to de risk and advance installation methods to fill this major research gap a 3d experimental investigation is conducted to measure the motions of the tunnel and pontoon simultaneously under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the emphasis is on the combined effects of the wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth on the coupled dynamics of the system tunnel motion pontoon motion relative motion suspension tensions and mooring tensions moreover special attention is also paid to capture the worst case scenario for the tunnel immersion system with various wave heading angles and wave periods in long wave regime the paper is structured as section 2 provide detailed introduction of the experimental setup and typical test conditions the combined effects of the wave period and wave heading angle on the coupling behavior of the tunnel immersion system for different immersion depths are evaluated in section 3 finally conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental facility and the physical model experiments are carried out in the wave basin of the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe dalian university of technology china the basin is 40m long 24m wide and 1 2m deep it is equipped with a piston type wave maker at one end of the basin capable of generating designed waves ranging from simple small amplitude monochromatic waves to large amplitude random waves in multi directions the wave maker consists of 70 active pistons which further absorbed wave energy reflected back to it moreover to minimize the undesirable wave reflections and to achieve unidirectional incident waves a gravel beach and wave absorbers are also placed respectively on the other end and the two lateral sides of the basin sketches of the plan and the side view of the experimental setup are shown in fig 1 knowing that the dynamic motion of the structure is governed by the gravitational effect and inertia forces the froude s law was employed for relating the model to prototype the scale of 1 60 is chosen by considering important factors such as water depth and wave generating capability the sketch of the models is shown in fig 2 the geometrical and structural characteristics of the tunnel and pontoon are presented in table 1 to achieve the similarity of mass dimensions and other key mechanical parameters the tunnel element model is constructed with concrete and acrylic while light wood was used to fabricate the immersion rig model during the tests the water depth is fixed as 60 cm moreover two immersion depths of the tunnel element d 1 7 cm and 17 cm are considered corresponding to the relative immersion depth d d max 0 04 and 0 40 d is the distance measured from the free surface to the top surface of the element and d max is the maximum of this distance which happens when the element is at rest on seabed as shown in fig 1b the purpose of a mooring system is to limit the movement of a floating structure such that it remains in its operational region in this study the tunnel and immersion rigs are positioned by four mooring lines for each the mooring system consists of 12 mooring lines in total as illustrated in fig 1 for each floater the four mooring lines are symmetrically placed along the x axis and arranged with an inclined 60 angle against the x axis the pretension on the mooring lines is set as 1n to achieve a better constraint on the floaters moreover each pontoon is connected with the tunnel model with two suspending lines according to the relative immersion depths of d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the lengths of the suspension lines are l 14 3 cm and 29 3 cm respectively and are calibrated by linear springs in the experiments for the suspension lines the initial tension is set as 8 8n due to the 1 5 overweight of the element more detailed parameters regarding the mooring lines and suspending line are presented in table 2 in the experiments mooring lines are made of stiff cotton ropes combined with clump weights such that the mass per unit length would satisfy the gravity similarity in addition several segmented linear springs are used to match the targeted axial elasticity of the mooring lines based on eqn 1 1 t m c p d p 2 δ s s n λ 3 where t m is the model tension and c p the elasticity modulus δs s the relative elongation and n 1 5 for the prototype wire fig 3 gives the theoretical and simulated tension deformation curves for the mooring and suspending lines it can be seen that excellent agreements are achieved for the mooring system 2 2 measurement equipment prior to the installation of the floating bodies the wave elevations and wave lengths are measured by wave probes of resistance type placed where the structure is to be installed the wave height and the wave period are checked till errors are within 5 to address the coupling effects of the tunnel pontoon system the movements of the tunnel pontoon and tensile forces in mooring suspension lines are measured synchronously for each test as plotted in fig 1 sixteen tensile gauges are separately arranged in the mooring suspension lines to measure the tensions in addition the six degrees of freedom of the tunnel and the seaward pontoon are measured using an electromagnetic motion system as shown in fig 4 two transmitters are fastened on the central surface of the tunnel element and pontoon and the receiver is fixed upon the tunnel pontoon system which achieve a non contact measurement the motion measuring apparatus records the real time six dofs with an accuracy better than 1 mm for translations and 0 1 for rotations the defined coordinate system of the six dofs is given in fig 5 considering the present experimental setup the sampling frequency of all the measurements is set as 50hz to acquire the responses with good temporal resolution 2 3 experimental conditions as mentioned before in the experiments two immersion depths of the tunnel element d 1 5 cm and 16 7 cm are chosen and for each immersion depth a series of tests have been conducted for the variety of wave periods and wave heading angles four wave directions described with heading angle θ are investigated turning from beam seas to quartering seas including 0 15 30 and 45 in the case of θ 90 the tunnel immersion model is placed in the basin with its longitudinal axis parallel to the wave maker fig 1 the cases of oblique waves are achieved by the appropriate counter clockwise rotation of the whole immersion system the tunnel rigs and mooring lines around the origin of coordinates fig 5 for each wave direction ten wave periods t were considered varying from 0 77s to 2 58s the wave conditions in the test are tabulated in table 3 fig 6 provides the plan view of the experimental set up for θ 30 as an example and also a snapshot from the experiments are included in fig 7 2 4 analysis method the motion amplitude of the tunnel pontoon is defined as the oscillation amplitude relative to its mean position in waves for instance sway amplitude maximum sway value minimum sway value 2 the tensions of the mooring and suspension lines are analyzed with the maximum values measured in time series moreover in section 3 the results of the motions and tensions are all normalized by the wave amplitude a fixed as 1 66 cm in this study moreover it is pointed out that the natural periods of the coupled immersion system have been determined through the implementation of modal analysis by numerical model built in ansys aqwa considering the given wave conditions of t 0 77s 2 58s the natural periods of modes 10 14 are within the range of the test scope the natural periods and eigenvectors of these modes for different immersion depth d d max 0 04 and 0 40 are tabulated in table 4 the whole results of the modal analysis can be referred to song et al 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 motions of the coupled tunnel immersion system figs 8 13 include amplitudes of the six dofs of the tunnel pontoon and their synchronous relative motion for different immersion depths d d max 0 04 and 0 40 with various wave heading angles θ 0 45 the wave periods are taken to be 0 77s 2 58s and the wave height is 3 33 cm as shown by figs 8 13 it can be concluded that all of the motion responses are very sensitive to the wave incident angle and this sensitivity varies with immersion depth and wave period fig 8 indicates that for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the beam waves θ 0 introduce the largest amplitude of the tunnel sway in the full range of wave periods which can be due to the fact that the wave obliquity drives down the wave excitation force in the sway direction for all the examined wave incident directions the tunnel s sway gets a gradual increasing trend with the enlarge of the wave period specifically for d d max 0 40 a local peak is observed at t 1 56s which can be attributed to the existence of the roll resonance with regard to the sway of the pontoon the obliquity of the incident wave increase of θ leads to generally smaller amplitude for d d max 0 04 as the wave period increases the pontoon sway presents a subtle local peak at t 1 03s which can be due to the excitation of the amplified roll and an increasing trend is observed in relatively long waves of t 1 29s in contrast for d d max 0 40 as the wave period enlarges the sway amplitude of the pontoon has a slight downward trend until it reaches its minimum value at t 1 16s followed by a noticeable upward trend the relative sway exhibits a similar tendency towards the wave period as the pontoon sway for relatively short waves t 1 29s however for longer wave the increasing trend of the relative sway is much smoother than that of the tunnel pontoon sway additionally the results also show that the obliquity of the incident waves induce a general reduction in the relative sway for t 1 29s while for a long wave regime of t 1 81s the relative sway between the tunnel and pontoon is more significant in oblique waves compared to the beam waves the largest relative sway occurs at t 1 29 s and θ 0 for d d max 0 04 this should be considered carefully during the operation since it raises the risk of collision between the tunnel and pontoons given the narrow space between the tunnel and pontoon 3 3 cm from fig 9 it is indicated that for d d max 0 04 the surge of the tunnel pontoon slightly affected by the wave incident direction for relatively short waves of t 1 29 except for the diminished surge of the pontoon with increasing wave heading angle at t 1 03s however when t 1 58s increasing wave heading angle leads to greater surge amplitude in both the tunnel and pontoon for example compared to the results in beam waves the tunnel s surge with θ 45 approaches five times larger and it is triple for the pontoon s surge for d d max 0 40 the influence of the wave incident direction is limited on the surge of the tunnel pontoon for t 1 29 while for longer waves the oblique waves induce significantly enlarged amplitudes than the beam waves furthermore it can be seen that in the beam and oblique waves the curves of the tunnel pontoon s surge behave in an analogous manner against the wave period for d d max 0 04 the variation of the surge amplitude of the tunnel pontoon is small for relatively short waves of t 1 03s and a local peak is observed around t 1 03s 1 16s corresponding to the natural frequency of mode no 12 the in phase roll of the tunnel and pontoons while an enlarge of the surge amplitude is induced by further longer waves getting another local peak at t 2 32 s which can be associated with the response amplification of mode no 11 the antiphase surge of the two pontoons on the other hand for d d max 0 40 the wave period has quite limited influence on the tunnel pontoon surge when exposed to short waves of t 1 29s while the surge amplitude is greater under longer wave actions and it fluctuates with the wave period getting its maximum value at t 1 56s 1 81s close to the natural frequency of mode no 12 or t 2 58s close to the natural frequency of mode no 11 correspondingly due to the tunnel s surge smaller than the pontoon s surge the relative surge exhibits similar tendencies against the impact factors wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth as the pontoon s surge comparing the statistical results for different immersion depths in fig 10 it can be found that the heave amplitude of the tunnel tends to decrease as the immersion depth enlarges and this also affects the pontoon through the connecting suspension lines this fact is primarily due to the appreciable reduction in the wave induced forces with larger water depth moreover it can also be seen that by increasing the wave period the heave of the tunnel pontoon and the relative heave are initially increased rapidly and then decreased getting their maximum at t 1 56s followed by a slight decrease this trend can be related to the excitation of the heave resonance when the wave period close to the heave period of the rigid connected tunnel pontoon system as reported by song et al 2018 regarding the effect of the wave heading angle one can note that larger θ causes smaller heave amplitude of the tunnel this trend is most intensified when the wave period is close to the heave period which demonstrates that the wave obliquity the enlarge of θ attenuate the resonant excitation of the heave particularly for d d max 0 04 the reduction of the tunnel s heave is prominent as 50 at t 1 55s from θ 0 to θ 45 and it is 38 for d d max 0 40 in contrast the effect of the wave heading angle on the heave amplitude of the pontoon is much smaller as θ enlarges there is only an evident downward trend in the pontoon s heave at t 1 55s 1 81s with respect to the relative heave the wave incident direction shows limited effect within the wave period range of t 0 77s 1 03s for d d max 0 04 and d d max 0 40 whereas for longer wave of t 1 29s the relative heave is substantially increased with increasing wave heading angle especially for oblique waves of θ 30 and 45 the relative heave amplitudes can be duple or triple of those in beam waves this can be attributed to the more significant diminish of the tunnel s heave amplitude compared to the pontoon heave and the widened phase lag between the tunnel and pontoon due to oblique waves in fig 11 as the wave period enlarges the tunnel pontoon s roll shows firstly an upward trend and then a downward trend getting its largest magnitude at t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 81s for d d max 0 40 which corresponds to the in phase roll period of the tunnel and pontoons mode no 12 meanwhile the increasing of the wave heading angle causes a decrease in the tunnel pontoon roll most importantly it can also be found that the wave obliquity is more influential with smaller immersion depth and the diminish is most significant with the incident wave period around the roll period for d d max 0 04 and t 1 16s compared to the beam waves the rolls of the tunnel and pontoon can be cut by 75 and 84 with θ 45 respectively whereas with d d max 0 40 the maximum reduction occurring at t 1 81s is 45 for the tunnel roll and 50 for the pontoon roll in addition with larger immersion depth the influential scope of the wave heading angle on the tunnel pontoon roll also becomes narrower for d d max 0 04 by increasing wave heading angle the tunnel pontoon rolls are reduced within a relatively wide range of wave period t 0 90 1 81s however for d d max 0 40 the reduction only focuses when the wave period close to the roll period t 1 55 1 81s and for wave period far away from the roll period it is much smaller and even negligible moreover this further results in the fact the curve trend of the roll amplitude against the wave period is somewhat changed with the varying wave incident direction for example for d d max 0 04 the tunnel pontoon rolls get their maximum amplitudes at t 1 16s with θ 0 and 15 while the peak are shifted to t 1 81s for θ 30 and 45 accordingly the relative roll also reaches its peak values around the coupled roll period of system t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 55s for d d max 0 40 it is also seen that the peak value is significantly enlarged with larger immersion depth which can be attributed to the increased roll resonance amplitude of the tunnel for d d max 0 04 the relative roll is not very sensitive to the wave incident direction however for d d max 0 40 a noticeable decrease with increased wave heading angle can be observed at the roll period t 1 55 s as revealed in fig 12 for d d max 0 04 the oblique waves can introduce larger pitch amplitude in the tunnel compared to beam waves and this observation is most notable in a long wave period domain of t 1 29 s this could result in greater bending moment on the long tunnel element and also exert an undesirable effect on the operability of the tunnel immersion in contrast with the enlarged immersion depth d d max 0 40 the effect of the wave heading angle on the tunnel s pitch only focus in a slight increase within the wave period range t 1 29 1 58s and for the other wave periods it is found to be limited on the other hand the pitch amplitude of the pontoon is affected significantly by the resonance phenomenon of mode no 13 the anti phase pitch of the two pontoons and exhibits local peaks around t 0 90 s except for the cases of θ 30 45 and d d max 0 40 it can also be seen that compared to the tunnel s pitch the oblique wave contributes more to enlarge the pitch amplitude of the pontoon for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the greatest amplitude of the pontoon pitch occurs at t 0 90 s and θ 15 consequently under the combined effects of the wave heading angle wave period and immersion depth the relative pitch behaves in an analogous manner as the pontoon pitch it is evident in fig 13 that for yaw amplitude of the tunnel than the beam waves for different immersion depths this is especially true for the long wave domain t 1 16 s where the tunnel yaw of θ 45 approaches 5 times that of θ 0 considering the large size of the tunnel element the enlarged yaw would raise the risk of the collision between the tunnel and pontoon for relatively small immersion depth with respect to the effect of the wave period the tunnel yaw is enlarged with increasing wave period for t 1 56 s and the increasing tendency is much more rapid exposed to the oblique waves than to beam waves however for further longer waves the tunnel yaw remains almost steady it can also be found in fig 13 that the yaw of the pontoon is affected by the roll resonance and gets its local peak around the roll period t 1 16s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 81s for d d max 0 40 the oblique waves also induce greater yaw amplitude of the pontoon especially for t 1 03s with d d max 0 04 and t 1 29s with d d max 0 40 subsequently the amplitude of the relative yaw is close to the pontoon s yaw and they also share similar tendency towards wave period wave heading angle and immersion depth 3 2 tensile forces in the suspension and mooring lines to investigate the tension distribution of the four suspension lines their average values avg and standard deviation std are discussed in this study the avg and std values are obtained respectively by eqn 2 and 3 2 f a v g 1 4 i 1 4 f i 3 f s t d 1 4 i 1 4 f i f a v g 2 where f i represents the single suspension tension in the four suspension lines fig 14 displays the statistical results in the maximum suspension tensions with the average and standard deviation values for different wave incident directions it can be seen that as the wave period enlarges the maximum suspension tension f max fig 14a and the standard deviation f std fig 14c gain a general increase and reach their largest values around the roll period t 1 03s for d d max 0 04 and t 1 56 s for d d max 0 40 followed by a decrease moreover for the average values of the suspension tension f avg in fig 14b the increase of the wave period leads to a subtle peak for short wave regime of t 0 77 1 58 s but it has no significant influence for further longer waves for the effect of the wave incident direction it can be concluded the wave heading angle has a considerable influence on the suspension tensions and this effect varies with the wave period and immersion depth for the small immersion depth d d max 0 04 the obliquity of the incident waves introduces greater f max along with enlarged standard deviation values f std compared to the beam waves for example the waves of θ 15 induces the largest f max and f std for t 0 77 0 90s and for t 1 03 s and 2 58s the greatest tension locates at θ 45 for the other wave periods the waves of θ 30 introduce larger values than other wave heading angles with regard to f avg the results do not allow a conclusive diagnosis most importantly in the examined range of wave periods the maximum suspension tension f max for d d max 0 04 is observed to be most drastic at t 1 03s with θ 45 which is 30 greater than the greatest f max due to beam waves t 1 03s and θ 0 this is probably because the oblique wave excitations incur greater relative roll in fig 11 and the consequent larger standard deviation in fig 14c thus the condition of t 1 03s with θ 45 can be regarded as the worst case scenario for the dynamic responses of the system at d d max 0 04 it further demonstrates that the importance of the oblique waves should be considered carefully to ensure the worst case scenario captured for an accurate prediction of the system dynamics furthermore for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the enlarge of the wave heading angle leads to smaller suspension tensions f max f avg and f std for most cases of the wave periods this implies that the oblique waves contribute to a more even tension distribution among the four suspension lines and consequently the maximum suspension tension f max occurs at θ 0 and t 1 56 s the maximum mooring line tensions of the tunnel and pontoon are included in fig 15 with various wave heading angels θ 0 45 for d d max 0 04 and 0 40 the other wave conditions are t 0 77s 2 58s and h 3 33 cm for d d 0 04 the mooring line tension of the tunnel shows different trend against the wave period for various wave heading angles for relatively short waves of t 1 29s as for longer waves of t 1 55s the mooring line tension shows a significant increase with the enlarged wave period besides it can be also seen that for t 1 29 s the mooring tension of the tunnel has greater values for θ 30 and 45 than that of θ 0 and 15 for example at t 1 16s the mooring tension at θ 30 is increased by 80 compared to the case of θ 0 in contrast for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the increase of the wave heading angle causes a slight reduction in the mooring tension of the tunnel moreover the mooring tension of the tunnel exhibits a general upward trend as the wave period enlarges except for a small drop at t 1 55s on the other hand the mooring line tension of the pontoon has a general increasing trend with the increased wave period for d d max 0 04 whereas for larger immersion depth d d max 0 40 the mooring tension of the pontoon gains an evident increase with the increase of wave period for t 1 55s while for t 1 29s the influence of the wave period becomes insignificant furthermore it is also worthy to point out that for small immersion depth d d max 0 04 the wave incident direction plays a more important role in the mooring tension of the pontoon than the cases of d d max 0 40 for d d max 0 04 and t 1 29s 2 32s the beam waves generate the largest mooring tension of the pontoon however for other cases of wave periods the oblique waves can introduce larger mooring tension of the pontoon than the beam waves for example for t 0 90s the mooring tension of the pontoon at θ 45 is 28 greater than that of θ 0 with regard to the cases of d d max 0 40 the increase of the wave period does not lead to any significant change on the mooring tension of the pontoon for t 1 29s similar phenomenon can also be observed with the enlarge of the wave heading angle whereas in long wave domain of t 1 55s the mooring tension of the pontoon exhibits a gradual increase with increasing wave period a significant influence of the wave incident direction can be observed at t 1 55s and t 2 58s and the mooring tension of the pontoon is increased by 35 for θ 15 at t 1 55s and by 32 at θ 45 for t 2 58 s at t 2 58s 4 conclusions a 3d experimental study was implemented for assessing the coupled dynamics of the tunnel immersion system under the action of beam and oblique regular waves the main conclusions of this investigation are given as the below the coupled motions of the tunnel and pontoons and the tensions of the suspension and mooring lines are very sensitive to the wave incident angle and this sensitivity varies with immersion depth and wave period the sway heave and roll of the tunnel pontoon exhibit a general decreasing trend with the increase of the wave heading angle the wave obliquity the enlarge of the heading angle θ significantly weaken the resonant excitations of the tunnel pontoon in the heave and roll directions with regard to the surge pitch and yaw of the tunnel pontoon the oblique waves could introduce larger amplitude than the cases of beam waves and this is especially true in long wave regime of t 1 55s this may exert an undesirable effect on the operability of the tunnel immersion for t 1 29s greater relative sway and yaw are observed in oblique waves compared to beam waves this should be considered carefully during the preliminary immersion stage since it could raise the risk of the collision between the tunnel and pontoon meanwhile the relative heave is substantially increased with the increase of wave heading angle the wave incident direction plays a more important role in the coupled dynamics of the system with smaller immersion depth for d d max 0 04 the maximum suspension tension f max is largest at t 1 03s with θ 45 which is 30 greater than the greatest f max due to beam waves t 1 03s and θ 0 this could be attributed to the greater relative roll and the consequent larger standard deviation of the suspension line tensions moreover the oblique wave excitations can also introduce higher mooring tension of the tunnel than the beam waves these further demonstrated that the importance of the oblique waves should be

21384,serious seismic damage is expected owing to the occurrence of lateral displacement following soil liquefaction after a strong earthquake currently there is a need for increased research on the lateral deformation occurring inside a liquefied foundation and its spatial distribution characteristics considering the initial geostatic stress of a slightly sloping site a finite element model that reflects the liquefaction induced slippage of the liquefiable site with a slightly inclined ground was designed according to the results the steeper the ground slope is the weaker the soil liquefaction in the slope body will be as the ground inclination and the intensity of input ground motion vary the lateral slippage of the liquefiable soil layer transforms from the liquefaction induced slipping along a single sliding surface to that along multiple sliding surfaces the dominant lateral displacement of liquefiable soil layers in the slope body changes as well from liquefaction induced slippage of soil to largely large single direction accumulated shear deformation of softening soil as a result of the drastically reduced intensity of the liquefiable soil in addition a similar linear relationship is found among the maximum lateral displacement the ground settlement near the slope crest and the ground uplift near the slope foot keywords sand liquefaction slightly sloping site lateral displacement ground subsidence finite element method 1 introduction a strong earthquake causes serious seismic damage to buildings in the liquefaction area because of large soil deformation for example in 1964 a 7 5 magnitude earthquake that struck niigata caused large scale liquefaction and ground fissure alongside the shinano river ground displacement peaked at 12 71 m and countless buildings bridges retaining walls and lifeline engineering structures suffered considerable damage the losses induced by sand liquefaction were estimated to be over usd 1 000 000 000 hamada et al 1987 the tangshan earthquake in 1976 also caused slippage ground fissure and sand blasting at some river banks with a slippage bandwidth of 100 150 m which resulted in the shortening of more than 10 highways and railway bridges slanting of bridge abutments breaking and beam collapse in bridges and narrowing of river channels liu and xie 1984 in japan s hanshin earthquake in 1995 the coastal backfill site in osaka and kobe experienced extreme soil liquefaction which caused permanent deformation of the foundation over a wide range in the horizontal direction with a maximum horizontal permanent displacement of 5 0 m resulting in serious damage to bridges wharfs underground subway structures embankments and other facilities hamada et al 1996 in 2008 the macroscopic phenomena related to soil liquefaction such as sand and water spewing surface cracks and ground subsidence were observed after the wenchuan earthquake in china specifically the approximately 400 m long highway from banqiao town to tumen town in mianzhu was affected by the overall slippage of roadbed towards the river by 30 50 cm yuan et al 2009 cao et al 2010 recently in the new zealand earthquake in 2010 the surface about 5 km southeast of christchurch was shifted by about 40 cm to the southwest and the centre of the city experienced a displacement of more than 10 cm thereby causing serious damage to infrastructural components such as sewers and bridges chen et al 2013 in the same year the sand liquefaction and lateral displacement of sandy soil during the chile earthquake caused serious seismic damage to bridges and highways with a maximum lateral displacement of 2 5 m and a maximum ground subsidence of 1 m in the mataquito bridge site turner fairbank highway research center 2011 hence it is necessary to study the severe earthquake damage caused by sand liquefaction under strong earthquakes to predict the lateral displacement of a liquefied site hamada et al and bartlett and youd established a multiple linear regression method mlr based on the analysis of site investigation data hamada et al 1987 bartlett and youd 1992 then goh and zhang and finn et al improved the mlr method based on the ultimate equilibrium theory goh and zhang 2014 finn et al 2016 newmark proposed the analysis method by solving the sliding block ultimate equilibrium newmark 1965 and then byrne and jitno continuously improved the analysis method byrne and jitno 1992 further towhata et al considered liquefied soil and non liquefied soil on the upper part as a fluid and an elastomer respectively and they established a fluid analysis method for calculating large liquefaction induced lateral deformation towhata et al 1991 meanwhile based on the analysis of data obtained from site investigations yasuda et al presented a graphical method for calculating the residual shear strain of large liquefaction induced lateral deformation yasuda et al 1992 the existing empirical prediction formula built on field survey data performs well in predicting lateral ground displacement of the liquefaction site however the formula fails to provide reasonable explanations on why this displacement is caused by sand liquefaction and its disaster causing process in terms of model tests the ability to reproduce lateral displacement as a phenomenon and its regular pattern are conducive to developing a better understanding of the mechanism by which sand liquefaction results in lateral displacement of the site higuchi et al 2000 hamada 2008 motamed et al 2009 dobry et al 2011 tang et al 2014 however given that model tests are restrained by dimension and testing technique it has not yet been effectively verified whether investigations and tests with respect to features of liquefaction deformation in soil layers and procedures can reflect the actual lateral displacement of the on site soil layer although limited by test technology and the boundary effect of the model box existing test results show a distribution feature in that a liquefied soil layer is characterized by continuous lateral deformation with an increase in depth however the results cannot demonstrate the trait that slippage is likely to occur on a sliding surface inside a liquefied soil layer or between liquefied and non liquefied soil layers given the lack of on site investigation and model test on ground liquefaction lateral displacement field numerical simulation studies can help estimate the temporal and spatial variation of soil liquefaction lateral displacement montgomery and boulanger 2016 howell et al 2015 chang et al 2013 currently for simulating a large liquefaction induced deformation based on finite element calculation method besides the main limitation of accuracy in the existing soil constitutive models when simulating characteristics of post liquefaction deformation other limitations such as convergence of numerical calculations caused by finite element large deformation after sand liquefaction also exist these two problems have a direct effect on the accuracy of the finite element method for the calculation of the large deformation of sand liquefaction further existing studies indicate that two primary causes slippage of sand liquefaction and modulus degradation due to the rise in pore pressure of the soil can result in large deformation of the liquefiable soil in the case of a strong earthquake however only a few studies investigate which of the two cases is dominant in inducing ground lateral displacement in a liquefiable slightly sloping site in summary with focus on the unique stratigraphic configuration and dynamic features of sandy soil in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china this paper proposed a finite element method for calculating the large deformation of sand liquefaction and liquefaction induced slippage further the characteristics of soil lateral displacement and ground settlement caused by sand liquefaction on a slightly sloping site were analysed first based on the test results for the large liquefaction deformation of the platy shaped particles of fine sand in the lower reaches of the yangtze river a modulus degradation function covering different loading and unloading stages before and after sand liquefaction were mentioned zhuang et al 2018 then a constitutive model was enhanced to describe the dynamic characteristics of soil following sand liquefaction the adaptive mesh adjustment technology provided by abaqus was used to address computational non convergence caused by the large deformation of soil liquefaction considering the initial static stress conditions of a slightly sloping site a static dynamic coupling finite element model that reflects the non linear seismic response of a liquefiable site with the ground slightly inclined was constructed a comparison of the simulation results with those obtained from the empirical predication formula proposed by youd et al verified the reliability of the proposed numerical calculation method furthermore the distribution characteristics of soil liquefaction in the site with different ground slopes as well as the mechanism for inducing the ground lateral displacement of liquefied foundation were investigated relevant research results can help further the understanding of the mechanism that contributes to soil slippage in the case of sand liquefaction and causes seismic damage i e lateral displacement on the ground 2 conditions of the liquefiable site the area of jiangsu province is part of the yangtze river delta plain owing to the constant aggradation of a large amount of sediments flowing from the yangtze river into this area relatively thick layers of loose and newly deposited soil pile up which shape the large yangtze river delta plain with features such as the yangtze river floodplains or lacustrine and paludal sediments from the topography perspective in the tai lake basin an area with abundant water resources dense river nets and well developed river systems the depositional plain area is composed of lacustrine sediments or lacustrine and paludal sediments this area once hit repeatedly by transgressions is full of shores and lagoon deposits and the integration of the dams of the yangtze river and the qiantang river that occurred 6000 years ago resulted in making it an inland area with lakes and marshes thus forming lake marsh and lagoon deposits this terrain filled with low mountains and foothills is characterized by topographic inequality according to the sedimentary phase sequence shown by the borehole the yangtze river delta plain can be split into three basic stratigraphic divisions the body zone of the delta its south wing and its north wing li et al 2000 south jiangsu is nestled in the south wing and body zone of the yangtze river delta as shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a typical cross section of the recent sedimentary soil at the yangtze river delta plain wherein the body zone comprises a riverbed phase floodplain estuary phase and sedimentary soil layer of delta phase consisting of medium and fine sand sandy clay and lens with sand inclusion where the cross and horizontal beddings have grown from bottom up the south wing of the delta consists mostly of sedimentary soil layers of seashores rich in argillaceous silty fine sand besides the silty fine sand in the lower reaches of the yangtze river consists of platy shaped particles as shown in fig 3 that differ from ordinary round quartz sand this platy shape imparts unique properties to the silty fine sand the sand structured in the shape of a platy shaped particle similar to nanjing sand which is widely distributed along the lower yangtze river coast thus such sites have gained increasing attention of relevant experts because it is valuable to study their seismic response for engineering construction in the lower yangtze river coast for the nanjing sand sampled from the nanjing yangtze river floodplain sedimentary phase in the lower reaches of the yangtze river its average natural density ρ 18 5 kn m3 maximum void ratio e max 1 14 minimum void ratio e min 0 62 relative density ranges between 42 and 46 uniformity coefficient c u 2 31 and curvature coefficient c c 1 07 meanwhile table 1 lists a comparison of physical parameters of nanjing sand against those of toyoura sand the values indicate that the types of sand are quite similar however the shape of toyoura sand is similar to a ball yasuda et al analysed all possible factors affecting the lateral displacement of the liquefaction soil through a series of vibrating table experiments yasuda et al 1992 such influencing factors include whether the overburden is horizontal or inclined the inclined angle and direction at the bottom of the liquefied sand layer compactness of sand loose sand or medium density sand and clay content of sand the analysis indicates that site lateral displacement following soil liquefaction is more apparent when the overburden is inclined instead of being horizontal which implies that a slightly inclined angle on the ground of the site is an important factor influencing the lateral displacement of the liquefied site consequently this paper discussed the influence of various inclined angles of the ground on the lateral displacement of the liquefied soil layer and its induction mechanism 3 constitutive model of liquefiable soil 3 1 yield surface function prevost et al 1985 proposed a function to define the yield surface as 1 f 3 2 s p a α s p a α m 2 p a 2 0 2 s σ p δ p a p a p 1 3 t r σ a c tan φ where σ is the effective cauchy stress tensor and δ is the kronecker delta p is the effective mean normal stress s is the deviatoric stress tensor and c and φ are the cohesion and friction angle of the soil respectively α is a tensor to define the centre of the yield surface in the deviatoric stress plane and m can be calculated by φ yang and elgamal et al developed a dynamic constitutive model of sand according to eq 1 yang and elgamal 2002 elgamal et al 2002 to simulate the dynamic consolidation of soil the biot type theory was used to model the interaction between the solid and fluid of soil parra colmenares and ender 1996 fig 4 shows the shape of the yield surfaces in the principal stress space in this model the hardening parameter should be deduced by solving a quadratic equation with one unknown meanwhile the shear modulus was assumed to be a constant in some strain range to develop this model in numerical modelling the hardening rule of this model was replaced by a widely available hardening rule zhuang et al 2009 2015 according to the new hardening rule all the active yield surfaces f i are tangential with the reversed yield surface f r at the reversed stress point and then the active yield surfaces should consecutively touch and push each other but do not intersect as a result the centres of the active yield surfaces in the deviatoric stress plane should move along the direction from the centre of the newest reversed yield surface f r to the newest reversed stress point accordingly the hardening parameters m and α can be deduced as 3 d m 3 s p a α d s 6 d p s p a α θ 2 j m d p 6 m p a s p a α θ 2 j p a 4 j 3 2 s p a α s p a α 5 d α 2 3 m d p p a d m θ d p α the spatial position of the initial yield surface is determined by α when α 0 the soil is considered as the initial isotropic material conversely when α 0 the initial anisotropy of the soil is considered if the effect of the rotation of the principal stress axis lode angle on the yield surface of the soil needs to be considered the following equation is used when defining material parameters 6 m 2 k 1 k 1 k sin 3 θ m in this formula k is a material parameter that defines the shape of the curve of the yield surface on the plane of the partial stress and θ can be expressed as 7 θ 1 m p a t r s 3 t r s 2 s 3 s p a α the outer normal q of the yield surface is 8 q f f it is found that when the loading and yield surfaces use the same function it is incorrect to asses loading and unloading under dilatancy therefore the influence of the lode angle on parameter m is not considered in this paper i e the yield surface at the π shape curve on the plane of the deviatoric stress is circular and it is assumed that the loading function is different from the yield function the loading surface is a cylindrical surface and the loading function is 9 q l 3 2 s p a α s p a α 0 the outer normal vector q of the loading surface can be determined by 10 q s p a α s p a α s p a α 3 2 model constitutive equation the constitutive equation of the model in incremental form noted as 11 σ e ε ε p where σ is increment of effective stress tensor e is initial elastic stiffness matrix ε is total strain increment and ε p is plastic strain increment 12 ε p p l where p defines the direction of plastic deformation in the stress space and l is the plastic loading function 13 l l i f l 0 0 i f l 0 l 1 h q σ according to equations 5 6 and 9 the plastic loading function can be expressed as 14 l 1 h h 0 q e ε 15 h 0 q e p b 3 p 3 q 2 g p q 16 p p p δ 3 p t r p 17 q q q δ 3 q t r q here h is calculated by 18 h 1 h 1 2 g 1 in the formula g is the shear modulus when considering the effect of the increase in pore water pressure on the soil modulus the initial shear modulus is 19 g g 0 p a p 0 a n p where g 0 is the initial shear modulus of soil under the confining pressure p 0 the material parameter n p can be determined by test in this study n p 0 5 then the following equation can be used to define the elastoplastic tangent modulus 20 h g 1 m m 2 in view of the unique particle shape characteristics of the sand in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river its liquefaction characteristics and resistance to liquefaction are different from those of round grain saturated sand zhuang et al 2018 therefore saturated nanjing fine sand with flaky particles as the main component was used as the cyclic shear test object the hollow cylindrical torsion equipment was used to make the double amplitude shear strain in the test close to 100 the shear moduli at different loading stages of the liquefied sand are shown in fig 5 based on the previous test results zhuang et al 2018 the shear moduli for the saturated nanjing sand in the zero effective stress and dilation stages can be expressed as 21 gl1 313 82 100 γsa 1 065 22 gl2 4852 8 100 γsa 1 033 where γsa is the single amplitude shear strain at the maximum shear stress state of each cyclic loading according to previous tests it is proved that the shear modulus reduction of the liquefied nanjing sand should be affected greatly by the effective confining pressure initial shear loading and amplitude of cyclic shear loading which can not be neglected in the decay function of the shear moduli g l3 accordingly the decay function for the shear moduli g l3 can be expressed as 23 g l 3 a 100 γ s a b 24 a 2 81 p 0 p a 0 9 c s r 0 258 e x p 1 6 s s r 25 b 0 86 c s r 0 1 e x p 1 1 s s r where p0 is the effective confining pressure csr is the cyclic stress ratio and ssr is the initial static stress ratio according to the results of the above studies the modulus attenuation of the shear modulus of the soil before liquefaction that increases with pore pressure is calculated using eq 19 when the soil is liquefied and the loading begins use gl3 in eq 23 instead of g0 in eq 19 when the soil is in the zero effective stress phase during liquefaction use gl1 in eq 21 instead of g0 in eq 19 and when the soil body is in the dilatancy stage during liquefaction use gl2 in eq 22 instead of g0 in eq 19 the detailed tests results and comparation with those of toyoura sand has also been analysed zhuang et al 2018 yang and gu 2013 to verified the constitutive model of the liquefiable soil model without using the shear moduli at different loading stages of the liquefied sand a 3 d numerical model has then developed to model the dynamic responses of a sand sample tested in a dynamic triaxial machine zhuang et al 2015 then after the shear modulus attenuation of the shear modulus at different loading stages modified by eq 21 23 the predicted axial strain time histories and the strain stress curves are compared with the test results as shown in fig 6 which shows that the compiled subroutine is available in this constitutive model the liquefaction induced perfected plastic during shear loading is significant only at very low confinement levels in liquefaction stage it was decided to directly response phase between contraction and dilation and an additional minimal change in shear stress is treated until a user specified shear strain is accumulated then if the shear loading reaches to the phase transformation surface the dilation phase will take place the detailed introduction about this method can be found in reference by elgamal et al 2002 4 finite elements model 4 1 model soil foundation a liquefiable site with different ground inclination angles was designed in this study based on the formation conditions of the nanjing yangtze river floodplain zhuang et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 table 2 shows the dynamic constitutive model parameters of the soil used in this study and table 3 shows the physical and mechanical parameters of each soil layer the thickness of the non liquefied covering layer and the depth of underground water level are kept constant in this study according to the actual engineering site condition the depth of the underground water level is set to be 1 0 m the inclination angles of the slope ground surface of the site are set to be 0 3 6 and 9 respectively the inclination angle of the liquefied soil layer under the slop is assumed to be consistent with those of the slope ground surface as shown in fig 8 4 2 boundary conditions to simulate the liquefaction flow deformation of soil the initial static stress condition of soil foundation should be simulated firstly then the dynamic responses of site should be analysed during the whole analysis the lateral boundary conditions should be converted from the horizontal constrain in the geostatic analysis step to the vertical constrain in the dynamic analysis step to solve this problem two methods can be used such as the static dynamic unified artificial boundary condition developed by liu and li 2005 and the artificial converting boundary method to the artificial converting boundary method the lateral boundary of soil foundation is horizontally constrained and vertically free in the static analysis step after the static analysis step the horizontal support forces of the nodes at the lateral boundary are outputted which is added artificially at the nodes of lateral boundary before the dynamic analysis step at the same time the lateral boundary of soil foundation changes to the vertically constrained and horizontally free as shown in fig 7 however in a strong earthquake the nonlinear properties of soil have taken place the related parameters for the boundary treating method has been changed greatly as a result most of the existed methods could not treat well on the boundary conditions of a large deformed soil foundation in view of the above analysis a large computational domain and fix both the lateral conditions in the horizontal direction should be an effective method to deal with the dynamic boundary condition of a large deformed soil foundation as a result the second method is used to deal with the lateral boundaries in the static and dynamic coupling analysis steps 4 3 finite element meshing the four node planar reduced integration elements are used to mesh the soil foundation and the dimension of element changes from 1 0 m to 3 0 m zhuang et al 2015 shown as fig 8 in this study the arbitrary lagrange euler ale method supported by abaqus software is used to adjust timely the shape of element which should be deformed greatly by the large flow deformation of soil liquefaction in this way the continue flow deformation of liquefied soil can be simulated successfully this method has been proposed by noh and hirt and used in the finite difference method hirt et al 1970 which has been introduced into the finite element method by takashi and hughes takashi and hughes 1992 kjellgren and hyvärinen 1998 4 4 ground motions input to simulate the liquefaction induced flow deformation of site in this study a ground motion recorded by the kobe marine observatory station during the osaka kobe earthquake january 17 1995 japan at a distance of about 1 0 km far from the epicentre and it is a typical near field strong earthquake record the epicentre of the osaka kobe earthquake is shown in fig 9 during this earthquake soil liquefaction occurred at the shores deposit site wherein a larger lateral displacement of the coastal engineering site was induced accordingly the kobe wave recorded at the kjma station was selected as the input motion in this study the original peak accelerations of kobe wave in the n s was 818 02 cm s2 which acceleration duration and response spectrum are as shown in fig 10 due to above reason the ground motion recorded by the kobe marine observatory station was selected as the input motion in this study the intensities of the input motions are equal to 1 0 m s2 2 0 m s2 and 3 0 m s2 and they are obtained by adjusting the peak accelerations of the original ground motions as far as the type of earthquake are concerned it has not considered in this study 5 soil liquefaction of site owing to various peak ground accelerations the effect of ground obliquity on the distribution characteristics of site liquefaction follows a consistent pattern even though the depth and extent of liquefaction may vary fig 11 shows a liquefaction distribution diagram of the site at each ground inclined angle when the peak acceleration of input ground motion at the bedrock is 0 1 g in fig 11 the solution dependent state variables sdv52 refers to the dynamic pore pressure ratio when sdv52 is greater than 1 0 the black zone indicates that the sand has liquefied according to the analysis of the calculated results the extent of liquefaction of soil in the slope body significantly decreases as the ground slope of the site increases when the input peak acceleration remains constant when the ground inclination of the ground surface increase to 6 only discontinuous liquefaction occurs locally in the saturated sand layer of the slope body which should be mainly induced by the discontinuous deformation of the saturated sand under the slope as the ground inclination increases further soil liquefaction in the horizontal layered site below the slope section increases as well however it is slightly reduced for the upper slope section the above regularity becomes more obvious as the input peak acceleration of seismic wave increases especially when the acceleration is 0 3 g wherein the liquefaction that occurs in lower horizontal layered site expands to all liquefiable soil layers while the upper layers are almost free of liquefaction findings similar to such a regular pattern have also been obtained from large scale vibrating table model tests zhuang et al 2019 with the increases of the pga peak ground acceleration noticeable expansion is expected within the corresponding range of soil liquefaction at the same site regardless of the apical slope of the liquefiable layer and this is verified by the fact that liquefaction extends deeper at the site whereas liquefaction in the upper horizontal soil layer reduces and that in the lower horizontal soil layer in the slope body increases as shown in fig 12 fig 13 compares the time history curves of pore pressure ratios at three points in liquefied soil layers with the same burial depth from the ground surface in various sections when the input kobe earthquake signal of bedrock is provided for further differentiating soil liquefaction characteristics in different sections of a slightly sloping liquefiable site in general the pore pressure ratio peaks at p3 in the horizontal soil layer below the slope body thereby sufficiently demonstrating that the level of liquefaction in the horizontal soil layer below the slope body is significantly higher than that in the slope body and in the upper horizontal soil layers further when the slope is 3 the pore pressure ratio at each point in the different section grows synchronously during the initial ground shock however it no longer grows at the same pace as the slope inclination increases the increase in the pore pressure ratio in the lower horizontal soil layers of the slightly inclined slope lags behind those of p1 and p2 especially when the inclined angle is 9 meanwhile as can be seen from fig 13 in the middle and late stages the pore pressure ratio at each point grows asynchronously because of the changes in the strain response in each section of the soil which is caused by the occurrence of slippage after soil liquefaction it should be noted that the pore pressure ratio of the liquefied soil was deduced from the pore pressure divided by the initial effective self weight stress of the soil however in the following dynamic analysis the vertical effective stress of soil foundation should be changed by the soil underground structure interaction as a result some pore pressure ratios shown in original fig 13 are obvious larger than 1 0 6 lateral displacement and settlement of site 6 1 lateral displacement of the soil layer the relative lateral displacement in the old clay layer is considerable lower than that in the liquefiable sand layer and only the relative lateral displacement in the liquefiable sand layer is analysed in this study when the relative displacement between the node at ground surface and the node at the bottom of soil foundation is maximal as shown in fig 14 a comparative analysis of the relative displacement curve of each location selected in the vertical cross section shows that at the top of the liquefiable soil layers the liquefaction is noticeable when input lower acceleration pga 0 1 g and the surface slope is 3 as shown in fig 11 b according to fig 15 a an evidently lateral slippage can be observed in the upper liquefiable soil layers especially in the middle of the slop body point b3 where maximum slippage displacement occurs the slippage displacement from the slope crest to the bottom of the liquefied soil tends to first increase and then decrease during which the peak lateral relative displacement is approximately 0 973 m slippage gradually weakens in the slope section as the ground slope becomes steeper however it may still occur at the top of lower horizontal liquefiable soil layers if the slope inclination increases to 9 there will be almost no slippage in the soil layers in the slope body and the maximum lateral displacement will occur in the upper section of the slope as the ground slope inclination increases the relative large shear deformation of the non liquefied soil layer in the slope part moves further down to the deeper soil layers where the lateral large deformation in soil layers shifts from soil slippage to large shear deformation caused by the severe weakening of the soil modulus thus when the input peak acceleration is low liquefaction induced slippage can only be found on the upper liquefiable soil in the slope body along a single sliding surface when the input acceleration rises to 0 2 g fig 16 in upper liquefiable soil layers in the slope body the liquefied soil layer becomes thicker at a ground slope inclination of 3 and the liquefaction induced slippage along multiple sliding surfaces occurs at the top of liquefied soil layers when the ground slope increases to 6 because the liquefaction degree of the upper soil layer in the slope body is reduced slippage remains evident at the contact position between the overlying non liquefied soil layer and the top surface of the liquefied soil layer further the relative lateral displacements of soil within a certain thickness range in the middle and lower depths of the liquefiable soil layer are caused by the serious weakening of the shearing resistance because of the build up of the pore water pressure when the apical slope inclination is up to 9 the slippage of the liquefiable soil layer in the slope body is not apparent when a large relative shear lateral displacement exists in the entire liquefiable soil layer because of the severe weakening of the shearing resistance of the liquefiable soil caused by the development of pore pressure in the soil as the apical slope inclination of the liquefiable soil layer increases further the maximum lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer tends to first increase and then decrease overall in the case of an input peak acceleration of 0 2 g and a small apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer the lateral soil displacement in the slope body is caused because of soil slippage along multiple sliding surfaces as the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer increases the overall relative lateral displacement of the soil in the slope body gradually shifts from the liquefaction induced slippage to the large shear deformation of the soil caused by the weakening of the shearing resistance when the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases to 0 3 g as can be seen from fig 17 since the liquefaction of the liquefiable soil layer increases the sliding surface is obviously in the lower depth of the liquefiable soil layer when the ground slope inclination is 3 and this manifests as multiple sliding surfaces in the lower depth of the liquefiable soil layer at this point the main driver resulting in the large lateral displacement of the soil layer is no longer only the liquefaction induced slippage in which case shear lateral displacement caused by severe weakening of shearing resistance of soil evidently plays an increasingly major role with the apical slope inclination increasing to 9 liquefaction is still noticeable in soil layers at this time fig 12 b wherein the overall relative lateral displacement of the soil layer at the lower depth of liquefiable soil is caused by both liquefaction induced slippage and the shear weakening of the soil comparing figs 15 17 indicates that the overall relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer accretes considerably as the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases based on the calculation results in this paper the maximum relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer is longer than 5 m a comparative analysis of the results obtained from previous model tests on lateral displacement induced by site liquefaction and those from finite element simulations based on the model test indicates that the varying characteristics of the depth of soil lateral displacement in liquefied foundation determined in this paper are not quite the same as those in the previous research the main difference lies in that the previous model test results fail to effectively reproduce the phenomenon of slippage along the sliding surface following soil liquefaction of the site mostly because of the difficulty in testing sudden changes in the lateral displacement caused by slippage at the contact position inside the soil and between the liquefied and non liquefied soils for previous model tests meanwhile in the previous model tests despite using the free shear box the slippage of the internal liquefied foundation was inevitably affected by the boundary effect of the model box to a certain extent because of the plane motion of the rigid body of its built in water proof rubber pads and stacked steel structures and fraction between layers to further investigate the change in the lateral displacement of the soil layer in the site over time fig 18 shows the time history curve of the top bottom relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer at the vertical section of b2 as shown in the figure if the ground of the site is horizontal the time history curve of the relative displacement remains stable after the strong earthquake phase of the input ground motion especially when the peak acceleration of input ground motion is 0 3 g and there is an obvious tendency to return to zero when the site ground is inclined the top bottom relative lateral displacement in this section obviously shows the phenomenon of accumulation indicating the occurrence of significant permanent relative lateral displacement in the soil layers when the input peak acceleration is 0 1 g there is evidently no significant consecutive liquefaction of the soil in the slope section when the slope inclinations are 6 and 9 fig 11 c and d respectively fig 18 a shows that the slope of the time history curve of relative displacement increases very slowly after the strong shock stage of the input seismic wave occurs this result suggests that the permanent relative lateral displacement of the slightly sloping site is attributed to the nonlinear deformation accumulation of the soil in the strong shock stage of input motion when the soil in the slope body is not continuously liquefied furthermore no clear slippage phenomenon is observed after the strong shock stage of input motion as the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases soil liquefaction is evident in the slope body as shown in fig 12 as shown by the top bottom relative displacement curve at cross section b2 a sharp increase did not appear until the strong shock stage of the input ground motion this implies the top bottom relative displacement in the soil layer at this point arises from the lagging accumulated deformation caused by soil liquefaction and severe weakening of soil strength during the strong shock period then in 20 s after the earthquake the relative lateral displacement curve essentially levels off 6 2 verification of the lateral displacement of the site based on the aerial photographs captured before and after the earthquake hamada et al organized the data on lateral displacement induced by seismic soil liquefaction hamada et al 1987 and derived the regression formula as 26 d h 0 75 h θ 3 where dh is the ground lateral displacement h is the anticipated thickness of the liquefied layer meter and θ is the ground slope or bottom slope angel of the liquefiable soil layer according to the calculation results in this paper the average liquefaction thickness of the soil layer under each calculation condition is listed in table 4 in addition based on observed data on liquefaction induced lateral displacement obtained from eight earthquakes that occurred in the united states and japan bartlett and youd assumed that the lateral displacement is a function of earthquake magnitude terrain geology and soil parameters they designed a multiple regression model mlr of liquefaction induced lateral displacement in slightly sloping sites bartlett and youd 1992 27 log d h 15 7870 1 1782 m 0 9275 l o g

thickness of the liquefied layer unit m f15 is the average fine content and d5015 is the average grain diameter unit mm the parameters of the liquefied soil layer in this paper are based on the dynamic parameters of nanjing fine sand whose d5015 0 17 mm f15 0 9 since seismic waves used for calculation in this paper are not actual data based on the on site seismic environment on site ground acceleration values obtained under various calculation conditions and model parameters for the above formula 27 which are determined with the recommended method in the literature are as listed in table 4 table 5 lists a comparison of numerical calculation results in this paper with the prediction results of formula 26 and formula 27 table 5 indicates that the prediction result yielded by empirical formula 27 is closer to that yielded by the numerical calculation and the varying pattern of ground lateral displacement with the ground slope coincides with the numerical calculation result in general the predicted results yielded by formula 27 for the slightly sloping site at 6 and 9 are closer to those yielded by the numerical calculation however the predicted results in the case of an inclined angle of 3 are not satisfactory meanwhile empirical formula 26 predicts an exaggerated result for the lateral displacement of the site if the input peak accelerations are 0 1 g and 0 2 g 6 3 vertical displacement at ground surface to further analyse the vertical displacement response of the slightly sloping site fig 19 shows the time history curves of the vertical displacements at points a and c on different ground surfaces of the site respectively and the specific locations are as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that an evident vertical subsidence occurs at point a at the ground surface of the horizontal soil layer near the slope crest of the slightly sloping site and a clear uplift at point c at the ground surface of the horizontal soil layer near the foot of the slope however it is apparent that the extent of subsidence at point a is greater than that of the uplift at point c in general the time history processes of the subsidence at point a is consistent with that of the lateral displacement of the soil layer shown in fig 18 thus it can be argued that the vertical subsidence near the slope crest is caused by the lateral displacement of the soil layer in the slope and it keeps rising because it emerges after the strong shock stage of the input motion in view of the development trend however the uplift process at point c differs apparently from that of soil lateral displacement and the subsidence at point a when the slightly sloping site has an inclined angle of 3 the uplift at point c at the slope foot maintains a growing momentum however when the slope angle of slightly sloping site increases to 6 and 9 the uplift at point c appears during the strong shock stage and exhibits a clear trend towards subsidence 6 4 relationship between lateral displacement and vertical displacement this paper attempts to analyse the relationship between the vertical displacement of the ground surface and the lateral displacement of the slope body in a slightly sloping site fig 20 shows the curves reflecting the connection of vertical subsidence at point a with the maximum uplift displacement at point c and the maximum lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layers an approximately linear relationship exists between the ground vertical displacement of the slightly sloping site and the maximum lateral displacement of the slope body which is less likely to be affected by the inclination of the site and the peak acceleration of input ground motion thus under the numerical simulation calculation conditions used in this study it is believed that the empirical prediction results for the lateral displacement of the slightly sloping site can be used to predict its ground vertical displacement based on this study the maximum lateral displacement in soil layers of the slope is about 4 5 times the ground subsidence at the ground surface near the slope crest and the subsidence at the slope crest is about 4 5 times the uplift at the ground surface near the foot of the slight slope at present study the calculated results on this problem are limited to give more analysis and explain on the relationship between lateral displacement and vertical displacement of a slightly inclining site some analysis on this section should be in the preliminary stage and further more studies on this relationship should be done in the following research 7 conclusions this paper proposed a finite element numerical analysis model based on a constitutive model of soil to simulate the liquefaction induced large deformation and a finite element meshing technique for the flow slip large deformation further the effect of various inclined angles at the top of the liquefiable soil layer on the distribution characteristics of soil liquefaction lateral deformation features of the site and ground settlement characteristics were analysed the principal conclusions are as follows for similar input peak accelerations an increase in the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer resulted in a dramatic decrease in the liquefaction depth of the soil layer in the slope body a distinct distribution pattern of discontinuous liquefaction was also observed given that the input peak acceleration is larger obvious liquefaction only appeared at the top surface of the liquefiable soil layers in the slope body in the case of both a small slope angle at the top liquefiable soil layer 3 in this study and a small input peak acceleration of seismic wave 0 1 g in this study the liquefied soil on the top of the liquefiable soil layer is thin which causes an overlaying soil layer to slip along one single sliding surface near the top of the under the non liquefied soil layer in which soil lateral displacement is attributed to the slippage of upper soils after soil liquefaction if the input peak acceleration of the seismic wave increases to a certain value and the apical slope angle of the liquefiable soil layer is small soil lateral displacement is caused by soil slippage on multiple sliding surfaces along with an increase in the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer soil lateral displacement in the slope body gradually shifts from the liquefaction induced slippage to the cumulative shear deformation caused by severe weakening of shearing resistance of the non liquefied soil under a limited magnitude earthquake when the soil in the slope body is not liquefied the relative lateral displacement of the soil layer is caused by the accumulated deformation of the soil layer which results from the input ground motion during the strong shock stage then the soil lateral displacement essentially becomes steady once the strong shock stage is over if the input ground motion is more intense because of the serious weakening of soil liquefaction in the slope body the occurrence of lateral displacement in the slope body is obviously because of the hysteresis after the strong shock stage of input ground motion the preliminary findings from this study demonstrate an approximately linear relationship between the ground vertical displacement of the slightly sloping site and the maximum lateral displacement of the slope body such a connection is less likely to be affected by the inclination of the site and the peak acceleration of input ground motion thus it is believed that the empirical prediction results for lateral displacement in the soil layer of the slightly sloping site can be used to predict its ground vertical displacement through a comparative analysis of the numerical calculation results in this paper and the predicted results of existing empirical formulas the predicted results from the empirical formula established by hamada et al who used site data varied considerably from the numerical calculation results however the results predicted in this study relatively coincide with the predictions made by the mlr method credit authorship contribution statement zhuang haiyang validation

21384,serious seismic damage is expected owing to the occurrence of lateral displacement following soil liquefaction after a strong earthquake currently there is a need for increased research on the lateral deformation occurring inside a liquefied foundation and its spatial distribution characteristics considering the initial geostatic stress of a slightly sloping site a finite element model that reflects the liquefaction induced slippage of the liquefiable site with a slightly inclined ground was designed according to the results the steeper the ground slope is the weaker the soil liquefaction in the slope body will be as the ground inclination and the intensity of input ground motion vary the lateral slippage of the liquefiable soil layer transforms from the liquefaction induced slipping along a single sliding surface to that along multiple sliding surfaces the dominant lateral displacement of liquefiable soil layers in the slope body changes as well from liquefaction induced slippage of soil to largely large single direction accumulated shear deformation of softening soil as a result of the drastically reduced intensity of the liquefiable soil in addition a similar linear relationship is found among the maximum lateral displacement the ground settlement near the slope crest and the ground uplift near the slope foot keywords sand liquefaction slightly sloping site lateral displacement ground subsidence finite element method 1 introduction a strong earthquake causes serious seismic damage to buildings in the liquefaction area because of large soil deformation for example in 1964 a 7 5 magnitude earthquake that struck niigata caused large scale liquefaction and ground fissure alongside the shinano river ground displacement peaked at 12 71 m and countless buildings bridges retaining walls and lifeline engineering structures suffered considerable damage the losses induced by sand liquefaction were estimated to be over usd 1 000 000 000 hamada et al 1987 the tangshan earthquake in 1976 also caused slippage ground fissure and sand blasting at some river banks with a slippage bandwidth of 100 150 m which resulted in the shortening of more than 10 highways and railway bridges slanting of bridge abutments breaking and beam collapse in bridges and narrowing of river channels liu and xie 1984 in japan s hanshin earthquake in 1995 the coastal backfill site in osaka and kobe experienced extreme soil liquefaction which caused permanent deformation of the foundation over a wide range in the horizontal direction with a maximum horizontal permanent displacement of 5 0 m resulting in serious damage to bridges wharfs underground subway structures embankments and other facilities hamada et al 1996 in 2008 the macroscopic phenomena related to soil liquefaction such as sand and water spewing surface cracks and ground subsidence were observed after the wenchuan earthquake in china specifically the approximately 400 m long highway from banqiao town to tumen town in mianzhu was affected by the overall slippage of roadbed towards the river by 30 50 cm yuan et al 2009 cao et al 2010 recently in the new zealand earthquake in 2010 the surface about 5 km southeast of christchurch was shifted by about 40 cm to the southwest and the centre of the city experienced a displacement of more than 10 cm thereby causing serious damage to infrastructural components such as sewers and bridges chen et al 2013 in the same year the sand liquefaction and lateral displacement of sandy soil during the chile earthquake caused serious seismic damage to bridges and highways with a maximum lateral displacement of 2 5 m and a maximum ground subsidence of 1 m in the mataquito bridge site turner fairbank highway research center 2011 hence it is necessary to study the severe earthquake damage caused by sand liquefaction under strong earthquakes to predict the lateral displacement of a liquefied site hamada et al and bartlett and youd established a multiple linear regression method mlr based on the analysis of site investigation data hamada et al 1987 bartlett and youd 1992 then goh and zhang and finn et al improved the mlr method based on the ultimate equilibrium theory goh and zhang 2014 finn et al 2016 newmark proposed the analysis method by solving the sliding block ultimate equilibrium newmark 1965 and then byrne and jitno continuously improved the analysis method byrne and jitno 1992 further towhata et al considered liquefied soil and non liquefied soil on the upper part as a fluid and an elastomer respectively and they established a fluid analysis method for calculating large liquefaction induced lateral deformation towhata et al 1991 meanwhile based on the analysis of data obtained from site investigations yasuda et al presented a graphical method for calculating the residual shear strain of large liquefaction induced lateral deformation yasuda et al 1992 the existing empirical prediction formula built on field survey data performs well in predicting lateral ground displacement of the liquefaction site however the formula fails to provide reasonable explanations on why this displacement is caused by sand liquefaction and its disaster causing process in terms of model tests the ability to reproduce lateral displacement as a phenomenon and its regular pattern are conducive to developing a better understanding of the mechanism by which sand liquefaction results in lateral displacement of the site higuchi et al 2000 hamada 2008 motamed et al 2009 dobry et al 2011 tang et al 2014 however given that model tests are restrained by dimension and testing technique it has not yet been effectively verified whether investigations and tests with respect to features of liquefaction deformation in soil layers and procedures can reflect the actual lateral displacement of the on site soil layer although limited by test technology and the boundary effect of the model box existing test results show a distribution feature in that a liquefied soil layer is characterized by continuous lateral deformation with an increase in depth however the results cannot demonstrate the trait that slippage is likely to occur on a sliding surface inside a liquefied soil layer or between liquefied and non liquefied soil layers given the lack of on site investigation and model test on ground liquefaction lateral displacement field numerical simulation studies can help estimate the temporal and spatial variation of soil liquefaction lateral displacement montgomery and boulanger 2016 howell et al 2015 chang et al 2013 currently for simulating a large liquefaction induced deformation based on finite element calculation method besides the main limitation of accuracy in the existing soil constitutive models when simulating characteristics of post liquefaction deformation other limitations such as convergence of numerical calculations caused by finite element large deformation after sand liquefaction also exist these two problems have a direct effect on the accuracy of the finite element method for the calculation of the large deformation of sand liquefaction further existing studies indicate that two primary causes slippage of sand liquefaction and modulus degradation due to the rise in pore pressure of the soil can result in large deformation of the liquefiable soil in the case of a strong earthquake however only a few studies investigate which of the two cases is dominant in inducing ground lateral displacement in a liquefiable slightly sloping site in summary with focus on the unique stratigraphic configuration and dynamic features of sandy soil in the lower reaches of the yangtze river in china this paper proposed a finite element method for calculating the large deformation of sand liquefaction and liquefaction induced slippage further the characteristics of soil lateral displacement and ground settlement caused by sand liquefaction on a slightly sloping site were analysed first based on the test results for the large liquefaction deformation of the platy shaped particles of fine sand in the lower reaches of the yangtze river a modulus degradation function covering different loading and unloading stages before and after sand liquefaction were mentioned zhuang et al 2018 then a constitutive model was enhanced to describe the dynamic characteristics of soil following sand liquefaction the adaptive mesh adjustment technology provided by abaqus was used to address computational non convergence caused by the large deformation of soil liquefaction considering the initial static stress conditions of a slightly sloping site a static dynamic coupling finite element model that reflects the non linear seismic response of a liquefiable site with the ground slightly inclined was constructed a comparison of the simulation results with those obtained from the empirical predication formula proposed by youd et al verified the reliability of the proposed numerical calculation method furthermore the distribution characteristics of soil liquefaction in the site with different ground slopes as well as the mechanism for inducing the ground lateral displacement of liquefied foundation were investigated relevant research results can help further the understanding of the mechanism that contributes to soil slippage in the case of sand liquefaction and causes seismic damage i e lateral displacement on the ground 2 conditions of the liquefiable site the area of jiangsu province is part of the yangtze river delta plain owing to the constant aggradation of a large amount of sediments flowing from the yangtze river into this area relatively thick layers of loose and newly deposited soil pile up which shape the large yangtze river delta plain with features such as the yangtze river floodplains or lacustrine and paludal sediments from the topography perspective in the tai lake basin an area with abundant water resources dense river nets and well developed river systems the depositional plain area is composed of lacustrine sediments or lacustrine and paludal sediments this area once hit repeatedly by transgressions is full of shores and lagoon deposits and the integration of the dams of the yangtze river and the qiantang river that occurred 6000 years ago resulted in making it an inland area with lakes and marshes thus forming lake marsh and lagoon deposits this terrain filled with low mountains and foothills is characterized by topographic inequality according to the sedimentary phase sequence shown by the borehole the yangtze river delta plain can be split into three basic stratigraphic divisions the body zone of the delta its south wing and its north wing li et al 2000 south jiangsu is nestled in the south wing and body zone of the yangtze river delta as shown in fig 1 fig 2 shows a typical cross section of the recent sedimentary soil at the yangtze river delta plain wherein the body zone comprises a riverbed phase floodplain estuary phase and sedimentary soil layer of delta phase consisting of medium and fine sand sandy clay and lens with sand inclusion where the cross and horizontal beddings have grown from bottom up the south wing of the delta consists mostly of sedimentary soil layers of seashores rich in argillaceous silty fine sand besides the silty fine sand in the lower reaches of the yangtze river consists of platy shaped particles as shown in fig 3 that differ from ordinary round quartz sand this platy shape imparts unique properties to the silty fine sand the sand structured in the shape of a platy shaped particle similar to nanjing sand which is widely distributed along the lower yangtze river coast thus such sites have gained increasing attention of relevant experts because it is valuable to study their seismic response for engineering construction in the lower yangtze river coast for the nanjing sand sampled from the nanjing yangtze river floodplain sedimentary phase in the lower reaches of the yangtze river its average natural density ρ 18 5 kn m3 maximum void ratio e max 1 14 minimum void ratio e min 0 62 relative density ranges between 42 and 46 uniformity coefficient c u 2 31 and curvature coefficient c c 1 07 meanwhile table 1 lists a comparison of physical parameters of nanjing sand against those of toyoura sand the values indicate that the types of sand are quite similar however the shape of toyoura sand is similar to a ball yasuda et al analysed all possible factors affecting the lateral displacement of the liquefaction soil through a series of vibrating table experiments yasuda et al 1992 such influencing factors include whether the overburden is horizontal or inclined the inclined angle and direction at the bottom of the liquefied sand layer compactness of sand loose sand or medium density sand and clay content of sand the analysis indicates that site lateral displacement following soil liquefaction is more apparent when the overburden is inclined instead of being horizontal which implies that a slightly inclined angle on the ground of the site is an important factor influencing the lateral displacement of the liquefied site consequently this paper discussed the influence of various inclined angles of the ground on the lateral displacement of the liquefied soil layer and its induction mechanism 3 constitutive model of liquefiable soil 3 1 yield surface function prevost et al 1985 proposed a function to define the yield surface as 1 f 3 2 s p a α s p a α m 2 p a 2 0 2 s σ p δ p a p a p 1 3 t r σ a c tan φ where σ is the effective cauchy stress tensor and δ is the kronecker delta p is the effective mean normal stress s is the deviatoric stress tensor and c and φ are the cohesion and friction angle of the soil respectively α is a tensor to define the centre of the yield surface in the deviatoric stress plane and m can be calculated by φ yang and elgamal et al developed a dynamic constitutive model of sand according to eq 1 yang and elgamal 2002 elgamal et al 2002 to simulate the dynamic consolidation of soil the biot type theory was used to model the interaction between the solid and fluid of soil parra colmenares and ender 1996 fig 4 shows the shape of the yield surfaces in the principal stress space in this model the hardening parameter should be deduced by solving a quadratic equation with one unknown meanwhile the shear modulus was assumed to be a constant in some strain range to develop this model in numerical modelling the hardening rule of this model was replaced by a widely available hardening rule zhuang et al 2009 2015 according to the new hardening rule all the active yield surfaces f i are tangential with the reversed yield surface f r at the reversed stress point and then the active yield surfaces should consecutively touch and push each other but do not intersect as a result the centres of the active yield surfaces in the deviatoric stress plane should move along the direction from the centre of the newest reversed yield surface f r to the newest reversed stress point accordingly the hardening parameters m and α can be deduced as 3 d m 3 s p a α d s 6 d p s p a α θ 2 j m d p 6 m p a s p a α θ 2 j p a 4 j 3 2 s p a α s p a α 5 d α 2 3 m d p p a d m θ d p α the spatial position of the initial yield surface is determined by α when α 0 the soil is considered as the initial isotropic material conversely when α 0 the initial anisotropy of the soil is considered if the effect of the rotation of the principal stress axis lode angle on the yield surface of the soil needs to be considered the following equation is used when defining material parameters 6 m 2 k 1 k 1 k sin 3 θ m in this formula k is a material parameter that defines the shape of the curve of the yield surface on the plane of the partial stress and θ can be expressed as 7 θ 1 m p a t r s 3 t r s 2 s 3 s p a α the outer normal q of the yield surface is 8 q f f it is found that when the loading and yield surfaces use the same function it is incorrect to asses loading and unloading under dilatancy therefore the influence of the lode angle on parameter m is not considered in this paper i e the yield surface at the π shape curve on the plane of the deviatoric stress is circular and it is assumed that the loading function is different from the yield function the loading surface is a cylindrical surface and the loading function is 9 q l 3 2 s p a α s p a α 0 the outer normal vector q of the loading surface can be determined by 10 q s p a α s p a α s p a α 3 2 model constitutive equation the constitutive equation of the model in incremental form noted as 11 σ e ε ε p where σ is increment of effective stress tensor e is initial elastic stiffness matrix ε is total strain increment and ε p is plastic strain increment 12 ε p p l where p defines the direction of plastic deformation in the stress space and l is the plastic loading function 13 l l i f l 0 0 i f l 0 l 1 h q σ according to equations 5 6 and 9 the plastic loading function can be expressed as 14 l 1 h h 0 q e ε 15 h 0 q e p b 3 p 3 q 2 g p q 16 p p p δ 3 p t r p 17 q q q δ 3 q t r q here h is calculated by 18 h 1 h 1 2 g 1 in the formula g is the shear modulus when considering the effect of the increase in pore water pressure on the soil modulus the initial shear modulus is 19 g g 0 p a p 0 a n p where g 0 is the initial shear modulus of soil under the confining pressure p 0 the material parameter n p can be determined by test in this study n p 0 5 then the following equation can be used to define the elastoplastic tangent modulus 20 h g 1 m m 2 in view of the unique particle shape characteristics of the sand in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river its liquefaction characteristics and resistance to liquefaction are different from those of round grain saturated sand zhuang et al 2018 therefore saturated nanjing fine sand with flaky particles as the main component was used as the cyclic shear test object the hollow cylindrical torsion equipment was used to make the double amplitude shear strain in the test close to 100 the shear moduli at different loading stages of the liquefied sand are shown in fig 5 based on the previous test results zhuang et al 2018 the shear moduli for the saturated nanjing sand in the zero effective stress and dilation stages can be expressed as 21 gl1 313 82 100 γsa 1 065 22 gl2 4852 8 100 γsa 1 033 where γsa is the single amplitude shear strain at the maximum shear stress state of each cyclic loading according to previous tests it is proved that the shear modulus reduction of the liquefied nanjing sand should be affected greatly by the effective confining pressure initial shear loading and amplitude of cyclic shear loading which can not be neglected in the decay function of the shear moduli g l3 accordingly the decay function for the shear moduli g l3 can be expressed as 23 g l 3 a 100 γ s a b 24 a 2 81 p 0 p a 0 9 c s r 0 258 e x p 1 6 s s r 25 b 0 86 c s r 0 1 e x p 1 1 s s r where p0 is the effective confining pressure csr is the cyclic stress ratio and ssr is the initial static stress ratio according to the results of the above studies the modulus attenuation of the shear modulus of the soil before liquefaction that increases with pore pressure is calculated using eq 19 when the soil is liquefied and the loading begins use gl3 in eq 23 instead of g0 in eq 19 when the soil is in the zero effective stress phase during liquefaction use gl1 in eq 21 instead of g0 in eq 19 and when the soil body is in the dilatancy stage during liquefaction use gl2 in eq 22 instead of g0 in eq 19 the detailed tests results and comparation with those of toyoura sand has also been analysed zhuang et al 2018 yang and gu 2013 to verified the constitutive model of the liquefiable soil model without using the shear moduli at different loading stages of the liquefied sand a 3 d numerical model has then developed to model the dynamic responses of a sand sample tested in a dynamic triaxial machine zhuang et al 2015 then after the shear modulus attenuation of the shear modulus at different loading stages modified by eq 21 23 the predicted axial strain time histories and the strain stress curves are compared with the test results as shown in fig 6 which shows that the compiled subroutine is available in this constitutive model the liquefaction induced perfected plastic during shear loading is significant only at very low confinement levels in liquefaction stage it was decided to directly response phase between contraction and dilation and an additional minimal change in shear stress is treated until a user specified shear strain is accumulated then if the shear loading reaches to the phase transformation surface the dilation phase will take place the detailed introduction about this method can be found in reference by elgamal et al 2002 4 finite elements model 4 1 model soil foundation a liquefiable site with different ground inclination angles was designed in this study based on the formation conditions of the nanjing yangtze river floodplain zhuang et al 2018 as shown in fig 8 table 2 shows the dynamic constitutive model parameters of the soil used in this study and table 3 shows the physical and mechanical parameters of each soil layer the thickness of the non liquefied covering layer and the depth of underground water level are kept constant in this study according to the actual engineering site condition the depth of the underground water level is set to be 1 0 m the inclination angles of the slope ground surface of the site are set to be 0 3 6 and 9 respectively the inclination angle of the liquefied soil layer under the slop is assumed to be consistent with those of the slope ground surface as shown in fig 8 4 2 boundary conditions to simulate the liquefaction flow deformation of soil the initial static stress condition of soil foundation should be simulated firstly then the dynamic responses of site should be analysed during the whole analysis the lateral boundary conditions should be converted from the horizontal constrain in the geostatic analysis step to the vertical constrain in the dynamic analysis step to solve this problem two methods can be used such as the static dynamic unified artificial boundary condition developed by liu and li 2005 and the artificial converting boundary method to the artificial converting boundary method the lateral boundary of soil foundation is horizontally constrained and vertically free in the static analysis step after the static analysis step the horizontal support forces of the nodes at the lateral boundary are outputted which is added artificially at the nodes of lateral boundary before the dynamic analysis step at the same time the lateral boundary of soil foundation changes to the vertically constrained and horizontally free as shown in fig 7 however in a strong earthquake the nonlinear properties of soil have taken place the related parameters for the boundary treating method has been changed greatly as a result most of the existed methods could not treat well on the boundary conditions of a large deformed soil foundation in view of the above analysis a large computational domain and fix both the lateral conditions in the horizontal direction should be an effective method to deal with the dynamic boundary condition of a large deformed soil foundation as a result the second method is used to deal with the lateral boundaries in the static and dynamic coupling analysis steps 4 3 finite element meshing the four node planar reduced integration elements are used to mesh the soil foundation and the dimension of element changes from 1 0 m to 3 0 m zhuang et al 2015 shown as fig 8 in this study the arbitrary lagrange euler ale method supported by abaqus software is used to adjust timely the shape of element which should be deformed greatly by the large flow deformation of soil liquefaction in this way the continue flow deformation of liquefied soil can be simulated successfully this method has been proposed by noh and hirt and used in the finite difference method hirt et al 1970 which has been introduced into the finite element method by takashi and hughes takashi and hughes 1992 kjellgren and hyvärinen 1998 4 4 ground motions input to simulate the liquefaction induced flow deformation of site in this study a ground motion recorded by the kobe marine observatory station during the osaka kobe earthquake january 17 1995 japan at a distance of about 1 0 km far from the epicentre and it is a typical near field strong earthquake record the epicentre of the osaka kobe earthquake is shown in fig 9 during this earthquake soil liquefaction occurred at the shores deposit site wherein a larger lateral displacement of the coastal engineering site was induced accordingly the kobe wave recorded at the kjma station was selected as the input motion in this study the original peak accelerations of kobe wave in the n s was 818 02 cm s2 which acceleration duration and response spectrum are as shown in fig 10 due to above reason the ground motion recorded by the kobe marine observatory station was selected as the input motion in this study the intensities of the input motions are equal to 1 0 m s2 2 0 m s2 and 3 0 m s2 and they are obtained by adjusting the peak accelerations of the original ground motions as far as the type of earthquake are concerned it has not considered in this study 5 soil liquefaction of site owing to various peak ground accelerations the effect of ground obliquity on the distribution characteristics of site liquefaction follows a consistent pattern even though the depth and extent of liquefaction may vary fig 11 shows a liquefaction distribution diagram of the site at each ground inclined angle when the peak acceleration of input ground motion at the bedrock is 0 1 g in fig 11 the solution dependent state variables sdv52 refers to the dynamic pore pressure ratio when sdv52 is greater than 1 0 the black zone indicates that the sand has liquefied according to the analysis of the calculated results the extent of liquefaction of soil in the slope body significantly decreases as the ground slope of the site increases when the input peak acceleration remains constant when the ground inclination of the ground surface increase to 6 only discontinuous liquefaction occurs locally in the saturated sand layer of the slope body which should be mainly induced by the discontinuous deformation of the saturated sand under the slope as the ground inclination increases further soil liquefaction in the horizontal layered site below the slope section increases as well however it is slightly reduced for the upper slope section the above regularity becomes more obvious as the input peak acceleration of seismic wave increases especially when the acceleration is 0 3 g wherein the liquefaction that occurs in lower horizontal layered site expands to all liquefiable soil layers while the upper layers are almost free of liquefaction findings similar to such a regular pattern have also been obtained from large scale vibrating table model tests zhuang et al 2019 with the increases of the pga peak ground acceleration noticeable expansion is expected within the corresponding range of soil liquefaction at the same site regardless of the apical slope of the liquefiable layer and this is verified by the fact that liquefaction extends deeper at the site whereas liquefaction in the upper horizontal soil layer reduces and that in the lower horizontal soil layer in the slope body increases as shown in fig 12 fig 13 compares the time history curves of pore pressure ratios at three points in liquefied soil layers with the same burial depth from the ground surface in various sections when the input kobe earthquake signal of bedrock is provided for further differentiating soil liquefaction characteristics in different sections of a slightly sloping liquefiable site in general the pore pressure ratio peaks at p3 in the horizontal soil layer below the slope body thereby sufficiently demonstrating that the level of liquefaction in the horizontal soil layer below the slope body is significantly higher than that in the slope body and in the upper horizontal soil layers further when the slope is 3 the pore pressure ratio at each point in the different section grows synchronously during the initial ground shock however it no longer grows at the same pace as the slope inclination increases the increase in the pore pressure ratio in the lower horizontal soil layers of the slightly inclined slope lags behind those of p1 and p2 especially when the inclined angle is 9 meanwhile as can be seen from fig 13 in the middle and late stages the pore pressure ratio at each point grows asynchronously because of the changes in the strain response in each section of the soil which is caused by the occurrence of slippage after soil liquefaction it should be noted that the pore pressure ratio of the liquefied soil was deduced from the pore pressure divided by the initial effective self weight stress of the soil however in the following dynamic analysis the vertical effective stress of soil foundation should be changed by the soil underground structure interaction as a result some pore pressure ratios shown in original fig 13 are obvious larger than 1 0 6 lateral displacement and settlement of site 6 1 lateral displacement of the soil layer the relative lateral displacement in the old clay layer is considerable lower than that in the liquefiable sand layer and only the relative lateral displacement in the liquefiable sand layer is analysed in this study when the relative displacement between the node at ground surface and the node at the bottom of soil foundation is maximal as shown in fig 14 a comparative analysis of the relative displacement curve of each location selected in the vertical cross section shows that at the top of the liquefiable soil layers the liquefaction is noticeable when input lower acceleration pga 0 1 g and the surface slope is 3 as shown in fig 11 b according to fig 15 a an evidently lateral slippage can be observed in the upper liquefiable soil layers especially in the middle of the slop body point b3 where maximum slippage displacement occurs the slippage displacement from the slope crest to the bottom of the liquefied soil tends to first increase and then decrease during which the peak lateral relative displacement is approximately 0 973 m slippage gradually weakens in the slope section as the ground slope becomes steeper however it may still occur at the top of lower horizontal liquefiable soil layers if the slope inclination increases to 9 there will be almost no slippage in the soil layers in the slope body and the maximum lateral displacement will occur in the upper section of the slope as the ground slope inclination increases the relative large shear deformation of the non liquefied soil layer in the slope part moves further down to the deeper soil layers where the lateral large deformation in soil layers shifts from soil slippage to large shear deformation caused by the severe weakening of the soil modulus thus when the input peak acceleration is low liquefaction induced slippage can only be found on the upper liquefiable soil in the slope body along a single sliding surface when the input acceleration rises to 0 2 g fig 16 in upper liquefiable soil layers in the slope body the liquefied soil layer becomes thicker at a ground slope inclination of 3 and the liquefaction induced slippage along multiple sliding surfaces occurs at the top of liquefied soil layers when the ground slope increases to 6 because the liquefaction degree of the upper soil layer in the slope body is reduced slippage remains evident at the contact position between the overlying non liquefied soil layer and the top surface of the liquefied soil layer further the relative lateral displacements of soil within a certain thickness range in the middle and lower depths of the liquefiable soil layer are caused by the serious weakening of the shearing resistance because of the build up of the pore water pressure when the apical slope inclination is up to 9 the slippage of the liquefiable soil layer in the slope body is not apparent when a large relative shear lateral displacement exists in the entire liquefiable soil layer because of the severe weakening of the shearing resistance of the liquefiable soil caused by the development of pore pressure in the soil as the apical slope inclination of the liquefiable soil layer increases further the maximum lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer tends to first increase and then decrease overall in the case of an input peak acceleration of 0 2 g and a small apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer the lateral soil displacement in the slope body is caused because of soil slippage along multiple sliding surfaces as the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer increases the overall relative lateral displacement of the soil in the slope body gradually shifts from the liquefaction induced slippage to the large shear deformation of the soil caused by the weakening of the shearing resistance when the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases to 0 3 g as can be seen from fig 17 since the liquefaction of the liquefiable soil layer increases the sliding surface is obviously in the lower depth of the liquefiable soil layer when the ground slope inclination is 3 and this manifests as multiple sliding surfaces in the lower depth of the liquefiable soil layer at this point the main driver resulting in the large lateral displacement of the soil layer is no longer only the liquefaction induced slippage in which case shear lateral displacement caused by severe weakening of shearing resistance of soil evidently plays an increasingly major role with the apical slope inclination increasing to 9 liquefaction is still noticeable in soil layers at this time fig 12 b wherein the overall relative lateral displacement of the soil layer at the lower depth of liquefiable soil is caused by both liquefaction induced slippage and the shear weakening of the soil comparing figs 15 17 indicates that the overall relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer accretes considerably as the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases based on the calculation results in this paper the maximum relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer is longer than 5 m a comparative analysis of the results obtained from previous model tests on lateral displacement induced by site liquefaction and those from finite element simulations based on the model test indicates that the varying characteristics of the depth of soil lateral displacement in liquefied foundation determined in this paper are not quite the same as those in the previous research the main difference lies in that the previous model test results fail to effectively reproduce the phenomenon of slippage along the sliding surface following soil liquefaction of the site mostly because of the difficulty in testing sudden changes in the lateral displacement caused by slippage at the contact position inside the soil and between the liquefied and non liquefied soils for previous model tests meanwhile in the previous model tests despite using the free shear box the slippage of the internal liquefied foundation was inevitably affected by the boundary effect of the model box to a certain extent because of the plane motion of the rigid body of its built in water proof rubber pads and stacked steel structures and fraction between layers to further investigate the change in the lateral displacement of the soil layer in the site over time fig 18 shows the time history curve of the top bottom relative lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layer at the vertical section of b2 as shown in the figure if the ground of the site is horizontal the time history curve of the relative displacement remains stable after the strong earthquake phase of the input ground motion especially when the peak acceleration of input ground motion is 0 3 g and there is an obvious tendency to return to zero when the site ground is inclined the top bottom relative lateral displacement in this section obviously shows the phenomenon of accumulation indicating the occurrence of significant permanent relative lateral displacement in the soil layers when the input peak acceleration is 0 1 g there is evidently no significant consecutive liquefaction of the soil in the slope section when the slope inclinations are 6 and 9 fig 11 c and d respectively fig 18 a shows that the slope of the time history curve of relative displacement increases very slowly after the strong shock stage of the input seismic wave occurs this result suggests that the permanent relative lateral displacement of the slightly sloping site is attributed to the nonlinear deformation accumulation of the soil in the strong shock stage of input motion when the soil in the slope body is not continuously liquefied furthermore no clear slippage phenomenon is observed after the strong shock stage of input motion as the peak acceleration of input ground motion increases soil liquefaction is evident in the slope body as shown in fig 12 as shown by the top bottom relative displacement curve at cross section b2 a sharp increase did not appear until the strong shock stage of the input ground motion this implies the top bottom relative displacement in the soil layer at this point arises from the lagging accumulated deformation caused by soil liquefaction and severe weakening of soil strength during the strong shock period then in 20 s after the earthquake the relative lateral displacement curve essentially levels off 6 2 verification of the lateral displacement of the site based on the aerial photographs captured before and after the earthquake hamada et al organized the data on lateral displacement induced by seismic soil liquefaction hamada et al 1987 and derived the regression formula as 26 d h 0 75 h θ 3 where dh is the ground lateral displacement h is the anticipated thickness of the liquefied layer meter and θ is the ground slope or bottom slope angel of the liquefiable soil layer according to the calculation results in this paper the average liquefaction thickness of the soil layer under each calculation condition is listed in table 4 in addition based on observed data on liquefaction induced lateral displacement obtained from eight earthquakes that occurred in the united states and japan bartlett and youd assumed that the lateral displacement is a function of earthquake magnitude terrain geology and soil parameters they designed a multiple regression model mlr of liquefaction induced lateral displacement in slightly sloping sites bartlett and youd 1992 27 log d h 15 7870 1 1782 m 0 9275 l o g

thickness of the liquefied layer unit m f15 is the average fine content and d5015 is the average grain diameter unit mm the parameters of the liquefied soil layer in this paper are based on the dynamic parameters of nanjing fine sand whose d5015 0 17 mm f15 0 9 since seismic waves used for calculation in this paper are not actual data based on the on site seismic environment on site ground acceleration values obtained under various calculation conditions and model parameters for the above formula 27 which are determined with the recommended method in the literature are as listed in table 4 table 5 lists a comparison of numerical calculation results in this paper with the prediction results of formula 26 and formula 27 table 5 indicates that the prediction result yielded by empirical formula 27 is closer to that yielded by the numerical calculation and the varying pattern of ground lateral displacement with the ground slope coincides with the numerical calculation result in general the predicted results yielded by formula 27 for the slightly sloping site at 6 and 9 are closer to those yielded by the numerical calculation however the predicted results in the case of an inclined angle of 3 are not satisfactory meanwhile empirical formula 26 predicts an exaggerated result for the lateral displacement of the site if the input peak accelerations are 0 1 g and 0 2 g 6 3 vertical displacement at ground surface to further analyse the vertical displacement response of the slightly sloping site fig 19 shows the time history curves of the vertical displacements at points a and c on different ground surfaces of the site respectively and the specific locations are as shown in fig 14 the figure shows that an evident vertical subsidence occurs at point a at the ground surface of the horizontal soil layer near the slope crest of the slightly sloping site and a clear uplift at point c at the ground surface of the horizontal soil layer near the foot of the slope however it is apparent that the extent of subsidence at point a is greater than that of the uplift at point c in general the time history processes of the subsidence at point a is consistent with that of the lateral displacement of the soil layer shown in fig 18 thus it can be argued that the vertical subsidence near the slope crest is caused by the lateral displacement of the soil layer in the slope and it keeps rising because it emerges after the strong shock stage of the input motion in view of the development trend however the uplift process at point c differs apparently from that of soil lateral displacement and the subsidence at point a when the slightly sloping site has an inclined angle of 3 the uplift at point c at the slope foot maintains a growing momentum however when the slope angle of slightly sloping site increases to 6 and 9 the uplift at point c appears during the strong shock stage and exhibits a clear trend towards subsidence 6 4 relationship between lateral displacement and vertical displacement this paper attempts to analyse the relationship between the vertical displacement of the ground surface and the lateral displacement of the slope body in a slightly sloping site fig 20 shows the curves reflecting the connection of vertical subsidence at point a with the maximum uplift displacement at point c and the maximum lateral displacement of the liquefiable soil layers an approximately linear relationship exists between the ground vertical displacement of the slightly sloping site and the maximum lateral displacement of the slope body which is less likely to be affected by the inclination of the site and the peak acceleration of input ground motion thus under the numerical simulation calculation conditions used in this study it is believed that the empirical prediction results for the lateral displacement of the slightly sloping site can be used to predict its ground vertical displacement based on this study the maximum lateral displacement in soil layers of the slope is about 4 5 times the ground subsidence at the ground surface near the slope crest and the subsidence at the slope crest is about 4 5 times the uplift at the ground surface near the foot of the slight slope at present study the calculated results on this problem are limited to give more analysis and explain on the relationship between lateral displacement and vertical displacement of a slightly inclining site some analysis on this section should be in the preliminary stage and further more studies on this relationship should be done in the following research 7 conclusions this paper proposed a finite element numerical analysis model based on a constitutive model of soil to simulate the liquefaction induced large deformation and a finite element meshing technique for the flow slip large deformation further the effect of various inclined angles at the top of the liquefiable soil layer on the distribution characteristics of soil liquefaction lateral deformation features of the site and ground settlement characteristics were analysed the principal conclusions are as follows for similar input peak accelerations an increase in the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer resulted in a dramatic decrease in the liquefaction depth of the soil layer in the slope body a distinct distribution pattern of discontinuous liquefaction was also observed given that the input peak acceleration is larger obvious liquefaction only appeared at the top surface of the liquefiable soil layers in the slope body in the case of both a small slope angle at the top liquefiable soil layer 3 in this study and a small input peak acceleration of seismic wave 0 1 g in this study the liquefied soil on the top of the liquefiable soil layer is thin which causes an overlaying soil layer to slip along one single sliding surface near the top of the under the non liquefied soil layer in which soil lateral displacement is attributed to the slippage of upper soils after soil liquefaction if the input peak acceleration of the seismic wave increases to a certain value and the apical slope angle of the liquefiable soil layer is small soil lateral displacement is caused by soil slippage on multiple sliding surfaces along with an increase in the apical slope of the liquefiable soil layer soil lateral displacement in the slope body gradually shifts from the liquefaction induced slippage to the cumulative shear deformation caused by severe weakening of shearing resistance of the non liquefied soil under a limited magnitude earthquake when the soil in the slope body is not liquefied the relative lateral displacement of the soil layer is caused by the accumulated deformation of the soil layer which results from the input ground motion during the strong shock stage then the soil lateral displacement essentially becomes steady once the strong shock stage is over if the input ground motion is more intense because of the serious weakening of soil liquefaction in the slope body the occurrence of lateral displacement in the slope body is obviously because of the hysteresis after the strong shock stage of input ground motion the preliminary findings from this study demonstrate an approximately linear relationship between the ground vertical displacement of the slightly sloping site and the maximum lateral displacement of the slope body such a connection is less likely to be affected by the inclination of the site and the peak acceleration of input ground motion thus it is believed that the empirical prediction results for lateral displacement in the soil layer of the slightly sloping site can be used to predict its ground vertical displacement through a comparative analysis of the numerical calculation results in this paper and the predicted results of existing empirical formulas the predicted results from the empirical formula established by hamada et al who used site data varied considerably from the numerical calculation results however the results predicted in this study relatively coincide with the predictions made by the mlr method credit authorship contribution statement zhuang haiyang validation
