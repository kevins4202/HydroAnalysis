10370,minimizing the adverse impacts of soil erosion and seasonal drought are critical to sustain production for citrus orchards on red soil slopes in southern china investigation of water budget between water supply and crop water demand is important to develop specific soil and water conservation measures to effectively utilize rainwater and irrigation in dry season in this study the surface runoff and soil water content at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm in the soil were monitored and hydrus 1d model was employed to estimate the evapotranspiration and deep percolation at a mature citrus orchard in southern china the results show that the annual effective rainfall in citrus orchards in the study area during 2010 2015 was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm the average effective rainfall from april to september was more than 70 mm per month and the total amount accounted for 66 63 of the annual effective rainfall deep percolation could account for 18 85 65 65 of the effective rainfall which was the main factor affecting the effective rainfall the water demand of citrus was 645 4 994 9 mm with an average of 843 2 mm the average water demand of 6 years from may to august was over 90 mm per month accounting for 55 34 of the whole growth period which was the key period of citrus water demand seasonal water deficit may occur in both high and low rainfall years in the study area and the frequency and degree of water shortage are prominent from july to october according to a water demand analysis surface runoff collected by rainwater harvesting for irrigation can satisfy the water shortage for citrus during the fruit growth period measures to reduce deep percolation should also be considered to increase the effective rainfall for sloping citrus orchards keywords water budget effective rainfall water demand soil moisture citrus orchard 1 introduction citrus is one of the important fruit crops in the hilly red soil region in southern china in 2018 the production and planting area of citrus accounted for 36 47 and 42 73 of the total fruit in the area respectively due to the uneven temporal distribution of precipitation seasonal water shortage and soil erosion are the two main threats to sustainable fruit cultivation lu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 heavy monsoonal rainfall between april and june causes serious soil erosion and water loss in the form of excessive runoff in sloping orchards mo et al 2019 although the average annual precipitation in the red soil regions of southern china is around 1400 mm intensive drought stress occurs frequently because of the limited rainfall from july to october in addition the low plant available water and poor water holding capacity of red clay soil d angelo et al 2014 silva et al 2008 poses a huge challenge for citrus production in these regions more importantly high yield and good quality of citrus production requires maintenance of soil water content near the field capacity especially during the fruit spreading growth period from july to september fares et al 2008 which coincides with the dry period of a year drought stress on citrus affects plant morphology and physiology and ultimately leads to yield reduction garcia tejero et al 2012 according to preliminary investigations in the study area the severe meteorological drought from july to october in 2019 reduced the yield of citrus by 20 30 full understand of the hydrological cycle and water budget components of soil plant atmosphere continuum in citrus orchards especially the water fluxes of the system including evapotranspiration of fruit trees and deep percolation can help us improve soil conservation in rainy season and water management in dry season the water budget for a sloping citrus orchard is determined by the difference between effective rainfall and water requirement of fruit trees which requires to investigate the dynamics of the water budget components within the effective root zone effective rainfall refers to the fraction of soil water storage that is actually added to the root zone form the total rainfall which is given by the total rainfall minus the surface runoff canopy interception and deep percolation obreza and pitts 2002 by assuming that the water requirement of fruit tree tissue growth less than 1 of total water demand is negligible the water demand of fruit trees is the evapotranspiration which is the sum of the root water uptake and soil evaporation it can be seen that the hydrological components of sloping citrus orchards include rainfall canopy interception surface runoff root zone soil water storage deep percolation transpiration of fruit trees and soil evaporation evapotranspiration some components in the water budget equation such as rainfall and surface runoff are easily measured whereas others such as the evapotranspiration root zone soil water storage and deep percolation require considerable effort to measure gunawardena et al 2011 herbrich et al 2017 more importantly it is impossible to conduct measurements under all possible combinations of climate and orchard management variables as such measurements expense time consuming laborious and unreliable in some cases walker et al 2002 water budget models based on experiments in small plots for runoff soil erosion evapotranspiration and other hydrological processes mayerhofer et al 2017 was regarded as a valuable method the models allow to extrapolate field measurements to different conditions with some predictive capabilities determining how to accurately simulate the water budget process of a cropland system has become a popular research topic and attracted considerable attention in the field of hydrology some of the current models include the soil water atmosphere plant swap model martínezferri et al 2013 soil water balance swb model sautoy et al 2003 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 of these models hydrus 1d can accurately simulate soil water dynamics by including different components of the plant soil water hydrological process such as canopy interception actual root water uptake soil water storage and deep drainage šimůnek et al 2008 and its boundary conditions are flexible which makes it possible to simulate the water cycle in the field although this model has been widely used in irrigation systems water movement and transport of agricultural contaminants for different crops šimůnek et al 2016 orchard has been rarely studied using hydrus 1d under field conditions and the simulations of evaporation transpiration and deep percolation are particularly rare water availability and the resilience of the soil water system to change depend on the internal dynamics of the system which necessitates an understanding of both the water budget components and the processes governing their behavior the specific objectives of this study were to 1 quantitatively estimate the water budget components of a citrus orchard on sloping red soil by hydrus 1d model including effective rainfall plant water uptake and deep percolation below the root zone and 2 analyze the dynamic process of water supply and demand balance in a red soil citrus orchard our results will benefit water resources management and soil erosion control in mountainous orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located at the experimental station of the jiangxi institute of soil and water conservation a red soil region of southern china 115 42 38 e 29 16 37 n where belong to subtropical monsoon climate region the red soil in this region was primarily produced from the weathering of quaternary sediments and the soil texture was silty loam from 1980 to 2015 the annual average temperature of the study area was 16 5 18 8 the annual sunshine was 1464 2005 h and the frost free period was 245 260 d fig 1 the annual rainfall was 954 0 2123 8 mm with an average of 1439 6 mm the rainy season in the region is between march and august which accounts for 51 91 88 32 of the total annual rainfall the rainfall increases monthly from january to june peaks in june and decrease thereafter although the rainwater resources are abundant in the study area the seasonal and annual rainfall distributions are uneven 2 2 field experiment and measurement in order to collect the surface runoff caused by rainfall in the orchard runoff plot of dimensions 20 m long 5 m wide with a 12 slope was installed with a horizontal projection area of 100 m2 the concrete edges of the plots were 30 cm above the surface and 45 cm deep underground twelve citrus trees citrus reticulata blanco cv ponkan two years old with fructus aurantii rootstock were planted in the runoff plot in 6 rows along the slope with 2 plants per row in 2000 the within row spacing was 3 m and the between row spacing was 2 5 m the management of fruit trees in the experimental plot is basically consistent with local fruit growers in 2005 the citrus trees reached maturity and began to bear fruit as measured in 2016 more than 85 of the citrus root system in the study orchard was distributed to a depth of 60 cm and the diameter of the tree crown was approximately 230 cm the surface runoff of rainfall events was observed by runoff collection pools meteorological data from an automatic station located in an open area close to the plots were provided by the experimental station soil water measurement access tubes were installed at 3 locations top middle and downhill along the slope in each plot the volumetric soil moisture content of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm depth at each location was measured twice a month using fdr water velocimeter pr2 6 profile probe delta t devices ltd cambridge uk from 2010 to 2015 the fdr probes had an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 after it was calibrated for the test soil rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm air temperature and relative air humidity were measured at a height of 2 m wind speed and direction were measured at a height of 10 m solar radiation is measured by a pyrometer in wm 2 2 3 hydrus 1d modeling 2 3 1 model s equations many studies have shown that vertical movement of soil water flow in the unsaturated zone is significantly greater than that in the lateral direction foussereau et al 2000 yan et al 2012 assuming a homogeneous and isotropic soil under the condition of root water uptake jing and chen 2011 the lateral movement of soil water could be negligible such that soil water movement would be restricted to vertical direction a hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2013 was employed to simulate the daily soil moisture root water uptake and deep percolation in the experimental citrus orchards the soil moisture movement within the hydrus 1d model was controlled by the one dimensional richards equation 1 θ t z k h h z k h s where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm3 h is the soil water pressure head cm t

function of root water uptake which describes the spatial distribution of root water uptake h 1 and h 2 are the soil water potential with root water uptake rates of 1 and 0 respectively the following parameters of the feddes model were used h1 10 h2 25 h3 200 to 1000 and h4 8000 cm which were adapted from taylor and ashcroft 1972 for orange tp is the potential transpiration rate of a crop cm d

and the model was used to simulate the soil water content changes in the 0 100 cm soil profiles of the experimental plots the upper boundary condition was defined as the atmospheric boundary with the surface layer which permits water to build up on the soil surface however surface runoff was not simulated and the maximum height of water at the soil surface was set as zero in this study the rainfall minus surface runoff depth and the canopy interception was used as the net rainfall input at the upper boundary due to the deep soil in the study area where the water table is much deeper than the domain of interest the free drainage condition was set for the bottom boundary at a soil depth of 100 cm 2 3 3 calibration and validation of the model the soil profiles were divided into three layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 100 cm based on the soil bulk density and genetic horizons and the physical properties were assumed to be uniform within each layer whereas the model calibration was based on data from the 2010 and the model was validated with data from the 2015 according to the measured soil mechanical composition of each layer the initial values of the soil characteristic curve parameters of each layer were calculated by using neural network prediction in hydrus 1d then the parameters were fitted to the measured data of 2010 in the experimental area and parameters of the soil characteristic curve of the citrus orchard were finally determined table 1 the model efficiency in the calibration and validation years was evaluated by using the determination coefficient r2 and root mean square errors rmse 10 r m s e 1 n θ o θ m 2 where n is the number of observations and θm and θo are the modeled and observed values of the soil water content respectively based on the hydrus 1d model the soil moisture change in citrus orchard could be calculated in this study the average water contents on the upper middle and lower slopes of the citrus orchard were used as the actual observed values at different depths the coefficients of determination r2 between the simulated and measured soil water contents in the plots are from 0 80 to 0 94 and the rmse is only 0 013 0 024 fig 2 which indicates that the simulated and measured soil water contents were in good agreements therefore the calibrated hydrus 1d model can simulate the process of soil hydrological change in citrus orchards 2 4 water budget effective rainfall is the main source of water in citrus orchards on red soil slopes it was defined as the portion of rainfall that actually supplements the soil moisture of the plant root layer and it was calculated by the following equation obreza and pitts 2002 11 e r i p i i i r i d p i where pi is the precipitation mm ii is the canopy interception ri is the surface runoff mm and dpi mm is the deep percolation which is the portion of precipitation that percolates below the root zone water budget can be defined as the difference between the water input and water output within a certain period zuo et al 2016 therefore the water budget of an orchard is used to determine the difference between effective rainfall supply and water consumption of fruit trees for a period of time the water budget of the citrus orchard was estimated using the water balance eq 11 12 w i e r i w d i where w i is the water budget mm e r i is the effective rainfall mm w d i is the water demand of citrus trees mm including actual root water uptake transpiration and soil evaporation when w i 0 it indicates water surplus in the orchard when w i 0 it indicates water deficit in the orchard when w i 0 a water balance is indicated the magnitude of the value reflects the degree of the soil water resource deficit or surplus in root zone 3 results 3 1 deep percolation distribution the deep percolation of soil water is a significant way of water loss for an orchard on sloped land and also an important factor affecting the effective rainfall driving hydrus 1d daily deep percolation of soil water fluxes was obtained the simulation results show that from 2010 to 2015 the water loss through deep percolation in the study area was 105 7 592 0 mm with an average of 365 2 mm fig 3 which accounted for 14 92 38 25 of the surface soil infiltration and 11 76 31 33 of the total rainfall deep percolation mainly occurred from march to july when the total amount was 94 5 440 0 mm which accounted for 74 32 92 66 of the annual total rainfall on the contrary the total amount of deep percolation from august to december was only 1 4 135 8 mm which accounted for only 0 47 22 94 of the total percolation the monthly variation in deep percolation showed a clear seasonal pattern with minimum in autumn september to november and a maximum in spring summer rainfall is an important factor that affects deep percolation the statistical results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the monthly rainfall and the amount of deep percolation p 0 01 3 2 effective rainfall distribution the effective rainfall of the study orchard could be calculated according to eq 10 table 2 from 2010 to 2015 the effective rainfall of the citrus orchard in the study area was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm the annual average effective rainfall increased from january to june and decreased gradually afterwards in monthly distribution there was a significant positive correlation between the effective rainfall and the total rainfall p 0 01 from april to september the effective rainfall of each month was more than 70 mm and the total amount during this period accounted for 66 63 of the whole the year 3 3 water demand distribution the water demand of citrus includes the actual transpiration of the fruit trees the evaporation from soil between the trees and the amount of water consumed by the plant tissues because the water consumption in the plant tissue is relatively small and can be neglected the fruit tree transpiration and soil evaporation are the main water consumption items in a sloped citrus orchard from 2010 to 2015 the transpiration of citrus trees in the orchard was 553 0 867 9 mm and the soil evaporation was 92 4 127 0 mm table 3 the average total evapotranspiration of citrus was 843 2 mm where the largest was 994 9 mm in 2012 and the smallest was 645 4 mm in 2011 the calculated results were similar to those measured in the other red soil region of southern china tahir et al 2016 the water demand of citrus showed a single peak during a year that is lower in january then increased continuously reached the peak in july and then decreased gradually the average water demand from may to august was more than 90 mm per month which accounted for 55 34 of the demand for the whole growth period the young citrus expansion stage from may to august was the key period for water demand and also the sensitive period to water supply garcia tejero et al 2010 3 4 water budget there is no irrigation system in the citrus orchard of the experimental plot and the source of water was only from natural rainfall the rainfall in the study area from 2010 to 2015 was 899 1 1889 7 mm the average rainfall was 1601 6 mm the rainfall within a year was mainly concentrated in the period from march to august which accounted for 70 85 of the annual rainfall although the total rainfall in the study area was abundant the effective rainfall only accounted for 47 45 62 37 of the total rainfall the annual canopy interception accounted for 13 57 23 5 of the total rainfall fig 4 alva et al 1999 reported that the citrus canopy interception accounted for 21 50 of the incident rainfall which is similar to our estimate the annual surface runoff of the citrus orchard from 2010 to 2015 was 23 7 227 5 mm with an average value of 112 0 mm the surface runoff was mainly concentrated from march to september which accounted for 90 08 of the total runoff the variation in the monthly runoff coefficient was not consistent with the rainfall on a short time scale the surface runoff was not only influenced by the rainfall amount but also by the rainfall intensity zhao et al 2015 among the water components the annual evapotranspiration deep percolation canopy interception and surface runoff account for 49 66 11 29 14 21 and only 2 13 respectively the water budget of the citrus orchard can be calculated according to eq 12 the year of 2011 was a dry year with less rainfall which led to many months of water deficit in the citrus orchard table 4 although the rainfall in 2010 and 2013 was more than 1400 mm due to the large amount of surface runoff loss the effective rainfall was actually lower than other years resulting water deficit for many months in the orchard due to the unmatched water demand of fruit trees and rainfall distribution citrus orchards in the study area may suffer from seasonal water shortage to different extent every month even in a high rainfall year normally water shortage is not substantial from january to june and the frequency and degree of water shortage are high from july to september the effect of water shortage duration on citrus tree growth was different from january to june soil water storage in the root zone was high and increased month by month fig 5 which allows for slight water shortage during this period without yield reduction from july to september was the period of fruit expansion in this period the water demand of fruit trees was large and the water storage of soil was low which could not effectively meet the water demand of fruit trees for the growth of fruit trees on sloping land surface runoff was the potential water resource once runoff was conserved by rainwater harvesting it may be used for irrigation the calculation results of monthly water surplus and potential available water balance remain available water showed that the surface runoff collected by runoff collection structures in the study orchard could meet the water deficit of citrus except for slight water shortage in january july and august table 5 4 discussion 4 1 validity of the model measurements of water components are considered to be expensive time consuming and require special instruments that are not always available physically based models can be used for extrapolating measured water budget components to different environments for improving water management in this study the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the soil moisture of 0 100 cm depth in a mature citrus orchard and the simulated data matched the measured values well due to climate differences it is difficult to directly compare citrus evapotranspiration in different regions niziński et al 2017 therefore crop coefficients were used for comparison according to the simulation results the water demand coefficients of citrus in the study area were from 0 54 to 1 09 with an average of 0 93 in summer and 0 68 in winter yang et al 2003 used weighing lysimeters to measure the actual evapotranspiration for eight year old murcott orange trees and found that the average seasonal crop coefficients were 0 91 and 0 75 during the summer and winter periods in japan respectively alves et al 2007 determined that the crop coefficients of citrus in southern brazil varied from 0 53 to 1 05 by weighing lysimeters the simulated crop coefficients were essentially consistent with the results of other humid regions morgan et al 2006 rogers et al 1983 the deep percolation of water components was another simulated variable larger deep percolation means less effective rainfall in our study deep percolation accounted for 11 76 31 33 of the total precipitation in the same study region jiangxi province he et al 2002 observed that the deep percolation of the broad leave forest was 110 1 605 9 mm according to their 12 year monitoring data which was similar to our simulated study wang et al 2011 used the hydrus 2d model to estimate the deep percolation under citrus orchards and found that the deep percolation accounted for 14 6 41 4 of the annual rainfall which agrees to our simulated results all these factors indicated that the evapotranspiration and deep percolation of citrus can be well simulated by hydrus 1d surface runoff is an important component of orchard water balance and it also affects the net rainfall input of hydrus 1d model hydrus 1d model has good accuracy in simulating the movement process of water into soil but it is not very good for surface runoff simulation especially in areas with abundant rainfall like previous studies the daily rainfall in this study was input as the original rainfall minus measured surface runoff therefore to improve the accuracy of the hydrus 1d model actual observations of surface runoff are required as possible 4 2 water resource management evapotranspiration of citrus in the study region normally ranges from 550 to 900 mm depending on the weather table 3 the total water input sum of rainfall in the studies ranged from 800 to 1900 mm which was more than the water demand of citrus fig 4 the main reason of seasonal water shortage is the uneven distribution of rainfall time therefore it is necessary to adopt certain soil and water conservation measures to improve the soil water storage or rainwater allocate increase the water supply for plant demand napoli et al 2014 most orchards in red soil hilly region of southern china were rain fed and the effective rainfall was the sole source of water supply larger deep percolation means less effective rainfall in our study deep percolation accounted for 11 76 31 33 of the total rainfall for the growth of citrus trees the deep percolation water below 100 cm was considered as unavailable water in addition the deep percolation was closely related to the leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients bethune et al 2008 wang et al 2014 taking relevant measures to reduce the deep percolation can increase the effective rainfall and reduce non point source pollution the effects of soil and water conservation measures on deep percolation were significant and complex soil and water conservation measures can effectively improve soil water storage but in the meanwhile it would promote deep percolation and its contribution rate can reach 85 7 lai et al 2016 therefore the fundamental measures of soil water management were to improve the soil water holding capacity adding biochar obia et al 2016 ulyett et al 2014 and super absorbent polymer bai et al 2010 were effective ways to improve the soil water storage and reduce the deep leakage of soil water citrus orchard evapotranspiration is due to both citrus transpiration and soil evaporation while the transpiration of fruit trees was directly related to productivity soil evaporation is considered an unproductive component of the soil water balance even if it affects the orchard energy balance soil evaporation contributes significantly to evapotranspiration of orchard which will affect the water use efficiency of orchard this study found that soil evaporation can account for 12 54 14 31 of the total evapotranspiration in citrus orchards organic mulching such as straw and grass are popular management practices for decreasing soil evaporation and increasing water availability in orchard kader et al 2017 by reducing the topsoil temperature in summer straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 21 40 compared with ck chen et al 2007 and the grass mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 36 53 shi et al 2009 at the same time organic mulching can play a positive role in soil and water conservation and improve soil water holding capacity by increasing soil total porosity for example straw mulching could reduce sediment concentration by 97 70 runoff by 96 34 and runoff coefficient by 96 45 jordán et al 2010 increase available water capacity by 18 35 total porosity by 35 46 mulumba and lal 2008 grass mulching also significantly reduced the runoff coefficient by 66 11 adekalu et al 2007 which could increase soil water storage rainwater harvesting technologies had been proven to be effective in reallocating water distribution thereby increasing water use efficiency and crop yield meng et al 2020 collection of surface runoff water during the rainy season for supplementary irrigation in dry season can effectively reduce the seasonal water shortage in orchards panigrahi 2015 table 5 showed that if the water shortage of every month required collected surface runoff for irrigation there was still a water shortage of 9 3 mm 6 3 mm and 7 9 mm in january july and august accounting for 37 20 4 22 and 8 87 of et respectively however if the collected surface runoff was only used for irrigation in july and august maximum water shortage and low soil water storage the water shortage could be fully met in addition the scale of rainwater storage structures is directly related to the economic cost xiao and dijk 2011 therefore it is suggested that rainwater harvesting irrigation should only be used in the critical period of fruit tree growth in southern china 5 conclusion the calibrated hydrus 1d model is found to be a useful tool to simulate effective rainfall and water demand for analyzing water budget in a mature citrus orchard the effective rainfall in the experiment citrus orchard was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm during the study period from 2010 to 2015 deep percolation was an important factor affecting effective rainfall which accounted for 11 76 31 33 22 47 on average of total rainfall the water demand of citrus trees was 645 4 994 9 mm and the average value was 843 2 mm the total water demand from may to august accounted for 55 34 of the annual water demand which was the key period of water demand for fruit trees in both wet and dry years in the red region of the southern china citrus may suffer from seasonal water shortages especially from july to september collecting surface runoff to supplement irrigation could meet the water shortage during the critical water demand period of citrus trees it was also suggested that measures should be taken to reduce deep percolation by improving

10370,minimizing the adverse impacts of soil erosion and seasonal drought are critical to sustain production for citrus orchards on red soil slopes in southern china investigation of water budget between water supply and crop water demand is important to develop specific soil and water conservation measures to effectively utilize rainwater and irrigation in dry season in this study the surface runoff and soil water content at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm 40 cm 60 cm and 100 cm in the soil were monitored and hydrus 1d model was employed to estimate the evapotranspiration and deep percolation at a mature citrus orchard in southern china the results show that the annual effective rainfall in citrus orchards in the study area during 2010 2015 was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm the average effective rainfall from april to september was more than 70 mm per month and the total amount accounted for 66 63 of the annual effective rainfall deep percolation could account for 18 85 65 65 of the effective rainfall which was the main factor affecting the effective rainfall the water demand of citrus was 645 4 994 9 mm with an average of 843 2 mm the average water demand of 6 years from may to august was over 90 mm per month accounting for 55 34 of the whole growth period which was the key period of citrus water demand seasonal water deficit may occur in both high and low rainfall years in the study area and the frequency and degree of water shortage are prominent from july to october according to a water demand analysis surface runoff collected by rainwater harvesting for irrigation can satisfy the water shortage for citrus during the fruit growth period measures to reduce deep percolation should also be considered to increase the effective rainfall for sloping citrus orchards keywords water budget effective rainfall water demand soil moisture citrus orchard 1 introduction citrus is one of the important fruit crops in the hilly red soil region in southern china in 2018 the production and planting area of citrus accounted for 36 47 and 42 73 of the total fruit in the area respectively due to the uneven temporal distribution of precipitation seasonal water shortage and soil erosion are the two main threats to sustainable fruit cultivation lu et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 heavy monsoonal rainfall between april and june causes serious soil erosion and water loss in the form of excessive runoff in sloping orchards mo et al 2019 although the average annual precipitation in the red soil regions of southern china is around 1400 mm intensive drought stress occurs frequently because of the limited rainfall from july to october in addition the low plant available water and poor water holding capacity of red clay soil d angelo et al 2014 silva et al 2008 poses a huge challenge for citrus production in these regions more importantly high yield and good quality of citrus production requires maintenance of soil water content near the field capacity especially during the fruit spreading growth period from july to september fares et al 2008 which coincides with the dry period of a year drought stress on citrus affects plant morphology and physiology and ultimately leads to yield reduction garcia tejero et al 2012 according to preliminary investigations in the study area the severe meteorological drought from july to october in 2019 reduced the yield of citrus by 20 30 full understand of the hydrological cycle and water budget components of soil plant atmosphere continuum in citrus orchards especially the water fluxes of the system including evapotranspiration of fruit trees and deep percolation can help us improve soil conservation in rainy season and water management in dry season the water budget for a sloping citrus orchard is determined by the difference between effective rainfall and water requirement of fruit trees which requires to investigate the dynamics of the water budget components within the effective root zone effective rainfall refers to the fraction of soil water storage that is actually added to the root zone form the total rainfall which is given by the total rainfall minus the surface runoff canopy interception and deep percolation obreza and pitts 2002 by assuming that the water requirement of fruit tree tissue growth less than 1 of total water demand is negligible the water demand of fruit trees is the evapotranspiration which is the sum of the root water uptake and soil evaporation it can be seen that the hydrological components of sloping citrus orchards include rainfall canopy interception surface runoff root zone soil water storage deep percolation transpiration of fruit trees and soil evaporation evapotranspiration some components in the water budget equation such as rainfall and surface runoff are easily measured whereas others such as the evapotranspiration root zone soil water storage and deep percolation require considerable effort to measure gunawardena et al 2011 herbrich et al 2017 more importantly it is impossible to conduct measurements under all possible combinations of climate and orchard management variables as such measurements expense time consuming laborious and unreliable in some cases walker et al 2002 water budget models based on experiments in small plots for runoff soil erosion evapotranspiration and other hydrological processes mayerhofer et al 2017 was regarded as a valuable method the models allow to extrapolate field measurements to different conditions with some predictive capabilities determining how to accurately simulate the water budget process of a cropland system has become a popular research topic and attracted considerable attention in the field of hydrology some of the current models include the soil water atmosphere plant swap model martínezferri et al 2013 soil water balance swb model sautoy et al 2003 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 of these models hydrus 1d can accurately simulate soil water dynamics by including different components of the plant soil water hydrological process such as canopy interception actual root water uptake soil water storage and deep drainage šimůnek et al 2008 and its boundary conditions are flexible which makes it possible to simulate the water cycle in the field although this model has been widely used in irrigation systems water movement and transport of agricultural contaminants for different crops šimůnek et al 2016 orchard has been rarely studied using hydrus 1d under field conditions and the simulations of evaporation transpiration and deep percolation are particularly rare water availability and the resilience of the soil water system to change depend on the internal dynamics of the system which necessitates an understanding of both the water budget components and the processes governing their behavior the specific objectives of this study were to 1 quantitatively estimate the water budget components of a citrus orchard on sloping red soil by hydrus 1d model including effective rainfall plant water uptake and deep percolation below the root zone and 2 analyze the dynamic process of water supply and demand balance in a red soil citrus orchard our results will benefit water resources management and soil erosion control in mountainous orchards 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study site was located at the experimental station of the jiangxi institute of soil and water conservation a red soil region of southern china 115 42 38 e 29 16 37 n where belong to subtropical monsoon climate region the red soil in this region was primarily produced from the weathering of quaternary sediments and the soil texture was silty loam from 1980 to 2015 the annual average temperature of the study area was 16 5 18 8 the annual sunshine was 1464 2005 h and the frost free period was 245 260 d fig 1 the annual rainfall was 954 0 2123 8 mm with an average of 1439 6 mm the rainy season in the region is between march and august which accounts for 51 91 88 32 of the total annual rainfall the rainfall increases monthly from january to june peaks in june and decrease thereafter although the rainwater resources are abundant in the study area the seasonal and annual rainfall distributions are uneven 2 2 field experiment and measurement in order to collect the surface runoff caused by rainfall in the orchard runoff plot of dimensions 20 m long 5 m wide with a 12 slope was installed with a horizontal projection area of 100 m2 the concrete edges of the plots were 30 cm above the surface and 45 cm deep underground twelve citrus trees citrus reticulata blanco cv ponkan two years old with fructus aurantii rootstock were planted in the runoff plot in 6 rows along the slope with 2 plants per row in 2000 the within row spacing was 3 m and the between row spacing was 2 5 m the management of fruit trees in the experimental plot is basically consistent with local fruit growers in 2005 the citrus trees reached maturity and began to bear fruit as measured in 2016 more than 85 of the citrus root system in the study orchard was distributed to a depth of 60 cm and the diameter of the tree crown was approximately 230 cm the surface runoff of rainfall events was observed by runoff collection pools meteorological data from an automatic station located in an open area close to the plots were provided by the experimental station soil water measurement access tubes were installed at 3 locations top middle and downhill along the slope in each plot the volumetric soil moisture content of 10

probes had an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 after it was calibrated for the test soil rainfall was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge with a resolution of 0 2 mm air temperature and relative air humidity were measured at a height of 2 m wind speed and direction were measured at a height of 10 m solar radiation is measured by a pyrometer in wm 2 2 3 hydrus 1d modeling 2 3 1 model s equations many studies have shown that vertical movement of soil water flow in the unsaturated zone is significantly greater than that in the lateral direction foussereau et al 2000 yan et al 2012 assuming a homogeneous and isotropic soil under the condition of root water uptake jing and chen 2011 the lateral movement of soil water could be negligible such that soil water movement would be restricted to vertical direction a hydrus 1d model simunek et al 2013 was employed to simulate the daily soil moisture root water uptake and deep percolation in the experimental citrus orchards the soil moisture

parameters of the feddes model were used h1 10 h2 25 h3 200 to 1000 and h4 8000 cm which were adapted from taylor and ashcroft 1972 for orange tp is the potential transpiration rate of a crop cm d

and the model was used to simulate the soil water content changes in the 0 100 cm soil profiles of the experimental plots the upper boundary condition was defined as the atmospheric boundary with the surface layer which permits water to build up on the soil surface however surface runoff was not simulated and the maximum height of water at the soil surface was set as zero in this study the rainfall minus surface runoff depth and the canopy interception was used as the net rainfall input at the upper boundary due to the deep soil in the study area where the water table is much deeper than the domain of interest the free drainage condition was set for the bottom boundary at a soil depth of 100 cm 2 3 3 calibration and validation of the model the soil profiles were divided into three layers 0 30 cm 30 60 cm and 60 100 cm based on the soil bulk density and genetic horizons and the physical properties were assumed to be uniform within each layer whereas the model calibration was based on data from the 2010 and the model was validated with data from the 2015 according to the measured soil mechanical composition of each layer the initial values of the soil characteristic curve parameters of each layer were calculated by using neural network prediction in hydrus 1d then the parameters were fitted to the measured data of 2010 in the experimental area and parameters of the soil characteristic curve of the citrus orchard were finally determined table 1 the model efficiency in the calibration and validation years was evaluated by using the determination coefficient r2 and root mean square errors rmse 10 r m s e 1 n θ o θ m 2 where n is the number of observations and θm and θo are the modeled and observed values of the soil water content respectively based on the hydrus 1d model the soil moisture change in citrus orchard could be calculated in this study the average water contents on the upper middle and lower slopes of the citrus orchard were used as the actual observed values at different depths the coefficients of determination r2 between the simulated and measured soil water contents in the plots are from 0 80 to 0 94 and the rmse is only 0 013 0 024 fig 2 which indicates that the simulated and measured soil water contents were in good agreements therefore the calibrated hydrus 1d model can simulate the process of soil hydrological change in citrus orchards 2 4 water budget effective rainfall is the main source of water in citrus orchards on red soil slopes it was defined as the portion of rainfall that actually supplements the soil moisture of the plant root layer and it was calculated by the following equation obreza and pitts 2002 11 e r i p i i i r i d p i where pi is the precipitation mm ii is the canopy interception ri is the surface runoff mm and dpi mm is the deep percolation which is the portion of precipitation that percolates below the root zone water budget can be defined as the difference between the water input and water output within a certain period zuo et al 2016 therefore the water budget of an orchard is used to determine the difference between effective rainfall supply and water consumption of fruit trees for a period of time the water budget of the citrus orchard was estimated using the water balance eq 11 12 w i e r i w d i where w i is the water budget mm e r i is the effective rainfall mm w d i is the water demand of citrus trees mm including actual root water uptake transpiration and soil evaporation when w i 0 it indicates water surplus in the orchard when w i 0 it indicates water deficit in the orchard when w i 0 a water balance is indicated the magnitude of the value reflects the degree of the soil water resource deficit or surplus in root zone 3 results 3 1 deep percolation distribution the deep percolation of soil water is a significant way of water loss for an orchard on sloped land and also an important factor affecting the effective rainfall driving hydrus 1d daily deep percolation of soil water fluxes was obtained the simulation results show that from 2010 to 2015 the water loss through deep percolation in the study area was 105 7 592 0 mm with an average of 365 2 mm fig 3 which accounted for 14 92 38 25 of the surface soil infiltration and 11 76 31 33 of the total rainfall deep percolation mainly occurred from march to july when the total amount was 94 5 440 0 mm which accounted for 74 32 92 66 of the annual total rainfall on the contrary the total amount of deep percolation from august to december was only 1 4 135 8 mm which accounted for only 0 47 22 94 of the total percolation the monthly variation in deep percolation showed a clear seasonal pattern with minimum in autumn september to november and a maximum in spring summer rainfall is an important factor that affects deep percolation the statistical results showed that there was a significant positive correlation between the monthly rainfall and the amount of deep percolation p 0 01 3 2 effective rainfall distribution the effective rainfall of the study orchard could be calculated according to eq 10 table 2 from 2010 to 2015 the effective rainfall of the citrus orchard in the study area was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm the annual average effective rainfall increased from january to june and decreased gradually afterwards in monthly distribution there was a significant positive correlation between the effective rainfall and the total rainfall p 0 01 from april to september the effective rainfall of each month was more than 70 mm and the total amount during this period accounted for 66 63 of the whole the year 3 3 water demand distribution the water demand of citrus includes the actual transpiration of the fruit trees the evaporation from soil between the trees and the amount of water consumed by the plant tissues because the water consumption in the plant tissue is relatively small and can be neglected the fruit tree transpiration and soil evaporation are the main water consumption items in a sloped citrus orchard from 2010 to 2015 the transpiration of citrus trees in the orchard was 553 0 867 9 mm and the soil evaporation was 92 4 127 0 mm table 3 the average total evapotranspiration of citrus was 843 2 mm where the largest was 994 9 mm in 2012 and the smallest was 645 4 mm in 2011 the calculated results were similar to those measured in the other red soil region of southern china tahir et al 2016 the water demand of citrus showed a single peak during a year that is lower in january then increased continuously reached the peak in july and then decreased gradually the average water demand from may to august was more than 90 mm per month which accounted for 55 34 of the demand for the whole growth period the young citrus expansion stage from may to august was the key period for water demand and also the sensitive period to water supply garcia tejero et al 2010 3 4 water budget there is no irrigation system in the citrus orchard of the experimental plot and the source of water was only from natural rainfall the rainfall in the study area from 2010 to 2015 was 899 1 1889 7 mm the average rainfall was 1601 6 mm the rainfall within a year was mainly concentrated in the period from march to august which accounted for 70 85 of the annual rainfall although the total rainfall in the study area was abundant the effective rainfall only accounted for 47 45 62 37 of the total rainfall the annual canopy interception accounted for 13 57 23 5 of the total rainfall fig 4 alva et al 1999 reported that the citrus canopy interception accounted for 21 50 of the incident rainfall which is similar to our estimate the annual surface runoff of the citrus orchard from 2010 to 2015 was 23 7 227 5 mm with an average value of 112 0 mm the surface runoff was mainly concentrated from march to september which accounted for 90 08 of the total runoff the variation in the monthly runoff coefficient was not consistent with the rainfall on a short time scale the surface runoff was not only influenced by the rainfall amount but also by the rainfall intensity zhao et al 2015 among the water components the annual evapotranspiration deep percolation canopy interception and surface runoff account for 49 66 11 29 14 21 and only 2 13 respectively the water budget of the citrus orchard can be calculated according to eq 12 the year of 2011 was a dry year with less rainfall which led to many months of water deficit in the citrus orchard table 4 although the rainfall in 2010 and 2013 was more than 1400 mm due to the large amount of surface runoff loss the effective rainfall was actually lower than other years resulting water deficit for many months in the orchard due to the unmatched water demand of fruit trees and rainfall distribution citrus orchards in the study area may suffer from seasonal water shortage to different extent every month even in a high rainfall year normally water shortage is not substantial from january to june and the frequency and degree of water shortage are high from july to september the effect of water shortage duration on citrus tree growth was different from january to june soil water storage in the root zone was high and increased month by month fig 5 which allows for slight water shortage during this period without yield reduction from july to september was the period of fruit expansion in this period the water demand of fruit trees was large and the water storage of soil was low which could not effectively meet the water demand of fruit trees for the growth of fruit trees on sloping land surface runoff was the potential water resource once runoff was conserved by rainwater harvesting it may be used for irrigation the calculation results of monthly water surplus and potential available water balance remain available water showed that the surface runoff collected by runoff collection structures in the study orchard could meet the water deficit of citrus except for slight water shortage in january july and august table 5 4 discussion 4 1 validity of the model measurements of water components are considered to be expensive time consuming and require special instruments that are not always available physically based models can be used for extrapolating measured water budget components to different environments for improving water management in this study the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the soil moisture of 0 100 cm depth in a mature citrus orchard and the simulated data matched the measured values well due to climate differences it is difficult to directly compare citrus evapotranspiration in different regions niziński et al 2017 therefore crop coefficients were used for comparison according to the simulation results the water demand coefficients of citrus in the study area were from 0 54 to 1 09 with an average of 0 93 in summer and 0 68 in winter yang et al 2003 used weighing lysimeters to measure the actual evapotranspiration for eight year old murcott orange trees and found that the average seasonal crop coefficients were 0 91 and 0 75 during the summer and winter periods in japan respectively alves et al 2007 determined that the crop coefficients of citrus in southern brazil varied from 0 53 to 1 05 by weighing lysimeters the simulated crop coefficients were essentially consistent with the results of other humid regions morgan et al 2006 rogers et al 1983 the deep percolation of water components was another simulated variable larger deep percolation means less effective rainfall in our study deep percolation accounted for 11 76 31 33 of the total precipitation in the same study region jiangxi province he et al 2002 observed that the deep percolation of the broad leave forest was 110 1 605 9 mm according to their 12 year monitoring data which was similar to our simulated study wang et al 2011 used the hydrus 2d model to estimate the deep percolation under citrus orchards and found that the deep percolation accounted for 14 6 41 4 of the annual rainfall which agrees to our simulated results all these factors indicated that the evapotranspiration and deep percolation of citrus can be well simulated by hydrus 1d surface runoff is an important component of orchard water balance and it also affects the net rainfall input of hydrus 1d model hydrus 1d model has good accuracy in simulating the movement process of water into soil but it is not very good for surface runoff simulation especially in areas with abundant rainfall like previous studies the daily rainfall in this study was input as the original rainfall minus measured surface runoff therefore to improve the accuracy of the hydrus 1d model actual observations of surface runoff are required as possible 4 2 water resource management evapotranspiration of citrus in the study region normally ranges from 550 to 900 mm depending on the weather table 3 the total water input sum of rainfall in the studies ranged from 800 to 1900 mm which was more than the water demand of citrus fig 4 the main reason of seasonal water shortage is the uneven distribution of rainfall time therefore it is necessary to adopt certain soil and water conservation measures to improve the soil water storage or rainwater allocate increase the water supply for plant demand napoli et al 2014 most orchards in red soil hilly region of southern china were rain fed and the effective rainfall was the sole source of water supply larger deep percolation means less effective rainfall in our study deep percolation accounted for 11 76 31 33 of the total rainfall for the growth of citrus trees the deep percolation water below 100 cm was considered as unavailable water in addition the deep percolation was closely related to the leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients bethune et al 2008 wang et al 2014 taking relevant measures to reduce the deep percolation can increase the effective rainfall and reduce non point source pollution the effects of soil and water conservation measures on deep percolation were significant and complex soil and water conservation measures can effectively improve soil water storage but in the meanwhile it would promote deep percolation and its contribution rate can reach 85 7 lai et al 2016 therefore the fundamental measures of soil water management were to improve the soil water holding capacity adding biochar obia et al 2016 ulyett et al 2014 and super absorbent polymer bai et al 2010 were effective ways to improve the soil water storage and reduce the deep leakage of soil water citrus orchard evapotranspiration is due to both citrus transpiration and soil evaporation while the transpiration of fruit trees was directly related to productivity soil evaporation is considered an unproductive component of the soil water balance even if it affects the orchard energy balance soil evaporation contributes significantly to evapotranspiration of orchard which will affect the water use efficiency of orchard this study found that soil evaporation can account for 12 54 14 31 of the total evapotranspiration in citrus orchards organic mulching such as straw and grass are popular management practices for decreasing soil evaporation and increasing water availability in orchard kader et al 2017 by reducing the topsoil temperature in summer straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 21 40 compared with ck chen et al 2007 and the grass mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 36 53 shi et al 2009 at the same time organic mulching can play a positive role in soil and water conservation and improve soil water holding capacity by increasing soil total porosity for example straw mulching could reduce sediment concentration by 97 70 runoff by 96 34 and runoff coefficient by 96 45 jordán et al 2010 increase available water capacity by 18 35 total porosity by 35 46 mulumba and lal 2008 grass mulching also significantly reduced the runoff coefficient by 66 11 adekalu et al 2007 which could increase soil water storage rainwater harvesting technologies had been proven to be effective in reallocating water distribution thereby increasing water use efficiency and crop yield meng et al 2020 collection of surface runoff water during the rainy season for supplementary irrigation in dry season can effectively reduce the seasonal water shortage in orchards panigrahi 2015 table 5 showed that if the water shortage of every month required collected surface runoff for irrigation there was still a water shortage of 9 3 mm 6 3 mm and 7 9 mm in january july and august accounting for 37 20 4 22 and 8 87 of et respectively however if the collected surface runoff was only used for irrigation in july and august maximum water shortage and low soil water storage the water shortage could be fully met in addition the scale of rainwater storage structures is directly related to the economic cost xiao and dijk 2011 therefore it is suggested that rainwater harvesting irrigation should only be used in the critical period of fruit tree growth in southern china 5 conclusion the calibrated hydrus 1d model is found to be a useful tool to simulate effective rainfall and water demand for analyzing water budget in a mature citrus orchard the effective rainfall in the experiment citrus orchard was 560 8 1071 2 mm with an average of 812 4 mm during the study period from 2010 to 2015 deep percolation was an important factor affecting effective rainfall which accounted for 11 76 31 33 22 47 on average of total rainfall the water demand of citrus trees was 645 4 994 9 mm and the average value was 843 2 mm the total water demand from may to august accounted for 55 34 of the annual water demand which was the key period of water demand for fruit trees in both wet and dry years in the red region of the southern china citrus may suffer from seasonal water shortages especially from july to september collecting surface runoff to supplement irrigation could meet the water shortage during the critical water demand period of citrus trees it was also suggested that measures should be taken to reduce deep percolation by improving

10371,the effectiveness of agricultural productivity is dependent on the availability of ambient natural resources as well as on the efficiency of on site management practices the overall understanding of a production system can help with finding management options that enable for the available resources to be used more efficiently and thus improving productivity we investigated the response of dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l yield to water availability in an irrigation district controlled by off site hydrology to show how integrated knowledge can benefit agricultural production this study focused on an agricultural system where an upstream watershed provided water for dry bean production in its downstream irrigation district in haiti dry bean growth was mathematically represented using the cropping system model csm cropgro dry bean model of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the upstream runoff was measured to quantify irrigation water availability changes over time the cultivar parameters of the dry bean model were calibrated to minimize differences between simulated and observed dry bean growth and yield the model was then used to determine long term dry bean response to water availability scenarios including fifteen combinations of five growing periods and three irrigation conditions the results showed that dry bean productivity was closely associated with the upstream watershed hydrology and that growing dry bean earlier than the standard management scenario december to march increased predicted dry bean yield by over 80 with the available water resources and associated temporal variability these findings indicate that an integrated systems approach could improve dry bean production by identifying alternative management practices to use the available water more efficiently keywords crop growth water resources crop modeling dssat watershed monitoring haiti 1 introduction limited water availability is one of the critical challenges that farmers face in developing countries such as haiti laraus 2004 molnar et al 2015 yang and zehnder 2002 at a global scale the agricultural sector is the largest user of freshwater resources with surface water that is readily accessible but highly variable in time and location as the main source for irrigation in many areas dieter 2018 fao 2017 2011 oecd 2017 stubbs 2016 winter et al 1998 the availability of surface water for irrigation depends on precipitation hydrological processes such as runoff generation and transport and their spatial temporal variability therefore agricultural production and productivity are directly impacted by surface water hydrology mcnider et al 2015 wallender and grismer 2002 for instance there is insufficient water for farmers to grow dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l during the growing season december to march since the source of irrigation i e streamflow is limited during this season in haiti in addition agricultural decisions such as the planting date are frequently determined without the guidance of scientific studies and practical evidence alvarez and nuthall 2006 mccown 2002 shackelford et al 2019 this traditional management practice might be the result of a balance among various factors including rainfall temperature and workability that influence crop growth and management but the trade offs have not been explored sufficiently to guide management practices for improved efficiency of agricultural management several studies have shown that the fluctuations in crop production are often due to the variability in rainfall and extreme events such as drought and flooding gornall et al 2010 guan et al 2015 olayide et al 2016 in haiti for instance downstream agricultural areas are closely connected to upstream areas creating a unique rural landscape along the coastal lines the mountainous catchments serve as the source of irrigation water for low lying crop areas thus water collected from upstream plays a critical role for agricultural production in this interconnected system an understanding of watershed hydrology is essential for improved crop production however the connection between two areas upstream mountainous catchment and downstream agriculture has not been studied sufficiently to guide watershed management practices for improved sustainability of agriculture integrated knowledge and a system approach are instrumental in improving the efficiency of managing natural resources brodt et al 2011 duan et al 2018 icid 2017 nepal et al 2014 sayer and cassman 2013 yoon et al 2015 an understanding of the relationship between upstream and downstream areas is necessary for efficient resource management such as flood control water quality improvement and biodiversity mcnider et al 2015 wallender and grismer 2002 wang et al 2016 from a holistic point of view the lack of water in an upstream watershed may reduce agricultural production in a downstream area past studies have shown that forested areas could stabilize the flow regime by increasing the baseflow which would increase water availability during the dry period belmar et al 2016 gashaw et al 2017 sun et al 2005 similarly gebremicael et al 2019 found that forested areas increased dry season streamflow and decreased wet season flow while deforested areas had the opposite effect on streamflow the decrease in crop production can then lead to farmers finding other sources of income by harvesting timber in the upstream watershed which reduces the number of trees or forest areas in the water source area and then decreases water availability to the downstream area and thus agricultural productivity however this results in a vicious cycle implementing agricultural management practices to increase productivity with limited water can reduce the occurrence of such negative feedback cycles the overall goal of this study was to investigate the linkage between upstream i e the source of irrigation water and downstream agricultural areas to provide the information required to make efficient management decisions for improved crop production the specific objectives of this study were 1 to assess the temporal variation of water available for the dry bean growing season 2 to evaluate the crop genetic coefficients for the csm cropping system model cropgro dry bean model and then 3 to determine dry bean response to water availability for different growing season and irrigation practices this study also discussed the implications of the results and their limitations associated with the quality and quantity of data used in the modeling experiment 2 methods and materials 2 1 study areas the arcahaie region 18 55 00 n and 72 33 20 w is located 41 km northwest from the capital of haiti port au prince fig 1 the courjolle river is one of the rivers that flows from the mountainous watersheds north to low lying coastal areas south in the region the courjolle river watershed is characterized by hills and mountains with high elevation draining water from 80 km2 to its downstream agricultural areas a geospatial analysis with the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem obtained from the united states geological survey usgs 2019 showed that the elevation of the watershed ranges from 100 m to 1 498 m with a mean elevation of 779 m above the mean sea level and a mean slope of 34 5 according to the recent land use data obtained from the centre national de l information géo spatiale cnigs the watershed is mostly covered by savanna 95 with dense forestry 2 and other unclassified plants 3 the soil in the watershed has been characterized as silty clay loam sandy loam and clay loam fao unesco 2003 fig 1 the watershed and agricultural system of this study located in arcahaie haiti the land use and haiti boundary data were obtained from the cnigs haiti the upstream watershed and downstream agricultural areas are connected by a concrete dam known as the courjolle river dam which is used to provide water to the downstream irrigation areas and the dry bean fields fig 1 the water controlled by gates is diverted into two primary canals that pass through the irrigation areas dry bean is grown from december to march and irrigated with water discharged from the courjolle river in the irrigated areas the dry bean fields are flooded using a furrow method which is subject to water losses by evaporation infiltration and percolation the irrigation canals are not well maintained which exacerbates the losses during the water transport process the climate of the arcahaie region is classified as a tropical wet dry climate aw according to the köppen classification which is characterized by distinct wet and dry

rainfall solar radiation and temperature from nasa power 1984 2018 daily data for arcahaie haiti the error bars represent the variability of the monthly rainfall and temperatures over the 34 years the dry bean is one of the most widely cultivated staple crops in the world it is a complete source of nutrition containing significantly more protein fiber iron potassium and folic acid than conventional grains such as wheat oats and other cereals siddiq et al 2010 dry bean is also important to the haitian population as a source of iron and as part of traditional haitian dishes fews net 2018 however there is high variability in reported dry bean yield according to fao statistics dry bean yield in haiti ranged from 400 kg ha 1 in 1961 to 697 kg ha 1 in 2017 fao 2019 a survey conducted by the ministry of agriculture in 2013 showed a higher yield ranging from 1500 to 2000 kg ha 1 compared to the fao statistics inozile 2016 in 2016 the haitian ministry of agriculture reported an annual dry bean yield of 360 kg ha 1 for the western and 450 kg ha 1 for the northeastern region of haiti usai marndr 2016 which are 44 and 51 of the world dry bean yield for the same year respectively fao 2019 2 2 dry bean simulation model 2 2 1 input data the dry bean model csm cropgro dry bean which is one of the crop simulation models of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2019a b 1994 jones et al 2003 was used to mathematically represent dry bean the dry bean model simulates plant growth and development and the soil and plant water nitrogen and carbon biophysical processes and ultimately predicts crop yield previous studies have demonstrated the capability of the dry bean simulation model to predict the time to flowering physiological maturity and yield components de oliveira et al 2012d santos et al 2016 weather data from nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource power stackhouse et al 2018 soil data from jeune 2015 and crop management data from unpublished experiments raphael colbert personal communication served as input data the model was calibrated and evaluated using experimental data that included dry bean growth development and yield measurements in the arcahaie region the model was then used to determine the impact of growing season selection and irrigation water availability on dry bean yield and water use efficiency using the seasonal analysis program of dssat thornton and hoogenboom 1994 the irrigation and water availability scenarios were developed based on streamflow discharge hydrographs observed at the outlet of the upstream watershed from august 2018 to april 2019 the overall procedures for this study are summarized in fig 3 fig 3 overall procedures for evaluating the linkage between the watershed area and the irrigation district soil data were obtained from a soil survey conducted by jeune 2015 which covered the jurisdictional boundaries of the west department of haiti including the arcahaie region table 1 the soil survey data were used to represent the soil characteristics of the study area such as soil texture percentage sand silt and clay bulk density soil organic matter ph and the cation exchange capacity cec for each soil horizon the soil data were also used to determine some of the parameters that control the dynamics of the soil water balance of the crop model ritchie 1998 such as the drained upper limit dul the lower limit of plant available soil water ll and saturated soil water content sat table 1 soil characteristics of the dry bean fields in the arcahaie region haiti jeune 2015 the crop model also requires daily weather data including precipitation mm minimum and maximum air temperature c and solar radiation mj m 2 as input the weather data were collected from two different sources a local weather station and the remotely sensed rainfall estimates of nasa the local station is managed by the unité hydro météorologique hydro weather unit which is an autonomous haitian government unit that works with the ministry of agriculture natural resources and rural development the weather data were used to calibrate and evaluate the csm cropgro dry bean model from september 1 2016 to december 20 2018 as the weather data have only been monitored at the local weather station since 2016 they could not show the long term trend of weather long term 1983 2018 daily rainfall daily maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation were obtained from nasa power accessible at https power larc nasa gov data access viewer for the scenario analysis the nasa power portal provides daily weather data maximum and minimum temperature rainfall solar radiation at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 stackhouse et al 2018 this system provides agro meteorological data for the entire globe to compensate for regions where long term weather data are not readily available maldonado et al 2019 the nasa power data have shown to be beneficial to agricultural research white et al 2008 although the remotely sensed weather data are useful for studies especially in developing countries where long term weather observation data are not common they include errors as their biases have not been corrected using local observations specific to the study area which could be one of the potential sources of uncertainty in this study 2 2 2 crop model calibration and evaluation calibration of the crop system model csm refers to the estimation of crop genetic coefficients or cultivar specific parameters boote et al 2003 hunt et al 2001 jones et al 1986 jones et al 2011 the cultivar coefficients define the traits of each cultivar in the dssat modeling ecosystem and they need to be estimated to represent the local cultivars or varieties buddhaboon et al 2018 hoogenboom et al 2019b in this study nine cultivar coefficients directly associated with dry bean development and yield were selected for calibration including em fl time between plant emergence and flower appearance r1 fl sd time between first flower and first seed r5 sd pm time between first seed r5 and physiological maturity r7 slavr specific leaf area of cultivar under standard growth conditions sizlf maximum size of full leaf three leaflets wtpsd maximum weight per seed sfdpur seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions sdpdv average seeds per pod under standard growing conditions and podur time required for a cultivar to reach final pod load under optimal conditions the csm cropgro dry bean model was calibrated using dry bean growth measurements obtained from field experiments conducted from 2016 to 2018 raphael colbert personal communication detailed information on dry bean management practices used for model calibration and evaluation is shown in table 2 the variables measured during the experiments included anthesis date adap maturity date mdap yield at harvest maturity hwam seed size at harvest maturity hwum and the number of seeds at harvest maturity no unit h um the quantity quality and uncertainty of the dry bean experimental data might vary over years thus we devised four different approaches to improve the reliability of the model calibration and evaluation 1 aggregate all measurements and then randomly split the data into two groups for calibration and evaluation hereafter differential split sample test or app1 which is called app1 comb1 when using the first group of measurements for calibration and the second one for evaluation and app1 comb2 when using the second group for calibration and the first one for evaluation 2 use the data collected in 2016 and 2017 for calibration and 2018 for evaluation app2 3 use the data collected in 2016 and 2018 for calibration and 2017 for evaluation app3 and 4 use the data collected in 2016 for calibration and 2017 for evaluation app4 table 2 dry bean management practices that were used for model calibration and evaluation the initials soil conditions and water applications were assumed based on the knowledge of local soils and management practices data were collected by raphael colbert the differential split sample test app1 has been implemented to ensure the reliability of a calibrated model in hydrological modeling but this methodology is not common in crop modeling klemeš 1986 gao et al 2020 in addition common approaches for crop model calibration and evaluation recommend the use of independent field experiment datasets and treatments that have not suffered from either water or nutrients stresses hoogenboom et al 2019b however the quantity and quality of dry bean growth observations varied highly over the years which made the split sample test a potential alternative to the traditional crop model calibration approaches for the test app1 dry bean experiment data including the time to flowering physiological maturity and yield records from the three years of experiments were randomly selected and split into two groups where each group was comprised of 19 records the nine cultivar coefficients were then calibrated using one of the groups and the other group was used to evaluate the performance of the calibrated model and vice versa in this study the calibration practices implemented with the first and second halves of the yield data were denoted as combination 1 and combination 2 comb1 and comb2 respectively the glue framework is integrated into the dssat crop modeling system to assist with the estimation of cultivar coefficients he et al 2010 2009 jones et al 2011 in the glue procedure the likelihood function eq 1 is used to evaluate the agreement between observed and modeled variables of interest he et al 2010 1 l θ i o j 1 m 1 2 π σ o 2 e o j s θ i 2 2 σ o 2 where θ i is the ith parameter set i is the index and it varies from 1 to n n is the total number of parameter sets generated by the algorithm s θ i is the model output derived from the parameter set θ i o is the observation o j represents the jth observation of o σ o 2 signifies the model errors variance and m is the number of observations he et al 2010 and jones et al 2011 have described the details of the dssat parameter estimation procedures model accuracy is regarded as excellent when the normalized root mean square error nrmse is less than 10 and good when the nrmse is between 10 and 20 anar et al 2019 jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 this study identified a parameter set that provided a lower nrmse than other parameter sets while exhibiting good or excellent performance in the evaluation period in the study the relative error statistic re and the nrmse were calculated using equations 2 and 3 liu et al 2012 willmott 1982 2 r e s o o 3 n r m s e r m s e o 100 i 1 n s i o i 2 n o 100 where s i s o i o and n are the ith simulated values the average of the simulated values the ith observed values the average of the observed values and the number of observed values respectively the other calibration strategies app2 app3 and app4 employed the same objective function in the calibration and evaluation criteria as those of the app1 case 2 3 scenario analysis 2 3 1 streamflow the water availability and irrigation application scenarios were developed based on the streamflow observations at the watershed outlet streamflow from the courjolle river was monitored from august 2018 to march 2019 a water level sensor was installed along with a level staff close to the outlet on august 22 2018 to record the water level every minute the cross section of the monitoring point and flow velocity were on average measured once a week based on the measurements a rating curve was developed for the courjolle river and then used to convert the recorded water levels to daily average discharge the baseflow separation was implemented to estimate the contribution of baseflow and direct runoff to the streamflow over time wittenberg 1999 the recursive filter technique adopted in baseflow filter program or bflow https swat tamu edu media 70817 baseflow2006 06 zip was used to separate baseflow from total runoff arnold and allen 1999 the baseflow index bfi which represents the ratio of baseflow to the total runoff was calculated to quantify the contribution of baseflow to the water resources the richards baker r b flashiness index of the streamflow was calculated to understand the temporal dynamics of the river flow and the promptness of surface water responses to rainfall events in the watershed baker et al 2004 undeveloped or natural watersheds tend to have smaller r b index values than developed or urbanized ones baker et al 2004 reported that an index of 0 25 for a stream with a watershed area less than 77 7 km2 would be classified in the stable groundwater based streams while the same r b index 0 25 for a greater watershed 7770 km2 would be considered as a flashy stream they also found that a negative correlation could exist between the r b index with the baseflow and watershed area during the hydrological monitoring streamflow data contained missing values due to sensor malfunction sedimentation at the station and the limited capacity of a data logger used the missing streamflow level data were filled by the linear interpolation of available data 2 3 2 irrigation water availability the daily discharge data obtained from the streamflow monitoring were converted into the daily volume to quantify the water availability for the downstream agricultural system as follows w a s d 60 60 24 ɛ where w a is the amount of water available for irrigation m3 day 1 s d is the observed streamflow discharge m3 s 1 ɛ is the irrigation efficiency and 60 and 24 are used as conversion factors from m3 s 1 to m3 day 1 there are two types of the canal in this region concrete or lined and earthen canals the lined canal delivers water from the watershed outlet or the dam to each of the irrigation blocks that contain multiple dry bean fields then water delivered to the entrance of each irrigation block is distributed to the individual fields through the earthen canal networks in this study an irrigation efficiency of 50 was assumed based on the literature and knowledge of the local conditions brouwer et al 1989 a local dry bean researcher raphael colbert personal communication suggested that typically a fixed amount of irrigation water was applied every eight days this estimated amount of water for irrigation was then used as an input for the dry bean model the following equation was used to calculate the daily water availability in the unit of depth mm for the dry bean irrigation scenario w a d w a a r e a i r r i g a t i o n 10 where w a d is daily irrigation water available in mm and a r e a i r r i g a t i o n is the size of the area that is being irrigated in ha 1800 ha in this study marndr 2012 and 10 is a conversion factor from m3 day 1 to mm day 1 we then calculated the sum of the daily available water w a d for the entire dry bean growing season which lasts two and a half months 2 3 3 planting dates the planting date for dry bean was determined based on the knowledge of management practices implemented in the study areas the local farmers grow dry bean from december to march which is called campagne de haricot d hiver winter bean growing season the farmers do not sow all seed at the same time due to the limited availability of seeds and the lack of sufficient labor the data obtained from the ministry of agriculture of haiti for the winter bean growing seasons in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 showed that the sowing dates ranged from december 10 to january 15 but most of the planting dates were close to december 15 since the yield responses to irrigation water deficits were the focus of this study we assumed that fertilizer was not limiting and that pests diseases and weeds were properly controlled 2 3 4 scenario development fifteen water availability and irrigation scenarios were developed from the combinations of planting dates and irrigation management practices five dates were selected for the planting season scenarios i e october 15 november 15 december 15 january 15 and february 15 three irrigation application scenarios were prepared well irrigated unlimited irrigated under the currently available irrigation water limited and no irrigation water applied rainfed in the scenario analysis the water availability for irrigation under the current limited irrigation water condition was estimated from streamflow monitoring as previously mentioned the average length of a dry bean growing season is two and a half months or 75 days thus the amount of available water for irrigation during the growing season was calculated by summing the daily flow discharge as depth mm for the 75 day period in the scenarios dry bean fields were assumed to be irrigated once every eight days which is the current water management practice implemented in the study area for the limited irrigation water condition irrigation water measured for the 2018 2019 growing season was used as a reference to estimate the amount of water available from rainfall for the other thirty five years from 1983 to 2018 the long term irrigation water availability could be estimated from a calibrated hydrological model which would provide the estimates of streamflow availability from the upstream watershed considering the watershed dynamics however there is no long term station based weather observation only remotely sensed rainfall and temperature estimates are available such as nasa power rainfall that can help to provide reliable hydrological modeling and streamflow prediction in this study thus we decided to use a simple method to estimate the amount of water available for irrigation from the remotely sensed rainfall estimates so as to avoid the introduction of unnecessary complexity and associated uncertainty into analysis results in the simple method the streamflow measured for the 2018 2019 growing season was used as a reference runoff and compared with the rainfall data for the same period of measurements to calculate monthly runoff rainfall ratios or runoff coefficients acınan 2008 kadioglu and şen 2001 karamage et al 2018 şen and altunkaynak 2006 then the ratios were applied to the rainfall data to estimate the corresponding amount of runoff considered as monthly water availability for the other thirty five years to run the long term simulations for the scenario analysis the december 15 planting season was selected for the baseline scenario because it represents the current farming practice in the study areas table 3 the planting dates were then shifted to one or two months earlier october and november to include scenarios that can secure more irrigation water wet period the planting dates were also moved later to january 15 and february 15 to have scenarios with greater solar radiation and higher temperature for dry bean growth in the irrigation scenario analysis the amount of water available was assumed to be evenly applied to all dry bean fields for the long term dry bean growth simulation the information of dry bean management practices was compiled from local growers and researchers table 4 in the case of the unlimited irrigation water scenarios the amount of water supplied for irrigation was determined based on soil moisture simulated using the calibrated csm cropgro dry bean model the soil profile was set to be fully refilled to its water holding or field capacity within the depth of 30 cm root zone whenever the soil water content became equal to or less than 80 of the capacity regardless of the water availability lopez et al 2017 the rainfed scenarios assumed that no irrigation water was available or applied two such extreme scenarios unlimited irrigation water u and rainfed r were introduced to demonstrate the yield response to irrigation in the study areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop model calibration and evaluation the performance of the calibrated csm cropgro dry bean model in predicting anthesis maturity and yield for dry bean was evaluated in terms of accuracy statistics including rmse nrmse and re table 5 the values for the cultivar coefficients for the variety x rav 40 estimated based on five calibration approaches are compared in table 6 in the case of app1 comb1 and comb2 the calibrated model predicted anthesis and maturity on average within a 1 day error for both model calibration and evaluation the simulated average flowering time was 38 days after sowing which was the same as the observed value 38 days and similar to the value 37 days reported by the national seed service of the ministry of agriculture of haiti beaver et al 2014 the simulated number of days 68 days from sowing to maturity was also similar to those 67 and 68 days reported by the ministry of agriculture in 2017 the evaluation showed that the csm cropgro dry bean model could mathematically represent the physiological processes of dry bean for the study area in haiti for the app2 calibration approach the dry bean phenology was simulated by the model with errors that were less than 2 days for both calibration and evaluation there was only one day of difference between the simulated and observed physiological maturity date table 5 for final the yield the simulations were not as accurate the nrmse for dry bean yield ranged from 20 3 to 57 2 for the calibration and the evaluation which was considered as a poor performance jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 the app3 calibration approach provided a difference of 0 to 2 days in predicting the time to flowering table 5 while the nrmse for yield prediction had a fair accuracy 16 7 to 26 6 thus the genetic coefficients estimated based on the app3 approach are the best candidates for application of the model and scenario analysis in the case of app4 the prediction errors for the time to flowering and physiological maturity ranged from 0 to 5 days for both calibration and evaluation table 5 the predicted yield ranged from 1 601 kg ha 1 and 1 484 kg ha 1 which were 10 3 to 68 5 greater than the observed yield 950 kg ha 1 and 1 655 kg ha 1 for the app2 app3 and app4 calibration approaches the difference between the simulated and observed anthesis and maturity ranged from 2 to 5 days which was worse compared to the accuracy provided by the app1 calibration approach table 5 the largest differences in the anthesis 4 days and maturity 5 days were observed for the app4 calibration approach the observed time to flowering and physiological maturity was 42 and 70 days respectively for the 2017 experiment the app4 calibration approach substantially underestimated both anthesis and physiological maturity with 37 days to anthesis for both 2016 and 2018 and 63 and 67 days to physiological maturity for the 2016 and the 2018 experiments in the case of the first calibration approach app1 the nrmse of dry bean yield simulated from the first data combination app1 comb1 and the second data combination app1 comb2 ranged from 18 to 27 for model calibration and evaluation these error statistics indicate that the csm cropgro drybean model provided a fair performance when simulating the dry bean yield using the calibrated cultivar coefficients jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 the predicted yield i e 1515 kg ha 1 for app1 comb1 and 1628 kg ha 1 for app1 comb2 was greater than the observed yield i e 1426 kg ha 1 for app1 comb1and 1 412 ha 1 for app1 comb2 and the differences 6 and 15 were regarded as acceptable since the nrmse was less than 30 the set of genetic coefficient values identified from the app1 comb1 was selected for the scenario analysis since the app1 comb1 provided the best agreement with the observed values among the different calibration approaches tables 5 and 6 the error in yield prediction increased from 5 0 to 68 5 and from 6 0 to 26 6 during the calibration and the evaluation respectively table 5 this can be explained by the variability in crop management practices and weather conditions that were not effectively captured by the weather data that were used for modeling as well as uncertainty in the observed yield data in addition the field experiments implemented in the study areas showed that variation in yield of different dry bean cultivars was larger than the variation in anthesis and physiological maturity unpublished data raphael colbert for the three years of dry bean experiments there was only a one to three day of variation in anthesis while observed yield fluctuated much more during the same period 3 2 temporal variation in the availability of irrigation water the runoff hydrograph observed at the watershed outlet showed fluctuations in the flow rate from august to october with the average flowrate of 3 26 m3 s 1 and peak discharges of 8 02 m3 s 1 on october 16 fig 4 baseflow started comprising a relatively large contribution to the streamflow in november although the baseflow started to decrease in october the bfi was estimated to be 0 70 which indicates the significance of the baseflow as the source of water in the study areas the r b flashiness index for the monitoring period including the wet and dry seasons was 0 14 and was 0 21 when only the wet period was considered august to october based on a total watershed area of 80 km2 an r b index of 0 14 indicates that the courjolle river is a stable groundwater based stream that has relatively significant and constant groundwater contribution to the streamflow baker et al 2004 the baseflow separation and flashiness analysis showed that baseflow is the major source of agricultural water in the watershed fig 4 streamflow hydrographs measured at the outlet of the watershed system or the courjolle river from august 2018 to march 2019 the baseflow was separated from the total runoff using the bflow method and precipitation was recorded at a local weather station close to the study area the hydrograph analysis showed that streamflow could provide more water than required for dry bean irrigation for a portion of the rainy season october and november fig 4 and table 7 the amount of water available could be greater than that of rainfall in the two months due to the delayed contribution of baseflow to the total streamflow in the limited irrigation water scenarios for the october planting dates october limited therefore irrigation water was not limited which made the average amount of irrigation water applied for the simulation period of 35 years similar to each other in the unlimited and limited irrigation scenarios october unlimited vs october limited the csm cropgro dry bean model predicted that the irrigation requirement would increase by 37 when changing the planting date from october to february under the unlimited irrigation scenarios october unlimited vs february unlimited table 7 such an increase can be explained by a decrease in rainfall and an increase in evapotranspiration et from dry bean due to an increase in temperature and solar radiation tables 7 and 8 thus the amount of water available from the upstream watershed for dry bean irrigation became more critical when delaying the planting date 3 3 responses of evapotranspiration to water availability the et rates were sensitive to the irrigation management scenarios table 8 crop water demand or crop evapotranspiration et increased from the october planting scenario dry bean started growing from october for two and a half months table 3 to the february dry bean started growing from february for two and a half months table 3 constantly table 8 in this study the potential pet was estimated based on the priestley taylor equation which expresses daily pet rates as a nonlinear function of daily solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity priestley and taylor 1972 allen et al 1998 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b the priestley taylor expression can explain the et increases from the october unlimited to the february unlimited scenarios when water is fully available through irrigation and rainfall the unlimited scenarios for instance the crop water demand is essentially dependent on the weather conditions such as solar radiation and temperature the seasonal variation patterns of et changed for the limited water and rainfed conditions for the rainfed situation the water demand decreased from the october planting scenario october rainfed to the december planting scenario december rainfed and then increased from the december rainfed to the february rainfed scenarios table 8 given that the only source of water was rainfall dry bean et followed the same pattern as that of the total rainfall amounts table 7 and table 8 for the rainfed scenarios the actual crop et was limited by a small amount of soil water in the dry season which created drought stress affecting the leaf and canopy growth and dry matter production table 8 boote et al 2008 dhakar et al 2018 jamieson et al 1995 saseendran et al 2008 in the case of the limited condition et increased slightly from the october planting scenario october limited to the november limited 246 mm and then decreased from the december limited 219 mm to the january limited 149 mm and then increased again for the february planting scenario february limited 168 mm this specific pattern for et was because sufficient water based on a combination of irrigation and rainfall was available for the october limited and november limited scenarios then et followed the trend of seasonal solar radiation and air temperature from the october limited to the november limited scenarios as found in the unlimited condition table 8 for the dry season solar radiation and temperature continued to increase while the available water for dry bean decreased during the dry season from december limited to the february limited scenarios which affected et growth and final yield tables 7 and 8 3 4 responses of dry bean yield to water availability the long term dry bean simulations showed that the rainfed scenarios october rainfed november rainfed december rainfed january rainfed and february rainfed resulted in the lowest yield with the median ranging from 30 kg ha 1 january rainfed to 49 kg ha 1 october rainfed table 8 and fig 5 these findings highlight the importance of irrigation for dry bean production in the study area under rainfed conditions the december rainfed scenario resulted in the second lowest median yield of 33 kg ha 1 8 to 32 less compared to those of the other scenarios this was due to the smallest amount of rainfall received during the growing period of december rainfed december to march 47 mm compared to october rainfed 97 mm november rainfed 62 mm january rainfed 52 mm and february rainfed 74 mm figs 2 4 and 5 fig 5 variability in simulated dry bean yield for the planting date and irrigation scenarios for the unlimited irrigated conditions dry bean yield increased consistently from the october to the february planting scenario which is not surprising since solar radiation and temperature increased during this period as well fig 2 and table 8 for instance the yield for the february planting date february unlimited was 23 higher than that for the october planting date october unlimited these findings indicate that solar radiation and temperature becomes a limiting factor for dry bean growth when irrigation water is not limited the simulated dry bean yield under the limited irrigation water scenarios october limited november limited december limited january limited and february limited decreased consistently from the november november limited to the february february limited planting scenario fig 5 this can be explained by the fact that the amount of irrigation water supplied by the river as well as rainfall significantly decreased from november to february figs 2 4 5 and table 7 for instance if dry bean is planted in january and february january limited and february limited the model predicted that the yield would decrease by 92 and 90 respectively compared to that of december limited on the other hand yield was predicted to increase by 84 and 93 respectively for the october limited and november limited scenarios compared to that of the december limited scenario these simulation results demonstrate that the productivity of the agricultural area is significantly limited by both the amount and the temporal variability of the water that is provided by the upstream watershed in addition these findings imply that the availability of irrigation is more critical to dry bean production than the effect of solar radiation and temperature in the study area the scenario analysis results suggest that local farmers can plant dry bean earlier than december to improve their yield if they are able to secure more water from the river for supplemental irrigation 3 5 implications and limitations this study demonstrated that the productivity of a downstream irrigation district relies on the upstream hydrological processes and the seasonal variability of these hydrological processes the baseflow separation analysis showed that streamflow of the study watershed mainly consisted of baseflow e g bfi of 0 70 and the r b flashiness index of 0 14 especially during the dry months which indicates that the watershed is a groundwater based system baker et al 2004 these hydrologic features are favored for the purpose of irrigation as groundwater discharge or baseflow is more consistent compared to direct runoff providing a more stable water supply for irrigation the water availability and irrigation scenario analyses suggest that the agricultural productivity can be improved by securing baseflow from the watershed which can be accomplished by the reforestation of the savannah regions in the upstream drainage areas and watershed of the irrigation district filoso et al 2017 ilstedt et al 2016 dry bean yield can also be improved by reducing water loss during conveyance from the river to the field while proper maintenance of the irrigation water delivery system can help increase the amount of water available for irrigation the use of advanced irrigation scheduling methods such as determining the amount and timing of water application based on the information of soil water conditions and growing stages can help local farmers save water resources under the current limited water availability condition without a large investment in the existing irrigation system liang et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 an optimum water application schedule also can be identified from both experimental and simulation studies such as modeling analysis of this study which could be an interesting subject for future research one of the greatest challenges of this study was the limited quantity and quality of experimental data that were available for crop modeling and scenario analysis crop modeling requires at least local rainfall data especially for tropical environments hoogenboom 2000a however the local weather data had many missing days and there was no local weather record that could help to analyze the long term weather and hydrologic variability thus the weather input data for the crop modeling had to be complemented with the remotely sensed rainfall estimates that are known to have much uncertainty which in turn could affect the irrigation water availability estimates awange et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2018 in addition the crop model was calibrated to measurements that are potentially biased towards a relatively low yield the crop growth and yield observations were obtained from field experiments that imposed nutrient stresses on crops which were only measurements that could show the physiological characteristics of dry bean in the study area the streamflow had been monitored for only nine months due to the limited accessibility to the area although the monitoring period includes the growing seasons of dry bean the streamflow data had to be extrapolated to estimate irrigation availability from the relationship between runoff discharges and rainfall depths observed during the monitoring period the imperfect measurements and the subsequent uncertainty introduced during the hydrologic analysis and crop model calibration should affect outputs of the scenario analysis harmel et al 2006 hoogenboom 2000 however this study emphasized the relative comparison between the efficiency of irrigation and dry bean management practices while uncertainty will be considered in a future study 3 6 conclusion the crop modeling experiment demonstrated that dry bean production with the traditional mid december planting date was substantially reduced by a limited availability of irrigation in addition streamflow monitoring indicated that irrigation water availability would decrease as dry bean planting was delayed these findings suggest that local farmers should plant dry bean earlier to be able to procure more irrigation water that could results in an increase in yield it also implies that securing more stable water resources such as baseflow other than direct runoff can help improve dry bean production this study demonstrated that agricultural production could benefit from integrated knowledge of the relationship between physically separated but hydrologically connected areas the upstream watershed and downstream irrigation district such knowledge highlights the need for a science based and coordinated approach to

10371,the effectiveness of agricultural productivity is dependent on the availability of ambient natural resources as well as on the efficiency of on site management practices the overall understanding of a production system can help with finding management options that enable for the available resources to be used more efficiently and thus improving productivity we investigated the response of dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l yield to water availability in an irrigation district controlled by off site hydrology to show how integrated knowledge can benefit agricultural production this study focused on an agricultural system where an upstream watershed provided water for dry bean production in its downstream irrigation district in haiti dry bean growth was mathematically represented using the cropping system model csm cropgro dry bean model of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the upstream runoff was measured to quantify irrigation water availability changes over time the cultivar parameters of the dry bean model were calibrated to minimize differences between simulated and observed dry bean growth and yield the model was then used to determine long term dry bean response to water availability scenarios including fifteen combinations of five growing periods and three irrigation conditions the results showed that dry bean productivity was closely associated with the upstream watershed hydrology and that growing dry bean earlier than the standard management scenario december to march increased predicted dry bean yield by over 80 with the available water resources and associated temporal variability these findings indicate that an integrated systems approach could improve dry bean production by identifying alternative management practices to use the available water more efficiently keywords crop growth water resources crop modeling dssat watershed monitoring haiti 1 introduction limited water availability is one of the critical challenges that farmers face in developing countries such as haiti laraus 2004 molnar et al 2015 yang and zehnder 2002 at a global scale the agricultural sector is the largest user of freshwater resources with surface water that is readily accessible but highly variable in time and location as the main source for irrigation in many areas dieter 2018 fao 2017 2011 oecd 2017 stubbs 2016 winter et al 1998 the availability of surface water for irrigation depends on precipitation hydrological processes such as runoff generation and transport and their spatial temporal variability therefore agricultural production and productivity are directly impacted by surface water hydrology mcnider et al 2015 wallender and grismer 2002 for instance there is insufficient water for farmers to grow dry bean phaseolus vulgaris l during the growing season december to march since the source of irrigation i e streamflow is limited during this season in haiti in addition agricultural decisions such as the planting date are frequently determined without the guidance of scientific studies and practical evidence alvarez and nuthall 2006 mccown 2002 shackelford et al 2019 this traditional management practice might be the result of a balance among various factors including rainfall temperature and workability that influence crop growth and management but the trade offs have not been explored sufficiently to guide management practices for improved efficiency of agricultural management several studies have shown that the fluctuations in crop production are often due to the variability in rainfall and extreme events such as drought and flooding gornall et al 2010 guan et al 2015 olayide et al 2016 in haiti for instance downstream agricultural areas are closely connected to upstream areas creating a unique rural landscape along the coastal lines the mountainous catchments serve as the source of irrigation water for low lying crop areas thus water collected from upstream plays a critical role for agricultural production in this interconnected system an understanding of watershed hydrology is essential for improved crop production however the connection between two areas upstream mountainous catchment and downstream agriculture has not been studied sufficiently to guide watershed management practices for improved sustainability of agriculture integrated knowledge and a system approach are instrumental in improving the efficiency of managing natural resources brodt et al 2011 duan et al 2018 icid 2017 nepal et al 2014 sayer and cassman 2013 yoon et al 2015 an understanding of the relationship between upstream and downstream areas is necessary for efficient resource management such as flood control water quality improvement and biodiversity mcnider et al 2015 wallender and grismer 2002 wang et al 2016 from a holistic point of view the lack of water in an upstream watershed may reduce agricultural production in a downstream area past studies have shown that forested areas could stabilize the flow regime by increasing the baseflow which would increase water availability during the dry period belmar et al 2016 gashaw et al 2017 sun et al 2005 similarly gebremicael et al 2019 found that forested areas increased dry season streamflow and decreased wet season flow while deforested areas had the opposite effect on streamflow the decrease in crop production can then lead to farmers finding other sources of income by harvesting timber in the upstream watershed which reduces the number of trees or forest areas in the water source area and then decreases water availability to the downstream area and thus agricultural productivity however this results in a vicious cycle implementing agricultural management practices to increase productivity with limited water can reduce the occurrence of such negative feedback cycles the overall goal of this study was to investigate the linkage between upstream i e the source of irrigation water and downstream agricultural areas to provide the information required to make efficient management decisions for improved crop production the specific objectives of this study were 1 to assess the temporal variation of water available for the dry bean growing season 2 to evaluate the crop genetic coefficients for the csm cropping system model cropgro dry bean model and then 3 to determine dry bean response to water availability for different growing season and irrigation practices this study also discussed the implications of the results and their limitations associated with the quality and quantity of data used in the modeling experiment 2 methods and materials 2 1 study areas the arcahaie region 18 55 00 n and 72 33 20 w is located 41 km northwest from the capital of haiti port au prince fig 1 the courjolle river is one of the rivers that flows from the mountainous watersheds north to low lying coastal areas south in the region the courjolle river watershed is characterized by hills and mountains with high elevation draining water from 80 km2 to its downstream agricultural areas a geospatial analysis with the 30 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem obtained from the united states geological survey usgs 2019 showed that the elevation of the watershed ranges from 100 m to 1 498 m with a mean elevation of 779 m above the mean sea level and a mean slope of 34 5 according to the recent land use data obtained from the centre national de l information géo spatiale cnigs the watershed is mostly covered by savanna 95 with dense forestry 2 and other unclassified plants 3 the soil in the watershed has been characterized as silty clay loam sandy loam and clay loam fao unesco 2003 fig 1 the watershed and agricultural system of this study located in arcahaie haiti the land use and haiti boundary data were obtained from the cnigs haiti the upstream watershed and downstream agricultural areas are connected by a concrete dam known as the courjolle river dam which is used to provide water to the downstream irrigation areas and the dry bean fields fig 1 the water controlled by gates is diverted into two primary canals that pass through the irrigation areas dry bean is grown from december to march and irrigated with water discharged from the courjolle river in the irrigated areas the dry bean fields are flooded using a furrow method which is subject to water losses by evaporation infiltration and percolation the irrigation canals are not well maintained which exacerbates the losses during the water transport process the climate of the arcahaie region is classified as a tropical wet dry climate aw according to the köppen classification which is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons and precipitation occurring during the summer season peel et al 2007 the mean annual rainfall is 928 mm based on historical records from 1981 to 2017 dinku et al 2018 funk et al 2015 the region has two distinct wet periods april to june and august to november while the air is relatively dry between december and february fig 2 the average annual temperature from 1984 and 2018 was approximately 27 9 c august and january are the warmest and coolest months with an average temperature of 29 6 c and 26 2 c respectively fig 2 maldonado et al 2019 fig 2 long term average monthly rainfall solar radiation and temperature from nasa power 1984 2018 daily data for arcahaie haiti the error bars represent the variability of the monthly rainfall and temperatures over the 34 years the dry bean is one of the most widely cultivated staple crops in the world it is a complete source of nutrition containing significantly more protein fiber iron potassium and folic acid than conventional grains such as wheat oats and other cereals siddiq et al 2010 dry bean is also important to the haitian population as a source of iron and as part of traditional haitian dishes fews net 2018 however there is high variability in reported dry bean yield according to fao statistics dry bean yield in haiti ranged from 400 kg ha 1 in 1961 to 697 kg ha 1 in 2017 fao 2019 a survey conducted by the ministry of agriculture in 2013 showed a higher yield ranging from 1500 to 2000 kg ha 1 compared to the fao statistics inozile 2016 in 2016 the haitian ministry of agriculture reported an annual dry bean yield of 360 kg ha 1 for the western and 450 kg ha 1 for the northeastern region of haiti usai marndr 2016 which are 44 and 51 of the world dry bean yield for the same year respectively fao 2019 2 2 dry bean simulation model 2 2 1 input data the dry bean model csm cropgro dry bean which is one of the crop simulation models of the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat hoogenboom et al 2019a b 1994 jones et al 2003 was used to mathematically represent dry bean the dry bean model simulates plant growth and development and the soil and plant water nitrogen and carbon biophysical processes and ultimately predicts crop yield previous studies have demonstrated the capability of the dry bean simulation model to predict the time to flowering physiological maturity and yield components de oliveira et al 2012d santos et al 2016 weather data from nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource power stackhouse et al 2018 soil data from jeune 2015 and crop management data from unpublished experiments raphael colbert personal communication served as input data the model was calibrated and evaluated using experimental data that included dry bean growth development and yield measurements in the arcahaie region the model was then used to determine the impact of growing season selection and irrigation water availability on dry bean yield and water use efficiency using the seasonal analysis program of dssat thornton and hoogenboom 1994 the irrigation and water availability scenarios were developed based on streamflow discharge hydrographs observed at the outlet of the upstream watershed from august 2018 to april 2019 the overall procedures for this study are summarized in fig 3 fig 3 overall procedures for evaluating the linkage between the watershed area and the irrigation district soil data were obtained from a soil survey conducted by jeune 2015 which covered the jurisdictional boundaries of the west department of haiti including the arcahaie region table 1 the soil survey data were used to represent the soil characteristics of the study area such as soil texture percentage sand silt and clay bulk density soil organic matter ph and the cation exchange capacity cec for each soil horizon the soil data were also used to determine some of the parameters that control the dynamics of the soil water balance of the crop model ritchie 1998 such as the drained upper limit dul the lower limit of plant available soil water ll and saturated soil water content sat table 1 soil characteristics of the dry bean fields in the arcahaie region haiti jeune 2015 the crop model also requires daily weather data including precipitation mm minimum and maximum air temperature c and solar radiation mj m 2 as input the weather data were collected from two different sources a local weather station and the remotely sensed rainfall estimates of nasa the local station is managed by the unité hydro météorologique hydro weather unit which is an autonomous haitian government unit that works with the ministry of agriculture natural resources and rural development the weather data were used to calibrate and evaluate the csm cropgro dry bean model from september 1 2016 to december 20 2018 as the weather data have only been monitored at the local weather station since 2016 they could not show the long term trend of weather long term 1983 2018 daily rainfall daily maximum and minimum temperature and solar radiation were obtained from nasa power accessible at https power larc nasa gov data access viewer for the scenario analysis the nasa power portal provides daily weather data maximum and minimum temperature rainfall solar radiation at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 stackhouse et al 2018 this system provides agro meteorological data for the entire globe to compensate for regions where long term weather data are not readily available maldonado et al 2019 the nasa power data have shown to be beneficial to agricultural research white et al 2008 although the remotely sensed weather data are useful for studies especially in developing countries where long term weather observation data are not common they include errors as their biases have not been corrected using local observations specific to the study area which could be one of the potential sources of uncertainty in this study 2 2 2 crop model calibration and evaluation calibration of the crop system model csm refers to the estimation of crop genetic coefficients or cultivar specific parameters boote et al 2003 hunt et al 2001 jones et al 1986 jones et al 2011 the cultivar coefficients define the traits of each cultivar in the dssat modeling ecosystem and they need to be estimated to represent the local cultivars or varieties buddhaboon et al 2018 hoogenboom et al 2019b in this study nine cultivar coefficients directly associated with dry bean development and yield were selected for calibration including em fl time between plant emergence and flower appearance r1 fl sd time between first flower and first seed r5 sd pm time between first seed r5 and physiological maturity r7 slavr specific leaf area of cultivar under standard growth conditions sizlf maximum size of full leaf three leaflets wtpsd maximum weight per seed sfdpur seed filling duration for pod cohort at standard growth conditions sdpdv average seeds per pod under standard growing conditions and podur time required for a cultivar to reach final pod load under optimal conditions the csm cropgro dry bean model was calibrated using dry bean growth measurements obtained from field experiments conducted from 2016 to 2018 raphael colbert personal communication detailed information on dry bean management practices used for model calibration and evaluation is shown in table 2 the variables measured during the experiments included anthesis date adap maturity date mdap yield at harvest maturity hwam seed size at harvest maturity hwum and the number of seeds at harvest maturity no unit h um the quantity quality and uncertainty of the dry bean experimental data might vary over years thus we devised four different approaches to improve the reliability of the model calibration and evaluation 1 aggregate all measurements and then randomly split the data into two groups for calibration and evaluation hereafter differential split sample test or app1 which is called app1 comb1 when using the first group of measurements for calibration and the second one for evaluation and app1 comb2 when using the second group for calibration and the first one for evaluation 2 use the data collected in 2016 and 2017 for calibration and 2018 for evaluation app2 3 use the data collected in 2016 and 2018 for calibration and 2017 for evaluation app3 and 4 use the data collected in 2016 for calibration and 2017 for evaluation app4 table 2 dry bean management practices that were used for model calibration and evaluation the initials soil conditions and water applications were assumed based on the knowledge of local soils and management practices data were collected by raphael colbert the differential split sample test app1 has been implemented to ensure the reliability of a calibrated model in hydrological modeling but this methodology is not common in crop modeling klemeš 1986 gao et al 2020 in addition common approaches for crop model calibration and evaluation recommend the use of independent field experiment datasets and treatments that have not suffered from either water or nutrients stresses hoogenboom et al 2019b however the quantity and quality of dry bean growth observations varied highly over the years which made the split sample test a potential alternative to the traditional crop model calibration approaches for the test app1 dry bean experiment data including the time to flowering physiological maturity and yield records from the three years of experiments were randomly selected and split into two groups where each group was comprised of 19 records the nine cultivar coefficients were then calibrated using one of the groups and the other group was used to evaluate the performance of the calibrated model and vice versa in this study the calibration practices implemented with the first and second halves of the yield data were denoted as combination 1 and combination 2 comb1 and comb2 respectively the glue framework is integrated into the dssat crop modeling system to assist with the estimation of cultivar coefficients he et al 2010 2009 jones et al 2011 in the glue procedure the likelihood function eq 1 is used to evaluate the agreement between observed and modeled variables of interest he et al 2010 1 l θ i o j 1 m 1 2 π σ o 2 e o j s θ i 2 2 σ o 2 where θ i is the ith parameter set i is the index and it varies from 1 to n n is the total number of parameter sets generated by the algorithm s θ i is the model output derived from the parameter set θ i o is the observation o j represents the jth observation of o σ o 2 signifies the model errors variance and m is the number of observations he et al 2010 and jones et al 2011 have described the details of the dssat parameter estimation procedures model accuracy is regarded as excellent when the normalized root mean square error nrmse is less than 10 and good when the nrmse is between 10 and 20 anar et al 2019 jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 this study identified a parameter set that provided a lower nrmse than other parameter sets while exhibiting good or excellent performance in the evaluation period in the study the relative error statistic re and the nrmse were calculated using equations 2 and 3 liu et al 2012 willmott 1982 2 r e s o o 3 n r m s e r m s e o 100 i 1 n s i o i 2 n o 100 where s i s o i o and n are the ith simulated values the average of the simulated values the ith observed values the average of the observed values and the number of observed values respectively the other calibration strategies app2 app3 and app4 employed the same objective function in the calibration and evaluation criteria as those of the app1 case 2 3 scenario analysis 2 3 1 streamflow the water availability and irrigation application scenarios were developed based on the streamflow observations at the watershed outlet streamflow from the courjolle river was monitored from august 2018 to march 2019 a water level sensor was installed along with a level staff close to the outlet on august 22 2018 to record the water level every minute the cross section of the monitoring point and flow velocity were on average measured once a week based on the measurements a rating curve was developed for the courjolle river and then used to convert the recorded water levels to daily average discharge the baseflow separation was implemented to estimate the contribution of baseflow and direct runoff to the streamflow over time wittenberg 1999 the recursive filter technique adopted in baseflow filter program or bflow https swat tamu edu media 70817 baseflow2006 06 zip was used to separate baseflow from total runoff arnold and allen 1999 the baseflow index bfi which represents the ratio of baseflow to the total runoff was calculated to quantify the contribution of baseflow to the water resources the richards baker r b flashiness index of the streamflow was calculated to understand the temporal dynamics of the river flow and the promptness of surface water responses to rainfall events in the watershed baker et al 2004 undeveloped or natural watersheds tend to have smaller r b index values than developed or urbanized ones baker et al 2004 reported that an index of 0 25 for a stream with a watershed area less than 77 7 km2 would be classified in the stable groundwater based streams while the same r b index 0 25 for a greater watershed 7770 km2 would be considered as a flashy stream they also found that a negative correlation could exist between the r b index with the baseflow and watershed area during the hydrological monitoring streamflow data contained missing values due to sensor malfunction sedimentation at the station and the limited capacity of a data logger used the missing streamflow level data were filled by the linear interpolation of available data 2 3 2 irrigation water availability the daily discharge data obtained from the streamflow monitoring were converted into the daily volume to quantify the water availability for the downstream agricultural system as follows w a s d 60 60 24 ɛ where w a is the amount of water available for irrigation m3 day 1 s d is the observed streamflow discharge m3 s 1 ɛ is the irrigation efficiency and 60 and 24 are used as conversion factors from m3 s 1 to m3 day 1 there are two types of the canal in this region concrete or lined and earthen canals the lined canal delivers water from the watershed outlet or the dam to each of the irrigation blocks that contain multiple dry bean fields then water delivered to the entrance of each irrigation block is distributed to the individual fields through the earthen canal networks in this study an irrigation efficiency of 50 was assumed based on the literature and knowledge of the local conditions brouwer et al 1989 a local dry bean researcher raphael colbert personal communication suggested that typically a fixed amount of irrigation water was applied every eight days this estimated amount of water for irrigation was then used as an input for the dry bean model the following equation was used to calculate the daily water availability in the unit of depth mm for the dry bean irrigation scenario w a d w a a r e a i r r i g a t i o n 10 where w a d is daily irrigation water available in mm and a r e a i r r i g a t i o n is the size of the area that is being irrigated in ha 1800 ha in this study marndr 2012 and 10 is a conversion factor from m3 day 1 to mm day 1 we then calculated the sum of the daily available water w a d for the entire dry bean growing season which lasts two and a half months 2 3 3 planting dates the planting date for dry bean was determined based on the knowledge of management practices implemented in the study areas the local farmers grow dry bean from december to march which is called campagne de haricot d hiver winter bean growing season the farmers do not sow all seed at the same time due to the limited availability of seeds and the lack of sufficient labor the data obtained from the ministry of agriculture of haiti for the winter bean growing seasons in 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 showed that the sowing dates ranged from december 10 to january 15 but most of the planting dates were close to december 15 since the yield responses to irrigation water deficits were the focus of this study we assumed that fertilizer was not limiting and that pests diseases and weeds were properly controlled 2 3 4 scenario development fifteen water availability and irrigation scenarios were developed from the combinations of planting dates and irrigation management practices five dates were selected for the planting season scenarios i e october 15 november 15 december 15 january 15 and february 15 three irrigation application scenarios were prepared well irrigated unlimited irrigated under the currently available irrigation water limited and no irrigation water applied rainfed in the scenario analysis the water availability for irrigation under the current limited irrigation water condition was estimated from streamflow monitoring as previously mentioned the average length of a dry bean growing season is two and a half months or 75 days thus the amount of available water for irrigation during the growing season was calculated by summing the daily flow discharge as depth mm for the 75 day period in the scenarios dry bean fields were assumed to be irrigated once every eight days which is the current water management practice implemented in the study area for the limited irrigation water condition irrigation water measured for the 2018 2019 growing season was used as a reference to estimate the amount of water available from rainfall for the other thirty five years from 1983 to 2018 the long term irrigation water availability could be estimated from a calibrated hydrological model which would provide the estimates of streamflow availability from the upstream watershed considering the watershed dynamics however there is no long term station based weather observation only remotely sensed rainfall and temperature estimates are available such as nasa power rainfall that can help to provide reliable hydrological modeling and streamflow prediction in this study thus we decided to use a simple method to estimate the amount of water available for irrigation from the remotely sensed rainfall estimates so as to avoid the introduction of unnecessary complexity and associated uncertainty into analysis results in the simple method the streamflow measured for the 2018 2019 growing season was used as a reference runoff and compared with the rainfall data for the same period of measurements to calculate monthly runoff rainfall ratios or runoff coefficients acınan 2008 kadioglu and şen 2001 karamage et al 2018 şen and altunkaynak 2006 then the ratios were applied to the rainfall data to estimate the corresponding amount of runoff considered as monthly water availability for the other thirty five years to run the long term simulations for the scenario analysis the december 15 planting season was selected for the baseline scenario because it represents the current farming practice in the study areas table 3 the planting dates were then shifted to one or two months earlier october and november to include scenarios that can secure more irrigation water wet period the planting dates were also moved later to january 15 and february 15 to have scenarios with greater solar radiation and higher temperature for dry bean growth in the irrigation scenario analysis the amount of water available was assumed to be evenly applied to all dry bean fields for the long term dry bean growth simulation the information of dry bean management practices was compiled from local growers and researchers table 4 in the case of the unlimited irrigation water scenarios the amount of water supplied for irrigation was determined based on soil moisture simulated using the calibrated csm cropgro dry bean model the soil profile was set to be fully refilled to its water holding or field capacity within the depth of 30 cm root zone whenever the soil water content became equal to or less than 80 of the capacity regardless of the water availability lopez et al 2017 the rainfed scenarios assumed that no irrigation water was available or applied two such extreme scenarios unlimited irrigation water u and rainfed r were introduced to demonstrate the yield response to irrigation in the study areas 3 results and discussion 3 1 crop model calibration and evaluation the performance of the calibrated csm cropgro dry bean model in predicting anthesis maturity and yield for dry bean was evaluated in terms of accuracy statistics including rmse nrmse and re table 5 the values for the cultivar coefficients for the variety x rav 40 estimated based on five calibration approaches are compared in table 6 in the case of app1 comb1 and comb2 the calibrated model predicted anthesis and maturity on average within a 1 day error for both model calibration and evaluation the simulated average flowering time was 38 days after sowing which was the same as the observed value 38 days and similar to the value 37 days reported by the national seed service of the ministry of agriculture of haiti beaver et al 2014 the simulated number of days 68 days from sowing to maturity was also similar to those 67 and 68 days reported by the ministry of agriculture in 2017 the evaluation showed that the csm cropgro dry bean model could mathematically represent the physiological processes of dry bean for the study area in haiti for the app2 calibration approach the dry bean phenology was simulated by the model with errors that were less than 2 days for both calibration and evaluation there was only one day of difference between the simulated and observed physiological maturity date table 5 for final the yield the simulations were not as accurate the nrmse for dry bean yield ranged from 20 3 to 57 2 for the calibration and the evaluation which was considered as a poor performance jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 the app3 calibration approach provided a difference of 0 to 2 days in predicting the time to flowering table 5 while the nrmse for yield prediction had a fair accuracy 16 7 to 26 6 thus the genetic coefficients estimated based on the app3 approach are the best candidates for application of the model and scenario analysis in the case of app4 the prediction errors for the time to flowering and physiological maturity ranged from 0 to 5 days for both calibration and evaluation table 5 the predicted yield ranged from 1 601 kg ha 1 and 1 484 kg ha 1 which were 10 3 to 68 5 greater than the observed yield 950 kg ha 1 and 1 655 kg ha 1 for the app2 app3 and app4 calibration approaches the difference between the simulated and observed anthesis and maturity ranged from 2 to 5 days which was worse compared to the accuracy provided by the app1 calibration approach table 5 the largest differences in the anthesis 4 days and maturity 5 days were observed for the app4 calibration approach the observed time to flowering and physiological maturity was 42 and 70 days respectively for the 2017 experiment the app4 calibration approach substantially underestimated both anthesis and physiological maturity with 37 days to anthesis for both 2016 and 2018 and 63 and 67 days to physiological maturity for the 2016 and the 2018 experiments in the case of the first calibration approach app1 the nrmse of dry bean yield simulated from the first data combination app1 comb1 and the second data combination app1 comb2 ranged from 18 to 27 for model calibration and evaluation these error statistics indicate that the csm cropgro drybean model provided a fair performance when simulating the dry bean yield using the calibrated cultivar coefficients jamieson et al 1991 rinaldi et al 2003 the predicted yield i e 1515 kg ha 1 for app1 comb1 and 1628 kg ha 1 for app1 comb2 was greater than the observed yield i e 1426 kg ha 1 for app1 comb1and 1 412 ha 1 for app1 comb2 and the differences 6 and 15 were regarded as acceptable since the nrmse was less than 30 the set of genetic coefficient values identified from the app1 comb1 was selected for the scenario analysis since the app1 comb1 provided the best agreement with the observed values among the different calibration approaches tables 5 and 6 the error in yield prediction increased from 5 0 to 68 5 and from 6 0 to 26 6 during the calibration and the evaluation respectively table 5 this can be explained by the variability in crop management practices and weather conditions that were not effectively captured by the weather data that were used for modeling as well as uncertainty in the observed yield data in addition the field experiments implemented in the study areas showed that variation in yield of different dry bean cultivars was larger than the variation in anthesis and physiological maturity unpublished data raphael colbert for the three years of dry bean experiments there was only a one to three day of variation in anthesis while observed yield fluctuated much more during the same period 3 2 temporal variation in the availability of irrigation water the runoff hydrograph observed at the watershed outlet showed fluctuations in the flow rate from august to october with the average flowrate of 3 26 m3 s 1 and peak discharges of 8 02 m3 s 1 on october 16 fig 4 baseflow started comprising a relatively large contribution to the streamflow in november although the baseflow started to decrease in october the bfi was estimated to be 0 70 which indicates the significance of the baseflow as the source of water in the study areas the r b flashiness index for the monitoring period including the wet and dry seasons was 0 14 and was 0 21 when only the wet period was considered august to october based on a total watershed area of 80 km2 an r b index of 0 14 indicates that the courjolle river is a stable groundwater based stream that has relatively significant and constant groundwater contribution to the streamflow baker et al 2004 the baseflow separation and flashiness analysis showed that baseflow is the major source of agricultural water in the watershed fig 4 streamflow hydrographs measured at the outlet of the watershed system or the courjolle river from august 2018 to march 2019 the baseflow was separated from the total runoff using the bflow method and precipitation was recorded at a local weather station close to the study area the hydrograph analysis showed that streamflow could provide more water than required for dry bean irrigation for a portion of the rainy season october and november fig 4 and table 7 the amount of water available could be greater than that of rainfall in the two months due to the delayed contribution of baseflow to the total streamflow in the limited irrigation water scenarios for the october planting dates october limited therefore irrigation water was not limited which made the average amount of irrigation water applied for the simulation period of 35 years similar to each other in the unlimited and limited irrigation scenarios october unlimited vs october limited the csm cropgro dry bean model predicted that the irrigation requirement would increase by 37 when changing the planting date from october to february under the unlimited irrigation scenarios october unlimited vs february unlimited table 7 such an increase can be explained by a decrease in rainfall and an increase in evapotranspiration et from dry bean due to an increase in temperature and solar radiation tables 7 and 8 thus the amount of water available from the upstream watershed for dry bean irrigation became more critical when delaying the planting date 3 3 responses of evapotranspiration to water availability the et rates were sensitive to the irrigation management scenarios table 8 crop water demand or crop evapotranspiration et increased from the october planting scenario dry bean started growing from october for two and a half months table 3 to the february dry bean started growing from february for two and a half months table 3 constantly table 8 in this study the potential pet was estimated based on the priestley taylor equation which expresses daily pet rates as a nonlinear function of daily solar radiation air temperature and relative humidity priestley and taylor 1972 allen et al 1998 jones et al 2003 hoogenboom et al 2019a 2019b the priestley taylor expression can explain the et increases from the october unlimited to the february unlimited scenarios when water is fully available through irrigation and rainfall the unlimited scenarios for instance the crop water demand is essentially dependent on the weather conditions such as solar radiation and temperature the seasonal variation patterns of et changed for the limited water and rainfed conditions for the rainfed situation the water demand decreased from the october planting scenario october rainfed to the december planting scenario december rainfed and then increased from the december rainfed to the february rainfed scenarios table 8 given that the only source of water was rainfall dry bean et followed the same pattern as that of the total rainfall amounts table 7 and table 8 for the rainfed scenarios the actual crop et was limited by a small amount of soil water in the dry season which created drought stress affecting the leaf and canopy growth and dry matter production table 8 boote et al 2008 dhakar et al 2018 jamieson et al 1995 saseendran et al 2008 in the case of the limited condition et increased slightly from the october planting scenario october limited to the november limited 246 mm and then decreased from the december limited 219 mm to the january limited 149 mm and then increased again for the february planting scenario february limited 168 mm this specific pattern for et was because sufficient water based on a combination of irrigation and rainfall was available for the october limited and november limited scenarios then et followed the trend of seasonal solar radiation and air temperature from the october limited to the november limited scenarios as found in the unlimited condition table 8 for the dry season solar radiation and temperature continued to increase while the available water for dry bean decreased during the dry season from december limited to the february limited scenarios which affected et growth and final yield tables 7 and 8 3 4 responses of dry bean yield to water availability the long term dry bean simulations showed that the rainfed scenarios october rainfed november rainfed december rainfed january rainfed and february rainfed resulted in the lowest yield with the median ranging from 30 kg ha 1 january rainfed to 49 kg ha 1 october rainfed table 8 and fig 5 these findings highlight the importance of irrigation for dry bean production in the study area under rainfed conditions the december rainfed scenario resulted in the second lowest median yield of 33 kg ha 1 8 to 32 less compared to those of the other scenarios this was due to the smallest amount of rainfall received during the growing period of december rainfed december to march 47 mm compared to october rainfed 97 mm november rainfed 62 mm january rainfed 52 mm and february rainfed 74 mm figs 2 4 and 5 fig 5 variability in simulated dry bean yield for the planting date and irrigation scenarios for the unlimited irrigated conditions dry bean yield increased consistently from the october to the february planting scenario which is not surprising since solar radiation and temperature increased during this period as well fig 2 and table 8 for instance the yield for the february planting date february unlimited was 23 higher than that for the october planting date october unlimited these findings indicate that solar radiation and temperature becomes a limiting factor for dry bean growth when irrigation water is not limited the simulated dry bean yield under the limited irrigation water scenarios october limited november limited december limited january limited and february limited decreased consistently from the november november limited to the february february limited planting scenario fig 5 this can be explained by the fact that the amount of irrigation water supplied by the river as well as rainfall significantly decreased from november to february figs 2 4 5 and table 7 for instance if dry bean is planted in january and february january limited and february limited the model predicted that the yield would decrease by 92 and 90 respectively compared to that of december limited on the other hand yield was predicted to increase by 84 and 93 respectively for the october limited and november limited scenarios compared to that of the december limited scenario these simulation results demonstrate that the productivity of the agricultural area is significantly limited by both the amount and the temporal variability of the water that is provided by the upstream watershed in addition these findings imply that the availability of irrigation is more critical to dry bean production than the effect of solar radiation and temperature in the study area the scenario analysis results suggest that local farmers can plant dry bean earlier than december to improve their yield if they are able to secure more water from the river for supplemental irrigation 3 5 implications and limitations this study demonstrated that the productivity of a downstream irrigation district relies on the upstream hydrological processes and the seasonal variability of these hydrological processes the baseflow separation analysis showed that streamflow of the study watershed mainly consisted of baseflow e g bfi of 0 70 and the r b flashiness index of 0 14 especially during the dry months which indicates that the watershed is a groundwater based system baker et al 2004 these hydrologic features are favored for the purpose of irrigation as groundwater discharge or baseflow is more consistent compared to direct runoff providing a more stable water supply for irrigation the water availability and irrigation scenario analyses suggest that the agricultural productivity can be improved by securing baseflow from the watershed which can be accomplished by the reforestation of the savannah regions in the upstream drainage areas and watershed of the irrigation district filoso et al 2017 ilstedt et al 2016 dry bean yield can also be improved by reducing water loss during conveyance from the river to the field while proper maintenance of the irrigation water delivery system can help increase the amount of water available for irrigation the use of advanced irrigation scheduling methods such as determining the amount and timing of water application based on the information of soil water conditions and growing stages can help local farmers save water resources under the current limited water availability condition without a large investment in the existing irrigation system liang et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 an optimum water application schedule also can be identified from both experimental and simulation studies such as modeling analysis of this study which could be an interesting subject for future research one of the greatest challenges of this study was the limited quantity and quality of experimental data that were available for crop modeling and scenario analysis crop modeling requires at least local rainfall data especially for tropical environments hoogenboom 2000a however the local weather data had many missing days and there was no local weather record that could help to analyze the long term weather and hydrologic variability thus the weather input data for the crop modeling had to be complemented with the remotely sensed rainfall estimates that are known to have much uncertainty which in turn could affect the irrigation water availability estimates awange et al 2016 mcmillan et al 2018 in addition the crop model was calibrated to measurements that are potentially biased towards a relatively low yield the crop growth and yield observations were obtained from field experiments that imposed nutrient stresses on crops which were only measurements that could show the physiological characteristics of dry bean in the study area the streamflow had been monitored for only nine months due to the limited accessibility to the area although the monitoring period includes the growing seasons of dry bean the streamflow data had to be extrapolated to estimate irrigation availability from the relationship between runoff discharges and rainfall depths observed during the monitoring period the imperfect measurements and the subsequent uncertainty introduced during the hydrologic analysis and crop model calibration should affect outputs of the scenario analysis harmel et al 2006 hoogenboom 2000 however this study emphasized the relative comparison between the efficiency of irrigation and dry bean management practices while uncertainty will be considered in a future study 3 6 conclusion the crop modeling experiment demonstrated that dry bean production with the traditional mid december planting date was substantially reduced by a limited availability of irrigation in addition streamflow monitoring indicated that irrigation water availability would decrease as dry bean planting was delayed these findings suggest that local farmers should plant dry bean earlier to be able to procure more irrigation water that could results in an increase in yield it also implies that securing more stable water resources such as baseflow other than direct runoff can help improve dry bean production this study demonstrated that agricultural production could benefit from integrated knowledge of the relationship between physically separated but hydrologically connected areas the upstream watershed and downstream irrigation district such knowledge highlights the need for a science based and coordinated approach to

water deficit causes crop water stress and ultimately loss of biomass production holzman et al 2014 ritchie 1998 while persistent saturation of soil can cause seeds to rot tu et al 1992 yanar et al 1997 and prohibit crop growth by cutting off roots air supply and making soil too compacted for roots to push through hence there exists a preferred range of soil moisture conditions from which large deviation on either side would cause crop damage in rain fed agricultural fields soil moisture throughout the growing season depends on storage at the planting time referred to as initial soil moisture ism hereafter precipitation during the growing season and loss to evapotranspiration and runoff ism influences the rate and speed of seedling germination and rooting thus playing an important role in determining the final crop yield however the extent to which ism determines crop yield has not been quantitatively assessed at the regional scale the current study aims to fill this research gap due to the lack of field data and experiments responses of crop yield to soil moisture management is often simulated by either statistical or process based crop models dokoohaki et al 2017 meng and quiring 2008 statistical models are often only applicable to local agronomic and environmental conditions used to calibrate the model parameters which limits extrapolation and transferability

includes five primary components weather soil plant management and soil plant atmosphere interface which collectively represent the response of soil and plants to weather and management on a single land unit jones et al 2003 unlike many crop and ecosystem models that calculate soil moisture at different depth by solving richards equation dssat uses a simple tipping bucket approach that passes the excess water above field capacity directly to the layer below dokoohaki et al 2017 shelia et al 2018 soulis et al 2015 although some previous studies have shown that such a simplification is of sufficient accuracy in modeling the soil water content under both irrigation and rainfed conditions meng and quiring 2008 saseendran et al 2008 recent studies found a degradation of the model performance under water stressed conditions dokoohaki et al 2017 esmaeilian et al 2014 dssat was designed as a field scale model but can also be applied at the regional scale by running it pixel by

surface and subsurface water fluxes and storage at multiple scales wang et al 2011 the latest crest version 3 0 has been verified for simulating hydrologic processes such as runoff soil moisture dynamics and evapotranspiration at high spatiotemporal scales shen et al 2016 shen and anagnostou 2017 wang et al 2011 the soil moisture scheme in crest 3 0 is a coupling of water balance and energy balance in the water balance part soil profile is divided into three unsaturated layers with depth of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 190 cm from top to bottom the infiltration process within the top layer is governed by the variable infiltration curve vic liang et al 1994 wood et al 1992 while the water percolation between soil layers is calculated using the percolation algorithm from the soil and water

adjusted to account for the impact of canopy water interception soil moisture and the moisture resistance of vegetation roots liang et al 1994 more detailed equations and steps for water and thermal balance computation can be found in shen and anagnostou 2017 the basic input to crest consists of weather leaf area index lai soil property land cover and imperviousness data the three hourly meteorological forcing data for crest was from the same source as that for dssat including precipitation air temperature downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation humidity pressure and wind speed similarly soil hydraulic properties such as saturation hydraulic conductivity field capacity wilting point residual soil moisture soil porosity organic matter and bulk density in crest were also obtained from soilgrids and isric afsis at 1 km resolution as in dssat lai was from global land surface satellites glass with a spatial resolution of 0 05 1982 1999 and 1 km 2000 present and a temporal resolution of 8 days liang et al 2013 land cover type was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 at 500 m resolution friedl et al 2010 with the impervious area fraction set to 0 because of the very low ratio of urbanized area in this region details of the data sources are listed in table 1 all data are bilinearly interpolated to 500 m for running crest 3 experimental design for dssat as a field scale model it is challenging to apply the model at large spatial scale with climate soil management and cultivar type varying from location to location here we calibrate and validate the genetic coefficients for each crop at the agroecological zone aez level fig 1 at five arc minute resolution specifically the genetic coefficients are uniform for pixels within each aez and vary among aezs while different pixels in the same aez differ in weather and soil conditions three of every four pixels are used for calibration and the remaining one for validation we first aggregate the model results from pixel scale to woreda scale the administrative level at which observational data were collected and then adjust the parameters to minimize the relative difference between simulated yield and observed yield based on woreda area weighted spatial average in each aez and temporal average during the years when observational data are available this is done for the calibration pixels and verification pixels separately with the calibrated genetic coefficients for each crop in each aez we run the model from 1979 to 2014 table 2 shows the relative biases for each aez before and after calibration using maize as an example details of the model calibration and validation are documented in yang et al 2020 in order to improve the accuracy of ism simulation we linked dssat with crest to take advantage of the more sophisticated soil moisture computational scheme from crest which involves overwriting soil moisture in dssat with values simulated by crest moisture contents in three soil layers within ubnb were simulated by crest at 500 m spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution from 1979 to 2014 soil moisture from crest were then aggregated to the dssat temporal and horizontal resolutions and vertically interpolated to each of the nine soil layers in dssat since the planting time for cereal crops in this region is generally in may fao 2019 the ism from crest in each pixel is classified into five categories extremely dry dry normal wet extremely wet according to the percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th of soil moisture in the 20 day period from april 21 to may 10 for 36 years the surface layer ism distribution of the five categories is shown in fig 2 to assess the sensitivity of crop yield and production in ubnb to ism the calibrated model is used to simulate crop yield in ubnb under each of the five ism classes and the corresponding crop productions were also calculated and evaluated by summing up the pixel wise products of crop yield and the corresponding harvest area 4 results and discussions fig 3 shows the 36 year average yield and production of the four major cereal crops barley maize sorghum and wheat same order hereafter under the normal ism condition most land of ubnb is potentially arable with the yield of the four crops at approximately 1 2 ton ha 2 5 ton ha 1 8 ton ha and 1 5 ton ha respectively in general the central and southeast part of the basin are most suitable for planting barley maize and sorghum with the highest yield of 2 ton ha 4 ton ha and 2 5 ton ha wheat grows better in western ubnb with the highest yield of 2 ton ha however due to uneven distribution of the actual planting area the spatial distribution of crop productions differs from that of crop yields this is particularly notable for maize and wheat in the western part of the basin and for sorghum in the north central part of the basin where high crop yield doesn t translate to high production due to small planting areas this disparity indicates potential for improving production through optimal allocation of farmland in order to test the sensitivity of crop yields to ism we calculate the relative differences of crop yield between normal condition and the other four ism classes fig 4 the relative differences for all crops show a similar distribution pattern and are negative for dry conditions and positive for wet conditions with larger magnitude and spatial extent under more extreme isms in response to dry and extremely dry ism crop yields show larger decreases in eastern basin 25 than in western basin close to 0 similarly in response to wet and extremely wet ism crop yields show larger increases in eastern basin around 75 than in western basin 25 or less in general cereal crop yield in ubnb shows higher sensitivity to wet ism than to dry ism and crops in eastern basin are much more sensitive to ism than in western basin qualitatively the crop production response to ism is similar to the crop yield response but with differences in spatial pattern and is rather symmetric between wet and dry anomalies supplementary fig 1 the spatial distribution of pixel level crop production difference between extremely wet and extremely dry ism classes is presented in fig 5 for all crops high production areas are generally more sensitive to ism than low production areas at the pixel level 100 km2 the largest differences in production are 400 tons for barley and wheat in central northeastern and southeastern basin 800 tons for maize in central basin and 600 tons for sorghum in northern and southeastern basin consistent with fig 4 most of the areas with higher production sensitivity to ism are also in eastern basin where climate is relatively cold and dry to investigate the influences of ism on crop productions in years with different precipitation conditions 2009 dry year 1996 normal year and 1985 wet year are selected as representative years based on the percentiles 10th 50th and 90th of the growing season precipitation amount supplementary figs 2 4 the production differences aggregated over the entire ubnb between extreme wet and extreme dry ism conditions for these three years are shown in table 3 in dry years crop production under extremely wet ism condition is much higher than under extremely dry ism condition in normal and wet years the crop production differences between the two ism extremes are much less significant the responses of production to ism in representative years differ among crops particularly for maize in the normal year showing a decreased production under extremely wet ism conditions maize is usually planted earlier than other crops in this region and the rainy season came earlier than usual in the selected normal year our previous findings show that other than the total growing season precipitation the sub seasonal climate has great influence on crop yield yang et al 2020 which could influence the crop response to ism conditions the crop production response to ism under the growing season precipitation gsp in the three representative years shows a spatial pattern similar to the response of multi year average supplementary fig 1 the magnitude and spatial extent of the ism influence increase as growing season precipitation decreases this indicates that wetting the soil before sowing can remarkably reduce the risk of severe crop loss or total crop failure caused by water stress in dry years but such a strategy may not have notable beneficial effects in wet years when water is not a limiting factor for growth this finding can therefore help guide drought mitigation strategies if farmers or other decision makers have access to seasonal forecast of precipitation in further exploring the dependence of crop yields on ism and growing season precipitation we divide the basin into east eb and west wb portions on account of topography climate variability and ism variability fig 2 and supplementary fig 5 and treat the two separately to figure out the effect of improved ism on crop productions in different precipitation years we compared the basin total annual production anomalies between extremely wet ism condition and actual condition in eb and wb fig 6 note that the actual ism condition during the 36 years ranges widely from year to year depending on the pre season hydro meteorological conditions in each year for all four crops extremely wet ism condition would have led to higher crop productions than actual condition in most years for sorghum it would have changed the yield to above normal in most of the below normal yield years these effects are particularly strong in eb and during dry years these results suggest that an impressive crop production improvement is likely to be attained in ubnb by wetting the field at seeding time 5 conclusions in conclusion wetting soil at the planting time can offer an effective solution to improving the yield and production of major cereal crops especially in eastern ubnb as rainfall in kiremt season is often sufficient for the growth of major cereal crops securing seedling emergence and rooting during the planting season right before the kiremt season is an important step towards improved food security in ubnb one typical practice of wetting soil is irrigation which would become feasible upon the completion of grand ethiopia renaissance dam previous studies found planting time irrigation can significantly improve crop yield because the increased emergence rate contributes to higher spike numbers and enhanced grain plumpness paredes et al 2017 yan et al 2017 ma et al 2012 mo et al 2017 other soil water conservation techniques such as plastic film mulching and straw mulching was also found effective in improving water use efficiency and crop yield dong et al 2018 ma et al 2018 in ubnb the benefit of wetting soil in the plating time is greater in the eastern basin due to its large cropland area and high cropland density as well as its drier climate and is also greater during years of low rainfall if the farmland distribution in ubnb remains similar to what it is today the eastern basin should receive priority consideration for soil water management infrastructure development and improvement in addition as wetting soil in the planting time is more critical for preventing severe crop loss or crop failure during years of low rain seasonal forecast for precipitation will be critically important to facilitate strategic planning and management to balance the many competing demands for water resources this study focuses on crops in the kiremt season when precipitation is relatively abundant crops in the belg season dry season face more agricultural water management challenges and require growing season irrigation block et al 2008 dile et al 2013 moreover future climate change is projected to deteriorate the water resources condition in this region

water deficit causes crop water stress and ultimately loss of biomass production holzman et al 2014 ritchie 1998 while persistent saturation of soil can cause seeds to rot tu et al 1992 yanar et al 1997 and prohibit crop growth by cutting off roots air supply and making soil too compacted for roots to push through hence there exists a preferred range of soil moisture conditions from which large deviation on either side would cause crop damage in rain fed agricultural fields soil moisture throughout the growing season depends on storage at the planting time referred to as initial soil moisture ism hereafter precipitation during the growing season and loss to evapotranspiration and runoff ism influences the rate and speed of seedling germination and rooting thus playing an important role in determining the final crop yield however the extent to which ism determines crop yield has not been quantitatively assessed at the regional scale the current study aims to fill this research gap due to the lack of field data and experiments responses of crop yield to soil moisture management is often simulated by either statistical or process based crop models dokoohaki et al 2017 meng and quiring 2008 statistical models are often only applicable to local agronomic and environmental conditions used to calibrate the model parameters which limits extrapolation and transferability bennett et al 2014 jones et al 2017 alternatively based on deterministic functions that describe the influence of external drivers on crop physiological processes process based models simulate crop yield responses to environmental factors including climate soil water and nutrient and agronomic practices and are more broadly applicable ammar and davies 2019 among a large number of process based crop models roberts et al 2017 decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model dssat csm is one of the most widely used and well tested bationo et al 2012 jones et al 2003 and is the primary modeling tool used in this study widely used in various crop related studies across different climate regimes dssat has been shown to perform well in simulating crop yields for different management strategies soil and climate scenarios risk analysis and resources optimization at multiple time scales boote et al 2010 gijsman et al 2002 sarkar 2009 past implementations of dssat in modeling a variety of crops in ethiopia indicated that dssat has a good performance simulating crop yields in this region araya et al 2015 endalew 2019 getachew et al 2017 kassie et al 2014 here using dssat model linked to a hydrologic model we quantify the sensitivity of crop yield and production to initial soil moisture conditions in ubnb of ethiopia which allows us to assess the potential of soil moisture management in promoting agricultural outcome our ultimate goal is to provide actionable information for the development of strategies to mitigate drought induced food security risks 2 methods and materials 2 1 dssat model and data description dssat csm simulates various field scale agricultural practices including crop and soil processes for 28 crops dokoohaki et al 2017 jones et al 2003 and includes three primary modules cropgro module for legumes ceres module for cereals and substor module for root crops shelia et al 2018 here dssat ceres module version 4 5 is used to simulate four major cereal crops barley maize sorghum and wheat teff another widely planted cereal crop in ethiopia is unique to ethiopia and cannot be simulated by dssat yet dssat csm includes five primary components weather soil plant management and soil plant atmosphere interface which collectively represent the response of soil and plants to weather and management on a single land unit jones et al 2003 unlike many crop and ecosystem models that calculate soil moisture at different depth by solving richards equation dssat uses a simple tipping bucket approach that passes the excess water above field capacity directly to the layer below dokoohaki et al 2017 shelia et al 2018 soulis et al 2015 although some previous studies have shown that such a simplification is of sufficient accuracy in modeling the soil water content under both irrigation and rainfed conditions meng and quiring 2008 saseendran et al 2008 recent studies found a degradation of the model performance under water stressed conditions dokoohaki et al 2017 esmaeilian et al 2014 dssat was designed as a field scale model but can also be applied at the regional scale by running it pixel by pixel with specified input information for each pixel ahmed et al 2017 2016 2015 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 this study is based on such a spatially distributed application of dssat over the ubrb in ethiopia the basic input data to dssat pertain to weather soil management and cultivar daily weather forcing data was obtained from european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf re analysis era interim for solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature and from multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep for precipitation all at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolution of three hours beck et al 2017 dee et al 2011 soil properties data at five arc minute resolution was from global high resolution soil profile database for crop modeling applications version 2 5 international research institute for climate and society iri et al 2015 derived from soilgrids and isric afsis at 1 km resolution hengl et al 2014 international research institute for climate and society iri et al 2015 management data was from various sources including planting date from crop calendar provided by food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao fao 2019 and gridded fertilizer application data from earthstat at five arc minute resolution mueller et al 2012 the irrigation condition was set to rainfed due to the very low irrigation rate in this region block and rajagopalan 2007 roth et al 2018 the observational data at parcel level used for the calibration of cultivar physiological parameters was from ethiopia s annual agricultural sample survey agss from 2004 to 2013 with 2005 6 missing csa 2016 mann and warner 2017 we calculated the yields of each crop based on the production and area in every parcel and then aggregated from parcel level to wareda level gridded harvest area data for each crop was obtained from the latest spatial production allocation model spam 2010 v1 0 at five arc minute resolution international food policy research institute 2019 2 2 crest model and data description the coupled routing and excess storage model crest is a grid based distributed hydrological model for the simulation of the spatiotemporal variations of surface and subsurface water fluxes and storage at multiple scales wang et al 2011 the latest crest version 3 0 has been verified for simulating hydrologic processes such as runoff soil moisture dynamics and evapotranspiration at high spatiotemporal scales shen et al 2016 shen and anagnostou 2017 wang et al 2011 the soil moisture scheme in crest 3 0 is a coupling of water balance and energy balance in the water balance part soil profile is divided into three unsaturated layers with depth of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 190 cm from top to bottom the infiltration process within the top layer is governed by the variable infiltration curve vic liang et al 1994 wood et al 1992 while the water percolation between soil layers is calculated using the percolation algorithm from the soil and water assessment tool swat green and ampt 1911 neitsch et al 2011 shen and anagnostou 2017 the potential evapotranspiration pet is computed using penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and further adjusted to account for the impact of canopy water interception soil moisture and the moisture resistance of vegetation roots liang et al 1994 more detailed equations and steps for water and thermal balance computation can be found in shen and anagnostou 2017 the basic input to crest consists of weather leaf area index lai soil property land cover and imperviousness data the three hourly meteorological forcing data for crest was from the same source as that for dssat including precipitation air temperature downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation humidity pressure and wind speed similarly soil hydraulic properties such as saturation hydraulic conductivity field capacity wilting point residual soil moisture soil porosity organic matter and bulk density in crest were also obtained from soilgrids and isric afsis at 1 km resolution as in dssat lai was from global land surface satellites glass with a spatial resolution of 0 05 1982 1999 and 1 km 2000 present and a temporal resolution of 8 days liang et al 2013 land cover type was obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover product mod12q1 at 500 m resolution friedl et al 2010 with the impervious area fraction set to 0 because of the very low ratio of urbanized area in this region details of the data sources are listed in table 1 all data are bilinearly interpolated to 500 m for running crest 3 experimental design for dssat as a field scale model it is challenging to apply the model at large spatial scale with climate soil management and cultivar type varying from location to location here we calibrate and validate the genetic coefficients for each crop at the agroecological zone aez level fig 1 at five arc minute resolution specifically the genetic coefficients are uniform for pixels within each aez and vary among aezs while different pixels in the same aez differ in weather and soil conditions three of every four pixels are used for calibration and the remaining one for validation we first aggregate the model results from pixel scale to woreda scale the administrative level at which observational data were collected and then adjust the parameters to minimize the relative difference between simulated yield and observed yield based on woreda area weighted spatial average in each aez and temporal average during the years when observational data are available this is done for the calibration pixels and verification pixels separately with the calibrated genetic coefficients for each crop in each aez we run the model from 1979 to 2014 table 2 shows the relative biases for each aez before and after calibration using maize as an example details of the model calibration and validation are documented in yang et al 2020 in order to improve the accuracy of ism simulation we linked dssat with crest to take advantage of the more sophisticated soil moisture computational scheme from crest which involves overwriting soil moisture in dssat with values simulated by crest moisture contents in three soil layers within ubnb were simulated by crest at 500 m spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution from 1979 to 2014 soil moisture from crest were then aggregated to the dssat temporal and horizontal resolutions and vertically interpolated to each of the nine soil layers in dssat since the planting time for cereal crops in this region is generally in may fao 2019 the ism from crest in each pixel is classified into five categories extremely dry dry normal wet extremely wet according to the percentiles 10th 25th 50th 75th and 90th of soil moisture in the 20 day period from april 21 to may 10 for 36 years the surface layer ism distribution of the five categories is shown in fig 2 to assess the sensitivity of crop yield and production in ubnb to ism the calibrated model is used to simulate crop yield in ubnb under each of the five ism classes and the corresponding crop productions were also calculated and evaluated by summing up the pixel wise products of crop yield and the corresponding harvest area 4 results and discussions fig 3 shows the 36 year average yield and production of the four major cereal crops barley maize sorghum and wheat same order hereafter under the normal ism condition most land of ubnb is potentially arable with the yield of the four crops at approximately 1 2 ton ha 2 5 ton ha 1 8 ton ha and 1 5 ton ha respectively in general the central and southeast part of the basin are most suitable for planting barley maize and sorghum with the highest yield of 2 ton ha 4 ton ha and 2 5 ton ha wheat grows better in western ubnb with the highest yield of 2 ton ha however due to uneven distribution of the actual planting area the spatial distribution of crop productions differs from that of crop yields this is particularly notable for maize and wheat in the western part of the basin and for sorghum in the north central part of the basin where high crop yield doesn t translate to high production due to small planting areas this disparity indicates potential for improving production through optimal allocation of farmland in order to test the sensitivity of crop yields to ism we calculate the relative differences of crop yield between normal condition and the other four ism classes fig 4 the relative differences for all crops show a similar distribution pattern and are negative for dry conditions and positive for wet conditions with larger magnitude and spatial extent under more extreme isms in response to dry and extremely dry ism crop yields show larger decreases in eastern basin 25 than in western basin close to 0 similarly in response to wet and extremely wet ism crop yields show larger increases in eastern basin around 75 than in western basin 25 or less in general cereal crop yield in ubnb shows higher sensitivity to wet ism than to dry ism and crops in eastern basin are much more sensitive to ism than in western basin qualitatively the crop production response to ism is similar to the crop yield response but with differences in spatial pattern and is rather symmetric between wet and dry anomalies supplementary fig 1 the spatial distribution of pixel level crop production difference between extremely wet and extremely dry ism classes is presented in fig 5 for all crops high production areas are generally more sensitive to ism than low production areas at the pixel level 100 km2 the largest differences in production are 400 tons for barley and wheat in central northeastern and southeastern basin 800 tons for maize in central basin and 600 tons for sorghum in northern and southeastern basin consistent with fig 4 most of the areas with higher production sensitivity to ism are also in eastern basin where climate is relatively cold and dry to investigate the influences of ism on crop productions in years with different precipitation conditions 2009 dry year 1996 normal year and 1985 wet year are selected as representative years based on the percentiles 10th 50th and 90th of the growing season precipitation amount supplementary figs 2 4 the production differences aggregated over the entire ubnb between extreme wet and extreme dry ism conditions for these three years are shown in table 3 in dry years crop production under extremely wet ism condition is much higher than under extremely dry ism condition in normal and wet years the crop production differences between the two ism extremes are much less significant the responses of production to ism in representative years differ among crops particularly for maize in the normal year showing a decreased production under extremely wet ism conditions maize is usually planted earlier than other crops in this region and the rainy season came earlier than usual in the selected normal year our previous findings show that other than the total growing season precipitation the sub seasonal climate has great influence on crop yield yang et al 2020 which could influence the crop response to ism conditions the crop production response to ism under the growing season precipitation gsp in the three representative years shows a spatial pattern similar to the response of multi year average supplementary fig 1 the magnitude and spatial extent of the ism influence increase as growing season precipitation decreases this indicates that wetting the soil before sowing can remarkably reduce the risk of severe crop loss or total crop failure caused by water stress in dry years but such a strategy may not have notable beneficial effects in wet years when water is not a limiting factor for growth this finding can therefore help guide drought mitigation strategies if farmers or other decision makers have access to seasonal forecast of precipitation in further exploring the dependence of crop yields on ism and growing season precipitation we divide the basin into east eb and west wb portions on account of topography climate variability and ism variability fig 2 and supplementary fig 5 and treat the two separately to figure out the effect of improved ism on crop productions in different precipitation years we compared the basin total annual production anomalies between extremely wet ism condition and actual condition in eb and wb fig 6 note that the actual ism condition during the 36 years ranges widely from year to year depending on the pre season hydro meteorological conditions in each year for all four crops extremely wet ism condition would have led to higher crop productions than actual condition in most years for sorghum it would have changed the yield to above normal in most of the below normal yield years these effects are particularly strong in eb and during dry years these results suggest that an impressive crop production improvement is likely to be attained in ubnb by wetting the field at seeding time 5 conclusions in conclusion wetting soil at the planting time can offer an effective solution to improving the yield and production of major cereal crops especially in eastern ubnb as rainfall in kiremt season is often sufficient for the growth of major cereal crops securing seedling emergence and rooting during the planting season right before the kiremt season is an important step towards improved food security in ubnb one typical practice of wetting soil is irrigation which would become feasible upon the completion of grand ethiopia renaissance dam previous studies found planting time irrigation can significantly improve crop yield because the increased emergence rate contributes to higher spike numbers and enhanced grain plumpness paredes et al 2017 yan et al 2017 ma et al 2012 mo et al 2017 other soil water conservation techniques such as plastic film mulching and straw mulching was also found effective in improving water use efficiency and crop yield dong et al 2018 ma et al 2018 in ubnb the benefit of wetting soil in the plating time is greater in the eastern basin due to its large cropland area and high cropland density as well as its drier climate and is also greater during years of low rainfall if the farmland distribution in ubnb remains similar to what it is today the eastern basin should receive priority consideration for soil water management infrastructure development and improvement in addition as wetting soil in the planting time is more critical for preventing severe crop loss or crop failure during years of low rain seasonal forecast for precipitation will be critically important to facilitate strategic planning and management to balance the many competing demands for water resources this study focuses on crops in the kiremt season when precipitation is relatively abundant crops in the belg season dry season face more agricultural water management challenges and require growing season irrigation block et al 2008 dile et al 2013 moreover future climate change is projected to deteriorate the water resources condition in this region dile et al 2013 teklesadik et al 2017 worqlul et al 2018 all of these should be taken into consideration in regional infrastructure planning and resource allocation data availability the sources of

10373,tomato is a popular healthy fruit worldwide because it is rich in secondary metabolites such as vitamin c deficit irrigation di can be applied to improve tomato fruit quality to a certain degree and save water consumption however the effects of di on tomato quality are complex and affected by factors such as tomato variety and soil bulk density and texture the objective of this paper is to use meta analysis to 1 investigate the effects of di on tomato quality variables and 2 study how soil texture soil bulk density and three tomato varieties affect quality variables under di compared to those under full irrigation we collected 83 research papers from around the world and analyzed 2369 data pairs overall di increased the total soluble solids 12 44 soluble sugar 11 23 organic acids 6 58 sugar acid content ratio 14 56 vitamin c 13 84 lycopene 10 46 color index 8 42 red green value 11 89 shape index 3 25 and firmness 12 09 while decreasing β carotene lightness hue angle and yellow blue value by 11 11 1 77 3 42 and 4 26 respectively in addition di had no significant effects on tomato chroma 0 89 on average 95 ci 0 96 to 2 79 or ph 0 13 on average 95 ci 0 26 to 0 52 the results indicated that it would be better to apply deficit irrigation in fine and coarse soil because most of the quality variables improved more in these soil textures than in medium soil soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 benefited taste quality vitamin c and shape index the quality of the three tomato varieties responded differently to water deficit conditions moreover cherry tomato responded better to water deficit conditions than the other two tomato varieties four quality variables improved the most in cherry tomato and two other variables were also improved our findings could help to obtain a better understanding of how fruit quality responds to di in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties and to produce higher quality tomatoes keywords tomato fruit quality deficit irrigation soil texture soil bulk density tomato varieties 1 introduction it is well known that a healthy diet is helpful in preventing chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases improving energy levels and managing weight dorais et al 2008 studies have shown that tomato consumption has strong inverse relationships with the risks of certain types of cancer sesso et al 2004 stahl and sies 2005 many clinical trials and experiments have proven that tomatoes are rich in antioxidants and vitamin c which can protect humans and animals from these diseases mayne 1996 in addition tomato is a popular vegetable battilani et al 2012 with a plant world wide area of 4 76 106 ha in 2018 and a production of 182 26 106 ha faostat 2018 tomato not only helps ensure the security of global food but it is also an important source of antioxidants such as lycopene phenolic and vitamin c in human diet toor et al 2006 sustaining tomato yields and improving fruit quality are very important to support environmental sustainability and ensure human health however traditional tomato irrigation uses large amounts of water and climate change decreases the renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions intensifying competition for water demand among different social industries ipcc 2014 to solve this problem developing water saving practices is a key strategy which could improve fruit quality with acceptable yield losses deficit irrigation di is a good way to produce environmentally sustainable food and save water this method applies water below the amount of the plant s water demand as indicated by evapotranspiration et willett et al 2019 di not only has the potential to reduce water consumption chai et al 2016 kang et al 2017 but also to regulate fruit quality nuruddin et al 2003 ripoll et al 2014 the application of the di strategy has succeeded in fruit tress dos santos et al 2007 yang et al 2011 and cereals li et al 2015 talebnejad and separskhah 2015 many studies have indicated that certain water deficit could improve some quality variables such as total soluble solids and vitamin c zegbe domınguez et al 2003 ozbahce and tari 2010 lu et al 2019 water deficit in the fruit development stage could also increase the total phenolic content in tomato barbagallo et al 2013 favati et al 2009 studied the effects of irrigation management on tomato quality and observed that the accumulation of lycopene and β carotene under water deficit was higher than that without water deficit in addition certain water deficit levels were demonstrated in experiments to have the potential to improve water use efficiency agbemafle et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 although deficit irrigation has many benefits in certain tomato quality variables its effects are complex despite much studies renquist and reid 2001 marouelli and silva 2007 many factors affect tomato nutrients including variety climate light temperature soil fertilization and water status smith and hui 2004 in addition many factors alter the response of tomato to water deficit ripoll et al 2016 studied the effects of different degrees of water deficit on tomato quality and found that high levels of deficit irrigation may reduce the sugar acid and carotenoid contents wang et al 2011b indicated the water deficit period significantly affected the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato quality soil properties including chemical physical and biological properties affect water and mineral uptake by plants thus influencing tomato quality under water deficit dorais et al 2008 bogale et al 2016 studied the effects of regulated deficit irrigation on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in two selected tomato cultivars and the results showed that vitamin c and lycopene contents significantly increased in the matina variety but not in the cochoro variety climate is also an important factor the evaporative demand on the crop strongly influences the effects of deficit irrigation patanè et al 2011 though many studies have investigated the effects of water deficit on tomato quality many factors influence the response of tomato quality to water deficit as discussed above it is important to understand what the effects will be under water deficit in different conditions and to correctly apply a water saving strategy for a better quality tomato moreover few studies have investigated the effects of water deficit on tomato quality in different soil textures and at different soil bulk densities thus further studies that take soil properties and tomato varieties into consideration are required to obtain a better understanding of their influences on tomato quality the objective of this study was to use a meta analysis to 1 quantify the effects of water deficit on tomato quality parameters such as total soluble solids soluble sugar vitamin c lycopene firmness and color and 2 identify how different factors including soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety influenced the effects of water deficit on tomato fruit quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection data were collected through a comprehensive literature search on the isi web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for studies reporting the effects of water deficit on tomato quality published from april 1960 to october 2019 in addition a second search was performed by reading references of already downloaded articles the following key words were focused on during the whole literature search tomato quality deficit irrigation regulated deficit irrigation water stress water deficit and irrigation regime studies that reported the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato quality compared with those of a control treatment without deficit irrigation ck in pot or field experiments were selected here the di strategy mainly refers to applying water at a rate lower than the plant water demand the detailed treatments were presented in table 1 treatments were set based on an index of the following parameters crop evapotranspiration etc reference evapotranspiration etr pan evaporation ep field water capacity θf soil water suction and leaf water potential in a few papers the control treatment was irrigated according to the experience of local growers and the irrigation water needed in some papers was calculated according to a specific function the treatments presented in table 1 represent only the degree of deficit irrigation because the detail application of the di may be performed with different application times the tomato quality variables analyzed included total soluble solids tss soluble solids were discussed in some papers and we included this variable in total soluble solids soluble sugar ss organic acids oa sugar acid content ratio sar vitamin c vc lycopene β carotene color parameters lightness chroma hue angle a b a indicates green red shade b indicates blue yellow shade color index calculated following the equation color index 2000 a l a2 b2 0 5 intelmann et al 2005 shape index si firmness fn and tomato ph we classified the variables above into categories as follows 1 taste quality variables including tss ss oa and sar 2 vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene 3 external quality si and color parameters lightness chroma hue angle a and b 4 storage quality including fn and 5 tomato ph in order to analyze the factors that affected the response of tomato quality to water deficit we also collected variables including soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 we classified the soil texture into three groups 1 coarse soil c including sandy loam sandy clay loam and loamy sand 2 medium soil m including clay loam silty clay loam silt and silt loam and 3 fine soil f including clay silt clay and sandy clay alameda et al 2012 found that the control treatment growth increased with soil compaction up to bulk density values of approximately 1 4 g cm 3 and then declined which showed that at low to intermediate values soil compaction could stimulate growth based on this we divided all data groups into three subgroups 1 soil bulk density values 1 4 g cm 3 2 soil bulk density values 1 2 g cm 3 1 4 g cm 3 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 and 3 soil bulk density values 1 2 g cm 3 several different tomato varieties were used in the experiments in the collected research articles but cherry tomato processing tomato and pink tomato accounted for a large proportion of the varieties if the data were classified based on the different tomato varieties some subgroup data would have come from fewer than two papers thus we only discussed the three subgroups of tomato varieties the data for the subgroups analyzed were from at least two papers otherwise the subgroup was not discussed in this paper to avoid publication bias the following criteria were used to select studies 1 at least one of the collected tomato quality variables was measured 2 how the studies carried out deficit irrigation and the control treatment were described in detail and 3 the mean value standard deviation sd and n the number of replicates for both the treatment and control groups were provided these data were needed to perform the meta analysis if there were missing data we tried to contact the authors to obtain the needed data if the data were shown in figures we extracted the data through getdata graph digitizer 2 26 http www getdatagraph digitizer com index php if the standard error se was given but the sd was not we converted the se to sd by the formula as s d s e n jian et al 2016 if the contacted authors did not answer the variances were interpolated as the coefficient of all the variances of the experimental means from the paper by multiplying by the treatment means moreover to reduce the weighting of these studies we doubled the variance jeffery et al 2017 after the searches and selection we finally used 83 papers and 2369 data pairs to analyze the effects of water deficit on tomato fruit quality as shown in table 1 most of the studies were from asia 55 42 followed by europe 32 53 north america 6 02 oceania 3 62 and africa 2 41 2 2 data analysis the meta analysis was performed in r software which is a free software environment for statistical analysis and graphics the response ratio r i was used as the measure of the effect size and was calculated by the following formula for each pair of data hedges et al 1999 r i x t x c where x t is the mean of the treatment group variables and x c is the mean of the control group variables while the value range of i 1 2 k representing the ith independent paired data the weight w i of each paired data is calculated with the following formula in the random effects model it is the weighted factor of effect size i w i 1 v i where v i is the sum of the variance among all data t 2 and the internal variance of the ith paired data v i that is v i v i t 2 the relative weight w i was calculated by the following formula and it represented the percentage of result of each paired data in the overall result w i w i i 1 k w i the whole effect size r is calculated by the following formula r i 1 k w i r i i 1 k w i in this way studies with lower variance were given greater weights to calculate r so as to increase the precision of the effect size higgins i2 statistics and the q test higgins et al 2003 were used to assess the degree of heterogeneity to indicate the variance between studies a fixed effects model was used for low heterogenous studies i2 50 and p 0 05 and a random effects model was used in the opposite situation i2 50 or p 0 05 a forest plot was generated from the pooled results in the forest plot the mean ratio response and the 95 confidence interval ci were represented by a point and bars respectively to explain the results we obtained the percentage of the change compared to the control treatment r 1 100 if the 95 ci did not overlap with zero we considered the effect size to be significantly different from the control if the 95 cis of the subgroups did not overlap we considered the effect size significantly different between subgroups 3 results 3 1 overall effect of water deficit on tomato fruit quality fig 1 shows the overall effect of water deficit on each quality variable we found water deficit significantly improved most of the quality variables except for chroma and juice ph and significantly decreased the quality variables of β carotene and hue angle lightness and b in detail water deficit significantly improved tss by 12 44 95 ci 9 92 to 15 01 according to 497 paired comparisons ss by 11 23 95 ci 8 21 to 14 34 197 paired comparisons oa by 6

comparisons for carotenoids lycopene increased by 10 46 95 ci 6 94 to 14 10 204 paired comparisons however β carotene decreased significantly by 11 11 95 ci 17 60 to 4 11 52 paired comparisons for the fruit chromatic parameters water deficit significantly increased the color index by 8 42 95 ci 6 54 to 10 33 127 paired comparisons and a value by 11 89 95 ci 7 20 to 16 79 52 paired comparisons in contrast lightness decreased by 1 77 95 ci 2 47 to 1 06 70 paired comparisons and the b value decreased by 4 26 95 ci 6 54 to 1 92 31 paired comparisons there was no significant difference in tomato chroma under water deficit 0 89 95 ci 0 96 to 2 79 the hue angle decreased significantly by 3 42 ci 4 86 to 1 96 si was increased significantly by 3 25 95 ci 1 99 to 4 53 119 paired comparisons based on 171 data pairs the storage quality fn was significantly enhanced by 12 09 95 ci 8 34 to 15 96 under water deficit water deficit had no significant effect on the tomato juice ph 0 13 95 ci 0 26 to 0

texture c f and m fig 2 a shows that tss increased the most in fine soil by 30 79 compared with the increases in the other two soil texture subgroups while the 95 confidence intervals of the groups overlapped however the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of tss to water deficit as shown in fig 2 b tss increased the most by 14 67 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 95 ci 11 81 to 17 59 155 paired comparisons compared with the increase in the other two subgroups the percentage increases in tss were 7 73 95 ci 5 98 to 9 51 and 9 39 95 ci 8 26 to 10 54 in 1 2 and 1 4 g cm 3 soils respectively taking the tomato variety into consideration the tss of pink tomato increased the least by 5 32 with 70 paired comparisons this value is significantly different from the increase in tss in the other two tomato verity subgroups as fig 3 a illustrates ss increased by 14 10 and 13 32 under water deficit in coarse and medium soil respectively fig 3 b shows that ss increased more by 15 19 in soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 than in soil with a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 10 82 the response of ss to the water deficit was significantly affected by the tomato variety and the ss of cherry tomato increased the most by 19 13 under water deficit ss increased by 14 08 in pink tomato and by 13 34 in processing tomato as shown in fig 4 a there was no change in the oa level in coarse soil 95 ci 1 20 to 9 37 under water deficit while it significantly increased by 9 86 in fine soil 95 ci 3 62 to 16 47 19 paired comparisons and by 8 02 in medium soil 95 ci 5 53 to 10 58 174 paired comparisons fig 4 b indicates that soil bulk density influenced the oa response to water deficit oa significantly increased by 8 58 in 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density soil and by 7 04 in 1 2 g cm 3 bulk density soil with 125 and 15 paired comparisons respectively while it did not change in the other subgroup 95 ci 3 62 to 7 51 the response of oa to water deficit differed among tomato varieties fig 4 c with increases of 11 92 95 ci 8 08 to 15 91 7 25 95 ci 3 32 to 11 34 and no change 95 ci 4 06 to 9 32 in cherry tomato processing tomato and pink tomato respectively both soil texture and bulk density had significant effects on tomato sar under water deficit as shown in fig 5 while tomato variety did not as shown in fig 5 a sar increased significantly more in coarse soil 29 42 95 ci 20 91 to 38 54 than in medium soil 9 18 95 ci 5 94 to 12 51 under water deficit fig 5 b shows that the percent increase in sar was higher in soil with bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 35 78 95 ci 24 15 to 48 51 than in soil with a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 6 51 95 ci 4 97 to 8 07 the percentage increases in sar were 11 44 12 38 and 4 27 in cherry tomato pink tomato and processing tomato respectively as shown in fig 5 c 3 3 effects of water deficit on tomato vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties vc was improved more by a water deficit in coarse soil than in medium soil with increase percentages of 18 29 and 15 51 respectively as shown in fig 6 a the increase in vc was 0 62 higher fig 6 b in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 11 85 95 ci 7 37 to 16 52 than that in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 11 23 95 ci 8 52 to 14 02 though soil texture and bulk density affected the response of vc to water deficit the 95 confidence intervals overlapped vc increased the most by 23 77 95 ci 16 57 to 31 42 in pink tomato followed by cherry tomato 5 35 95 ci 0 02 to 10 97 and processing tomato 3 97 95 ci 1 91 to 6 07 moreover the effects of the water deficit in pink tomato were significantly different from those in cherry tomato and processing tomato fig 6 c lycopene increased more by 20 76 in medium soil than in coarse soil 9 46 fig 7 a while the 95 confidence for the two soil types intervals overlapped water deficit significantly increased lycopene in soil with a bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 17 84 95 ci 13 52 to 22 32 but not in soil with a bulk density 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 0 71 95 ci 5 15 to 9 39 the increase in lycopene in pink tomato under water deficit 39 28 was significantly higher 95 ci 23 97 to 56 48 than that of the other two tomato varieties fig 7 c the percentage increase in lycopene in processing tomato was 17 32 95 ci 13 59 to 21 16 however lycopene in cherry tomato did not change under water deficit 15 57 95 ci 11 41 to 50 76 water deficit had no effects on β carotene in the processing tomato subgroup 3 24 ci 4 87 to 12 04 while it improved β carotene in the cherry tomato subgroup by 10 68 95 ci 3 04 to 18 88 as shown in fig 8 3 4 effects of water deficit on external tomato quality including chromatic parameters and shape index in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties as fig 9 a shows the color index increased more in coarse soil than in medium soil by 5 68 and 4 12 respectively the effects of water deficit on the color index in soil with a bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 were significantly different from those in the other subgroups fig 9 b the increased percentages were 9 85 95 ci 5 73 to 14 14 and 3 21 95 ci 2 09 to 4 34 in the two soil bulk density subgroups respectively the color index of pink tomato increased the least and the increase was 2 89 95 ci 1 80 to 3 99 fig 9 c the color index increased significantly by 3 28 95 ci 1 84 to 4 75 in processing tomato the effects of water deficit on tomato hue angle in the different tomato variety groups are shown in fig 10 there was no statistically significant difference in the change in the hue angle of cherry tomato and processing tomato water deficit decreased the hue angle in cherry tomato by 3 11 and that in processing tomato by 3 81 due to the insufficient data of hue angle in different soil textures and soil bulk densities we could not analyze the effects of water deficit on hue angle in these subgroups fig 11 indicates that the soil texture and bulk density significantly affected the response of si to water deficit si increased in coarse soil by 7 30 95 ci 4 44 to 10 23 but did not change in the medium soil 0 20 95 ci 0 93 to 0 54 as shown in fig 11 a similar results for si are exhibited in fig 11 b with an increase of 8 91 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 95 ci 6 05 to 11 85 and no change in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 0 56 95 ci 1 49 to 0 37 3 5 effects of water deficit on tomato storage quality in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties fig 12 a indicates that the soil texture influenced the response of fn to water deficit the increase in fn under water deficit was higher in coarse soil than in medium soil and it was 9 30 95 ci 6 06 to 12 64 in coarse soil and 3 19 ci 1 39 to 5 02 in medium soil there was no difference in the fn response to water deficit among the bulk density subgroups fig 12 b fn increased by 5 59 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 4 97 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density there was no change in the fn of cherry tomato 95 ci 2 08 to 9 56 shown in fig 12 c the fn of pink tomato increased by 5 54 under water deficit 95 ci 2 87 to 8 27 and the fn of processing tomato increased by 7 89 under water deficit 95 ci 4 06 to 11 86 3 6 effects of water deficit on tomato ph in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties there was no change in tomato ph under water deficit in coarse soil 95 ci 0 51 to 1 55 fine soil 95 ci 0 38 to 0 58 or medium soil 95 ci 0 57 to 0 07 however the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of ph to water deficit fig 13 b tomato ph increased by 2 87 95 ci 1 47 to 4 29 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density but did not change in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 0 19 95 ci 0 53 to 0 14 or 1 2 g cm 3 bulk density 0 84 95 ci 1 88 to 0 22 4 discussion 4 1 water deficit influence on tomato taste quality variables since tomato is known as nutrient rich healthy crop that has a high water demand patanè et al 2011 it is important to determine an effective method to improve tomato quality and save water deficit irrigation has been indicated to have beneficial effects on tomato fruit quality with little decrease in yield ripoll et al 2014 as one of the most important tomato fruit quality variables tss indicates the proportion of dissolved solids in a solution which includes approximately 65 sugars sucrose and hexoses 13 acids citrate and malate and 12 other minor components phenols amino acids soluble pectins ascorbic acid and minerals in the tomato fruit pulp balibrea et al 2006 kader 2008 in our study the results demonstrated that deficit irrigation could significantly increase tss by 12 44 which was in an agreement with previous studies reporting that soluble solids were higher in deficit treatments than in control treatments wang et al 2015 patanè and cosentino 2010 the reason why tomato obtained higher soluble solids under deficit irrigation was that the decrease of water uptake into tomato led to higher solute concentration renquist and reid 2001 fruit taste is mainly determined by the soluble sugar organic acid and sugar acid content ratio kader 2008 ss increased significantly by 11 23 under water deficit and the same result was obtained by jiang and zhao 2019 mitchell et al 1991 revealed that increased water stress decreased water uptake in tomato fruit and increased the concentration of solutes in the sap thus increasing the sugars in the fruit there was a significant 6 58 increase in oa under deficit irrigation this finding was supported by kumar et al 2015 while there was a decrease in tomato acidity in the study of jiang and zhao 2019 this discrepancy may be because tomato acidity depends not only on growth conditions but also on cultural practices and varieties previous studies shao et al 2016 keabetswe et al 2019 observed an increase in sar under deficit irrigation which was similar to our result of an increase of 14 56 in sar achieving the best flavor in tomato requires high sugar concentrations and relatively high acid concentrations hao et al 2019 in our study under deficit irrigation both oa and ss were increased and ss was increased more than oa in our study leading to an increase in sar this suggests that deficit irrigation may improve tomato flavor although deficit irrigation may improve tomato quality its effects varied with various factors such as deficit irrigation application time severity of water deficit tomato variety soil texture and soil bulk density generally deficit irrigation increased the quality variables including tss ss and sar more in coarse soil than in medium soil in this study apart from that tss and oa increased more in fine soil than in coarse soil however the soil texture had no significant effects on the response of these four quality variables to water deficit except for sar the reason for the largest improvement of fruit quality in fine soil may be that there was enough time for the fine soil to adjust to low soil water matric potential and therefore the quality variables were not easily or rapidly influenced adu et al 2018 kirda 2002 the water leakage of the coarse soil was the highest among three soil textures leading to less water uptake by the fruit and more solute concentration however due to the highest water leakage in coarse soil tomato plants could not absorb more nutrients which are essential for growth and resulting in a worse fruit quality at the end the quality of tomatoes grown in medium soil was worse than that in coarse soil comparing to coarse soil the water leakage in medium soil was less and resulting in fewer solute concentration than those in coarse soil but the adjusting capacity to low water matric potential was better in medium soil than in coarse soil we analyzed the percentage of soil bulk density in each soil texture subgroup and found that the percentage of soil bulk density over 1 4 g cm 3 was the largest than the other two bulk density soil in medium soil and the percentage of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density soil was fewer by 6 83 and 13 38 in coarse soil than in medium soil in all the paired data about tss and ss respectively the results showed that the medium soil was more compacted in our study therefore causing bad soil aeration which may reduce photosynthetic activity and sugar metabolizing enzyme activities ozaki et al 2009 and a higher bulk density could limit root growth which was not good for roots to absorb nutrients this may explain why fruit taste quality improved less in medium soil than in coarse soil though the adjusting capacity to low water matric potential was better in medium soil than in coarse soil in some condition additional variables and interacting factors including tomato variety soil bulk density may confound counteract the effect of one single variable de pascale et al 2015 observed that tomato fruit sugar content was affected by soil texture and the fruit sugar content increased more in clayey soil medium soil than in sandy soil coarse soil this was a little inconsistent with our results and that was because soil texture treatments were combined with n fertilization treatments and farming systems in their study they did not combine soil texture treatments with deficit irrigation treatments the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of tss and sar to water deficit moreover fruit quality was improved more in soil at 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than that in soil at 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the reason may be that high soil compaction could limit the tomato root growth thus affecting whole plant growth the results were similar to those of a previous study tubeileh et al 2003 indicating that high soil compaction could limit the growth distribution and absorption capacity of maize roots the tomato variety also had effects on the quality variables under deficit irrigation it had significant effects on tss and oa under water deficit but not on ss or sar moreover the general trends of the tss and oa variables were similar in general cherry tomato improved the most under water deficit followed by processing tomato and pink tomato these results are the same as those in the study of fullana pericàs et al 2019 which reported that the tss and oa of cherry tomato were improved more than those of processing tomato the fruit quality varied not only between crops but also between varieties bertin et al 2000 4 2 water deficit influence on tomato vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene tomato produces health giving secondary metabolites such as vc lycopene and β carotene tohge et al 2014 these compounds can decrease the death rate of certain cancers and cardiovascular disease carr and frei 1999 vc increased by 13 84 under deficit irrigation in our study many studies indicated that water deficit could increase vc in tomato fruit dumas et al 2003 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2014 water deficit decreased foliage development leading to increasing fruit sunlight exposure and hence more vc accumulated massot et al 2010 lycopene accounts for 80 90 of the total carotenoids krumbein et al 2006 which has anti carcinogenic and anti atherogenic potential singh and goyal 2008 biddle et al 2013 moreover lycopene increased by 10 46 under water deficit for the same reason as vc toor et al 2006 while both vc and lycopene were significantly increased by deficit irrigation β carotene was significantly decreased the results were contradictory compared with those of bogale et al 2016 we analyzed the results of the 6 collected papers deeply and found 21 data pairs from one paper schweiggert et al 2017 with a relative weight of 41 3 moreover most results of this paper showed that water deficit had a significantly negative effect on β carotene considering the publication bias we calculated the results again excluding this paper and the effects of deficit irrigation on β carotene changed and were not significant 2 00 ci 10 00 to 7 00 the effect of deficit irrigation on β carotene was not significant in each collected paper except in the paper of bogale et al 2016 because more than one tomato variety was used in some papers thus the response of β carotene to water deficit needs to be analyzed deeply in future studies coyago cruz et al 2017 confirmed that β carotene was strongly affected by the treatments and the tomato variety the effects of soil texture on vc were the same as those on ss under water deficit vc increased by 2 78 more in coarse soil than in medium soil the reason why vc was improved more in coarse soil than in medium soil may be that the capacity of coarse soil to hold water and nutrients was poorer than that of medium soil thus decreasing foliage development more increasing fruit exposure to sunlight and vc accumulation like soil texture soil bulk density affected the response of vc to water deficit without statistical significance but water deficit improved vc more in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density there were studies observingthat moderate bulk densities could enhance root growth hamza and anderson 2005 tracy et al 2012 if the soil bulk density increased the soil became more compacted and would limit root growth bengough et al 2006 however roots are important for plants to absorb water and nutrients from soil and transport them to the parts aboveground roots growth was worse in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with bulk density between 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 thus plant absorbed fewer nutrients and transported less photoassimilate in soil with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 cao et al 2005 pointed out that the absorption of beneficial microelements from soil by roots were helpful to improve tomato vc that was why tomato vc was improved less in soil with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 moreover porosity was low in high bulk density soil resulting in bad soil aeration arthur et al 2012 it may cause root hypoxia horchani et al 2008 proved that root hypoxia could reduce the induction of most genes in their biosynthesis pathways and then limit ascorbate vc accumulation in fruits in addition vc cotent was determined by the season the nutrients available and the environment davies and hobson 1981 in contrast lycopene increased less in coarse soil than in medium soil with a significant difference of 11 30 in addition the effects of soil bulk density on lycopene were different from those on vc under water deficit lycopene was significantly increased by 17 84 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density while it did not change in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the difference between lycopene and vc under water deficit may indicate that lycopene was more affected by the tomato variety moreover lahoz et al 2016 indicated that lycopene was strongly influenced by genotype with minor modifications by the irrigation and year effects the tomato variety had significant effects on the response of vc and lycopene to water deficit but not on β carotene the vc of pink tomato was improved more than that of cherry tomato and processing tomato showed the least improvement bogale et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation had various effects on vc depending on the cultivar lycopene of pink tomato was significantly improved more than that of processing tomato while there were no significant effects on the lycopene of cherry tomato no significant effects on the lycopene of cherry tomato were found because some papers indicated that water stress could increase lycopene in cherry tomatoes pernice et al 2010 wang et al 2011b but some showed contrasting results sánchez rodríguez et al 2012 the β carotene of cherry tomato increased significantly by 10 68 under deficit irrigation but the β carotene content did not significantly increase in processing tomato the variation in carotenoid accumulation among varieties under water deficit could be due to the differential regulation or abundance of the enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis othman et al 2014 4 3 water deficit influence on the external quality of tomato including chromatic parameters and shape index lightness decreased by 1 77 under water deficit this result was the same as that in a previous study cantore et al 2016 barbagallo et al 2013 the hue angle decreased by 3 42 under water deficit which expressed the color intensity purity lower values of lightness and hue angle factually meant fruits darker redder and more mature champa et al 2015 these results were consistent with results of parameters of a value and lycopene and all of these parameters were relevant with a redder tomato water deficit had no significant effects on chroma this may be because the tomato varieties were different among the collected papers resulting in different responses to water deficit the a value is a good parameter for indicating red color development and the degree of ripening in tomato while the b parameter shows yellow discoloration artés et al 1999 the value of a significantly increased by 11 89 while the value of b significantly decreased by 4 26 under water deficit this was also reported in previous studies pulupol et al 1996 zegbe domınguez et al 2003 the increased a value and decreased b value increased the color index as one of the external qualities that are important to consumers the color index increased by 8 42 under water deficit consistent with a previous study shao et al 2015 this was because water deficit increased the tomato ethylene content leading to an increase in lycopene and carotenoid concentrations thus making the pericarp of the tomato fruit redder basiouny et al 1994 as another important external quality si increased by 3 25 under water deficit the results were the same as those of a previous study reporting that the effects of water deficit on fruit si were significant in the third bunch of fruits hao et al 2019 other studies shao et al 2015 jiang and zhao 2019 found that there was a nonsignificant increase in fruit si compared with that under no water stress the response of the hue angle to water deficit was similar in cherry tomato and processing tomato which indicated that the effects of water deficit on tomato hue angle did not differ among varieties the color index in different soil texture subgroups had the opposite response to water deficit as the different soil bulk density subgroups because the color index response was significantly different among soil bulk density subgroups but not among soil texture subgroups the color index was enhanced more under water deficit in coarse soil than in medium soil and increased more in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the varieties had effects on the response of color index to water deficit without statistical significance and the color index increased more in processing tomato than in pink tomato the external fruit color was relative to the lycopene content in fruits helyes et al 2006 this could explain why the color index had a similar response as the lycopene to soil texture and soil bulk density under water deficit nevertheless there were differences among the varieties the si response to water deficit was affected by soil properties because si increased significantly in coarse soil and in soil of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 while it decreased no significantly in medium soil and in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 this could be explained by the fact that si was affected by environmental growing conditions white et al 2000 4 4 water deficit influence on storage quality of tomato a high fn value is desirable to both growers and consumers because it allows for a longer storage duration shewfelt 2000 in our study fn increased by 12 09 which was in an agreement with previous results patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2014 the increase in fn under deficit irrigation may be due to a decrease in internal turgor leading to lower pressure on the cell walls and higher epidermal elasticity guichard et al 2001 fn responded to the water deficit significantly differently among soil texture subgroups fn was improved by 9 30 and 3 19 in coarse and medium soil respectively although bulk density had no significant effects on fn fn was slightly higher in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density by 0 62 there was no significant difference in fn among the three tomato varieties the fn of pink tomato and processing tomato significantly increased by 5 54 and 7 89 respectively under deficit irrigation in contrast cherry tomato was not significantly influenced by the water deficit the different responses of fn to soil and varieties indicated that fn under water deficit was affected not only by soil properties but also by environmental factors e g temperature and light intensity in addition a previous study reported that fn was related to the maturity stage zheng et al 2013 4 5 water deficit influence on tomato ph tomato ph is important because it affects the thermal processing conditions applied in industrial tomato processing to produce safe products in our study water deficit had no significant effect on ph this result was consistent with that in previous studies tüzel et al 1994 hanson et al 2006 the ph response to water deficit in different soil textures was different from that in soils with different bulk densities water deficit had no significant effect on tomato juice ph in coarse medium and fine soil however the tomato ph was significantly increased by deficit irrigation in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density but not in the rest of the bulk density subgroups the ph response was insignificant in most soil texture and bulk density subgroups because ph depended on cultural practices growing location seasonal variations and so on favati et al 2009 for example a previous study garcia and barrett 2006 observed that the effect of the growing season on ph was clear 4 6 limitations of the current study this study investigated the response of 12 tomato quality variables to water deficit in different soil textures and bulk densities and tomato varieties however due to insufficient data when fewer than two papers were available the effects of these three factors on the response of tomato quality to water deficit could not be analyzed in some cases future studies could investigate the effects of these three factors on the responses of tomato chromatic quality including chroma lightness a and b to water deficit moreover the response of β carotene to water deficit with different soil textures and bulk densities could be studied data on si and ph under water deficit in different tomato varieties are limited and need to be investigated in our study there were many tomato varieties but not every tomato variety was analyzed because data on some varieties were collected from only one published paper and there was no unified standard for dividing all the data into categories we only investigated the responses of pink tomato processing tomato and cherry tomato quality to water deficit these categories were studied more often than others among the collected literature this study discussed the effects of water deficit on tomato quality considering soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety however there are other factors such as the timing and intensity of deficit application that affect the results hou et al 2020 moreover environmental conditions and fertilizers can influence the effects of water deficit on quality future research can consider more factors and characterize the effects of their interactions on tomato quality moreover there have been few studies on the effects of water deficit on tomato quality that consider soil properties such as ph thus these aspects could be explored more deeply for example wang et al 2020 performed a meta analysis to evaluate how climate affected the response of crop yield to controlled drainage so that the climate could be considered in future studies about the effects of water deficit on tomato quality gao et al 2020 analyzed the effects of biochar application on crop water use efficiency combined with the n application rate 5 conclusions numerous studies have shown that water deficit can improve tomato quality however it is known that many factors affect the response of tomato quality to water deficit previous studies have addressed the effects of water deficit severity and time on the response of tomato quality to water deficit but few studies have investigated the effects of soil texture and bulk density on the response of tomato quality to water deficit our work provides a quantitative analysis of the current literature available to investigate the effects of water deficit on tomato quality in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties overall water deficit significantly improved most of the quality variables tss ss oa sar vc lycopene color index a si fn decreased four variables β carotene lightness hue angle b and had no significant effect on chroma or tomato ph deficit irrigation increased tss ss oa sar vc lycopene color index a si and fn by 12 44 11 23 6 58 14 56 13 84 10 46 8 42 11 89 3 25 and 12 09 respectively deficit irrigation decreased β carotene lightness hue angle and b by 11 11 1 77 3 42 and 4 26 respectively although some quality variables sar si and fn responded significantly differently to water deficit in different soil textures the rest of the quality variables did not and most of the quality variables had better values in coarse soil than in medium soil and reached their best values in fine soil except for oa lycopene color index fn and ph the other quality variables were better in soil of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density tomato quality showed different responses to water deficit among varieties for tss and oa cherry tomato improved the most followed by processing tomato and pink tomato for ss cherry tomato improved the most followed by pink tomato and processing tomato for sar and vc pink tomato improved the most followed by cherry tomato and processing tomato there was no significant effect on lycopene or fn in cherry tomato under water deficit and lycopene was improved more in pink tomato than in processing tomato fn showed the opposite result β carotene was significantly improved by water deficit in cherry tomato but not in processing tomato the tomato hue angle responded similarly to water deficit in cherry tomato and processing tomato the color index an important tomato color parameter was improved more in processing tomato than in pink tomato but the changes in color index in two tomato varieties were not significantly different the results showed that water deficit can be a potential strategy for improving tomato fruit quality while also saving water in general water deficit resulted in redder firmer and better tasting tomatoes with more vc and lycopene compared to well irrigated tomatoes it would be better to apply deficit irrigation in fine and coarse soil because most of the quality variables were improved more in these soil types than in medium soil soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 was good for the improvement of taste quality variables vc and si but not for the other quality variables moreover cherry tomato had a better response to water deficit than the other two tomato varieties for four quality variables improved the most in cherry tomato and two other variables also improved declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript and manuscript is approved

10373,tomato is a popular healthy fruit worldwide because it is rich in secondary metabolites such as vitamin c deficit irrigation di can be applied to improve tomato fruit quality to a certain degree and save water consumption however the effects of di on tomato quality are complex and affected by factors such as tomato variety and soil bulk density and texture the objective of this paper is to use meta analysis to 1 investigate the effects of di on tomato quality variables and 2 study how soil texture soil bulk density and three tomato varieties affect quality variables under di compared to those under full irrigation we collected 83 research papers from around the world and analyzed 2369 data pairs overall di increased the total soluble solids 12 44 soluble sugar 11 23 organic acids 6 58 sugar acid content ratio 14 56 vitamin c 13 84 lycopene 10 46 color index 8 42 red green value 11 89 shape index 3 25 and firmness 12 09 while decreasing β carotene lightness hue angle and yellow blue value by 11 11 1 77 3 42 and 4 26 respectively in addition di had no significant effects on tomato chroma 0 89 on average 95 ci 0 96 to 2 79 or ph 0 13 on average 95 ci 0 26 to 0 52 the results indicated that it would be better to apply deficit irrigation in fine and coarse soil because most of the quality variables improved more in these soil textures than in medium soil soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 benefited taste quality vitamin c and shape index the quality of the three tomato varieties responded differently to water deficit conditions moreover cherry tomato responded better to water deficit conditions than the other two tomato varieties four quality variables improved the most in cherry tomato and two other variables were also improved our findings could help to obtain a better understanding of how fruit quality responds to di in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties and to produce higher quality tomatoes keywords tomato fruit quality deficit irrigation soil texture soil bulk density tomato varieties 1 introduction it is well known that a healthy diet is helpful in preventing chronic diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases improving energy levels and managing weight dorais et al 2008 studies have shown that tomato consumption has strong inverse relationships with the risks of certain types of cancer sesso et al 2004 stahl and sies 2005 many clinical trials and experiments have proven that tomatoes are rich in antioxidants and vitamin c which can protect humans and animals from these diseases mayne 1996 in addition tomato is a popular vegetable battilani et al 2012 with a plant world wide area of 4 76 106 ha in 2018 and a production of 182 26 106 ha faostat 2018 tomato not only helps ensure the security of global food but it is also an important source of antioxidants such as lycopene phenolic and vitamin c in human diet toor et al 2006 sustaining tomato yields and improving fruit quality are very important to support environmental sustainability and ensure human health however traditional tomato irrigation uses large amounts of water and climate change decreases the renewable surface water and groundwater resources in most dry subtropical regions intensifying competition for water demand among different social industries ipcc 2014 to solve this problem developing water saving practices is a key strategy which could improve fruit quality with acceptable yield losses deficit irrigation di is a good way to produce environmentally sustainable food and save water this method applies water below the amount of the plant s water demand as indicated by evapotranspiration et willett et al 2019 di not only has the potential to reduce water consumption chai et al 2016 kang et al 2017 but also to regulate fruit quality nuruddin et al 2003 ripoll et al 2014 the application of the di strategy has succeeded in fruit tress dos santos et al 2007 yang et al 2011 and cereals li et al 2015 talebnejad and separskhah 2015 many studies have indicated that certain water deficit could improve some quality variables such as total soluble solids and vitamin c zegbe domınguez et al 2003 ozbahce and tari 2010 lu et al 2019 water deficit in the fruit development stage could also increase the total phenolic content in tomato barbagallo et al 2013 favati et al 2009 studied the effects of irrigation management on tomato quality and observed that the accumulation of lycopene and β carotene under water deficit was higher than that without water deficit in addition certain water deficit levels were demonstrated in experiments to have the potential to improve water use efficiency agbemafle et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 although deficit irrigation has many benefits in certain tomato quality variables its effects are complex despite much studies renquist and reid 2001 marouelli and silva 2007 many factors affect tomato nutrients including variety climate light temperature soil fertilization and water status smith and hui 2004 in addition many factors alter the response of tomato to water deficit ripoll et al 2016 studied the effects of different degrees of water deficit on tomato quality and found that high levels of deficit irrigation may reduce the sugar acid and carotenoid contents wang et al 2011b indicated the water deficit period significantly affected the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato quality soil properties including chemical physical and biological properties affect water and mineral uptake by plants thus influencing tomato quality under water deficit dorais et al 2008 bogale et al 2016 studied the effects of regulated deficit irrigation on bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity in two selected tomato cultivars and the results showed that vitamin c and lycopene contents significantly increased in the matina variety but not in the cochoro variety climate is also an important factor the evaporative demand on the crop strongly influences the effects of deficit irrigation patanè et al 2011 though many studies have investigated the effects of water deficit on tomato quality many factors influence the response of tomato quality to water deficit as discussed above it is important to understand what the effects will be under water deficit in different conditions and to correctly apply a water saving strategy for a better quality tomato moreover few studies have investigated the effects of water deficit on tomato quality in different soil textures and at different soil bulk densities thus further studies that take soil properties and tomato varieties into consideration are required to obtain a better understanding of their influences on tomato quality the objective of this study was to use a meta analysis to 1 quantify the effects of water deficit on tomato quality parameters such as total soluble solids soluble sugar vitamin c lycopene firmness and color and 2 identify how different factors including soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety influenced the effects of water deficit on tomato fruit quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection data were collected through a comprehensive literature search on the isi web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for studies reporting the effects of water deficit on tomato quality published from april 1960 to october 2019 in addition a second search was performed by reading references of already downloaded articles the following key words were focused on during the whole literature search tomato quality deficit irrigation regulated deficit irrigation water stress water deficit and irrigation regime studies that reported the effects of deficit irrigation on tomato quality compared with those of a control treatment without deficit irrigation ck in pot or field experiments were selected here the di strategy mainly refers to applying water at a rate lower than the plant water demand the detailed treatments were presented in table 1 treatments were set based on an index of the following parameters crop evapotranspiration etc reference evapotranspiration etr pan evaporation ep field water capacity θf soil water suction and leaf water potential in a few papers the control treatment was irrigated according to the experience of local growers and the irrigation water needed in some papers was calculated according to a specific function the treatments presented in table 1 represent only the degree of deficit irrigation because the detail application of the di may be performed with different application times the tomato quality variables analyzed included total soluble solids tss soluble solids were discussed in some papers and we included this variable in total soluble solids soluble sugar ss organic acids oa sugar acid content ratio sar vitamin c vc lycopene β carotene color parameters lightness chroma hue angle a b a indicates green red shade b indicates blue yellow shade color index calculated following the equation color index 2000 a l a2 b2 0 5 intelmann et al 2005 shape index si firmness fn and tomato ph we classified the variables above into categories as follows 1 taste quality variables including tss ss oa and sar 2 vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene 3 external quality si and color parameters lightness chroma hue angle a and b 4 storage quality including fn and 5 tomato ph in order to analyze the factors that affected the response of tomato quality to water deficit we also collected variables including soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety according to soil taxonomy soil survey staff 2014 we classified the soil texture into three groups 1 coarse soil c including sandy loam sandy clay loam and loamy sand 2 medium soil m including clay loam silty clay loam silt and silt loam and 3 fine soil f including clay silt clay and sandy clay alameda et al 2012 found that the control treatment growth increased with soil compaction up to bulk density values of approximately 1 4 g cm 3 and then declined which showed that at low to intermediate values soil compaction could stimulate growth based on this we divided all data groups into three subgroups 1 soil bulk density values 1 4 g cm 3 2 soil bulk density values 1 2 g cm 3 1 4 g cm 3 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 and 3 soil bulk density values 1 2 g cm 3 several different tomato varieties were used in the experiments in the collected research articles but cherry tomato processing tomato and pink tomato accounted for a large proportion of the varieties if the data were classified based on the different tomato varieties some subgroup data would have come from fewer than two papers thus we only discussed the three subgroups of tomato varieties the data for the subgroups analyzed were from at least two papers otherwise the subgroup was not discussed in this paper to avoid publication bias the following criteria were used to select studies 1 at least one of the collected tomato quality variables was measured 2 how the studies carried out deficit irrigation and the control treatment were described in detail and 3 the mean value standard deviation sd and n the number of replicates for both the treatment and control groups were provided these data were needed to perform the meta analysis if there were missing data we tried to contact the authors to obtain the needed data if the data were shown in figures we extracted the data through getdata graph digitizer 2 26 http www getdatagraph digitizer com index php if the standard error se was given but the sd was not we converted the se to sd by the formula as s d s e n jian et al 2016 if the contacted authors did not answer the variances were interpolated as the coefficient of all the variances of the experimental means from the paper by multiplying by the treatment means moreover to reduce the weighting of these studies we doubled the variance jeffery et al 2017 after the searches and selection we finally used 83 papers and 2369 data pairs to analyze the effects of water deficit on tomato fruit quality as shown in table 1 most of the studies were from asia 55 42 followed by europe 32 53 north america 6 02 oceania 3 62 and africa 2 41 2 2 data analysis the meta analysis was performed in r software which is a free software environment for statistical analysis and graphics the response ratio r i was used as the measure of the effect size and was calculated by the following formula for each pair of data hedges et al 1999 r i x t x c where x t is the mean of the treatment group variables and x c is the mean of the control group variables while the value range of i 1 2 k representing the ith independent paired data the weight w i of each paired data is calculated with the following formula in the random effects model it is the weighted factor of effect size i w i 1 v i where v i is the sum of the variance among all data t 2 and the internal variance of the ith paired data v i that is v i v i t 2 the relative weight w i was calculated by the following formula and it represented the percentage of result of each paired data in the overall result w i w i i 1 k w i the whole effect size r is calculated by the following formula r i 1 k w i r i i 1 k w i in this way studies with lower variance were given greater weights to calculate r so as to increase the precision of the effect size higgins i2 statistics and the q test higgins et al 2003 were used to assess the degree of heterogeneity to indicate the variance between studies a fixed effects model was used for low heterogenous studies i2 50 and p 0 05 and a random effects model was used in the opposite situation i2 50 or p 0 05 a forest plot was generated from the pooled results in the forest plot the mean ratio response and the 95 confidence interval ci were represented by a point and bars respectively to explain the results we obtained the percentage of the change compared to the control treatment r 1 100 if the 95 ci did not overlap with zero we considered the effect size to be significantly different from the control if the 95 cis of the subgroups did not overlap we considered the effect size significantly different between subgroups 3 results 3 1 overall effect of water deficit on tomato fruit quality fig 1 shows the overall effect of water deficit on each quality variable we found water deficit significantly improved most of the quality variables except for chroma and juice ph and significantly decreased the quality variables of β carotene and hue angle lightness and b in detail water deficit significantly improved tss by 12 44 95 ci 9 92 to 15 01 according to 497 paired comparisons ss by 11 23 95 ci 8 21 to 14 34 197 paired comparisons oa by 6

comparisons for carotenoids lycopene increased by 10 46 95 ci 6 94 to 14 10 204 paired comparisons however β carotene decreased significantly by 11 11 95 ci 17 60 to 4 11 52 paired comparisons for the fruit chromatic parameters water deficit significantly increased the color index by 8 42 95 ci 6 54 to 10 33 127 paired comparisons and a value by 11 89 95 ci 7 20 to 16 79 52 paired comparisons in contrast lightness decreased by 1 77 95 ci 2 47 to 1 06 70 paired comparisons and the b value decreased by 4 26 95 ci 6 54 to 1 92 31 paired comparisons there was no significant difference in tomato chroma under water deficit 0 89 95 ci 0 96 to 2 79 the hue angle decreased significantly by 3 42 ci 4 86 to 1 96 si was increased significantly by 3 25 95 ci 1 99 to 4 53 119 paired comparisons based on 171 data pairs the storage quality fn was significantly enhanced by 12 09 95 ci 8 34 to 15 96 under water deficit water deficit had no significant effect on the tomato juice ph 0 13 95 ci 0 26 to 0 52 3 2 effects of water deficit on tomato taste quality in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties we divided the data on tss into three subgroups according to the soil texture c f and m fig 2 a shows that tss increased the most in fine soil by 30 79 compared with the increases in the other two soil texture subgroups while the 95 confidence intervals of the groups overlapped however the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of tss to water deficit as shown in fig 2 b tss increased the most by 14 67 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 95 ci 11 81 to 17 59 155 paired comparisons compared with the increase in the other two subgroups the percentage increases in tss were 7 73 95 ci 5 98 to 9 51 and 9 39 95 ci 8 26 to 10 54 in 1 2 and 1 4 g cm 3 soils respectively taking the tomato variety into consideration the tss of pink tomato increased the least by 5 32 with 70 paired comparisons this value is significantly different from the increase in tss in the other two tomato verity subgroups as fig 3 a illustrates ss increased by 14 10 and 13 32 under water deficit in coarse and medium soil respectively fig 3 b shows that ss increased more by 15 19 in soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 than in soil with a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 10 82 the response of ss to the water deficit was significantly affected by the tomato variety and the ss of cherry tomato increased the most by 19 13 under water deficit ss increased by 14 08 in pink tomato and by 13 34 in processing tomato as shown in fig 4 a there was no change in the oa level in coarse soil 95 ci 1 20 to 9 37 under water deficit while it significantly increased by 9 86 in fine soil 95 ci 3 62 to 16 47 19 paired comparisons and by 8 02 in medium soil 95 ci 5 53 to 10 58 174 paired comparisons fig 4 b indicates that soil bulk density influenced the oa response to water deficit oa significantly increased by 8 58 in 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density soil and by 7 04 in 1 2 g cm 3 bulk density soil with 125 and 15 paired comparisons respectively while it did not change in the other subgroup 95 ci 3 62 to 7 51 the response of oa to water deficit differed among tomato varieties fig 4 c with increases of 11 92 95 ci 8 08 to 15 91 7 25 95 ci 3 32 to 11 34 and no change 95 ci 4 06 to 9 32 in cherry tomato processing tomato and pink tomato respectively both soil texture and bulk density had significant effects on tomato sar under water deficit as shown in fig 5 while tomato variety did not as shown in fig 5 a sar increased significantly more in coarse soil 29 42 95 ci 20 91 to 38 54 than in medium soil 9 18 95 ci 5 94 to 12 51 under water deficit fig 5 b shows that the percent increase in sar was higher in soil with bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 35 78 95 ci 24 15 to 48 51 than in soil with a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 6 51 95 ci 4 97 to 8 07 the percentage increases in sar were 11 44 12 38 and 4 27 in cherry tomato pink tomato and processing tomato respectively as shown in fig 5 c 3 3 effects of water deficit on tomato vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties vc was improved more by a water deficit in coarse soil than in medium soil with increase percentages of 18 29 and 15 51 respectively as shown in fig 6 a the increase in vc was 0 62 higher fig 6 b in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 11 85 95 ci 7 37 to 16 52 than that in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 11 23 95 ci 8 52 to 14 02 though soil texture and bulk density affected the response of vc to water deficit the 95 confidence intervals overlapped vc increased the most by 23 77 95 ci 16 57 to 31 42 in pink tomato followed by cherry tomato 5 35 95 ci 0 02 to 10 97 and processing tomato 3 97 95 ci 1 91 to 6 07 moreover the effects of the water deficit in pink tomato were significantly different from those in cherry tomato and processing tomato fig 6 c lycopene increased more by 20 76 in medium soil than in coarse soil 9 46 fig 7 a while the 95 confidence for the two soil types intervals overlapped water deficit significantly increased lycopene in soil with a bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 17 84 95 ci 13 52 to 22 32 but not in soil with a bulk density 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 0 71 95 ci 5 15 to 9 39 the increase in lycopene in pink tomato under water deficit 39 28 was significantly higher 95 ci 23 97 to 56 48 than that of the other two tomato varieties fig 7 c the percentage increase in lycopene in processing tomato was 17 32 95 ci 13 59 to 21 16 however lycopene in cherry tomato did not change under water deficit 15 57 95 ci 11 41 to 50 76 water deficit had no effects on β carotene in the processing tomato subgroup 3 24 ci 4 87 to 12 04 while it improved β carotene in the cherry tomato subgroup by 10 68 95 ci 3 04 to 18 88 as shown in fig 8 3 4 effects of water deficit on external tomato quality including chromatic parameters and shape index in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties as fig 9 a shows the color index increased more in coarse soil than in medium soil by 5 68 and 4 12 respectively the effects of water deficit on the color index in soil with a bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 were significantly different from those in the other subgroups fig 9 b the increased percentages were 9 85 95 ci 5 73 to 14 14 and 3 21 95 ci 2 09 to 4 34 in the two soil bulk density subgroups respectively the color index of pink tomato increased the least and the increase was 2 89 95 ci 1 80 to 3 99 fig 9 c the color index increased significantly by 3 28 95 ci 1 84 to 4 75 in processing tomato the effects of water deficit on tomato hue angle in the different tomato variety groups are shown in fig 10 there was no statistically significant difference in the change in the hue angle of cherry tomato and processing tomato water deficit decreased the hue angle in cherry tomato by 3 11 and that in processing tomato by 3 81 due to the insufficient data of hue angle in different soil textures and soil bulk densities we could not analyze the effects of water deficit on hue angle in these subgroups fig 11 indicates that the soil texture and bulk density significantly affected the response of si to water deficit si increased in coarse soil by 7 30 95 ci 4 44 to 10 23 but did not change in the medium soil 0 20 95 ci 0 93 to 0 54 as shown in fig 11 a similar results for si are exhibited in fig 11 b with an increase of 8 91 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 95 ci 6 05 to 11 85 and no change in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density 0 56 95 ci 1 49 to 0 37 3 5 effects of water deficit on tomato storage quality in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties fig 12 a indicates that the soil texture influenced the response of fn to water deficit the increase in fn under water deficit was higher in coarse soil than in medium soil and it was 9 30 95 ci 6 06 to 12 64 in coarse soil and 3 19 ci 1 39 to 5 02 in medium soil there was no difference in the fn response to water deficit among the bulk density subgroups fig 12 b fn increased by 5 59 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density and 4 97 in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density there was no change in the fn of cherry tomato 95 ci 2 08 to 9 56 shown in fig 12 c the fn of pink tomato increased by 5 54 under water deficit 95 ci 2 87 to 8 27 and the fn of processing tomato increased by 7 89 under water deficit 95 ci 4 06 to 11 86 3 6 effects of water deficit on tomato ph in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties there was no change in tomato ph under water deficit in coarse soil 95 ci 0 51 to 1 55 fine soil 95 ci 0 38 to 0 58 or medium soil 95 ci 0 57 to 0 07 however the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of ph to water deficit fig 13 b tomato ph increased by 2 87 95 ci 1 47 to 4 29 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density but did not change in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 0 19 95 ci 0 53 to 0 14 or 1 2 g cm 3 bulk density 0 84 95 ci 1 88 to 0 22 4 discussion 4 1 water deficit influence on tomato taste quality variables since tomato is known as nutrient rich healthy crop that has a high water demand patanè et al 2011 it is important to determine an effective method to improve tomato quality and save water deficit irrigation has been indicated to have beneficial effects on tomato fruit quality with little decrease in yield ripoll et al 2014 as one of the most important tomato fruit quality variables tss indicates the proportion of dissolved solids in a solution which includes approximately 65 sugars sucrose and hexoses 13 acids citrate and malate and 12 other minor components phenols amino acids soluble pectins ascorbic acid and minerals in the tomato fruit pulp balibrea et al 2006 kader 2008 in our study the results demonstrated that deficit irrigation could significantly increase tss by 12 44 which was in an agreement with previous studies reporting that soluble solids were higher in deficit treatments than in control treatments wang et al 2015 patanè and cosentino 2010 the reason why tomato obtained higher soluble solids under deficit irrigation was that the decrease of water uptake into tomato led to higher solute concentration renquist and reid 2001 fruit taste is mainly determined by the soluble sugar organic acid and sugar acid content ratio kader 2008 ss increased significantly by 11 23 under water deficit and the same result was obtained by jiang and zhao 2019 mitchell et al 1991 revealed that increased water stress decreased water uptake in tomato fruit and increased the concentration of solutes in the sap thus increasing the sugars in the fruit there was a significant 6 58 increase in oa under deficit irrigation this finding was supported by kumar et al 2015 while there was a decrease in tomato acidity in the study of jiang and zhao 2019 this discrepancy may be because tomato acidity depends not only on growth conditions but also on cultural practices and varieties previous studies shao et al 2016 keabetswe et al 2019 observed an increase in sar under deficit irrigation which was similar to our result of an increase of 14 56 in sar achieving the best flavor in tomato requires high sugar concentrations and relatively high acid concentrations hao et al 2019 in our study under deficit irrigation both oa and ss were increased and ss was increased more than oa in our study leading to an increase in sar this suggests that deficit irrigation may improve tomato flavor although deficit irrigation may improve tomato quality its effects varied with various factors such as deficit irrigation application time severity of water deficit tomato variety soil texture and soil bulk density generally deficit irrigation increased the quality variables including tss ss and sar more in coarse soil than in medium soil in this study apart from that tss and oa increased more in fine soil than in coarse soil however the soil texture had no significant effects on the response of these four quality variables to water deficit except for sar the reason for the largest improvement of fruit quality in fine soil may be that there was enough time for the fine soil to adjust to low soil water matric potential and therefore the quality variables were not easily or rapidly influenced adu et al 2018 kirda 2002 the water leakage of the coarse soil was the highest among three soil textures leading to less water uptake by the fruit and more solute concentration however due to the highest water leakage in coarse soil tomato plants could not absorb more nutrients which are essential for growth and resulting in a worse fruit quality at the end the quality of tomatoes grown in medium soil was worse than that in coarse soil comparing to coarse soil the water leakage in medium soil was less and resulting in fewer solute concentration than those in coarse soil but the adjusting capacity to low water matric potential was better in medium soil than in coarse soil we analyzed the percentage of soil bulk density in each soil texture subgroup and found that the percentage of soil bulk density over 1 4 g cm 3 was the largest than the other two bulk density soil in medium soil and the percentage of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density soil was fewer by 6 83 and 13 38 in coarse soil than in medium soil in all the paired data about tss and ss respectively the results showed that the medium soil was more compacted in our study therefore causing bad soil aeration which may reduce photosynthetic activity and sugar metabolizing enzyme activities ozaki et al 2009 and a higher bulk density could limit root growth which was not good for roots to absorb nutrients this may explain why fruit taste quality improved less in medium soil than in coarse soil though the adjusting capacity to low water matric potential was better in medium soil than in coarse soil in some condition additional variables and interacting factors including tomato variety soil bulk density may confound counteract the effect of one single variable de pascale et al 2015 observed that tomato fruit sugar content was affected by soil texture and the fruit sugar content increased more in clayey soil medium soil than in sandy soil coarse soil this was a little inconsistent with our results and that was because soil texture treatments were combined with n fertilization treatments and farming systems in their study they did not combine soil texture treatments with deficit irrigation treatments the soil bulk density significantly affected the response of tss and sar to water deficit moreover fruit quality was improved more in soil at 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than that in soil at 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the reason may be that high soil compaction could limit the tomato root growth thus affecting whole plant growth the results were similar to those of a previous study tubeileh et al 2003 indicating that high soil compaction could limit the growth distribution and absorption capacity of maize roots the tomato variety also had effects on the quality variables under deficit irrigation it had significant effects on tss and oa under water deficit but not on ss or sar moreover the general trends of the tss and oa variables were similar in general cherry tomato improved the most under water deficit followed by processing tomato and pink tomato these results are the same as those in the study of fullana pericàs et al 2019 which reported that the tss and oa of cherry tomato were improved more than those of processing tomato the fruit quality varied not only between crops but also between varieties bertin et al 2000 4 2 water deficit influence on tomato vc and carotenoids lycopene and β carotene tomato produces health giving secondary metabolites such as vc lycopene and β carotene tohge et al 2014 these compounds can decrease the death rate of certain cancers and cardiovascular disease carr and frei 1999 vc increased by 13 84 under deficit irrigation in our study many studies indicated that water deficit could increase vc in tomato fruit dumas et al 2003 patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2014 water deficit decreased foliage development leading to increasing fruit sunlight exposure and hence more vc accumulated massot et al 2010 lycopene accounts for 80 90 of the total carotenoids krumbein et al 2006 which has anti carcinogenic and anti atherogenic potential singh and goyal 2008 biddle et al 2013 moreover lycopene increased by 10 46 under water deficit for the same reason as vc toor et al 2006 while both vc and lycopene were significantly increased by deficit irrigation β carotene was significantly decreased the results were contradictory compared with those of bogale et al 2016 we analyzed the results of the 6 collected papers deeply and found 21 data pairs from one paper schweiggert et al 2017 with a relative weight of 41 3 moreover most results of this paper showed that water deficit had a significantly negative effect on β carotene considering the publication bias we calculated the results again excluding this paper and the effects of deficit irrigation on β carotene changed and were not significant 2 00 ci 10 00 to 7 00 the effect of deficit irrigation on β carotene was not significant in each collected paper except in the paper of bogale et al 2016 because more than one tomato variety was used in some papers thus the response of β carotene to water deficit needs to be analyzed deeply in future studies coyago cruz et al 2017 confirmed that β carotene was strongly affected by the treatments and the tomato variety the effects of soil texture on vc were the same as those on ss under water deficit vc increased by 2 78 more in coarse soil than in medium soil the reason why vc was improved more in coarse soil than in medium soil may be that the capacity of coarse soil to hold water and nutrients was poorer than that of medium soil thus decreasing foliage development more increasing fruit exposure to sunlight and vc accumulation like soil texture soil bulk density affected the response of vc to water deficit without statistical significance but water deficit improved vc more in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density there were studies observingthat moderate bulk densities could enhance root growth hamza and anderson 2005 tracy et al 2012 if the soil bulk density increased the soil became more compacted and would limit root growth bengough et al 2006 however roots are important for plants to absorb water and nutrients from soil and transport them to the parts aboveground roots growth was worse in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with bulk density between 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 thus plant absorbed fewer nutrients and transported less photoassimilate in soil with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 cao et al 2005 pointed out that the absorption of beneficial microelements from soil by roots were helpful to improve tomato vc that was why tomato vc was improved less in soil with bulk density 1 4 g cm 3 moreover porosity was low in high bulk density soil resulting in bad soil aeration arthur et al 2012 it may cause root hypoxia horchani et al 2008 proved that root hypoxia could reduce the induction of most genes in their biosynthesis pathways and then limit ascorbate vc accumulation in fruits in addition vc cotent was determined by the season the nutrients available and the environment davies and hobson 1981 in contrast lycopene increased less in coarse soil than in medium soil with a significant difference of 11 30 in addition the effects of soil bulk density on lycopene were different from those on vc under water deficit lycopene was significantly increased by 17 84 in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density while it did not change in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the difference between lycopene and vc under water deficit may indicate that lycopene was more affected by the tomato variety moreover lahoz et al 2016 indicated that lycopene was strongly influenced by genotype with minor modifications by the irrigation and year effects the tomato variety had significant effects on the response of vc and lycopene to water deficit but not on β carotene the vc of pink tomato was improved more than that of cherry tomato and processing tomato showed the least improvement bogale et al 2016 reported that deficit irrigation had various effects on vc depending on the cultivar lycopene of pink tomato was significantly improved more than that of processing tomato while there were no significant effects on the lycopene of cherry tomato no significant effects on the lycopene of cherry tomato were found because some papers indicated that water stress could increase lycopene in cherry tomatoes pernice et al 2010 wang et al 2011b but some showed contrasting results sánchez rodríguez et al 2012 the β carotene of cherry tomato increased significantly by 10 68 under deficit irrigation but the β carotene content did not significantly increase in processing tomato the variation in carotenoid accumulation among varieties under water deficit could be due to the differential regulation or abundance of the enzymes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis othman et al 2014 4 3 water deficit influence on the external quality of tomato including chromatic parameters and shape index lightness decreased by 1 77 under water deficit this result was the same as that in a previous study cantore et al 2016 barbagallo et al 2013 the hue angle decreased by 3 42 under water deficit which expressed the color intensity purity lower values of lightness and hue angle factually meant fruits darker redder and more mature champa et al 2015 these results were consistent with results of parameters of a value and lycopene and all of these parameters were relevant with a redder tomato water deficit had no significant effects on chroma this may be because the tomato varieties were different among the collected papers resulting in different responses to water deficit the a value is a good parameter for indicating red color development and the degree of ripening in tomato while the b parameter shows yellow discoloration artés et al 1999 the value of a significantly increased by 11 89 while the value of b significantly decreased by 4 26 under water deficit this was also reported in previous studies pulupol et al 1996 zegbe domınguez et al 2003 the increased a value and decreased b value increased the color index as one of the external qualities that are important to consumers the color index increased by 8 42 under water deficit consistent with a previous study shao et al 2015 this was because water deficit increased the tomato ethylene content leading to an increase in lycopene and carotenoid concentrations thus making the pericarp of the tomato fruit redder basiouny et al 1994 as another important external quality si increased by 3 25 under water deficit the results were the same as those of a previous study reporting that the effects of water deficit on fruit si were significant in the third bunch of fruits hao et al 2019 other studies shao et al 2015 jiang and zhao 2019 found that there was a nonsignificant increase in fruit si compared with that under no water stress the response of the hue angle to water deficit was similar in cherry tomato and processing tomato which indicated that the effects of water deficit on tomato hue angle did not differ among varieties the color index in different soil texture subgroups had the opposite response to water deficit as the different soil bulk density subgroups because the color index response was significantly different among soil bulk density subgroups but not among soil texture subgroups the color index was enhanced more under water deficit in coarse soil than in medium soil and increased more in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density the varieties had effects on the response of color index to water deficit without statistical significance and the color index increased more in processing tomato than in pink tomato the external fruit color was relative to the lycopene content in fruits helyes et al 2006 this could explain why the color index had a similar response as the lycopene to soil texture and soil bulk density under water deficit nevertheless there were differences among the varieties the si response to water deficit was affected by soil properties because si increased significantly in coarse soil and in soil of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 while it decreased no significantly in medium soil and in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 this could be explained by the fact that si was affected by environmental growing conditions white et al 2000 4 4 water deficit influence on storage quality of tomato a high fn value is desirable to both growers and consumers because it allows for a longer storage duration shewfelt 2000 in our study fn increased by 12 09 which was in an agreement with previous results patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2014 the increase in fn under deficit irrigation may be due to a decrease in internal turgor leading to lower pressure on the cell walls and higher epidermal elasticity guichard et al 2001 fn responded to the water deficit significantly differently among soil texture subgroups fn was improved by 9 30 and 3 19 in coarse and medium soil respectively although bulk density had no significant effects on fn fn was slightly higher in soil with 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil with 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density by 0 62 there was no significant difference in fn among the three tomato varieties the fn of pink tomato and processing tomato significantly increased by 5 54 and 7 89 respectively under deficit irrigation in contrast cherry tomato was not significantly influenced by the water deficit the different responses of fn to soil and varieties indicated that fn under water deficit was affected not only by soil properties but also by environmental factors e g temperature and light intensity in addition a previous study reported that fn was related to the maturity stage zheng et al 2013 4 5 water deficit influence on tomato ph tomato ph is important because it affects the thermal processing conditions applied in industrial tomato processing to produce safe products in our study water deficit had no significant effect on ph this result was consistent with that in previous studies tüzel et al 1994 hanson et al 2006 the ph response to water deficit in different soil textures was different from that in soils with different bulk densities water deficit had no significant effect on tomato juice ph in coarse medium and fine soil however the tomato ph was significantly increased by deficit irrigation in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density but not in the rest of the bulk density subgroups the ph response was insignificant in most soil texture and bulk density subgroups because ph depended on cultural practices growing location seasonal variations and so on favati et al 2009 for example a previous study garcia and barrett 2006 observed that the effect of the growing season on ph was clear 4 6 limitations of the current study this study investigated the response of 12 tomato quality variables to water deficit in different soil textures and bulk densities and tomato varieties however due to insufficient data when fewer than two papers were available the effects of these three factors on the response of tomato quality to water deficit could not be analyzed in some cases future studies could investigate the effects of these three factors on the responses of tomato chromatic quality including chroma lightness a and b to water deficit moreover the response of β carotene to water deficit with different soil textures and bulk densities could be studied data on si and ph under water deficit in different tomato varieties are limited and need to be investigated in our study there were many tomato varieties but not every tomato variety was analyzed because data on some varieties were collected from only one published paper and there was no unified standard for dividing all the data into categories we only investigated the responses of pink tomato processing tomato and cherry tomato quality to water deficit these categories were studied more often than others among the collected literature this study discussed the effects of water deficit on tomato quality considering soil texture soil bulk density and tomato variety however there are other factors such as the timing and intensity of deficit application that affect the results hou et al 2020 moreover environmental conditions and fertilizers can influence the effects of water deficit on quality future research can consider more factors and characterize the effects of their interactions on tomato quality moreover there have been few studies on the effects of water deficit on tomato quality that consider soil properties such as ph thus these aspects could be explored more deeply for example wang et al 2020 performed a meta analysis to evaluate how climate affected the response of crop yield to controlled drainage so that the climate could be considered in future studies about the effects of water deficit on tomato quality gao et al 2020 analyzed the effects of biochar application on crop water use efficiency combined with the n application rate 5 conclusions numerous studies have shown that water deficit can improve tomato quality however it is known that many factors affect the response of tomato quality to water deficit previous studies have addressed the effects of water deficit severity and time on the response of tomato quality to water deficit but few studies have investigated the effects of soil texture and bulk density on the response of tomato quality to water deficit our work provides a quantitative analysis of the current literature available to investigate the effects of water deficit on tomato quality in different soil textures soil bulk densities and tomato varieties overall water deficit significantly improved most of the quality variables tss ss oa sar vc lycopene color index a si fn decreased four variables β carotene lightness hue angle b and had no significant effect on chroma or tomato ph deficit irrigation increased tss ss oa sar vc lycopene color index a si and fn by 12 44 11 23 6 58 14 56 13 84 10 46 8 42 11 89 3 25 and 12 09 respectively deficit irrigation decreased β carotene lightness hue angle and b by 11 11 1 77 3 42 and 4 26 respectively although some quality variables sar si and fn responded significantly differently to water deficit in different soil textures the rest of the quality variables did not and most of the quality variables had better values in coarse soil than in medium soil and reached their best values in fine soil except for oa lycopene color index fn and ph the other quality variables were better in soil of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density than in soil of 1 4 g cm 3 bulk density tomato quality showed different responses to water deficit among varieties for tss and oa cherry tomato improved the most followed by processing tomato and pink tomato for ss cherry tomato improved the most followed by pink tomato and processing tomato for sar and vc pink tomato improved the most followed by cherry tomato and processing tomato there was no significant effect on lycopene or fn in cherry tomato under water deficit and lycopene was improved more in pink tomato than in processing tomato fn showed the opposite result β carotene was significantly improved by water deficit in cherry tomato but not in processing tomato the tomato hue angle responded similarly to water deficit in cherry tomato and processing tomato the color index an important tomato color parameter was improved more in processing tomato than in pink tomato but the changes in color index in two tomato varieties were not significantly different the results showed that water deficit can be a potential strategy for improving tomato fruit quality while also saving water in general water deficit resulted in redder firmer and better tasting tomatoes with more vc and lycopene compared to well irrigated tomatoes it would be better to apply deficit irrigation in fine and coarse soil because most of the quality variables were improved more in these soil types than in medium soil soil with a bulk density of 1 2 1 4 g cm 3 was good for the improvement of taste quality variables vc and si but not for the other quality variables moreover cherry tomato had a better response to water deficit than the other two tomato varieties for four quality variables improved the most in cherry tomato and two other variables also improved declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exits in the submission of this manuscript and manuscript is approved

10374,irrigation water is crucial for farm operations in the world with irrigated lands contributing about 40 to food and fiber production in semi arid regions such as the southwestern united states the demand for irrigation water has increased due to population growth rising temperatures and severe drought events in the region irrigation plays a vital role in the economies of southwestern states and requires comparative studies to understand the current situation and to propose possible improvement strategies this study investigated the trend of irrigated cropland the quantity of irrigation water use irrigation technology scheduling decisions and irrigation outreach using data from 2007 and 2017 united states department of agriculture usda national agriculture statistics service nass census harvested cropland in the region remained the same with minimal increase in total irrigated land 1 and the quantity of irrigated water used 2 however gravity irrigation methods reduced significantly by 12 with a 71 increase in the use of drip irrigation systems the increase in the adoption of soil moisture sensors 55 plant sensors 107 government schedules 29 and supplier s schedules 50 for irrigation scheduling decisions did not translate to a reduction in irrigation water use at the regional level however at the state level within the same period arizona recorded an increase in irrigated cropland by 10 and harvested cropland by 9 with a reduction in the quantity of irrigation water used 5 the gains in arizona could be associated with the combined effects of improved irrigation technologies and the use of best management decisions which could serve as a model for prudent water use in the southwest there is a need to increase the effort in science based education and extension programming on integrated approaches that emphasize both irrigation technology and the best management practices which include seed selection for drought tolerant crops keywords irrigation water harvested cropland best management practice sprinklers and drip systems 1 introduction irrigated farmlands provide about 40 of food and fiber used in the world with increasing demand for irrigated acreage due to climate variabilities and rising food demands of the growing population evans and sadler 2008 drought spells and rising temperatures are occurring especially in semi arid and arid regions of the southwestern united states where annual evaporation and transpiration exceed the rainfall southwest is the hottest part of the nation usgcrp 2014 the united states environmental protection agency epa in 2014 reported average temperatures in the southwest increased by 2 f 1 12 c from 2000 2013 relative to the long term average from 1895 2013 us epa 2014 and 2017 the over allocation of surface waters and the 20 year long droughts have affected the colorado river watershed usgcrp 2014 which is a major source of water supply for the southwest the prolonged continuous droughts and over allocation of the river waters may lead to an official water shortage declaration in most of the southwestern states though a state like arizona has a great history of robust innovative groundwater regulation such a declaration may affect irrigation water supply with potential pressure on groundwater withdrawal and likely increases in prices of water rights and farm produce lahmers and eden 2018 irrigation is a crucial component for crop production in the southwest especially in states like arizona where more than 90 of croplands are irrigated with about 74 of the total water used in arizona going into agriculture arizona department of water resources 2020 crop production contributes significantly to the economies in the southwest hence the need to understand advances made in irrigation water use for crop productions in terms of irrigation technology and best management practices bmp which includes drough tolerant seeds selection for prudent water management according to carey and zilberman 2002 genius et al 2014 developing intensive extension and educational programs on irrigation could give producers the right information to transition from unsustainable traditional irrigation practices to smart irrigation technology that may lead to water saving in agriculture studies have shown that reducing water withdrawals as a result of smart water use systems in agriculture could increase water supply for other uses such as municipal and environmental applications ward and pulido velazquez 2008 rockström et al 2007 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 hussain et al 2007 which could be a great strategy in mitigating water shortages based on this assumption we asked the question could the adoption of smarter irrigation methods in the southwest reduce total irrigation water use in agriculture thus increasing water availability for other purposes such as municipal and environmental applications without compromising field crop yields this study aimed to elucidate a decade of trends of irrigation water use irrigation technology and irrigation outreach programs in the southwest using the united states department of agriculture usda census data of 2007 and 2017 in a comparative approach the study hypothesized no differences in irrigation water use irrigation technology and irrigation outreach programs in the southwestern states between 2007 and 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area demographics and precipitation pattern in 2007 and 2017 the locations selected for the study within the southwestern usa include arizona az california ca nevada ne new mexico nm colorado co and utah ut fig 1 the number of farms average farm size and significant crops grown in the southwest are represented in table 1 based on precipitation ranking pattern in the usa arizona recorded below average in 2017 which is a reduction from near average in 2007 while ut co and nm registered near average in both years however ca and nv recorded above average in 2017 which is an improvement from below average in nv and much below average in ca in 2007 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa annual report 2007 and 2017 2 2 data collection the usda agriculture census data 2007 and 2017 were obtained online at www nass usda gov surveys guide to nass surveys farm and ranch irrigation index php for the study data were collected for the following parameters irrigated lands harvested irrigated land the quantity of water used types of irrigation methods for water delivery sources of irrigation information to farmers and ranchers and methods used to decide irrigation schedules usda nass 2008 2013 2018 2 3 data analysis the years 2007 and 2017 represented the main treatments while the states arizona az california ca nevada ne new mexico nm colorado co and utah ut were used as the replicates a t test was then performed in a pairwise comparison assuming equal variance at p 0 05 using 2007 data as the baseline percentage changes were calculated using the 2007 and 2017 data points in the formula reported by mpanga et al 2020 below to understand the trend of selected parameters δ y 2 y 1 y 1 100 where δ percentage change y1 2007 data and y2 2017 data 2 4 study limitations some limitations of the study included missing or withheld data from the usda for privacy reasons however it did not limit the ability to address the study objective 3 results 3 1 harvested irrigated cropland in the southwest from 2007 to 2017 harvested irrigated croplands recorded no significant changes from 2007 to 2017 in the southwest however quantitatively at the state levels increases were recorded in arizona 9 california 6 nevada 7 and utah 5 with reductions in new mexico and colorado at 21 and 15 respectively with no statistical difference in any of the categories at the regional level fig 2 california was the highest producer of crops with a yearly average of 2 832 799 hectares in the region followed by colorado with about 1 011 714 hectares in comparison the remaining four states az ne nm and ut were below 404 685 hectares each fig 2 3 2 total irrigated cropland and quantity of water used in the southwest from 2007 to 2017 the total irrigated cropland in the southwest increased marginally by 1 from 2007 to 2017 with no significant difference at the state level increases were recorded in az 10 ca 7 ne 15 and ut 3 while nm and co decreased by 25 and 14 respectively with no statistical differences at p 0 05 between 2007 and 2017 fig 3 a the result in fig 3a is consistent with harvested cropland in fig 2 the quantity of water used however decreased in most of the states az 5 nm 29 co 15 ut 4 except ca and ne which increased by 8 and 34 respectively with a 2 increase at the regional level fig 3b arizona and utah showed water saving by 5 and 4 with gains in irrigated cropland by 10 and 3 respectively without statistical differences fig 3 a b 3 3 irrigation methods for water distribution the usda census reported data on the types of water distribution systems such as gravity sprinkler and drip irrigation systems for 2007 and 2017 usda nass 2008 and 2018 according to fig 4 at the regional level the use of gravity as an irrigation water delivery system in the southwest reduced significantly by 12 p 0 05 and sprinklers by 8 from 2007 to 2017 the use of drip trickle and low flow micro sprinklers increased by 71 but with no statistical difference at p 0 05 fig 4a which could be due to the high variability in the measured values at the state level there was 71 increase in the use of drip irrigation systems for water delivery from 2007 to 2017 at the regional level by az ca ne and ut with ne and ut contributing the most 45 74 431 and 187 respectively to the increase in the use of drip systems in the southwest fig 4b the reasons for these increases in the use of drip systems could relate to associated benefits such as cost savings for irrigation water sustainable of water use potential yield increase and other advantages such as reduction in weed pressure and soil bone diseases thompson et al 2009 3 4 methods used in making irrigation scheduling decisions at the regional level the use of any method for irrigation scheduling decisions was most familiar with about 80 000 farms followed by conditions of the crop with 60 000 farms how soil feels with 30 000 farms while the rest of the methods together made up less than 20 000 farms with the use of computer simulation the least used in the region fig 5 a comparing 2007 and 2017 data irrigation scheduling by plant sensing methods increased by 107 while scheduling by soil moisture sensors increased by 55 across the states although the use of both methods are still relatively low when compared to other scheduling methods fig 5a decisions based on information from government and the water supplier schedules increased by 29 and 50 with minimal increases in any method and conditions of crops fig 5a but no reported statistical difference in all at p 0 05 the regional increases in the use of techniques such as soil moisture and plant sensors commercial or government schedules and water supplier companies were influenced by az ne and nm states with either negative or very minimal contributions from ca co and ut fig 5b there were decreases in the use of methods such as soil feel 10 personal calendar 12 computer simulations 50 and when the neighbors start irrigating 10 fig 5a 3 5 irrigation information sources to farmers on how to reduce irrigation costs and conserve water all outreach programs including university extension state and federal agencies private and media report as sources of information for growers on how to minimize irrigation cost and conserve water declined between 2007 and 2017 except for the electronic information services such as internet sources which increased by 38 during the same time period table 2 4 discussions this study focused on irrigation practices in crops within the southwest of the united states with comparative analysis of 2007 and 2017 usda census of agriculture data across the region of southwest there was no increase in harvested irrigated cropland while total irrigated lands increased by 1 the quantity of irrigated water also increased by 2 with no significant differences at the state level az could serve as a model for irrigation water use improvement where the quantity of irrigated water decreased 5 fig 3b while the irrigated and harvested cropland increased by 9 and 10 respectively figs 3a and 2 even under a worse precipitation condition in 2017 compared to 2007 noaa 2007 and 2017 the increased efficiency was probably due to the combined effect of irrigation technology and best management practices figs 4a b and 5b as discussed below in fig 6 4 1 southwest precipitation ranking and irrigation water use in 2007 and 2017 the precipitation pattern did not seem to reduce the amount of irrigation water use in the southwest for example the quantity of irrigation water use reduced in az nm ut and co from 2007 to 2017 while there was an increase in ca and nv fig 3b however precipitation ranking in az reduced from 2007 to 2017 ca and nv recorded a rise in precipitation ranking while ut co and nm remained relatively the same in both years noaa 2007and 2017 though the precipitation events did now seem to reduce the amount of water use in the region they play a vital role in refilling the water table after withdrawals gardner and heilweil 2009 in some cases farmers may not have the technology and technical irrigation information that will help them understand and adjust irrigation systems to reduce watering during rainfall days the number of farmers using soil moisture and plant sensors in making irrigation scheduling decisions compared to other methods fig 5a is a clear evidence that fields could still be irrigated sooner than expected after precipitation events since most farmers are not using any quantitative method for establishing soil and crop conditions prior to irrigation water application on the other hand the increase in precipitation events in the ca and ne could be the driving force behind the increase in the irrigation water use for both states due to more water availability unfortunately the increases in the irrigation water use did not translate into increase in harvested cropland in those two states compared to what was observed in arizona and utah therefore understanding the trends in irrigation technology use best management practices and irrigation outreach programs is required to support decisions and policy on sustainable irrigation water use in the southwest 4 2 irrigation technology growers increased acreage under more efficient systems such as drip subsurface and micro irrigations fig 4a and b in fig 4 drip irrigation increased by 71 with significant reduction in gravity methods over the study period this demonstrates farmers efforts in sustainable water use by transitioning to modern and smart irrigation technologies micro drip subsurface drip and pipes reduce water losses to surface evaporation and deliver water by target applications to the plants this finding is in line with the study by lahmers and eden 2018 which reported that the southwest of u s made improvements in water use efficiency through improved irrigation technologies disadvantages of these irrigation systems compared to open ditches include the initial cost of installation labor and maintenance fig 6 technologies such as sensors and computer simulations could reduce delivery waste and on farm leakages as farmers are now able to deliver water to crops through precision scheduling fig 5a b arizona department of water resources 2020 fan et al 2018 generally irrigation water use efficiencies are much higher with subsurface drip systems than the furrow irrigation method encisco et al 2015 mansour 2015 and mansour et al 2016 transitioning to a more efficient irrigation system will become more pivotal in the southwestern region as the impacts of climate change becomes more severe fuller and harhay 2010 thompson et al 2009 highlighted the potential of subsurface drip irrigation as a potential solution to the problem of low water use efficiency in the southwest the authors also highlighted other added benefits of the subsurface drip systems including reduced nitrate leaching into the groundwater higher crop yields better weed control crop health fig 6 and flexibility in harvesting specialty crops all these benefits will improve the bottom line of farmers in the region as mentioned earlier installation costs could be a major drawback to the adaptation of these more efficient irrigation methods this issue could be addressed through the provision of credit facilities to help farmers in the region with the installation of more efficient irrigation systems and by governmental policies that prohibit inefficient irrigation methods such as flood irrigation currently prevalent in the southwestern states 4 3 best management practices the method used in making irrigation scheduling decisions play a vital role in making sure the right amount of water is delivered at the right time using the appropriate method in fig 5b the use of sensors and computer simulations were more prevalent in arizona which could be a contributing factor to the water use efficiencies observed in the state which has also been reported by yadav et al 2020 in a technical report with vegetable production in california other best management practices introduced through agricultural water conservation include canal lining laser leveling technology level basin irrigations sprinkler irrigation drip or trickle irrigation and tailwater re use systems agronomic practices such as crop rotations also considered as best management practices contribute to higher water use efficiency huang et al 2003 mpanga et al 2020 reported increases in sustainable practices such as conservation agriculture no till cover cropping and reduced tillage in arizona could also have contributed to higher water use efficiencies recorded in the state these practices reduce runoff improve soil structure for higher water holding capacity and reduce water evaporation from the soil surface hatfield and dold 2019 reported that depending on climate and soil conditions cultural practices such as mulching row spacing crop rotation mixed cropping and agroforestry strategies could increase water use efficiency land fallowing could also be used as a conservation strategy land fallowing of 1 500 acres was tested in 2014 at the yuma mesa irrigation and drainage district in arizona and this led to savings of about 7 000 acre feet per year of colorado river water lahmers and eden 2018 crops with higher water use efficiency could be one of the contributing factors to an increase in harvested cropland and a decrease in water use from 2007 to 2017 in arizona for example nut crop production has been on the rise with changes from flood to micro irrigation systems in arizona alternative crops with higher water use efficiencies such as industrial hemp cannabis sativa or guayule parthenium argentatum are being promoted hemp could partially replace cotton for fiber production if the demand for hemp fiber emerges while guayule is a desert adapted industrial crop that produces rubber for manufacturing tires lahmers and eden 2018 the genetic traits crop species and variety selections could be another best management practice that can increase water use efficiency in the southwest hatfield and dold 2019 breeding techniques such as improving root architecture to access subsoil water and early vigor for rapid soil surface cover will improve water use efficiencies condon 2020 for example barley cultivars requiring either low or high irrigation input were grown in arizona under regular and deficit irrigation the low irrigation types performed better under drought because of early vigor and flowering more significant root growth at lower soil depth and more effective water use during the grain filling stage carter et al 2019 at the plant cell level osmotic adjustment is the main drought responsive trait that prevents cellular dehydration under drought stress apart from developmental and phenological attributes blum 2005 therefore species and variety selection are critical to achieving water use efficiency and increased yields under dry conditions such as in the southwest 4 4 outreach and educational programs to growers in most cases growers need frequent and consistent information and extension service delivery in comprehensive formats on new technologies and practices that can reduce irrigation costs and conserve water this aspect is very critical for the successful introduction of innovations to growers for adoption according to table 2 agricultural extension efforts have reduced over time in the southwest leaving farmers to depend more on internet links for their irrigation and water conservation information however internet sources in many cases may not provide reliable and credible scientific support for the farmers according to levidow et al 2014 to build a sense of responsibility across the entire water supply chain for improvement in efficient water use consistent exchange of knowledge is necessary between all stakeholders which can only be achieved through outreach activities based on the results presented in table 2 most educational activities on irrigation water use requires more efforts in the southwest to promote smart innovations and technologies on irrigation and water conservation technologies fig 6 5 conclusion though there was no significant gain in the southwest as a region on prudent irrigation water management however the gains made in arizona and utah between 2007 and 2017 could serve as a model fig 6a in the southwestern region the gains made in arizona were associated with improved irrigation technologies and the use of best management decisions to improve water conservation and promote efficient use of water resources in the southwest an integrated approach that combines both the irrigation technology and best management practices should be a priority for the region in addition more research extension and outreach programs that address the needs of agricultural stakeholders and water issues using integrated approaches should be promoted in the region funding n a none availability of data and material

significantly by 12 with a 71 increase in the use of drip irrigation systems the increase in the adoption of soil moisture sensors 55 plant sensors 107 government schedules 29 and supplier s schedules

for irrigated acreage due to climate variabilities and rising food demands of the growing population evans and sadler 2008 drought spells and rising temperatures are occurring especially in semi arid and arid regions of the southwestern united states where annual evaporation and transpiration exceed the rainfall southwest is the hottest part of the nation usgcrp 2014 the united states environmental protection agency epa in 2014 reported average temperatures in the southwest increased by 2 f 1 12 c from 2000 2013 relative to the long term average from 1895 2013 us epa 2014 and 2017 the over allocation of surface waters and the 20 year long droughts have affected the colorado river watershed usgcrp 2014 which is a major source of water supply for the southwest the prolonged continuous droughts and over allocation of the river waters may lead to an official water shortage declaration in most of the southwestern states though a state like arizona has a great history of robust innovative groundwater regulation such a declaration may affect irrigation water supply with potential pressure on groundwater withdrawal and likely increases in prices of water rights and farm produce lahmers and eden 2018 irrigation is a crucial component for crop production in the southwest especially in states like arizona where more than 90 of croplands are irrigated with about 74 of the total water used in arizona going into agriculture arizona department of water resources 2020 crop production contributes significantly to the economies in the southwest hence the need to understand advances made in irrigation water use for crop productions in terms of irrigation technology and best management practices bmp which includes drough tolerant seeds selection for prudent water management according to carey and zilberman 2002 genius et al 2014 developing intensive extension and educational programs on irrigation could give producers the right information to transition from unsustainable traditional irrigation practices to smart irrigation technology that may lead to water saving in agriculture studies have shown that reducing water withdrawals as a result of smart water use systems in agriculture could increase water supply for other uses such as municipal and environmental applications ward and pulido velazquez 2008 rockström et al 2007 huffaker and whittlesey 2000 hussain et al 2007 which could be a great strategy in mitigating water shortages based on this assumption we asked the question could the adoption of smarter irrigation methods in the southwest reduce total irrigation water use in agriculture thus increasing water availability for other purposes such as municipal and environmental applications without compromising field crop yields this study aimed to elucidate a decade of trends of irrigation water use irrigation technology and irrigation outreach programs in the southwest using the united states department of agriculture usda census data of 2007 and 2017 in a comparative approach the study hypothesized no differences in irrigation water use irrigation technology and irrigation outreach programs in the southwestern states between 2007 and 2017 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area demographics and precipitation pattern in 2007 and 2017 the locations selected for the study within the southwestern usa include arizona az california ca nevada ne new mexico nm colorado co and utah ut fig 1 the number of farms average farm size and significant crops grown in the southwest are represented in table 1 based on precipitation ranking pattern in the usa arizona recorded below average in 2017 which is a reduction from near average in 2007 while ut co and nm registered near average in both years however ca and nv recorded above average in 2017 which is an improvement from below average in nv and much below average in ca in 2007 national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa annual report 2007 and 2017 2 2 data collection the usda agriculture census data 2007 and 2017 were obtained online at www nass usda gov surveys guide to nass surveys farm and ranch irrigation index php for the study data were collected for the following parameters irrigated lands harvested irrigated land the quantity of water used types of irrigation methods for water delivery sources of irrigation information to farmers and ranchers and methods used to decide irrigation schedules usda nass 2008 2013 2018 2 3 data analysis the years 2007 and 2017 represented the main treatments while the states arizona az california ca nevada ne new mexico nm colorado co and utah ut were used as the replicates a t test was then performed in a pairwise comparison assuming equal variance at p 0 05 using 2007 data as the baseline percentage changes were calculated using the 2007 and 2017 data points in the formula reported by mpanga et al 2020 below to understand the trend of selected parameters δ y 2 y 1 y 1 100 where δ percentage change y1 2007 data and y2 2017 data 2 4 study limitations some limitations of the study included missing or withheld data from the usda for privacy reasons however it did not limit the ability to address the study objective 3 results 3 1 harvested irrigated cropland in the southwest from 2007 to 2017 harvested irrigated croplands recorded no significant changes from 2007 to 2017 in the southwest however quantitatively at the state levels increases were recorded in arizona 9 california 6 nevada 7 and utah 5 with reductions in new mexico and colorado at 21 and 15 respectively with no statistical difference in any of the categories at the regional level fig 2 california was the highest producer of crops with a yearly average of 2 832 799 hectares in the region followed by colorado with about 1 011 714 hectares in comparison the remaining four states az ne nm and ut were below 404 685 hectares each fig 2 3 2 total irrigated cropland and quantity of water used in the southwest from 2007 to 2017 the total irrigated cropland in the southwest increased marginally by 1 from 2007 to 2017 with no significant difference at the state level increases were recorded in az 10 ca 7 ne 15 and ut 3 while nm and co decreased by 25 and 14 respectively with no statistical differences at p 0 05 between 2007 and 2017 fig 3 a the result in fig 3a is consistent with harvested cropland in fig 2 the quantity of water used however decreased in most of the states az 5 nm 29 co 15 ut 4 except ca and ne which increased by 8 and 34 respectively with a 2 increase at the regional level fig 3b arizona and utah showed water saving by 5 and 4 with gains in irrigated cropland by 10 and 3 respectively without statistical differences fig 3 a b 3 3 irrigation methods for water distribution the usda census reported data on the types of water distribution systems such as gravity sprinkler and drip irrigation systems for 2007 and 2017 usda nass 2008 and 2018 according to fig 4 at the regional level the use of gravity as an irrigation water delivery system in the southwest reduced significantly by 12 p 0 05 and sprinklers by 8 from 2007 to 2017 the use of drip trickle and low flow micro sprinklers increased by 71 but with no statistical difference at p 0 05 fig 4a which could be due to the high variability in the measured values at the state level there was 71 increase in the use of drip irrigation systems for water delivery from 2007 to 2017 at the regional level by az ca ne and ut with ne and ut contributing the most 45 74 431 and 187 respectively to the increase in the use of drip systems in the southwest fig 4b the reasons for these increases in the use of drip systems could relate to associated benefits such as cost savings for irrigation water sustainable of water use potential yield increase and other advantages such as reduction in weed pressure and soil bone diseases thompson et al 2009 3 4 methods used in making irrigation scheduling decisions at the regional level the use of any method for irrigation scheduling decisions was most familiar with about 80 000 farms followed by conditions of the crop with 60 000 farms how soil feels with 30 000 farms while the rest of the methods together made up less than 20 000 farms with the use of computer simulation the least used in the region fig 5 a comparing 2007 and 2017 data irrigation scheduling by plant sensing methods increased by 107 while scheduling by soil moisture sensors increased by 55 across the states although the use of both methods are still relatively low when compared to other scheduling methods fig 5a decisions based on information from government and the water supplier schedules increased by 29 and 50 with minimal increases in any method and conditions of crops fig 5a but no reported statistical difference in all at p 0 05 the regional increases in the use of techniques such as soil moisture and plant sensors commercial or government schedules and water supplier companies were influenced by az ne and nm states with either negative or very minimal contributions from ca co and ut fig 5b there were decreases in the use of methods such as soil feel 10 personal calendar 12 computer simulations 50 and when the neighbors start irrigating 10 fig 5a 3 5 irrigation information sources to farmers on how to reduce irrigation costs and conserve water all outreach programs including university extension state and federal agencies private and media report as sources of information for growers on how to minimize irrigation cost and conserve water declined between 2007 and 2017 except for the electronic information services such as internet sources which increased by 38 during the same time period table 2 4 discussions this study focused on irrigation practices in crops within the southwest of the united states with comparative analysis of 2007 and 2017 usda census of agriculture data across the region of southwest there was no increase in harvested irrigated cropland while total irrigated lands increased by 1 the quantity of irrigated water also increased by 2 with no significant differences at the state level az could serve as a model for irrigation water use improvement where the quantity of irrigated water decreased 5 fig 3b while the irrigated and harvested cropland increased by 9 and 10 respectively figs 3a and 2 even under a worse precipitation condition in 2017 compared to 2007 noaa 2007 and 2017 the increased efficiency was probably due to the combined effect of irrigation technology and best management practices figs 4a b and 5b as discussed below in fig 6 4 1 southwest precipitation ranking and irrigation water use in 2007 and 2017 the precipitation pattern did not seem to reduce the amount of irrigation water use in the southwest for example the quantity of irrigation water use reduced in az nm ut and co from 2007 to 2017 while there was an increase in ca and nv fig 3b however precipitation ranking in az reduced from 2007 to 2017 ca and nv recorded a rise in precipitation ranking while ut co and nm remained relatively the same in both years noaa 2007and 2017 though the precipitation events did now seem to reduce the amount of water use in the region they play a vital role in refilling the water table after withdrawals gardner and heilweil 2009 in some cases farmers may not have the technology and technical irrigation information that will help them understand and adjust irrigation systems to reduce watering during rainfall days the number of farmers using soil moisture and plant sensors in making irrigation scheduling decisions compared to other methods fig 5a is a clear evidence that fields could still be irrigated sooner than expected after precipitation events since most farmers are not using any quantitative method for establishing soil and crop conditions prior to irrigation water application on the other hand the increase in precipitation events in the ca and ne could be the driving force behind the increase in the irrigation water use for both states due to more water availability unfortunately the increases in the irrigation water use did not translate into increase in harvested cropland in those two states compared to what was observed in arizona and utah therefore understanding the trends in irrigation technology use best management practices and irrigation outreach programs is required to support decisions and policy on sustainable irrigation water use in the southwest 4 2 irrigation technology growers increased acreage under more efficient systems such as drip subsurface and micro irrigations fig 4a and b in fig 4 drip irrigation increased by 71 with significant reduction in gravity methods over the study period this demonstrates farmers efforts in sustainable water use by transitioning to modern and smart irrigation technologies micro drip subsurface drip and pipes reduce water losses to surface evaporation and deliver water by target applications to the plants this finding is in line with the study by lahmers and eden 2018 which reported that the southwest of u s made improvements in water use efficiency through improved irrigation technologies disadvantages of these irrigation systems compared to open ditches include the initial cost of installation labor and maintenance fig 6 technologies such as sensors and computer simulations could reduce delivery waste and on farm leakages as farmers are now able to deliver water to crops through precision scheduling fig 5a b arizona department of water resources 2020 fan et al 2018 generally irrigation water use efficiencies are much higher with subsurface drip systems than the furrow irrigation method encisco et al 2015 mansour 2015 and mansour et al 2016 transitioning to a more efficient irrigation system will become more pivotal in the southwestern region as the impacts of climate change becomes more severe fuller and harhay 2010 thompson et al 2009 highlighted the potential of subsurface drip irrigation as a potential solution to the problem of low water use efficiency in the southwest the authors also highlighted other added benefits of the subsurface drip systems including reduced nitrate leaching into the groundwater higher crop yields better weed control crop health fig 6 and flexibility in harvesting specialty crops all these benefits will improve the bottom line of farmers in the region as mentioned earlier installation costs could be a major drawback to the adaptation of these more efficient irrigation methods this issue could be addressed through the provision of credit facilities to help farmers in the region with the installation of more efficient irrigation systems and by governmental policies that prohibit inefficient irrigation methods such as flood irrigation currently prevalent in the southwestern states 4 3 best management practices the method used in making irrigation scheduling decisions play a vital role in making sure the right amount of water is delivered at the right time using the appropriate method in fig 5b the use of sensors and computer simulations were more prevalent in arizona which could be a contributing factor to the water use efficiencies observed in the state which has also been reported by yadav et al 2020 in a technical report with vegetable production in california other best management practices introduced through agricultural water conservation include canal lining laser leveling technology level basin irrigations sprinkler irrigation drip or trickle irrigation and tailwater re use systems agronomic practices such as crop rotations also considered as best management practices contribute to higher water use efficiency huang et al 2003 mpanga et al 2020 reported increases in sustainable practices such as conservation agriculture no till cover cropping and reduced tillage in arizona could also have contributed to higher water use efficiencies recorded in the state these practices reduce runoff improve soil structure for higher water holding capacity and reduce water evaporation from the soil surface hatfield and dold 2019 reported that depending on climate and soil conditions cultural practices such as mulching row spacing crop rotation mixed cropping and agroforestry strategies could increase water use efficiency land fallowing could also be used as a conservation strategy land fallowing of 1 500 acres was tested in 2014 at the yuma mesa irrigation and drainage district in arizona and this led to savings of about 7 000 acre feet per year of colorado river water lahmers and eden 2018 crops with higher water use efficiency could be one of the contributing factors to an increase in harvested cropland and a decrease in water use from 2007 to 2017 in arizona for example nut crop production has been on the rise with changes from flood to micro irrigation systems in arizona alternative crops with higher water use efficiencies such as industrial hemp cannabis sativa or guayule parthenium argentatum are being promoted hemp could partially replace cotton for fiber production if the demand for hemp fiber emerges while guayule is a desert adapted industrial crop that produces rubber for manufacturing tires lahmers and eden 2018 the genetic traits crop species and variety selections could be another best management practice that can increase water use efficiency in the southwest hatfield and dold 2019 breeding techniques such as improving root architecture to access subsoil water and early vigor for rapid soil surface cover will improve water use efficiencies condon 2020 for example barley cultivars requiring either low or high irrigation input were grown in arizona under regular and deficit irrigation the low irrigation types performed better under drought because of early vigor and flowering more significant root growth at lower soil depth and more effective water use during the grain filling stage carter et al 2019 at the plant cell level osmotic adjustment is the main drought responsive trait that prevents cellular dehydration under drought stress apart from developmental and phenological attributes blum 2005 therefore species and variety selection are critical to achieving water use efficiency and increased yields under dry conditions such as in the southwest 4 4 outreach and educational programs to growers in most cases growers need frequent and consistent information and extension service delivery in comprehensive formats on new technologies and practices that can reduce irrigation costs and conserve water this aspect is very critical for the successful introduction of innovations to growers for adoption according to table 2 agricultural extension efforts have reduced over time in the southwest leaving farmers to depend more on internet links for their irrigation and water conservation information however internet sources in many cases may not provide reliable and credible scientific support for the farmers according to levidow et al 2014 to build a sense of responsibility across the entire water supply chain for improvement in efficient water use consistent exchange of knowledge is necessary between all stakeholders which can only be achieved through outreach activities based on the results presented in table 2 most educational activities on irrigation water use requires more efforts in the southwest to promote smart innovations and technologies on irrigation and water conservation technologies fig 6 5 conclusion though there was no significant gain in the southwest as a region on prudent irrigation water management however the gains made in arizona and utah between 2007 and 2017 could serve as a model fig 6a in the southwestern region the gains made in arizona were associated with improved irrigation technologies and the use of best management decisions to improve water conservation and promote efficient use of water resources in the southwest an integrated approach that combines both the irrigation technology and best management practices should be a priority for the region in addition more research extension and outreach programs that address the needs of agricultural stakeholders and water issues using integrated approaches should be promoted in the region funding n a none availability of data and material
