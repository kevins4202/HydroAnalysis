1305,olive farming is one of the key agricultural activities in jordan where nearly 70 of the cultivated land in jordan is covered with olive trees olive harvesting generates massive quantities of agricultural waste which will be an environmental burden if not managed properly the present study introduces the use of novel co processed biomass extracted from the olive tree leaves for the adsorption of lead from contaminated water several biomass co processing techniques using different concentrations of sodium hydroxide phosphoric acid and the dead sea water were investigated and their effect on the removal efficiency was demonstrated moreover the effect of several parameters on the adsorption efficiency including biomass particle size solution ph contact time adsorbent amount and lead ion concentration was explored it was inferred that biomass co processing enhanced the adsorption capacity of lead it was also found that the adsorption efficiency increased with decreasing biomass particle size due to the increase in surface area the highest lead removal was attained at an efficiency value of 70 for the 0 1 mm particle size and at a maximum adsorption capacity recorded at ph 5 the foregoing had a negatively charged biomass surface which as such favored the cationic adsorption phpzc values around 2 8 4 5 for lead biosorption the process was a rapid process whereby most adsorption was observed within the first 20 min concurrently there were no considerable changes in lead removal thereafter theoretically this was attributed to the decrease in the available adsorption sites on the biomass surface on the other hand a continuous increase in the removal efficiency was recorded upon increasing the adsorbent amount however there was a continuous decline in the removal efficiency upon an increase in the initial lead concentration the experimental data were fitted well with langmuir isotherm indicating a monolayer adsorption isotherm while kinetic data showed the best fit with a pseudo second order kinetic model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption langmuir isotherm pseudo second order contamination heavy metals kinetic 1 introduction heavy metals as a definition refers to metals and metalloids of 4 g cm3 density or higher paul 2017 heavy metals contamination is considered to represent one of the most serious health and environmental concerns among other elements such concern is attributed to the persistent toxic and bioaccumulative nature of these types of elements olayinka olagunju et al 2021 most heavy metals contamination originates from anthropogenic activities of the industrial sector e g paints pigments tannery and distillery steel energy sector mining activities and domestic wastewater bolisetty et al 2019 saha et al 2017 nevertheless some heavy metals such as pb cd and cr are regarded as essential micronutrients and of significant nutritional value for different life forms however heavy metals contamination has been linked to various critical diseases such as cardiovascular diseases increased blood pressure anuria pharynx congestion and extensive lesions in the kidneys paul 2017 lead is one of the most poisonous heavy metals with a long history of water contamination lead pollution in the environment was reported to originate from natural and anthropogenic sources patel et al 2021 the latter source includes batteries paint ceramic glass industries ammunition auto exhaust fertilizers and pesticides jaishankar et al 2014 therefore in light of its numerous health risks lead was phased out from gasoline in most countries perhaps the most famous lead contamination episode was the flint michigan incident that took place in 2014 in this regard lead caused serious contamination to drinking water in network pipes as a result of water corrosiveness such incidents caused a major health crisis in the city bellinger 2016 boudrahem et al 2011 ibisi and asoluka 2018 mireles 2017 consequently lead was identified as a priority pollutant by the u s environmental protection agency epa agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr and the world health organization who the safe level in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l boudrahem et al 2011 ibisi and asoluka 2018 several techniques have been investigated for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water these include chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation sedimentation microfiltration centrifugation adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange distillation and electrochemical precipitation bolisetty et al 2019 however these techniques were found to have serious economic and technological drawbacks attributed to their high costs low selectivity and low capacity in the removal of low concentrations of contaminant metals moreover large quantities of secondary wastes are generated with these methods despite the drawbacks of the aforementioned techniques adsorption is recognized as a well established and effective treatment method in this regard the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants from contaminated water is carried out through mass transfer practically adsorption is arguably a superior technique compared to other treatment methods due to the flexibility in the design and operation high removal efficiencies short duration and the potential to regenerate the adsorbent at a relatively low cost adsorption is advantageous from an economic perspective in particular due to the lower capital and energy requirements compared to other heavy metals treatment methods bolisetty et al 2019 cui et al 2020 chen et al 2009 pandey et al 2020 adsorbents of nano size particles represent a good example of ideal types that were unanimously given special attention these particles are characterized by their high surface to volume ratio bolisetty et al 2019 the most commonly used adsorbents of these types include natural oxides fly ash coal clay activated carbon and biomass pandey et al 2020 among the aforementioned adsorbent types olive leaves biomass has gained popularity as a sustainable adsorbent due to its abundance in nature high biosorption capacity for heavy metals rapid equilibrium and biodegradability biosorbents such as dried activated sludge crab shell particles palm tree leaves palm oil waste olive cake olive trees cotton cellulose algal biomass orange and lemon peels and rice husks have been reported to effectively remove heavy metals from contaminated water akpomie and conradie 2020 du et al 2020 febrianto et al 2009 feng et al 2004 reported that rice husk ash was effective in the removal of lead and mercury from contaminated water on the other hand zehhaf et al 2012 utilized the modified algerian montmorillonites for the biosorption of lead from contaminated water in the same context luo et al 2006 investigated the use of modified biomass of marine brown algae for the adsorption of lead where the equilibrium was reached after about 2 h in the current study biomass from olive leaves has been extracted modified and utilized for the adsorption of lead the interest in olive leaves comes from the fact that olive farming is a key agricultural activity in jordan in this regard more than 80 000 jordanian families are involved in olive production that takes place over nearly one third of the cultivated land in jordan olive oil in jordan is estimated to surpass a production quantity of 30 000 tons in more than 100 olive mills all over the country most of the produced oil is consumed locally abu ashour et al 2010 al addous et al 2017 cook 2018 despite its importance olive farming in jordan generates large quantities of organic waste which can be regarded an environmental concern if not properly managed in particular olive tree leaves are produced in large quantities which are typically disposed or incinerated nevertheless olive leaves are lignocellulosic materials rich in biopolymers making this waste material an attractive alternative for several environmental applications fawzy et al 2019 lama muñoz et al 2020 the present study aims to evaluate the efficiency of biomass extracted from olive leaves for the adsorption of lead from contaminated water several co processing methods were investigated and the improvements in the biosorption capacity were assessed minerals from the super salty water of dead sea in jordan were used for the co processing the novelty of the current work is in the use of the co processing method for forming mineral fiber solid dispersion according to previous work the co processing involves the precipitation of solid water insoluble salts of calcium magnesium phosphate within the structure of olive leaves biomass the solid dispersion has a hydrophilic nature with a high adsorption capacity the co processed solid dispersion structure formed in an appropriate ratio was studied and evaluated for its ability to adsorb lead ions in aqueous solution badwan et al 2007 therefore the proposed biomass can be entirely prepared using natural and locally available materials including olive tree leaves and minerals from the dead sea water the effects of ph biomass quantity initial lead concentration and contact time were examined in an attempt to optimize the adsorption process using this biomass finally the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were conducted in batch mode to estimate parameters of lead adsorption using the biomass 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural materials and chemicals fresh olive leaves olea europea l sativa were collected from ajloun jordan during the olive harvesting season in october 2018 sodium hydroxide pellets with 99 purity and 2 13 g cm3 density reagent grade and 1000 ppm lead stock solution were purchased from fisher scientific u k ltd ethanol was purchased from scharlab s l spain and phosphoric acid was purchased from jordan phosphate mines company jordan sodium hypochlorite 12 was purchased from jordan chemical industries co 2 2 extraction procedure the collected leaves were washed several times with distilled water and left to dry at a dark room temperature for 3 weeks the crude dried leaves were then grounded using a kitchen grinder which was then stored in the dark until the time of extraction the dried powder was extracted using the reflux extraction method described by yateem et al 2014 the method involved mixing about 200 g of dried powder with 500 ml 80 ethanol for about 5 h at 70 c in a volumetric flask the extract was cooled to room temperature and then filtered through whatman filter no 42 to remove coarse particles the filtrate was macerated in 5 l sodium hypochlorite for 3 days and then filtered and the sodium hypochlorite treatment process was repeated five times until creamy white biomass was obtained finally the biomass was washed with 80 ethanol and distilled water to eliminate the sodium hypochlorite and then dried at 70 c for 3 days the dry biomass was stored in a sealed dry container 2 3 co processing of biomass the co processing method is known as the utilization of waste materials and using them as an alternative product by several steps gomes et al 2019 while co precipitation method is defined as two or more metals precipitated in the formula of hydroxide from a salt predecessor with the assistance of a base in a solvent ashik et al 2018 consequently in our study co processing technology was utilized for formulating a suitable natural adsorbent by the use of the co precipitation method of metal ions onto the biomass intimate structure the dried biomass was co processed and co precipitated with different mixtures of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid according to the procedure described by al remawi et al 2017 to increase the adsorption affinity four different mixtures were created based on the different amounts of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid in the mix initially the sodium hydroxide was added to 5 ml deionized water and was then mixed with 85 wt wt phosphoric acid the four mixtures were rbs 1 1 75 g sodium hydroxide and 1 ml phosphoric acid rbs 2 3 5 g sodium hydroxide and 2 ml phosphoric acid rbs 3 5 25 g sodium hydroxide and 3 ml phosphoric acid and rbs 5 8 76 g phosphoric acid and 5 ml phosphoric acid the solutions were mixed for 10 min after which 10 g of biomass was added to each solution and mixed vigorously to obtain homogenous dispersions 50 ml of dead sea water dsw was added gradually in 10 ml increments to each solution with continuous mixing for 15 min the volume of liquid increase after each dsw increment so the solution was left for approximately 15 min to restore the original volume a summary of the chemical reactions in the co processing is presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 h 3 p o 4 3 naoh n a 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o 2 biomass n a 3 p o 4 dsw m g 2 c a 2 a l 3 biomass c a 3 p o 4 2 biomass mg 3 p o 4 2 biomass al 3 p o 4 the left hand side of eq 2 consists of dsw which is rich with soluble salts while the products on the right hand side of the same equation are insoluble salts table 1 is a summary of the different mixtures discussed above in comparison with the biomass without co processing rbs 2 4 adsorption experiments the lead adsorption experiments were conducted following the procedures presented by li et al 2013 and yu et al 2007 the effects of several parameters including sorbent particle size ph of the solution contact time adsorbent amount lead ion concentration and temperature on the adsorption behavior were investigated 2 4 1 effect of biomass particle size the sieve sizes of 2 1 0 5 and 0 1 mm were used to obtain different size fractions 20 mg of each particle size biomass was added to 10 ml of 100 ppm lead solution contained in 50 ml centrifuge vials with a ph of all solutions maintained at 5 the vials were shaken for 2 min in a programmable orbital shaker boeco shaker psu 15i the samples were then filtered using whatman no 42 filters lead concentration in the filtrate was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas in samples the sample is aspirated into the flame and the aas determines the presence of lead by focussing a beam of uv light at a specific wavelength through a flame and into the detector if lead is present in the sample it will absorb some of the light and reduce its intensity the instrument measures the change in intensity which is converted to absorbance by simple mathematical handling 2 4 2 effect of solution ph the effect of the ph of the solution on lead adsorption was examined by conducting the adsorption experiments at different ph values from 2 to 7 the ph was measured using a glass electrode digital ph meter phs 3b phtek previously set with buffer solutions at a ph of 4 and 7 the same procedure presented earlier in section 2 4 1 was repeated except that the ph of the solutions was adjusted to the desired value using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl the sorbent particle size of all solutions was fixed at 0 1 mm 2 4 3 effect of contact time the effect of contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate was tested within the time range of 0 and 80 min the experiment was conducted at 25 c 100 ppm lead concentration ph 5 agitation speed of 150 rpm and 20 mg amount of the adsorbent 2 4 4 effect of adsorbent amount different amounts 1 to 50 mg of the adsorbent were used for the adsorption of a fixed amount of 100 ppm of pb 2 over a contact time of 60 min at ph 5 2 4 5 effect of lead ion concentration the effect of various initial lead ion concentrations ranged from 10 to 200 mg l on lead removal efficiency was assessed at constant experimental conditions like 20 mg l adsorbents ph 5 and 150 rpm agitation speed the concentration of lead was determined using wfx 210 atomic absorption spectrophotometer beijing beifen ruili analytical instrument co ltd the instrument was calibrated using a stock solution of 1000 ppm pb no3 2 which was diluted sequentially to reach the desired number of standard solutions samples from the adsorption experiments were filtered using whatman no 42 filters before the analysis 2 5 analytical methods scanning electron microscopy sem images of olive leaves biomass were taken at 5000 magnification biomass samples were also investigated by a single beam fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir lambda scientific pty ltd using a 4000 500 cm 1 wavenumber range ash content the inorganic minerals was determined by the combustion of 1 0 g of biomass samples in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h as described by dias et al 2019 eq 3 was used to calculate the ash content 3 ash w a b c 100 where a crucible weight and ash residue after combustion g b crucible weight g and c original sample weight g the moisture content was measured by adding 1 g of biomass powder in an infrared moisture determination balance kett fd 720 japan and the temperature was adjusted at 180 c for 10 min while bulk density in g ml was obtained by adding 20 g of the biomass powder to an empty 25 ml volumetric cylinder without tapping the tap density was obtained by a mechanically tapped cylinder with the sample for 300 times initially and the tapped volume va was measured al remawi et al 2017 the point of zero charge phpzc was obtained by adding selective amounts of adsorbent to a set of solutions at different ph values bakatula et al 2018 this was accomplished in a sequence of 50 ml centrifuge tubes where 0 2 g of biomass samples were added to 40 0 ml of 0 1 m nano3 solution the ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh as required to acquire the suitable ph range of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 0 1 ph units the ph reading of the supernatant in each tube was signified as ph0 the samples were shaken for 24 h using boeco programmable orbital shaker psu 15i at 150 rpm after settling the ph values in each tube were calculated and denoted as phf the pzc was obtained from the plot of δph phf ph0 against phi those experiments were performed in triplicates and the mean values were recorded 2 6 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of the lead ion on the biomass samples were evaluated at different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 250 mg l adsorption data were represented by three adsorption models langmuir freundlich and temkin kowanga et al 2016 the linear form of the langmuir model is expressed as shown in eq 4 4 c e q e 1 q 0 b 1 q 0 c e where c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g q 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is the langmuir rate of adsorption constant l mg therefore the slope of the plot c e q e vs c e is 1 q 0 while the intercept of the straight line is equal to 1 q e b a dimensionless separation factor r l can be derived from the langmuir model as follows eq 5 5 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 is the initial ion concentration mg l r l value greater than 1 indicates unfavorable adsorption conditions a value of 1 0 corresponds to a linear adsorption process 0 r l 1 0 indicates a favorable adsorption process while an r l value of 0 indicates that the adsorption is irreversible the linear form of freundlich model is expressed in eq 6 6 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich capacity factor mg g l mg 1 n 1 n is freundlich intensity parameter the slope and intercept of the straight line logq e vs log c e are used to estimate these constants the linear form of temkin is as follows in eq 7 7 q e rt b ln a rt b ln c e where a is the equilibrium binding constant l mol which conforms to the maximum binding energy b is associated with the adsorption heat r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k mole and t is the temperature k 2 7 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms of lead adsorption on the biomass the pseudo first order model is often applicable to reversible adsorption based on the equilibrium between the solid and liquid phases while in the pseudo second order model chemisorption is the rate limiting factor wang and guo 2020 the linearized forms of the two models are expressed in eqs 8 and 9 8 pseudo

the first order adsorption constant h and k 2 is the second order adsorption constant g mg h the slopes and intercepts of the straight lines corresponding to the two equations are used to estimate the constants and equilibrium adsorption capacity kowanga et al 2016 taqvi et al 2006 the initial adsorption rate h is estimated by eqs 10 10 h k 2 q e 2 2 8 thermodynamic studies the effect of temperature on the adsorption of pb ii ions onto the olive leave biomass was investigated within a time interval of 1 h varying temperature values were used including 298 308 318 338 and 348 k where the adsorbate concentration adsorbate amount and ph values were fixed at 100 mg l 20 mg and 5 respectively bhatti et al 2016 thermodynamic parameters the gibbs free energy g o enthalpy h o entropy s o

characterization of the extracted biomass the physical and chemical properties of the extracted raw biomass rbs and the co processed biomass rbs 1 rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 were explored by means of scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir 3 1 1 scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds the morphological properties have a strong influence on the physical behavior of the granular biomass lu et al 2017 sem images of the raw and co processed biomass are portrayed in fig 1 it can be inferred that there are no significant differences in the particle size between the raw biomass rbs and rbs 1 the particles were irregular in shape and size on the other hand the addition of increased amounts of salts resulted in more particle agglomeration a lower percentage of fine particles and increased granular particle size in addition the surface is rough with many creases and cracks increase with increased the amount of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid in the co processed method which increases the amount of salt on the surface of particles as seen in rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 images image e shows that rbs 5 had the largest particle size with the highest surface roughness which can be attributed to the precipitation of water insoluble salts of magnesium and calcium phosphate which happened within the structure of olive leave biomass particles in addition elemental analysis was conducted via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds as shown in fig 1 and table 2 where non volatile ca mg and si and volatile na p cl k in o and c elements were measured it is clear from table 2 that mg p si k and in were mainly present in the co processed biomass 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir analysis was conducted to identify the chemical properties of the raw and co processed biomass the key structural components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose hemicellulose and lignin stefanidis et al 2014 in the ftir analysis there are two general regions for the spectra of the organic compounds the diagnostic region 4000 1500 cm 1 where peaks in this region indicate the presence of a specific functional group and the fingerprint region 1500 400 cm 1 and peaks in this region denote complex deformations lazzari et al 2018 the ftir spectra of the biomass are depicted in fig 2 and it can be observed that the broadband between 3500 and 3100 cm 1 is due to oh stretching vibration related to cellulose or water two broad peaks were detected at 2950 and 2700 cm 1 which correspond to symmetric ch and asymmetric ch bands of alkyl groups of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin respectively mondragon et al 2014 liu et al 2016 most of the absorption bands were detected in the fingerprint region the bands at 1600 and 1650 cm 1 suggest the presence of oxygen containing surface functional groups involving oh and cooh of water absorbed onto cellulose structure and amide i c o hassan and badri 2014 liu et al 2016 z wang et al 2017 peaks from 1400 to 1325 cm 1 can be attributed to co stretching of cellulose chen et al 2010 absorptions which occur around 1120 950 cm 1 are associated with organic phosphate groups p o p carbonates co and silicates si o si deformation vibrations of the pyranose ring skeletal of cellulose and xylan lv et al 2015 mondragon et al 2014 peaks at 780 and 568 cm 1 are caused by co and cc stretching band respectively siengchum et al 2013 biomass co processing has altered the chemical structure to some extent for instance there were no peaks between 1740 and 1650 cm 1 indicating a decreasing hemicellulose content due to washing and co processing maheswari et al 2008 however the cellulose and lignin contents increased slightly or remained constant the co processing effect can be evaluated from fig 2a where in rbs 2 the alterations in peaks rbs 1 are related to oh ch and phosphate groups further alternations can be observed with an increase in the level of co processing due to the increase in the phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide quantities and in fact some peaks completely disappeared in rbs 5 most likely due to chemical interaction or chemical complexation another co processing effect is the broadening of some peaks which might be an indication of deformation h bonds breaking and dilution effect yazıcı et al 2008 alterations in the biomass spectra as a result of lead adsorption can be examined in fig 2b f for rbs there was a shift in the peak from 3436 cm 1 to 3397 cm 1 similar observation in rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 where the peaks shifted from 3401 8 cm 1 to 3432 cm 1 for rbs 1 from 3432 cm 1 to 3417 cm 1 for rbs 2 and from 3397 cm 1 to 3417 cm 1 for rbs 3 peaks around 3250 cm 1 to 3150 cm 1 for the co processed biomass disappeared after lead adsorption which can be due to the interaction of the hydroxyl group with the lead ion majumdar et al 2010 aliphatic symmetric ch and asymmetric ch bands 2919 2854 cm for rbs 2919 2850 cm 1 for rbs 1 2931 2854 cm 1 for rbs 3 were shifted to 2921 2809 cm 1 2931 2805 cm 1 and 2919 2803 cm 1 respectively only asymmetric ch band was shifted from 2962 cm 1 to 2919 cm 1 for rbs 2 and symmetric band at 2857 cm 1 was shifted to 2850 cm 1 for rbs 5 changes after lead adsorption can be attributed to an alteration in ch vibration majumdar et al 2010 other changes can be observed at 1616 cm 1 for rbs and rbs 1 1619 cm 1 for rbs 2 and 1635 cm 1 for rbs 3 which were shifted to 1596 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1639 cm 1 for rbs 5 was shifted to 1616 cm 1 these findings indicate that the carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups are vital for lead ion adsorption li et al 2013 the bands around 1400 cm 1 for rbs stretching vibration shifted after lead adsorption to 1380 cm 1 for rbs and 1384 cm 1 for rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 while no change was observed for rbs 5 other bands in the 1325 1317 cm 1 range and 783 760 cm 1 range shifted after lead ion adsorption regardless of the biomass processing which indicates an active role of the carbonyl groups in lead biosorption chigondo et al 2013 another shift in the peaks occurred from 1103 cm 1 to 1099 cm 1 for rbs from 1065 cm 1 to 1014 cm 1 for rbs 1 from 1103 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 for rbs 2 from 1065 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 for rbs 3 and from 1065 cm 1 to 975 cm 1 for rbs 5 these peaks represent carbonates co phosphates p o p and silicates si o si which have a great affinity to lead ions thus the shifting in these peaks can be explained by the precipitation interactions majumdar et al 2010 pap et al 2018 these negatively charged functional groups favor the uptake of lead ions the functional groups particularly carboxyls and phenolic hydroxyls are accountable for the complexation capacity of the biomass due to their acid base behavior in other words the adsorption process on the biomass surface can be attributed to the electrostatic forces the interaction mechanism of the functional groups and the lead ion occurs in three stages in the first stage lead ion is captured by the adsorbent and the functional group dissociates by the loss of a proton the next stage is the dehydration of the lead ion loss of the water molecule finally lead ion is captured by the anionic group dissociated from cellulose hemicellulose or lignin oliveira et al 2021 3 1 3 ash content moisture content bulk density tap density and point of zero charge phpzc the ash content of biomass samples was acquired to further investigate the adsorption mechanism it was found that the ash content was increasing steadily with the treatment as demonstrated in table 3 ash is mainly composed of inorganic salts therefore the higher content of metal salts might explain the higher adsorption capacity qu et al 2020 méndez et al 2009 has shown that the adsorption capacities of the various adsorbents were not dependent on their surface areas but rather the high removal capacities of materials could be attributed to cation exchange reactions between calcium and magnesium in adsorbents table 3 shows the obtained moisture contents of the rbs and the co processed biomass at 25 c temperature the moisture content of the rbs was found to be 6 25 the values of moisture contents were increased with increased added amounts of the phosphoric acid in the co processing of the biomass such increase could be attributed to the adsorption of the added salts on the surface of the biomass and inside the biomass pores according to al remawi et al 2017 work co precipitation treatment increases the water uptake by biomass on the other hand bulk and tap density values for rbs were 0 25 and 0 39 respectively while after co processing of the biomass these values were increased in range from 0 35 to 0 4 for bulk density and 0 62 to 69 for tap density the phpzc of an adsorbent is one of the principal characteristics that determine the ph of the surface charge and explains the affiliation of the adsorbate to an adsorbent surface bagali et al 2017 it can be observed from fig 3 that the phpzc values vary between 2 8 and 4 5 when the ph is lower than phpzc the adsorbent surface is positively charged attracts anions on other hand when the ph is higher the material has negatively charged sites favoring the adsorption of cations and a higher negative charge will indicate stronger electrostatic interaction higher adsorption capacity adsorbing pollutants through stronger electrostatic interactions jiménez cedillo et al 2013 3 2 factors affecting the lead adsorption several factors such as biomass particle size ph contact time adsorbent amount and the initial lead concentration were explored and their effect on the biosorption behavior is presented in the following subsections 3 2 1 biomass particle size the effect of the biomass particle size was examined by using four different particle sizes 2 1 0 5 and 0 1 mm as illustrated in fig 4 a the adsorbent mass used was 20 mg the initial lead concentration was 100 ppm and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 it is worthy to mention that the particle size experiments were not conducted on the co processed biomass therefore the results presented in fig 4a are only for the raw biomass rbs the highest removal efficiency was observed at the smallest particle size 0 1 mm this can be explained by the increase in the available surface area which results in increasing the initial lead ion uptake rate this finding is consistent with other studies which reported that the biosorption capacity depends primarily on the accessible area for interaction between the solute and the biomass amro et al 2019 benguella and benaissa 2002 iddou et al 2011 the overall lead removal efficiency was 70 for the 0 1 mm particle size which was considerably higher than the removal efficiencies observed at the other particle sizes nearly 30 3 2 2 solution ph the effect of the solution ph was characterized by investigating six different ph values 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 the ph experiments were conducted on the raw and co processed biomass and the results are presented in fig 4b it can be concluded that the maximum adsorption capacity is at ph 5 for rbs rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 after which the adsorption capacity declined for rbs 5 there was a constant increase in the adsorption capacity with an increasing ph from 5 to 7 which can be explained by the high concentration of calcium phosphate in this co processing method and according to minh et al 2014 the maximum adsorption efficiency by calcium phosphate is between ph 6 and 7 ph values higher than 7 were avoided to eliminate the potential of lead precipitation thus adsorption will be the dominant lead removal mechanism kariuki et al 2017 besides the adsorption efficiency declines with an increasing ph due to the formation of metal complexes with the negatively charged ligands barka et al 2013 and lópez mesas et al 2011 on the other hand the biomass surface sites are closely linked with h ions at lower ph values in the acidic range which will limit the availability of cations amro et al 2019 furthermore phpzc values were lower than the ph of maximum adsorption capacities which biomass contains a negative charge it can also be observed from fig 4b that the co processed biomass demonstrated superior adsorption behavior compared to the raw biomass regardless of the ph 3 2 3 contact time the effect of the contact time was evaluated by investigating different contact times between the biomass and the adsorbate as shown in fig 4c there was a rapid uptake of lead within the first 5 min of contact time where the removal efficiencies were 64 54 62 60 and 81 for rbs rbs 1 rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 respectively within nearly 40 60 min the equilibrium was attained for all the samples after which minimal variations were observed for the remainder of the contact time in addition the adsorption of the lead ion was rapid and constant as shown in the time vs percent removal which indicates monolayer adsorption of the lead ion on the biomass surface hence the subsequent experiments were conducted using a contact time of 60 min this rapid adsorption phenomenon was reported by other researchers akhtar et al 2004 gabr et al 2008 yinghui liu et al 2009 qaiser et al 2009 tao et al 2015 and is attributed to the vacancy of surface sites which are filled up rapidly the drastic decrease of adsorption later is due to the slow migration and diffusion of lead ions al smadi et al 2019 pap et al 2018 3 2 4 adsorbent amount the effect of different biomass quantities 1 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg was investigated as shown in fig 4d there was a smooth and constant increase in the removal efficiency with an increase in the adsorbent biomass and this is not surprising because increasing the biomass yields a gradual increase in the available active binding sites esaifan et al 2019 sarı and tuzen 2008 tao et al 2015 the removal efficiency approached 100 at 50 mg biomass for the co processed biomass whereas the lead removal efficiency for the raw biomass was nearly 80 at this biomass amount therefore 20 mg of biomass was used for testing the effect of other factors since using 50 mg or more will lead to 100 removal efficiency which will likely eliminate the effect of other factors on the lead removal efficiency 3 2 5 lead ion concentration the effect of different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 mg l using 20 mg biomass and at ph 5 is demonstrated in fig 4e there was a constant decline in the removal efficiency with an increase in the initial lead concentration the highest removal efficiencies were observed at the 10 ppm initial concentration which was 100 for the co processed biomass and 84 4 for the raw biomass at low lead concentrations the ratio of surface active sites to the free ions is high resulting in rapid adsorption reddy et al 2010 tao et al 2015 the diminishing removal efficiency with increasing lead concentration is attributed to the saturation of the available adsorption sites amin et al 2019 3 3 adsorption isotherm the adsorption of lead on raw and co processed biomass was modeled using langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms at different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 mg l adsorption isotherms are necessary to understand the adsorption mechanisms and the partitioning of the adsorbate between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium pap et al 2018 in the langmuir model the adsorption is a monolayer process and the process will not proceed after all surface sites are equivalent no stacking the freundlich model on the other hand assumes multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface while the temkin model accounts for the interaction between the adsorbate particles chen et al 2020 elwakeel et al 2018 shariatinia and bagherpour 2018 the three models were compared quantitatively using the coefficient of determination r2 as shown in table 4 and qualitatively using the linearized isotherms as depicted in fig 5 it can be inferred from table 4 that the langmuir model was notably a better fit for the biosorption of lead compared to freundlich and temkin models the r2 values for the langmuir model were nearly a unity for the raw and all co processed biomass samples unlike the other two models where the highest r2 value observed was 0 68 this conclusion can also be confirmed by inspecting the graphical representations of the three models fig 5 it is clear that the langmuir model was an excellent fit for the experimental data over the entire range of lead concentrations while freundlich and temkin models deviated from the observed data at the lower range of lead concentrations this suggests that the adsorption of lead on the raw and co processed biomass is a monolayer process the isotherm parameters for the three models are presented in table 4 and it can be noted that langmuir s maximum capacity q 0 ranges between 22 8 and 35 9 mg g with an average value of 30 5 mg g the langmuir rate of adsorption constant b increased with the increase of biomass processing lowest value was observed at rbs while the highest was observed for rbs 2 which suggests increasing bond energy between the lead ion and the surface particles with biomass co processing forghani et al 2020 the dimensionless separation factor r l derived from the langmuir model are greater than 0 and less than 1 table 5 thus the adsorption process is favorable at higher initial lead concentrations adebisi et al 2017 sarada et al 2014 the freundlich capacity parameter kf increased with the level of biomass co processing which indicates an increase in the affinity to lead adsorption this is in agreement with the earlier conclusion of increasing bond energy with co processing the freundlich n values were between 1 and 4 suggesting a desirable physical adsorption process foroutan et al 2019 several studies reported that the adsorption of lead ions on different biomass types follows the langmuir model for instance yap et al 2017 found that the adsorption of lead by biochar from agricultural biomass was well characterized by the langmuir model the langmuir adsorption capacities reported by guyo et al 2015 for the adsorption of lead by raw and treated maize stover were 19 65 and 27 10 mg g respectively according to coelho et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of lead by cashew nut shell was 28 65 mg g while foroutan et al 2019 observed that the lead adsorption capacity by callinectes sapidus was 31 44 mg g these adsorption capacities are close to the values obtained in our study average 31 04 mg g the langmuir adsorption capacity qo obtained in this study is compared with those obtained by others for different types of biomass and the summary is reported in table 6 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out in batch mode for over 80 min to gain a better understanding of the lead adsorption process with respect to time the adsorption kinetic data were modeled using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models an equilibrium between liquid and solid phases is assumed in the former while chemisorption is the limiting factor in the latter al smadi et al 2019 the two models were linearized based on the collected data as described before and the results are presented in fig 6 the parameters of both models were estimated from the slope and intercept of the linearized models as shown in table 7 it can be observed from table 7 that the pseudo second order model is a better fit to the lead adsorption data with r2 value 0 99 for all samples this is also apparent from fig 6 as nearly all observed data points fall onto the straight lines a clear departure from the model lines can be observed in the pseudo first order lines particularly in the first 10 min which can be explained by the fast initial adsorption before the process slows down kowanga et al 2016 therefore the adsorption process follows a pseudo second order model which suggests that the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate is through valency forces al smadi et al 2019 this is in agreement with several other studies in which the adsorption of lead was concluded to be a chemisorption process basha and murthy 2007 erdem et al 2013 nabizadeh et al 2005 ofomaja et al 2010 the highest equilibrium adsorption capacities pseudo second order were observed for rbs 2 rbs 3 rbs 5 44 05 46 08 and 42 19 mg g respectively however these values are not substantially greater than the raw biomass adsorption capacity 39 21 mg g the lowest adsorption capacity was recorded for rbs 1 25 38 mg g nevertheless the effect of biomass treatment co processing can be attributed to the introduction of different soluble salts from the dead sea water such as magnesium chloride sodium chloride calcium chloride potassium chloride and magnesium bromide al khlaifat 2008 hamid et al 2010 the enhanced adsorption capacity in rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 can be attributed to the alternation of the active binding sites from h to ca na mg and k as a result of the phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide treatment rozman et al 2020 akar and tunali 2006 reported that the alkali pretreatment of biomass increases its adsorption capacity yan and viraraghavan 2000 speculated that the enhanced adsorption efficiency due to pretreatment can be explained by the elimination of proteins lipids and polysaccharides which may block the binding sites 3 5 thermodynamic studies the values of h o and s o were estimated from the slope and intercept of the line in fig 7 the values of g o h o and s o for the adsorption process are reported in table 8 the negative g o indicates that the adsorption of pb ii ions onto biomass was spontaneous the g o values for all samples were between 0 and 20 kj mol 1 revealing that the adsorption procedure was physical adsorption while for the chemical adsorption g o is between 80 and 400 kj mol 1 iqbal and khera 2015 the value of g o also improved with the increase in temperature representing that the adsorption was favorable at lower temperatures morosanu et al 2017 the value of h o was negative indicating that the adsorption process was exothermic and this behavior showed that increasing the uptake of pb ii ion from aqueous solution at a lower temperature the entropy s o values were negative suggests that there is a decrease in randomness at the biomass surface solution interface that occurred due to the moved molecules from adsorbent surfaces lost additional translational entropy than was gained by the pb ii ions olu owolabi et al 2012 bhatti et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study lead biosorption by olive leaves extracted biomass was demonstrated several parameters including biomass particle size solution ph contact time adsorbent amount and lead ion concentration were explored results showed that the lead removal efficiency increased with decreasing particle size the adsorption behavior was highly ph dependent with the maximum adsorption of lead at ph 5 for the same ph value the co processed biomass showed higher removal efficiency than the raw biomass most of the adsorption was achieved within 20 min and no significant changes in the removal efficiency were observed after 40 min a continuous increase in the removal efficiency was observed with increasing the adsorbent amount when 50 mg adsorbent was used the removal efficiencies were 100 and 80 for the co processed and raw biomass respectively on the contrary a continuous decline in the removal efficiency with an increase in the initial lead concentration was observed at 10 ppm initial concentration the removal efficiencies were 100 and 84 4 for the co processed and raw biomass respectively we can conclude that the co processed biomass always have higher removal efficiency than raw biomass it was also concluded that the langmuir model was a better fit to the isotherm data compared with the freundlich and temkin models at different initial lead concentrations indicating the adsorption of lead by the olive leaves biomass is a monolayer process the r2 values for the langmuir model were nearly a unity for the raw and co processed biomass where the highest r2 value was 0 68 for the other two models the kinetics data were well modeled by the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that the lead adsorption process was chemisorption a possible extension of the present study is to investigate the successful utilization of proposed biomass in typical

1305,olive farming is one of the key agricultural activities in jordan where nearly 70 of the cultivated land in jordan is covered with olive trees olive harvesting generates massive quantities of agricultural waste which will be an environmental burden if not managed properly the present study introduces the use of novel co processed biomass extracted from the olive tree leaves for the adsorption of lead from contaminated water several biomass co processing techniques using different concentrations of sodium hydroxide phosphoric acid and the dead sea water were investigated and their effect on the removal efficiency was demonstrated moreover the effect of several parameters on the adsorption efficiency including biomass particle size solution ph contact time adsorbent amount and lead ion concentration was explored it was inferred that biomass co processing enhanced the adsorption capacity of lead it was also found that the adsorption efficiency increased with decreasing biomass particle size due to the increase in surface area the highest lead removal was attained at an efficiency value of 70 for the 0 1 mm particle size and at a maximum adsorption capacity recorded at ph 5 the foregoing had a negatively charged biomass surface which as such favored the cationic adsorption phpzc values around 2 8 4 5 for lead biosorption the process was a rapid process whereby most adsorption was observed within the first 20 min concurrently there were no considerable changes in lead removal thereafter theoretically this was attributed to the decrease in the available adsorption sites on the biomass surface on the other hand a continuous increase in the removal efficiency was recorded upon increasing the adsorbent amount however there was a continuous decline in the removal efficiency upon an increase in the initial lead concentration the experimental data were fitted well with langmuir isotherm indicating a monolayer adsorption isotherm while kinetic data showed the best fit with a pseudo second order kinetic model graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorption langmuir isotherm pseudo second order contamination heavy metals kinetic 1 introduction heavy metals as a definition refers to metals and metalloids of 4 g cm3 density or higher paul 2017 heavy metals contamination is considered to represent one of the most serious health and environmental concerns among other elements such concern is attributed to the persistent toxic and bioaccumulative nature of these types of elements olayinka olagunju et al 2021 most heavy metals contamination originates from anthropogenic activities of the industrial sector e g paints pigments tannery and distillery steel energy sector mining activities and domestic wastewater bolisetty et al 2019 saha et al 2017 nevertheless some heavy metals such as pb cd and cr are regarded as essential micronutrients and of significant nutritional value for different life forms however heavy metals contamination has been linked to various critical diseases such as cardiovascular diseases increased blood pressure anuria pharynx congestion and extensive lesions in the kidneys paul 2017 lead is one of the most poisonous heavy metals with a long history of water contamination lead pollution in the environment was reported to originate from natural and anthropogenic sources patel et al 2021 the latter source includes batteries paint ceramic glass industries ammunition auto exhaust fertilizers and pesticides jaishankar et al 2014 therefore in light of its numerous health risks lead was phased out from gasoline in most countries perhaps the most famous lead contamination episode was the flint michigan incident that took place in 2014 in this regard lead caused serious contamination to drinking water in network pipes as a result of water corrosiveness such incidents caused a major health crisis in the city bellinger 2016 boudrahem et al 2011 ibisi and asoluka 2018 mireles 2017 consequently lead was identified as a priority pollutant by the u s environmental protection agency epa agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr and the world health organization who the safe level in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l boudrahem et al 2011 ibisi and asoluka 2018 several techniques have been investigated for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated water these include chemical precipitation coagulation flocculation sedimentation microfiltration centrifugation adsorption reverse osmosis ion exchange distillation and electrochemical precipitation bolisetty et al 2019 however these techniques were found to have serious economic and technological drawbacks attributed to their high costs low selectivity and low capacity in the removal of low concentrations of contaminant metals moreover large quantities of secondary wastes are generated with these methods despite the drawbacks of the aforementioned techniques adsorption is recognized as a well established and effective treatment method in this regard the removal of heavy metals and other contaminants from contaminated water is carried out through mass transfer practically adsorption is arguably a superior technique compared to other treatment methods due to the flexibility in the design and operation high removal efficiencies short duration and the potential to regenerate the adsorbent at a relatively low cost adsorption is advantageous from an economic perspective in particular due to the lower capital and energy requirements compared to other heavy metals treatment methods bolisetty et al 2019 cui et al 2020 chen et al 2009 pandey et al 2020 adsorbents of nano size particles represent a good example of ideal types that were unanimously given special attention these particles are characterized by their high surface to volume ratio bolisetty et al 2019 the most commonly used adsorbents of these types include natural oxides fly ash coal clay activated carbon and biomass pandey et al 2020 among the aforementioned adsorbent types olive leaves biomass has gained popularity as a sustainable adsorbent due to its abundance in nature high biosorption capacity for heavy metals rapid equilibrium and biodegradability biosorbents such as dried activated sludge crab shell particles palm tree leaves palm oil waste olive cake olive trees cotton cellulose algal biomass orange and lemon peels and rice husks have been reported to effectively remove heavy metals from contaminated water akpomie and conradie 2020 du et al 2020 febrianto et al 2009 feng et al 2004 reported that rice husk ash was effective in the removal of lead and mercury from contaminated water on the other hand zehhaf et al 2012 utilized the modified algerian montmorillonites for the biosorption of lead from contaminated water in the same context luo et al 2006 investigated the use of modified biomass of marine brown algae for the adsorption of lead where the equilibrium was reached after about 2 h in the current study biomass from olive leaves has been extracted modified and utilized for the adsorption of lead the interest in olive leaves comes from the fact that olive farming is a key agricultural activity in jordan in this regard more than 80 000 jordanian families are involved in olive production that takes place over nearly one third of the cultivated land in jordan olive oil in jordan is estimated to surpass a production quantity of 30 000 tons in more than 100 olive mills all over the country most of the produced oil is consumed locally abu ashour et al 2010 al addous et al 2017 cook 2018 despite its importance olive farming in jordan generates large quantities of organic waste which can be regarded an environmental concern if not properly managed in particular olive tree leaves are produced in large quantities which are typically disposed or incinerated nevertheless olive leaves are lignocellulosic materials rich in biopolymers making this waste material an attractive alternative for several environmental applications fawzy et al 2019 lama muñoz et al 2020 the present study aims to evaluate the efficiency of biomass extracted from olive leaves for the adsorption of lead from contaminated water several co processing methods were investigated and the improvements in the biosorption capacity were assessed minerals from the super salty water of dead sea in jordan were used for the co processing the novelty of the current work is in the use of the co processing method for forming mineral fiber solid dispersion according to previous work the co processing involves the precipitation of solid water insoluble salts of calcium magnesium phosphate within the structure of olive leaves biomass the solid dispersion has a hydrophilic nature with a high adsorption capacity the co processed solid dispersion structure formed in an appropriate ratio was studied and evaluated for its ability to adsorb lead ions in aqueous solution badwan et al 2007 therefore the proposed biomass can be entirely prepared using natural and locally available materials including olive tree leaves and minerals from the dead sea water the effects of ph biomass quantity initial lead concentration and contact time were examined in an attempt to optimize the adsorption process using this biomass finally the kinetic and equilibrium adsorption experiments were conducted in batch mode to estimate parameters of lead adsorption using the biomass 2 materials and methods 2 1 natural materials and chemicals fresh olive leaves olea europea l sativa were collected from ajloun jordan during the olive harvesting season in october 2018 sodium hydroxide pellets with 99 purity and 2 13 g cm3 density reagent grade and 1000 ppm lead stock solution were purchased from fisher scientific u k ltd ethanol was purchased from scharlab s l spain and phosphoric acid was purchased from jordan phosphate mines company jordan sodium hypochlorite 12 was purchased from jordan chemical industries co 2 2 extraction procedure the collected leaves were washed several times with distilled water and left to dry at a dark room temperature for 3 weeks the crude dried leaves were then grounded using a kitchen grinder which was then stored in the dark until the time of extraction the dried powder was extracted using the reflux extraction method described by yateem et al 2014 the method involved mixing about 200 g of dried powder with 500 ml 80 ethanol for about 5 h at 70 c in a volumetric flask the extract was cooled to room temperature and then filtered through whatman filter no 42 to remove coarse particles the filtrate was macerated in 5 l sodium hypochlorite for 3 days and then filtered and the sodium hypochlorite treatment process was repeated five times until creamy white biomass was obtained finally the biomass was washed with 80 ethanol and distilled water to eliminate the sodium hypochlorite and then dried at 70 c for 3 days the dry biomass was stored in a sealed dry container 2 3 co processing of biomass the co processing method is known as the utilization of waste materials and using them as an alternative product by several steps gomes et al 2019 while co precipitation method is defined as two or more metals precipitated in the formula of hydroxide from a salt predecessor with the assistance of a base in a solvent ashik et al 2018 consequently in our study co processing technology was utilized for formulating a suitable natural adsorbent by the use of the co precipitation method of metal ions onto the biomass intimate structure the dried biomass was co processed and co precipitated with different mixtures of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid according to the procedure described by al remawi et al 2017 to increase the adsorption affinity four different mixtures were created based on the different amounts of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid in the mix initially the sodium hydroxide was added to 5 ml deionized water and was then mixed with 85 wt wt phosphoric acid the four mixtures were rbs 1 1 75 g sodium hydroxide and 1 ml phosphoric acid rbs 2 3 5 g sodium hydroxide and 2 ml phosphoric acid rbs 3 5 25 g sodium hydroxide and 3 ml phosphoric acid and rbs 5 8 76 g phosphoric acid and 5 ml phosphoric acid the solutions were mixed for 10 min after which 10 g of biomass was added to each solution and mixed vigorously to obtain homogenous dispersions 50 ml of dead sea water dsw was added gradually in 10 ml increments to each solution with continuous mixing for 15 min the volume of liquid increase after each dsw increment so the solution was left for approximately 15 min to restore the original volume a summary of the chemical reactions in the co processing is presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 h 3 p o 4 3 naoh n a 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o 2 biomass n a 3 p o 4 dsw m g 2 c a 2 a l 3 biomass c a 3 p o 4 2 biomass mg 3 p o 4 2 biomass al 3 p o 4 the left hand side of eq 2 consists of dsw which is rich with soluble salts while the products on the right hand side of the same equation are insoluble salts table 1 is a summary of the different mixtures discussed above in comparison with the biomass without co processing rbs 2 4 adsorption experiments the lead adsorption experiments were conducted following the procedures presented by li et al 2013 and yu et al 2007 the effects of several parameters including sorbent particle size ph of the solution contact time adsorbent amount lead ion concentration and temperature on the adsorption behavior were investigated 2 4 1 effect of biomass particle size the sieve sizes of 2 1 0 5 and 0 1 mm were used to obtain different size fractions 20 mg of each particle size biomass was added to 10 ml of 100 ppm lead solution contained in 50 ml centrifuge vials with a ph of all solutions maintained at 5 the vials were shaken for 2 min in a programmable orbital shaker boeco shaker psu 15i the samples were then filtered using whatman no 42 filters lead concentration in the filtrate was determined using atomic absorption spectroscopy aas in samples the sample is aspirated into the flame and the aas determines the presence of lead by focussing a beam of uv light at a specific wavelength through a flame and into the detector if lead is present in the sample it will absorb some of the light and reduce its intensity the instrument measures the change in intensity which is converted to absorbance by simple mathematical handling 2 4 2 effect of solution ph the effect of the ph of the solution on lead adsorption was examined by conducting the adsorption experiments at different ph values from 2 to 7 the ph was measured using a glass electrode digital ph meter phs 3b phtek previously set with buffer solutions at a ph of 4 and 7 the same procedure presented earlier in section 2 4 1 was repeated except that the ph of the solutions was adjusted to the desired value using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m hcl the sorbent particle size of all solutions was fixed at 0 1 mm 2 4 3 effect of contact time the effect of contact time between the adsorbent and the adsorbate was tested within the time range of 0 and 80 min the experiment was conducted at 25 c 100 ppm lead concentration ph 5 agitation speed of 150 rpm and 20 mg amount of the adsorbent 2 4 4 effect of adsorbent amount different amounts 1 to 50 mg of the adsorbent were used for the adsorption of a fixed amount of 100 ppm of pb 2 over a contact time of 60 min at ph 5 2 4 5 effect of lead ion concentration the effect of various initial lead ion concentrations ranged from 10 to 200 mg l on lead removal efficiency was assessed at constant experimental conditions like 20 mg l adsorbents ph 5 and 150 rpm agitation speed the concentration of lead was determined using wfx 210 atomic absorption spectrophotometer beijing beifen ruili analytical instrument co ltd the instrument was calibrated using a stock solution of 1000 ppm pb no3 2 which was diluted sequentially to reach the desired number of standard solutions samples from the adsorption experiments were filtered using whatman no 42 filters before the analysis 2 5 analytical methods scanning electron microscopy sem images of olive leaves biomass were taken at 5000 magnification biomass samples were also investigated by a single beam fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir lambda scientific pty ltd using a 4000 500 cm 1 wavenumber range ash content the inorganic minerals was determined by the combustion of 1 0 g of biomass samples in a muffle furnace at 500 c for 4 h as described by dias et al 2019 eq 3 was used to calculate the ash content 3 ash w a b c 100 where a crucible weight and ash residue after combustion g b crucible weight g and c original sample weight g the moisture content was measured by adding 1 g of biomass powder in an infrared moisture determination balance kett fd 720 japan and the temperature was adjusted at 180 c for 10 min while bulk density in g ml was obtained by adding 20 g of the biomass powder to an empty 25 ml volumetric cylinder without tapping the tap density was obtained by a mechanically tapped cylinder with the sample for 300 times initially and the tapped volume va was measured al remawi et al 2017 the point of zero charge phpzc was obtained by adding selective amounts of adsorbent to a set of solutions at different ph values bakatula et al 2018 this was accomplished in a sequence of 50 ml centrifuge tubes where 0 2 g of biomass samples were added to 40 0 ml of 0 1 m nano3 solution the ph was adjusted with 0 1 m hno3 and 0 1 m naoh as required to acquire the suitable ph range of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10 0 1 ph units the ph reading of the supernatant in each tube was signified as ph0 the samples were shaken for 24 h using boeco programmable orbital shaker psu 15i at 150 rpm after settling the ph values in each tube were calculated and denoted as phf the pzc was obtained from the plot of δph phf ph0 against phi those experiments were performed in triplicates and the mean values were recorded 2 6 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of the lead ion on the biomass samples were evaluated at different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 250 mg l adsorption data were represented by three adsorption models langmuir freundlich and temkin kowanga et al 2016 the linear form of the langmuir model is expressed as shown in eq 4 4 c e q e 1 q 0 b 1 q 0 c e where c e is the equilibrium concentration mg l q e is the adsorption capacity at equilibrium mg g q 0 is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and b is the langmuir rate of adsorption constant l mg therefore the slope of the plot c e q e vs c e is 1 q 0 while the intercept of the straight line is equal to 1 q e b a dimensionless separation factor r l can be derived from the langmuir model as follows eq 5 5 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 is the initial ion concentration mg l r l value greater than 1 indicates unfavorable adsorption conditions a value of 1 0 corresponds to a linear adsorption process 0 r l 1 0 indicates a favorable adsorption process while an r l value of 0 indicates that the adsorption is irreversible the linear form of freundlich model is expressed in eq 6 6 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f is the freundlich capacity factor mg g l mg 1 n 1 n is freundlich intensity parameter the slope and intercept of the straight line logq e vs log c e are used to estimate these constants the linear form of temkin is as follows in eq 7 7 q e rt b ln a rt b ln c e where a is the equilibrium binding constant l mol which conforms to the maximum binding energy b is associated with the adsorption heat r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j k mole and t is the temperature k 2 7 adsorption kinetics adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted to understand the mechanisms of lead adsorption on the biomass the pseudo first order model is often applicable to reversible adsorption based on the equilibrium between the solid and liquid phases while in the pseudo second order model chemisorption is the rate limiting factor wang and guo 2020 the linearized forms of the two models are expressed in eqs 8 and 9 8 pseudo

temperature on the adsorption of pb ii ions onto the olive leave biomass was investigated within a time interval of 1 h varying temperature values were used including 298 308 318 338 and 348 k where the adsorbate concentration adsorbate amount and ph values were fixed at 100 mg l 20 mg and 5 respectively bhatti et al 2016 thermodynamic parameters the gibbs free energy g o enthalpy h o entropy s o

characterization of the extracted biomass the physical and chemical properties of the extracted raw biomass rbs and the co processed biomass rbs 1 rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 were explored by means of scanning electron microscopy and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir 3 1 1 scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds the morphological properties have a strong influence on the physical behavior of the granular biomass lu et al 2017 sem images of the raw and co processed biomass are portrayed in fig 1 it can be inferred that there are no significant differences in the particle size between the raw biomass rbs and rbs 1 the particles were irregular in shape and size on the other hand the addition of increased amounts of salts resulted in more particle agglomeration a lower percentage of fine particles and increased granular particle size in addition the surface is rough with many creases and cracks increase with increased the amount of sodium hydroxide and phosphoric acid in the co processed method which increases the amount of salt on the surface of particles as seen in rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 images image e shows that rbs 5 had the largest particle size with the highest surface roughness which can be attributed to the precipitation of water insoluble salts of magnesium and calcium phosphate which happened within the structure of olive leave biomass particles in addition elemental analysis was conducted via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem eds as shown in fig 1 and table 2 where non volatile ca mg and si and volatile na p cl k in o and c elements were measured it is clear from table 2 that mg p si k and in were mainly present in the co processed biomass 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the ftir analysis was conducted to identify the chemical properties of the raw and co processed biomass the key structural components of lignocellulosic biomass are cellulose hemicellulose and lignin stefanidis et al 2014 in the ftir analysis there are two general regions for the spectra of the organic compounds the diagnostic region 4000 1500 cm 1 where peaks in this region indicate the presence of a specific functional group and the fingerprint region 1500 400 cm 1 and peaks in this region denote complex deformations lazzari et al 2018 the ftir spectra of the biomass are depicted in fig 2 and it can be observed that the broadband between 3500 and 3100 cm 1 is due to oh stretching vibration related to cellulose or water two broad peaks were detected at 2950 and 2700 cm 1 which correspond to symmetric ch and asymmetric ch bands of alkyl groups of hemicellulose cellulose and lignin respectively mondragon et al 2014 liu et al 2016 most of the absorption bands were detected in the fingerprint region the bands at 1600 and 1650 cm 1 suggest the presence of oxygen containing surface functional groups involving oh and cooh of water absorbed onto cellulose structure and amide i c o hassan and badri 2014 liu et al 2016 z wang et al 2017 peaks from 1400 to 1325 cm 1 can be attributed to co stretching of cellulose chen et al 2010 absorptions which occur around 1120 950 cm 1 are associated with organic phosphate groups p o p carbonates co and silicates si o si deformation vibrations of the pyranose ring skeletal of cellulose and xylan lv et al 2015 mondragon et al 2014 peaks at 780 and 568 cm 1 are caused by co and cc stretching band respectively siengchum et al 2013 biomass co processing has altered the chemical structure to some extent for instance there were no peaks between 1740 and 1650 cm 1 indicating a decreasing hemicellulose content due to washing and co processing maheswari et al 2008 however the cellulose and lignin contents increased slightly or remained constant the co processing effect can be evaluated from fig 2a where in rbs 2 the alterations in peaks rbs 1 are related to oh ch and phosphate groups further alternations can be observed with an increase in the level of co processing due to the increase in the phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide quantities and in fact some peaks completely disappeared in rbs 5 most likely due to chemical interaction or chemical complexation another co processing effect is the broadening of some peaks which might be an indication of deformation h bonds breaking and dilution effect yazıcı et al 2008 alterations in the biomass spectra as a result of lead adsorption can be examined in fig 2b f for rbs there was a shift in the peak from 3436 cm 1 to 3397 cm 1 similar observation in rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 where the peaks shifted from 3401 8 cm 1 to 3432 cm 1 for rbs 1 from 3432 cm 1 to 3417 cm 1 for rbs 2 and from 3397 cm 1 to 3417 cm 1 for rbs 3 peaks around 3250 cm 1 to 3150 cm 1 for the co processed biomass disappeared after lead adsorption which can be due to the interaction of the hydroxyl group with the lead ion majumdar et al 2010 aliphatic symmetric ch and asymmetric ch bands 2919 2854 cm for rbs 2919 2850 cm 1 for rbs 1 2931 2854 cm 1 for rbs 3 were shifted to 2921 2809 cm 1 2931 2805 cm 1 and 2919 2803 cm 1 respectively only asymmetric ch band was shifted from 2962 cm 1 to 2919 cm 1 for rbs 2 and symmetric band at 2857 cm 1 was shifted to 2850 cm 1 for rbs 5 changes after lead adsorption can be attributed to an alteration in ch vibration majumdar et al 2010 other changes can be observed at 1616 cm 1 for rbs and rbs 1 1619 cm 1 for rbs 2 and 1635 cm 1 for rbs 3 which were shifted to 1596 cm 1 whereas the peak at 1639 cm 1 for rbs 5 was shifted to 1616 cm 1 these findings indicate that the carboxyl hydroxyl and amino groups are vital for lead ion adsorption li et al 2013 the bands around 1400 cm 1 for rbs stretching vibration shifted after lead adsorption to 1380 cm 1 for rbs and 1384 cm 1 for rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 while no change was observed for rbs 5 other bands in the 1325 1317 cm 1 range and 783 760 cm 1 range shifted after lead ion adsorption regardless of the biomass processing which indicates an active role of the carbonyl groups in lead biosorption chigondo et al 2013 another shift in the peaks occurred from 1103 cm 1 to 1099 cm 1 for rbs from 1065 cm 1 to 1014 cm 1 for rbs 1 from 1103 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 for rbs 2 from 1065 cm 1 to 983 cm 1 for rbs 3 and from 1065 cm 1 to 975 cm 1 for rbs 5 these peaks represent carbonates co phosphates p o p and silicates si o si which have a great affinity to lead ions thus the shifting in these peaks can be explained by the precipitation interactions majumdar et al 2010 pap et al 2018 these negatively charged functional groups favor the uptake of lead ions the functional groups particularly carboxyls and phenolic hydroxyls are accountable for the complexation capacity of the biomass due to their acid base behavior in other words the adsorption process on the biomass surface can be attributed to the electrostatic forces the interaction mechanism of the functional groups and the lead ion occurs in three stages in the first stage lead ion is captured by the adsorbent and the functional group dissociates by the loss of a proton the next stage is the dehydration of the lead ion loss of the water molecule finally lead ion is captured by the anionic group dissociated from cellulose hemicellulose or lignin oliveira et al 2021 3 1 3 ash content moisture content bulk density tap density and point of zero charge phpzc the ash content of biomass samples was acquired to further investigate the adsorption mechanism it was found that the ash content was increasing steadily with the treatment as demonstrated in table 3 ash is mainly composed of inorganic salts therefore the higher content of metal salts might explain the higher adsorption capacity qu et al 2020 méndez et al 2009 has shown that the adsorption capacities of the various adsorbents were not dependent on their surface areas but rather the high removal capacities of materials could be attributed to cation exchange reactions between calcium and magnesium in adsorbents table 3 shows the obtained moisture contents of the rbs and the co processed biomass at 25 c temperature the moisture content of the rbs was found to be 6 25 the values of moisture contents were increased with increased added amounts of the phosphoric acid in the co processing of the biomass such increase could be attributed to the adsorption of the added salts on the surface of the biomass and inside the biomass pores according to al remawi et al 2017 work co precipitation treatment increases the water uptake by biomass on the other hand bulk and tap density values for rbs were 0 25 and 0 39 respectively while after co processing of the biomass these values were increased in range from 0 35 to 0 4 for bulk density and 0 62 to 69 for tap density the phpzc of an adsorbent is one of the principal characteristics that determine the ph of the surface charge and explains the affiliation of the adsorbate to an adsorbent surface bagali et al 2017 it can be observed from fig 3 that the phpzc values vary between 2 8 and 4 5 when the ph is lower than phpzc the adsorbent surface is positively charged attracts anions on other hand when the ph is higher the material has negatively charged sites favoring the adsorption of cations and a higher negative charge will indicate stronger electrostatic interaction higher adsorption capacity adsorbing pollutants through stronger electrostatic interactions jiménez cedillo et al 2013 3 2 factors affecting the lead adsorption several factors such as biomass particle size ph contact time adsorbent amount and the initial lead concentration were explored and their effect on the biosorption behavior is presented in the following subsections 3 2 1 biomass particle size the effect of the biomass particle size was examined by using four different particle sizes 2 1 0 5 and 0 1 mm as illustrated in fig 4 a the adsorbent mass used was 20 mg the initial lead concentration was 100 ppm and the ph of the solution was adjusted to 5 it is worthy to mention that the particle size experiments were not conducted on the co processed biomass therefore the results presented in fig 4a are only for the raw biomass rbs the highest removal efficiency was observed at the smallest particle size 0 1 mm this can be explained by the increase in the available surface area which results in increasing the initial lead ion uptake rate this finding is consistent with other studies which reported that the biosorption capacity depends primarily on the accessible area for interaction between the solute and the biomass amro et al 2019 benguella and benaissa 2002 iddou et al 2011 the overall lead removal efficiency was 70 for the 0 1 mm particle size which was considerably higher than the removal efficiencies observed at the other particle sizes nearly 30 3 2 2 solution ph the effect of the solution ph was characterized by investigating six different ph values 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 the ph experiments were conducted on the raw and co processed biomass and the results are presented in fig 4b it can be concluded that the maximum adsorption capacity is at ph 5 for rbs rbs 1 rbs 2 and rbs 3 after which the adsorption capacity declined for rbs 5 there was a constant increase in the adsorption capacity with an increasing ph from 5 to 7 which can be explained by the high concentration of calcium phosphate in this co processing method and according to minh et al 2014 the maximum adsorption efficiency by calcium phosphate is between ph 6 and 7 ph values higher than 7 were avoided to eliminate the potential of lead precipitation thus adsorption will be the dominant lead removal mechanism kariuki et al 2017 besides the adsorption efficiency declines with an increasing ph due to the formation of metal complexes with the negatively charged ligands barka et al 2013 and lópez mesas et al 2011 on the other hand the biomass surface sites are closely linked with h ions at lower ph values in the acidic range which will limit the availability of cations amro et al 2019 furthermore phpzc values were lower than the ph of maximum adsorption capacities which biomass contains a negative charge it can also be observed from fig 4b that the co processed biomass demonstrated superior adsorption behavior compared to the raw biomass regardless of the ph 3 2 3 contact time the effect of the contact time was evaluated by investigating different contact times between the biomass and the adsorbate as shown in fig 4c there was a rapid uptake of lead within the first 5 min of contact time where the removal efficiencies were 64 54 62 60 and 81 for rbs rbs 1 rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 respectively within nearly 40 60 min the equilibrium was attained for all the samples after which minimal variations were observed for the remainder of the contact time in addition the adsorption of the lead ion was rapid and constant as shown in the time vs percent removal which indicates monolayer adsorption of the lead ion on the biomass surface hence the subsequent experiments were conducted using a contact time of 60 min this rapid adsorption phenomenon was reported by other researchers akhtar et al 2004 gabr et al 2008 yinghui liu et al 2009 qaiser et al 2009 tao et al 2015 and is attributed to the vacancy of surface sites which are filled up rapidly the drastic decrease of adsorption later is due to the slow migration and diffusion of lead ions al smadi et al 2019 pap et al 2018 3 2 4 adsorbent amount the effect of different biomass quantities 1 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg was investigated as shown in fig 4d there was a smooth and constant increase in the removal efficiency with an increase in the adsorbent biomass and this is not surprising because increasing the biomass yields a gradual increase in the available active binding sites esaifan et al 2019 sarı and tuzen 2008 tao et al 2015 the removal efficiency approached 100 at 50 mg biomass for the co processed biomass whereas the lead removal efficiency for the raw biomass was nearly 80 at this biomass amount therefore 20 mg of biomass was used for testing the effect of other factors since using 50 mg or more will lead to 100 removal efficiency which will likely eliminate the effect of other factors on the lead removal efficiency 3 2 5 lead ion concentration the effect of different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 mg l using 20 mg biomass and at ph 5 is demonstrated in fig 4e there was a constant decline in the removal efficiency with an increase in the initial lead concentration the highest removal efficiencies were observed at the 10 ppm initial concentration which was 100 for the co processed biomass and 84 4 for the raw biomass at low lead concentrations the ratio of surface active sites to the free ions is high resulting in rapid adsorption reddy et al 2010 tao et al 2015 the diminishing removal efficiency with increasing lead concentration is attributed to the saturation of the available adsorption sites amin et al 2019 3 3 adsorption isotherm the adsorption of lead on raw and co processed biomass was modeled using langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms at different initial lead concentrations 10 50 100 150 and 200 mg l adsorption isotherms are necessary to understand the adsorption mechanisms and the partitioning of the adsorbate between the solid and liquid phases at equilibrium pap et al 2018 in the langmuir model the adsorption is a monolayer process and the process will not proceed after all surface sites are equivalent no stacking the freundlich model on the other hand assumes multilayer adsorption on the heterogeneous surface while the temkin model accounts for the interaction between the adsorbate particles chen et al 2020 elwakeel et al 2018 shariatinia and bagherpour 2018 the three models were compared quantitatively using the coefficient of determination r2 as shown in table 4 and qualitatively using the linearized isotherms as depicted in fig 5 it can be inferred from table 4 that the langmuir model was notably a better fit for the biosorption of lead compared to freundlich and temkin models the r2 values for the langmuir model were nearly a unity for the raw and all co processed biomass samples unlike the other two models where the highest r2 value observed was 0 68 this conclusion can also be confirmed by inspecting the graphical representations of the three models fig 5 it is clear that the langmuir model was an excellent fit for the experimental data over the entire range of lead concentrations while freundlich and temkin models deviated from the observed data at the lower range of lead concentrations this suggests that the adsorption of lead on the raw and co processed biomass is a monolayer process the isotherm parameters for the three models are presented in table 4 and it can be noted that langmuir s maximum capacity q 0 ranges between 22 8 and 35 9 mg g with an average value of 30 5 mg g the langmuir rate of adsorption constant b increased with the increase of biomass processing lowest value was observed at rbs while the highest was observed for rbs 2 which suggests increasing bond energy between the lead ion and the surface particles with biomass co processing forghani et al 2020 the dimensionless separation factor r l derived from the langmuir model are greater than 0 and less than 1 table 5 thus the adsorption process is favorable at higher initial lead concentrations adebisi et al 2017 sarada et al 2014 the freundlich capacity parameter kf increased with the level of biomass co processing which indicates an increase in the affinity to lead adsorption this is in agreement with the earlier conclusion of increasing bond energy with co processing the freundlich n values were between 1 and 4 suggesting a desirable physical adsorption process foroutan et al 2019 several studies reported that the adsorption of lead ions on different biomass types follows the langmuir model for instance yap et al 2017 found that the adsorption of lead by biochar from agricultural biomass was well characterized by the langmuir model the langmuir adsorption capacities reported by guyo et al 2015 for the adsorption of lead by raw and treated maize stover were 19 65 and 27 10 mg g respectively according to coelho et al 2014 the adsorption capacity of lead by cashew nut shell was 28 65 mg g while foroutan et al 2019 observed that the lead adsorption capacity by callinectes sapidus was 31 44 mg g these adsorption capacities are close to the values obtained in our study average 31 04 mg g the langmuir adsorption capacity qo obtained in this study is compared with those obtained by others for different types of biomass and the summary is reported in table 6 3 4 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics experiments were carried out in batch mode for over 80 min to gain a better understanding of the lead adsorption process with respect to time the adsorption kinetic data were modeled using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models an equilibrium between liquid and solid phases is assumed in the former while chemisorption is the limiting factor in the latter al smadi et al 2019 the two models were linearized based on the collected data as described before and the results are presented in fig 6 the parameters of both models were estimated from the slope and intercept of the linearized models as shown in table 7 it can be observed from table 7 that the pseudo second order model is a better fit to the lead adsorption data with r2 value 0 99 for all samples this is also apparent from fig 6 as nearly all observed data points fall onto the straight lines a clear departure from the model lines can be observed in the pseudo first order lines particularly in the first 10 min which can be explained by the fast initial adsorption before the process slows down kowanga et al 2016 therefore the adsorption process follows a pseudo second order model which suggests that the interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate is through valency forces al smadi et al 2019 this is in agreement with several other studies in which the adsorption of lead was concluded to be a chemisorption process basha and murthy 2007 erdem et al 2013 nabizadeh et al 2005 ofomaja et al 2010 the highest equilibrium adsorption capacities pseudo second order were observed for rbs 2 rbs 3 rbs 5 44 05 46 08 and 42 19 mg g respectively however these values are not substantially greater than the raw biomass adsorption capacity 39 21 mg g the lowest adsorption capacity was recorded for rbs 1 25 38 mg g nevertheless the effect of biomass treatment co processing can be attributed to the introduction of different soluble salts from the dead sea water such as magnesium chloride sodium chloride calcium chloride potassium chloride and magnesium bromide al khlaifat 2008 hamid et al 2010 the enhanced adsorption capacity in rbs 2 rbs 3 and rbs 5 can be attributed to the alternation of the active binding sites from h to ca na mg and k as a result of the phosphoric acid and sodium hydroxide treatment rozman et al 2020 akar and tunali 2006 reported that the alkali pretreatment of biomass increases its adsorption capacity yan and viraraghavan 2000 speculated that the enhanced adsorption efficiency due to pretreatment can be explained by the elimination of proteins lipids and polysaccharides which may block the binding sites 3 5 thermodynamic studies the values of h o and s o were estimated from the slope and intercept of the line in fig 7 the values of g o h o and s o for the adsorption process are reported in table 8 the negative g o indicates that the adsorption of pb ii ions onto biomass was spontaneous the g o values for all samples were between 0 and 20 kj mol 1 revealing that the adsorption procedure was physical adsorption while for the chemical adsorption g o is between 80 and 400 kj mol 1 iqbal and khera 2015 the value of g o also improved with the increase in temperature representing that the adsorption was favorable at lower temperatures morosanu et al 2017 the value of h o was negative indicating that the adsorption process was exothermic and this behavior showed that increasing the uptake of pb ii ion from aqueous solution at a lower temperature the entropy s o values were negative suggests that there is a decrease in randomness at the biomass surface solution interface that occurred due to the moved molecules from adsorbent surfaces lost additional translational entropy than was gained by the pb ii ions olu owolabi et al 2012 bhatti et al 2016 4 conclusions in this study lead biosorption by olive leaves extracted biomass was demonstrated several parameters including biomass particle size solution ph contact time adsorbent amount and lead ion concentration were explored results showed that the lead removal efficiency increased with decreasing particle size the adsorption behavior was highly ph dependent with the maximum adsorption of lead at ph 5 for the same ph value the co processed biomass showed higher removal efficiency than the raw biomass most of the adsorption was achieved within 20 min and no significant changes in the removal efficiency were observed after 40 min a continuous increase in the removal efficiency was observed with increasing the adsorbent amount when 50 mg adsorbent was used the removal efficiencies were 100 and 80 for the co processed and raw biomass respectively on the contrary a continuous decline in the removal efficiency with an increase in the initial lead concentration was observed at 10 ppm initial concentration the removal efficiencies were 100 and 84 4 for the co processed and raw biomass respectively we can conclude that the co processed biomass always have higher removal efficiency than raw biomass it was also concluded that the langmuir model was a better fit to the isotherm data compared with the freundlich and temkin models at different initial lead concentrations indicating the adsorption of lead by the olive leaves biomass is a monolayer process the r2 values for the langmuir model were nearly a unity for the raw and co processed biomass where the highest r2 value was 0 68 for the other two models the kinetics data were well modeled by the pseudo second order kinetic model indicating that the lead adsorption process was chemisorption a possible extension of the present study is to investigate the successful utilization of proposed biomass in typical operating conditions continuous water flow which can be addressed in future efforts author statement all persons who meet authorship criteria are listed as authors and all authors certify that they

1306,knowledge of soil water content swc dynamics within soil profiles is crucial for the effective management of water and soil resources this study aims to clarify the temporal variability and stability of swc in a forested critical zone experimental catchment and further to improve the understanding of the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water in a typical hilly catchment in eastern china the selected nandadish ndd catchment covering 0 79 ha was instrumented with 34 swc monitoring sites using frequency domain reflectometry the consecutive high resolution monitoring data of soil water at different depths of the sites were collected from january 2017 to december 2019 the results showed that the swc of the shallow layer 0 30 cm had the strongest variability over time during the three hydrologic years the interannual variability of swc showed the opposite regularity with that of the seasonal variability specifically the spatial variability of swc in the dry years was greater than that in wet years whilst the temporal stability of swc in dry seasons was greater than that in rainy seasons precipitation and temperature were the two dominant factors influencing the temporal variation of swc precipitation controlled the interannual variation of swc while temperature controlled the seasonal variation of swc additionally soil water had high temporal stability throughout the observation period in ndd catchment and the most representative point was located at a relatively flat and central place which can be used to simulate the variability of swc under different rainfall conditions in the study area the temporal stability of swc patterns was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater level in the study area which was characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover this research provides scientific bases for the optimum design of ground sampling and the temporal and spatial prediction for soil moisture in a typical eastern hilly area with forest land uses keywords soil water temporal stability interannual dynamics micro topography critical zone 1 introduction the earth s critical zone cz refers to the thin layer of the earth s surface and near surface terrestrial environment from the top of the vegetation canopy to the bottom of active groundwater nrc 2001 hydrological processes within the cz are crucial for sustaining the material energy cycle lin 2010 soil water content swc is a key factor controlling a range of hydrological and ecological processes in the critical zone wang et al 2015 sprenger et al 2019 ma et al 2020 swc is also one of the key variables controlling the interaction between the surface and groundwater within the cz the distribution of swc at different spatial temporal scales is a vital component of the hydrological process in the cz brantley et al 2007 lin 2014 as a result there is a developing interest in measuring and interpreting the evolution of swc at different spatial temporal scales in order to precisely quantify temporal changes in hydrologic models buttafuoco et al 2005 sela et al 2012 ma et al 2020 rodriguez sinobas et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however the spatial and temporal variations of swc are prone to be affected by numerous environmental factors e g soil texture vegetation topography and groundwater level which present challenges to accurately estimate swc for hydrological models chaney et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the variations of swc in a large range of soil layers have been proven to respond to different types of vegetation restoration jia et al 2013 wang et al 2011 meanwhile the variability of swc plays an important role in the effectiveness of precipitation to recharge groundwater in the critical zone liu et al 2021 previous studies on the temporal variability of swc were mainly focused on the rainfall scale yinglan et al 2018 guo 2020 little attention has been paid on the controlling mechanism of swc variability at seasonal and interannual scales although swc exhibits certain temporal spatial variability characteristics the spatial distribution patterns of which were reported to be relatively stable giving rise to the concept of temporal stability vachaud et al 1985 xu et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 temporal stability is the temporal persistence of the spatial model of swc zhu et al 2017 temporal stability analysis has been proven to be an effective tool for estimating spatial mean swc from point scale observations grayson and western 1998 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 guber et al 2008b which means that one or more locations can be found where the time series of swc are very similar to the time series of average swc across the whole study area once found these sites merely require a small number of soil moisture sensors to monitor the average swc over a large area guber et al 2008a many scholars have attempted to apply the temporal stability theory in multi scale regions with varied land use types for example zhao et al 2020 presented a case study on the temporal stability of gravel covered swc in different planting years providing a theoretical reference for large scale monitoring of swc from a few observations penna et al 2013 selected two small hillslopes with contrasting morphology to identify the representative sampling locations and to assess the temporal stability in wet and dry states to date the temporal stability of swc has been widely examined and successfully applied to areas with different land uses brocca et al 2010 gao and shao 2012 including grassland vachaud et al 1985 cropland guber et al 2008b shrub land williams et al 2009 and forestland lin 2006 penna et al 2013 however few studies have reported the application of temporal stability analysis on soil water dynamics in the critical zone within humid regions e g the eastern china with subtropical climate under forested land use as a matter of fact for those areas with subtropical climate where rainfall is unevenly distributed during the year and varies greatly between years the rainy season is characterized by heavy rainfall and flooding while the dry season is characterized by seasonal drought liu et al 2021 under this circumstance the seasonal and interannual variations of swc may be enlarged the uncertain spatial temporal variability of swc may further increase the uncertainty of runoff formation to a great extent gu et al 2018 which brings enormous pressure to the water and ecological environment of the forest critical zone in the lower yangtze river basin cao et al 2011 yang et al 2012 wang et al 2011 additionally strong human activities have seriously damaged the primary forest vegetation in the hilly areas and the newly replenished vegetation as restore plants usually consume more soil water than those native plants mei et al 2018 which affects the transportation path of soil water and aggravates the spatial heterogeneity of swc to some extent in sum the main controlling factors of spatial temporal variations of swc are still not clear for those forested hilly areas in subtropical eastern china not to mention the analysis on multiple runoff processes and the accurate simulation by hydrological model a forested hilly catchment in subtropical eastern china was selected therefore as the experimental site of forested critical zone over the lower yangtze river basin in this study the purpose of this study is to understand the temporal dynamic and spatial distribution of swc in a typical forested catchment using high resolution observation both in temporal and spatial dimensions and to explore the most temporally stable swc site and the potential driving characteristics of swc in the catchment the present work could provide scientific guidance for swc prediction in eastern china with a subtropical climate particularly for simplifying the dynamic processes of soil water by representing the entire critical zone using the most temporally stable swc site 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nadadish catchment ndd catchment is a small experimental forested catchment managed by the chuzhou scientific hydrology laboratory of nanjing hydraulic research institute located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin 118 12 0 e 32 16 48 n with a covering area of approximately 0 79 ha fig 1 the study area is a low hill landform with a surface slope of 6 7 to 17 1 at different directions and an altitude difference of 12 9 m gu et al 2013 gu et al 2018 the local climate is a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1008 mm and an annual average temperature of 15 4 c during 1951 2016 rainfall shows strong seasonality with more than 80 of the total precipitation occurring during the rainy season from may to october the vegetation in the area is dominated by sawtooth oak and paper mulberry mixed with chinaberry aspen hackberry and locust trees zhang et al 2020 the thickness of soil layer is 0 5 7 m mainly heavy loam medium loam and clay loam the soil structure is mainly blocky and prismatic with fairly developed horizontal and vertical fissures the soil structure also shows high spatial heterogeneity soil samples were collected from 34 locations in the study area table 1 the soil in the study area is mainly divided into four types clay particle diameter 2 00 μm silt particle diameter ranging 2 00 20 00 μm fine sand particle diameter ranging 20 00 200 00 μm and sand particle diameter 200 00 μm table 1 the clay content 29 37 36 10 is relatively high at different depths of three locations in the study area table 1 2 2 experimental setting and data collection different locations at the forested hillslope were selected to investigate the swc variations the 34 swc observation points were evenly distributed in the catchment fig 1 table 2 the frequency domain reflectometry fdr sm 1 adcon austria was used to measure the volumetric swc of different soil profiles with a time interval of 15 min and a depth interval of 10 cm considering the actual soil thickness of each monitoring point the measuring depth range of soil volumetric water content was set 90 150 cm the groundwater level gauges lev01 adcon austria were set up close to each swc monitoring site to observe the groundwater level changes which can assist to understand the relationship between swc and groundwater the observation towers used for observing rainfall at the top of the canopy were installed in the southeast northeast northwest southwest and middle of the ndd experimental catchment tipping bucket rain gauges with a resolution of 0 1 mm were installed on the top of the observation tower sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument factory china and a cr3000 nb data collector campbell scientific inc usa was used to collect rainfall data every 1 min the meteorological data was obtained from a meteorological gradient tower in an open field of the catchment measurements were recorded by a cr3000 nb datalogger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa at 5 min intervals meteorological data were provided by the meteorological field of the chuzhou scientific hydrology laboratory of nanjing hydraulic research institute the mean annual precipitation in the study area from 1951 to 2016 was 1008 mm annual rainfall in the year 2017 2018 and 2019 was 1416 mm 1268 mm and 614 mm respectively according to the classification criteria in the specifications for hydrological information forecasting gb t22482 2008 the year 2017 was an exceptionally wet year 2018 was a wet year and 2019 was an extremely dry year therefore the three years 2017 2018 and 2019 were chosen as the typical hydrological years of different rainfall conditions to study the temporal changes of swc the uniform distribution of sites in the ndd catchment was to study the spatial variability of swc within forestland areas 2 3 statistical analyses 2 3 1 classical statistical methods the distribution of swc in the study area was calculated using classical statistical methods the coefficient of variation cv and the standard deviation were calculated to describe the spatial temporal distribution and variability of swc the variability of swc can be classified according to the cv hu et al 2010 with cv 10 indicating the low variation 10 cv 100 indicating the moderate variation and cv 100 indicating the high variation zhang 2005 2 3 2 correlation analysis the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test was used to test the consistency or similarity of the swc spatial pattern at varying time scales the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s is defined by the following equation vachaud et al 1985 1 r s 1 6 j 1 n r ij r i j n n 2 1 where n is the number of observation sites in the study area r ij is the rank of observation site i at time j and r ij is the rank of observation site i at time j the closer the value of r s to 1 the stronger the temporal stability of swc 2 3 3 assessing temporal stability of soil water along the profiles the mean relative difference plot is the main tool to perform temporal stability analysis cosh et al 2008 the relative difference at sampling location i for sampling event j at depth k is defined as vachaud et al 1985 2 δ ijk θ ijk θ jk θ jk a temporal mean relative difference mrd and its standard deviation sdrd over time is calculated as 3 mrd ik 1 m j 1 m δ ijk 4 sdrd ik 1 m 1 j 1 m δ ijk mrd ik 2 mrd ik is the computed mean relative difference of swc at depth k among all sampling locations for a given time i m is the total number of sampling events for a given depth those locations having both the nearest zero mrd and low value of sdrd can be directly used to estimate mean swc martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal characteristics of swc in diverse soil layers fig 2 showed the changes of swc in 0 150 cm layers under different rainfall conditions i e different hydrological years the average swc swc in 2017 was the highest swc 23 80 followed by 2018 swc 23 69 and 2019 swc 22 55 which were consistent with the annual rainfall recordings the temporal averaged swc in the0 30 cm0 30 cm layer swc 22 28 had a relatively lower value than that in the 40 60 cm40 60 cm layer swc 23 29 and 70 150 cm layer swc 23 72 from 2017 to 2019 in the study area indicating that swc increased with soil depths the cv of swc in the 0 30 cm layer was greater than 10 during 2017 2019 fig 2 the temporal variation of the mean swc occurred mainly in the 0 30 cm layer the cv values of swc in 2017 and 2018 were all lower than 10 average cv cv 8 0 and 8 1 respectively while that in 2019 was higher than 10 cv 11 2 the cv of swc below 20 cm soil layer was less than 10 from 2017 to 2018 fig 2 this indicated that the variability of swc decreased as soil depth increased fig 2 the cv of swc 0 90 cm was greater than 10 in 2019 therefore the swc of shallow soil layers was more fluctuant than that of deep soils meanwhile the cv values of swc decreased with increased depth in the wet years while cv values of swc showed moderate variation with no obvious pattern of variation with depth in the dry year fig 2 as shown in fig 3 large fluctuation in temporal swc changes was observed in the 0 30 cm layer from 4 43 to 27 78 whilst greater temporal stability of swc was found in deep soil layers the mean swc increased with the increased soil depth during 2017 2019 in addition the stratification of swc in different soil layers was more obvious in 2017 and 2018 compared with 2019 also the temporal variation in swc was evident from april to october for the three soil layers indicating that the swc of the three soil layers changed seasonally according to spearman s correlation analysis the temporal variation of mean swc in the 0 30 cm layer showed a significant negative correlation with the temporal variation of mean temperature from april to september in 2017 2019 ρ 0 22 p 0 01 fig 3 3 2 temporal patterns of swc in the forested experimental catchment 3 2 1 temporal patterns of swc for the three soil layers spearman s correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlation between swc at different depths for the three years 2017 2019 it was found that most of the correlation coefficients were significant p 0 05 fig 4 indicating strong temporal stability in the three layers as evidenced by the smaller coefficients the correlation appeared to decrease with increasing time lags indicating that the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers fig 4 the coefficients for the dataset from january to october in 2017 decreased from 0 85 to 0 50 with the time lags increasing in the 0 30 cm soil layer fig 4 with an increase in the same time lags the coefficients decreased from 0 97 to 0 43 for the 70 150 cm soil layers in 2017 the coefficients decreased from 0 91 to 0 86 and from 0 99 to 0 57 for the 0 30 cm and 70 150 cm soil layers in 2018 respectively this indicated that the time lags had larger influence on the temporal patterns of swc in deep soil layers in the wet years the coefficients decreased from 0 78 to 0 66 from 0 77 to 0 70 and from 0 41 to 0 37 for the 0 30 cm 40 60 cm and 70 150 cm soil layers in 2019 respectively based on the spearman s correlation coefficients the similarity of temporal swc patterns i e monthly swc distribution pattern at seasonal scale decreased largely for the different soil layers with the increased time lags in addition as the annual rainfall decreased the similarity of temporal patterns decreased greatly in the wet years 2017 2018 the temporal pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was lower than that of the deep soil layer while in the dry year 2019 the temporal pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was higher than that of the deep soil layer the effect of time lags on the temporal stability of spatial patterns was thus a function of soil depth and precipitation these results could provide illumination for identifying the period of validity of the temporal stability that the simulation of swc using temporal stability is time sensitive and could be better simulated in years due to the time lag 3 2 2 temporal stability of swc for the different soil layers fig 5 shows the mean relative differences mrds and standard deviation sdrd for the study period at different depths most locations for a given depth reflected the temporal stability of swc in the study area with the relatively near zero mrd 0 01 0 1 and relatively low sdrd values 1 14 the ranges between the minimum and maximum values of mrd were larger in shallow soil during 2017 2019 table 3 fig 5 the decreasing ranges of mrd might be ascribed to the stronger spatial stability of swc with the increased soil depth fig 5 the range values of mrd were smaller for the soil layers at 40 90 cm during the study period the location f29 showed the maximum absolute values of mrd and sdrd indicating the lowest temporal stability of swc the observation site f 29 was located at the edge of the study area table 2 also the temporal stability of swc was also weaker for site f15 f26 f28 and f31 where the absolute values of mrd and sdrd were greater than other locations fig 5 it can be found that all those observation sites were located on steep slopes near the edge of the study area fig 1 table 2 suggesting that locations near catchment boundaries and steep slopes may lead to the increased variability in swc the average sdrd sdrd of the topsoil was highest sdrd 4 05 in 2017 and that of the 70 90 cm soil layer sdrd 1 91 was the lowest indicating that swc of the 70 90 cm soil layer had the strongest temporal stability in the study area consistently the average sdrd sdrd 5 42 and 6 36 of the 0 30 cm layer was also highest in 2018 and 2019 the averaged sdrd sdrd 2 16 and 2 62 of the 40 60 cm soil layer was the most temporally stable with the lowest values indicating that soil layer with the strongest temporal stability was closer to the surface soil in 2018 2019 than in 2017 generally the mean values of sdrd increased with the decreased annual rainfall table 3 these results indicated that the swc of the soil layers at 40 90 cm had the strongest stability in the study area and the greater the annual rainfall the greater the stability of swc 3 3 mean swc estimation using temporal stability in the 10 30 cm depth interval the location f12 and f30 were the most temporally stable as presented by the lowest sdrd values in 2017 2 02 and 2 09 and 2018 3 05 and 3 53 meanwhile the location f27 f30 and f12 had the lowest sdrd values 3 35 3 62 and 3 76 in 2019 for the 40 60 cm depth the three most stable locations were at f28 f30 and f12 in 2017 0 95 1 34 and 1 41 meanwhile the site f27 f30 and f12 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 1 31 1 45 and 1 78 in 2018 the most temporally stable locations with the three lowest sdrd values were f1 f12 and f16 1 31 1 45 and 1 78 in 2019 in the 70 90 cm depth interval f12 f28 and f16 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 0 86 0 87 and 1 19 in 2017 and f12 f29 and f16 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 1 45 1 48 and 1 90 in 2018 while f16 f01 and f12were the three locations with the lowest sdrd values 1 43 1 43 and 1 81 in 2019 for the 100 150 cm depth interval the location f15 f16 and f12 were the three locations with the lowest sdrd value 1 2 1 5 and 2 19 the location f15 f16 f12 1 86 2 31 and 2 32 in 2018 and f01 f16 and f12 1 60 1 82 and 2 01 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values in 2018 and 2019 respectively the sdrd values were between 1 2 and 3 6 during 2017 2019 it can be found that all the sdrd values of f12 f16 and f30 in different soil layers from 2017 to 2019 were low and the swc at those locations was characterized by extreme temporal stability the mean values of sdrd in 2017 2019 were 2 54 3 29 and 3 17 respectively which was negatively correlated with annual rainfall r 1 p 0 05 r2 0 90 sites with sdrd values under 5 were taken to be temporally stable starks et al 2006 hu et al 2010 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 defined those locations with the lowest sdrd values as representative of the mean value of swc for that specific depth two locations for each soil layer with minimum sdrd values were selected to simulate the swc of each layer the location f12 and f30 for 10 30 cm and 40 60 cm f12 and f16 for 70 90 cm and 100 150 cm depth and location f12 for 0 150 cm depth were selected as rmse root mean square error for the corresponding depth the linear fitting analysis indicated that the selected rmses could well estimate the mean swc for the study area table 4 the regression analysis of the mean value of swc and the representative measurement points indicated that the variation range of the determination coefficient r2 was 0 686 0 951 suggesting that the representative point has well reflected the corresponding swc of the soil layer the location f12 as the extremely stable point of swc had a high correlation with the swc of each soil layer and all soil layers in the study area the relationship between the mean swc of representative measuring sites and the mean swc of all soil layers for the study period was characterized by the linear equation y 1 13 3 2 r2 0 951 the comparison between the simulated swc by the representative location f12 and the measured swc of the area showed that the representative location could simulate the regional swc very well in the study area fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the temporal variability of swc at various depths soil water is the main body of water storage in forest ecosystems and rainfall is the primary source of soil water recharge venkatesh et al 2011 lusheng et al 2017 compared with other soil layers the swc of the 0 30 cm layer showed the strongest variability over time zhao et al 2020 also found the swc of shallow layers had a stronger variability over time than that of deep layers several environmental factors especially temperature may cause greater variability in the shallow soil layer than in the lower layers fig 3 table 5 the deep soil layer was less affected by external environmental factors due to the insulation by the 0 30 cm soil layer table 5 the response of different soil layers to external environmental factors varied significantly which resulted in higher vertical spatial variation in 0 30 cm soils than in deep layers compared to 2017 and 2018 the cv value of swc for the soil layers was the largest in 2019 the variability of annual swc was low in years with high precipitation during the dry year soil water hardly moved as it was difficult for the soil to reach saturation whilst soils gradually became near saturated in the wet year and soil water can easily move from regions of higher soil water potential to regions of lower potential which decreased the spatial variability of swc penna et al 2009 rainfall had a large impact on swc variability in the study area besides vegetation growth was poor due to the lack of precipitation in dry years zhang et al 2019 which increased the variability of evapotranspiration in the study area and indirectly affected the swc table 5 owing to the decrease in precipitation plants need to obtain water from deep soil layers thus increased the variability of swc in deep soil layers during dry years therefore the variability of swc in the dry years was greater than that in the wet years however the variability of swc was greater in the rainy season than in the dry season the relationship between the seasonal variability of swc and rainfall was contrary to the relationship between the inter annual variability of swc and rainfall the temporal variability of swc was high from april to september especially in the 0 30 cm soil layer which received more than two thirds of the annual rainfall during this period takegi and lin 2012 also found obvious seasonal changes in swc of 0 30 cm layers during the rainy season in april as the temperature rose the vegetation entered the growth period and the water demand increased sharply which caused the swc in the topsoil to decrease with the advent of the rainy season the swc of the topsoil rose rapidly as the temperature rose evaporation and transpiration increased simultaneously leading to further changes in surface swc the high variability of surface swc would affect vegetation growth in the context of climate warming temperature changes have a greater impact on swc which can further affect hydroecological processes in the catchment therefore it is essential to raise awareness and analyze the variation of soil water content in each region the cv values of swc decreased with increasing depth in the wet years considering the influencing factors of swc the deep soil was less affected by the evaporation given that they were severed by the topsoil from being directly exposed to the atmospheric environment soil water maintains the mobility of water in the soil as a result of effectively receiving recharge from precipitation in the wet year while cv values of swc were relatively large with no obvious pattern of variation with depth in dry year soil water activity decreases in dry years when it is less recharged by external precipitation and soil water is regulated by the internal structure and texture of the soil korsunskaya et al 1995 gao and shao 2012 soil structure and texture heterogeneity result in no significant vertical distribution pattern of soil water variability 4 2 temporal stability analysis of swc in the three soil layers sdrd is widely used to describe the temporal stability of swc in this study the results of temporal stability as indicated by sdrd coincided with those based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient under different hydrological years the strongest temporal stability was found in the 40 90 cm soil layer based on sdrd values table 3 the water holding capacity of the soil was stronger with higher clay content entin et al 2000 jacobs et al 2004 jacobs et al 2010 the clay content showed a decreasing trend at different slope positions in the study area tabel 1 but the topsoil layer was not the most stable location for swc this is because the topsoil is more easily influenced by external variables e g precipitation temperature by contrast soil layers at 40 90 cm reduced dependence on the climatic biological and hydrological factors that determine the dynamics of swc guber et al 2008a gao and shao 2012 in addition the swc of the deepest soil layers was related to shallow groundwater level table 5 the shallow groundwater level in the study area varied with time due to the uneven distribution of rainfall seasons which led to the relatively instability of swc at the deepest soil layers compared with other research areas cosh et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the values of mrd and sdrd were very low in this study area in fact the sdrd values were all less than 5 and the mrd values were all close to 0 in the study area zhao et al 2010 indicating that the time stability of swc was relatively strong such stability could be explained to a large extent by relationships between soil texture and water content vachaud et al 1985 this may be related to the higher clay content in the study area table 1 jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 in addition the vegetation type in the study area was woodland which was a mature ecosystem with relatively stable hydrothermal conditions the sdrd values and the mrd range values at different soil depths increased over time during 2017 2019 this result indicated that the temporal stability of swc in this study area was stronger in the wetter years the degree of temporal stability in drier versus wetter locations has been debated some authors have found greater stability for drier locations cosh et al 2008 guber et al 2008 such research mostly occurred in arid and semi arid regions where the drier the climate the more stable the swc however the reverse is the case in the wet zones williams et al 2009 in our study as the annual precipitation decreased the most stable layer of swc appeared at a shallower location from 70 100 cm to 40 60 cm table 3 fig 5 according to previous results the high temporal stability under wet conditions may be related to the enhanced capillary movement of water from the subsoil to the surface soil which reduced the temporal variation of surface swc williams et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 the critical periods in terms of temporal stability are those in which the recharge of water in the profile occurs martinez fernandez and ceballos 2003 therefore when rainfall decreases the relative decrease in soil water recharge to the deep layers could lead to an increase in swc variability in the study area there were some locations f12 f16 f30 where the temporal stability of swc was extremely strong fig 5 the f12 was extremely stable location even in the dry year the time stable location had a relatively gentle slope and a relatively flat surface compared to other places with steep slopes e g f15 f26 f28 f29 and f31 in the study area fig 1 table3 grayson and western 1998 jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the temporal stability of swc in the central of the basin was stronger than that at the edge of the basin in terms of the soil texture the central part of the soil exhibited the highest clay content and high soil water holding capacity which led to the strong temporal stability of swc as with zhang et al 2019 throughfall at these locations had extreme temporal stability which affected the temporal stability of the swc by measuring the time distribution of the groundwater level it was found that the groundwater level at f12 f16 and f30 fluctuated little over time which may indirectly lead to the extreme stability of the swc in this area in conclusion soil properties clay content topography geographic location throughfall and the variability of groundwater level should be comprehensively considered when identifying the time stable locations of one study area 4 3 temporal patterns analysis of swc in the three soil layers many studies have focused on the relationship between temporal patterns of soil water and soil depth cassel et al 2000 guber et al 2008b gao and shao 2012 in the present work the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers on the forested critical zone experimental block rainfall was the main resource for soil water the replenishment of soil water by a precipitation event was profound and lasting especially in forest ecosystems lin 2006 as a result of the high rate of woodland coverage in the study area and the process of vegetation interception the time for penetrating rain to reach the ground was longer thereby increasing the time for precipitation to infiltrate the ground the high clay content with strong water holding capacity further aggravated the time lags in the study area jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the time lags had more influence on the temporal patterns of swc in deep soil layers in dry years than in the wet years the swc decreased with the decline in rainfall which needed more time to move in the soil profile in the wet years 2017 2018 the time pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was lower than that of the deep soil layer whilst in the dry year 2019 the time pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was higher than that of the deep soil layer a continuously operating swc sensor network and a more detailed analysis of forest fields are thus necessary to corroborate all the results we obtained the temporal stability of a particular location and depth can be a good predictor of the utility of this location for estimating the area averaged swc at different depths temporal stability could be efficiently used to correct area average water content for missing data swc can be upscaled and efficiently monitored using the temporal stability of swc patterns guber et al 2008a our results provide valuable supporting evidence for soil water content management and hydrologic applications knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of swc promotes the effective use of soil water while providing a prerequisite basis for the study of hydrological processes the factors affecting swc differed at seasonal and interannual scales temperature has a critical role in soil horizons during the rainy season and the superimposed effect of rainfall and temperature results in high variability in the soil profile the crucial factor controlling the interannual variability of soil water is rainfall and a decrease in annual rainfall increases the variability of swc in the study area this work would be an asset to proper management of water resource in similar regions the temporal stability of swc patterns in the study area was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater levels with the area characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover finding a single representative site with temporal stability to estimate mean swc at several depths for a large area can reduce the costs of measurement and save time the soil water movement trajectory of the representative site is more stable so it can represent the soil water movement path and infiltration mode in the study area to a high degree therefore the study of the temporal stability of swc can also contribute to the study on soil hydraulics 5 conclusions based on the datasets of the swc within 0 150 cm layers at 34 locations on the forested critical zone experimental block the following conclusions were drawn 1 the temporal variability for swc decreased with increasing soil depth in the study area the swc of topsoil was strongly influenced by temperature and evaporation and deep swc was strongly influenced by groundwater level the variability of the swc in dry years was greater than that in wet years while the temporal stability of the swc in the dry season was greater than that in the rainy season precipitation controlled the interannual variation of swc while temperature controlled the seasonal variation of swc 2 the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers the time lag had less effect on the temporal pattern of swc in deep soils in wet years but more effect on that in dry years in wet years the temporal pattern was less similar in shallow soils than in deep soils while the opposite regularity was found in dry years 3 the locations representative of field mean swc were identified in all four layers the time stable location had a relatively flat surface in the central of the watershed and stable groundwater level with the high clay content where throughfall had temporal stability the temporal stability of swc patterns was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater level an area characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover the results presented herein provide evidence for the existence of time stable locations in the catchment and a reliable method to estimate field mean soil moisture from point based observations in this area the method should provide useful information for soil water management in this area authors contributions haowen

1306,knowledge of soil water content swc dynamics within soil profiles is crucial for the effective management of water and soil resources this study aims to clarify the temporal variability and stability of swc in a forested critical zone experimental catchment and further to improve the understanding of the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water in a typical hilly catchment in eastern china the selected nandadish ndd catchment covering 0 79 ha was instrumented with 34 swc monitoring sites using frequency domain reflectometry the consecutive high resolution monitoring data of soil water at different depths of the sites were collected from january 2017 to december 2019 the results showed that the swc of the shallow layer 0 30 cm had the strongest variability over time during the three hydrologic years the interannual variability of swc showed the opposite regularity with that of the seasonal variability specifically the spatial variability of swc in the dry years was greater than that in wet years whilst the temporal stability of swc in dry seasons was greater than that in rainy seasons precipitation and temperature were the two dominant factors influencing the temporal variation of swc precipitation controlled the interannual variation of swc while temperature controlled the seasonal variation of swc additionally soil water had high temporal stability throughout the observation period in ndd catchment and the most representative point was located at a relatively flat and central place which can be used to simulate the variability of swc under different rainfall conditions in the study area the temporal stability of swc patterns was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater level in the study area which was characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover this research provides scientific bases for the optimum design of ground sampling and the temporal and spatial prediction for soil moisture in a typical eastern hilly area with forest land uses keywords soil water temporal stability interannual dynamics micro topography critical zone 1 introduction the earth s critical zone cz refers to the thin layer of the earth s surface and near surface terrestrial environment from the top of the vegetation canopy to the bottom of active groundwater nrc 2001 hydrological processes within the cz are

sprenger et al 2019 ma et al 2020 swc is also one of the key variables controlling the interaction between the surface and groundwater within the cz the distribution of swc at different spatial temporal scales is a vital component of the hydrological process in the cz brantley et al 2007 lin 2014 as a result there is a developing interest in measuring and interpreting the evolution of swc at different spatial temporal scales in order to precisely quantify temporal changes in hydrologic models buttafuoco et al 2005 sela et al 2012 ma et al 2020 rodriguez sinobas et al 2021 wang et al 2021 however the spatial and temporal variations of swc are prone to be affected by numerous environmental factors e g soil texture vegetation topography and groundwater level which present challenges to accurately estimate swc for hydrological models chaney et al 2015 wang et al 2015 the variations of swc in a large range of soil layers have been proven to respond to different types of vegetation restoration jia et al 2013 wang et al 2011 meanwhile the variability of swc plays an important role in the effectiveness of precipitation to recharge groundwater in the critical zone liu et al 2021 previous studies on the temporal variability of swc were mainly focused on the rainfall scale yinglan et al 2018 guo 2020 little attention has been paid on the controlling mechanism of swc variability at seasonal and interannual scales although swc exhibits certain temporal spatial variability characteristics the spatial distribution patterns of which were reported to be relatively stable giving rise to the concept of temporal stability vachaud et al 1985 xu et al 2016 cheng et al 2017 temporal stability is the temporal persistence of the spatial model of swc zhu et al 2017 temporal stability analysis has been proven to be an effective tool for estimating spatial mean swc from point scale observations grayson and western 1998 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 guber et al 2008b which means that one or more locations can be found where the time series of swc are very similar to the time series of average swc across the whole study area once found these sites merely require a small number of soil moisture sensors to monitor the average swc over a large area guber et al 2008a many scholars have attempted to apply the temporal stability theory in multi scale regions with varied land use types for example zhao et al 2020 presented a case study on the temporal stability of gravel covered swc in different planting years providing a theoretical reference for large scale monitoring of swc from a few observations penna et al 2013 selected two small hillslopes with contrasting morphology to identify the representative sampling locations and to assess the temporal stability in wet and dry states to date the temporal stability of swc has been widely examined and successfully applied to areas with different land uses brocca et al 2010 gao and shao 2012 including grassland vachaud et al 1985 cropland guber et al 2008b shrub land williams et al 2009 and forestland lin 2006 penna et al 2013 however few studies have reported the application of temporal stability analysis on soil water dynamics in the critical zone within humid regions e g the eastern china with subtropical climate under forested land use as a matter of fact for those areas with subtropical climate where rainfall is unevenly distributed during the year and varies greatly between years the rainy season is characterized by heavy rainfall and flooding while the dry season is characterized by seasonal drought liu et al 2021 under this circumstance the seasonal and interannual variations of swc may be enlarged the uncertain spatial temporal variability of swc may further increase the uncertainty of runoff formation to a great extent gu et al 2018 which brings enormous pressure to the water and ecological environment of the forest critical zone in the lower yangtze river basin cao et al 2011 yang et al 2012 wang et al 2011 additionally strong human activities have seriously damaged the primary forest vegetation in the hilly areas and the newly replenished vegetation as restore plants usually consume more soil water than those native plants mei et al 2018 which affects the transportation path of soil water and aggravates the spatial heterogeneity of swc to some extent in sum the main controlling factors of spatial temporal variations of swc are still not clear for those forested hilly areas in subtropical eastern china not to mention the analysis on multiple runoff processes and the accurate simulation by hydrological model a forested hilly catchment in subtropical eastern china was selected therefore as the experimental site of forested critical zone over the lower yangtze river basin in this study the purpose of this study is to understand the temporal dynamic and spatial distribution of swc in a typical forested catchment using high resolution observation both in temporal and spatial dimensions and to explore the most temporally stable swc site and the potential driving characteristics of swc in the catchment the present work could provide scientific guidance for swc prediction in eastern china with a subtropical climate particularly for simplifying the dynamic processes of soil water by representing the entire critical zone using the most temporally stable swc site 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the nadadish catchment ndd catchment is a small experimental forested catchment managed by the chuzhou scientific hydrology laboratory of nanjing hydraulic research institute located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river basin 118 12 0 e 32 16 48 n with a covering area of approximately 0 79 ha fig 1 the study area is a low hill landform with a surface slope of 6 7 to 17 1 at different directions and an altitude difference of 12 9 m gu et al 2013 gu et al 2018 the local climate is a moderate subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1008 mm and an annual average temperature of 15 4 c during 1951 2016 rainfall shows strong seasonality with more than 80 of the total precipitation occurring during the rainy season from may to october the vegetation in the area is dominated by sawtooth oak and paper mulberry mixed with chinaberry aspen hackberry and locust trees zhang et al 2020 the thickness of soil layer is 0 5 7 m mainly heavy loam medium loam and clay loam the soil structure is mainly blocky and prismatic with fairly developed horizontal and vertical fissures the soil structure also shows high spatial heterogeneity soil samples were collected from 34 locations in the study area table 1 the soil in the study area is mainly divided into four types clay particle diameter 2 00 μm silt particle diameter ranging 2 00 20 00 μm fine sand particle diameter ranging 20 00 200 00 μm and sand particle diameter 200 00 μm table 1 the clay content 29 37 36 10 is relatively high at different depths of three locations in the study area table 1 2 2 experimental setting and data collection different locations at the forested hillslope were selected to investigate the swc variations the 34 swc observation points were evenly distributed in the catchment fig 1 table 2 the frequency domain reflectometry fdr sm 1 adcon austria was used to measure the volumetric swc of different soil profiles with a time interval of 15 min and a depth interval of 10 cm considering the actual soil thickness of each monitoring point the measuring depth range of soil volumetric water content was set 90 150 cm the groundwater level gauges lev01 adcon austria were set up close to each swc monitoring site to observe the groundwater level changes which can assist to understand the relationship between swc and groundwater the observation towers used for observing rainfall at the top of the canopy were installed in the southeast northeast northwest southwest and middle of the ndd experimental catchment tipping bucket rain gauges with a resolution of 0 1 mm were installed on the top of the observation tower sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument factory china and a cr3000 nb data collector campbell scientific inc usa was used to collect rainfall data every 1 min the meteorological data was obtained from a meteorological gradient tower in an open field of the catchment measurements were recorded by a cr3000 nb datalogger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa at 5 min intervals meteorological data were provided by the meteorological field of the chuzhou scientific hydrology laboratory of nanjing hydraulic research institute the mean annual precipitation in the study area from 1951 to 2016 was 1008 mm annual rainfall in the year 2017 2018 and 2019 was 1416 mm 1268 mm and 614 mm respectively according to the classification criteria in the specifications for hydrological information forecasting gb t22482 2008 the year 2017 was an exceptionally wet year 2018 was a wet year and 2019 was an extremely dry year therefore the three years 2017 2018 and 2019 were chosen as the typical hydrological years of different rainfall conditions to study the temporal changes of swc the uniform distribution of sites in the ndd catchment was to study the spatial variability of swc within forestland areas 2 3 statistical analyses 2 3 1 classical statistical methods the distribution of swc in the study area was calculated using classical statistical methods the coefficient of variation cv and the standard deviation were calculated to describe the spatial temporal distribution and variability of swc the variability of swc can be classified according to the cv hu et al 2010 with cv 10 indicating the low variation 10 cv 100 indicating the moderate variation and cv 100 indicating the high variation zhang 2005 2 3 2 correlation analysis the non parametric spearman s rank correlation test was used to test the consistency or similarity of the swc spatial pattern at varying time scales the spearman s rank correlation coefficient r s is defined by the following equation vachaud et al 1985 1 r s 1 6 j 1 n r ij r i j n n 2 1 where n is the number of observation sites in the study area r ij is the rank of observation site i at time j and r ij is the rank of observation site i at time j the closer the value of r s to 1 the stronger the temporal stability of swc 2 3 3 assessing temporal stability of soil water along the profiles the mean relative difference plot is the main tool to perform temporal stability analysis cosh et al 2008 the relative difference at sampling location i for sampling event j at depth k is defined as vachaud et al 1985 2 δ ijk θ ijk θ jk θ jk a temporal mean relative difference mrd and its standard deviation sdrd over time is calculated as 3 mrd ik 1 m j 1 m δ ijk 4 sdrd ik 1 m 1 j 1 m δ ijk mrd ik 2 mrd ik is the computed mean relative difference of swc at depth k among all sampling locations for a given time i m is the total number of sampling events for a given depth those locations having both the nearest zero mrd and low value of sdrd can be directly used to estimate mean swc martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal characteristics of swc in diverse soil layers fig 2 showed the changes of swc in 0 150 cm layers under different rainfall conditions i e different hydrological years the average swc swc in 2017 was the highest swc 23 80 followed by 2018 swc 23 69 and 2019 swc 22 55 which were consistent with the annual rainfall recordings the temporal averaged swc in the0 30 cm0 30 cm layer swc 22 28 had a relatively lower value than that in the 40 60 cm40 60 cm layer swc 23 29 and 70 150 cm layer swc 23 72 from 2017 to 2019 in the study area indicating that swc increased with soil depths the cv of swc in the 0 30 cm layer was greater than 10 during 2017 2019 fig 2 the temporal variation of the mean swc occurred mainly in the 0 30 cm layer the cv values of swc in 2017 and 2018 were all lower than 10 average cv cv 8 0 and 8 1 respectively while that in 2019 was higher than 10 cv 11 2 the cv of swc below 20 cm soil layer was less than 10 from 2017 to 2018 fig 2 this indicated that the variability of swc decreased as soil depth increased fig 2 the cv of swc 0 90 cm was greater than 10 in 2019 therefore the swc of shallow soil layers was more fluctuant than that of deep soils meanwhile the cv values of swc decreased with increased depth in the wet years while cv values of swc showed moderate variation with no obvious pattern of variation with depth in the dry year fig 2 as shown in fig 3 large fluctuation in temporal swc changes was observed in the 0 30 cm layer from 4 43 to 27 78 whilst greater temporal stability of swc was found in deep soil layers the mean swc increased with the increased soil depth during 2017 2019 in addition the stratification of swc in different soil layers was more obvious in 2017 and 2018 compared with 2019 also the temporal variation in swc was evident from april to october for the three soil layers indicating that the swc of the three soil layers changed seasonally according to spearman s correlation analysis the temporal variation of mean swc in the 0 30 cm layer showed a significant negative correlation with the temporal variation of mean temperature from april to september in 2017 2019 ρ 0 22 p 0 01 fig 3 3 2 temporal patterns of swc in the forested experimental catchment 3 2 1 temporal patterns of swc for the three soil layers spearman s correlation analysis was used to investigate the correlation between swc at different depths for the three years 2017 2019 it was found that most of the correlation coefficients were significant p 0 05 fig 4 indicating strong temporal stability in the three layers as evidenced by the smaller coefficients the correlation appeared to decrease with increasing time lags indicating that the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers fig 4 the coefficients for the dataset from january to october in 2017 decreased from 0 85 to 0 50 with the time lags increasing in the 0 30 cm soil layer fig 4 with an increase in the same time lags the coefficients decreased from 0 97 to 0 43 for the 70 150 cm soil layers in 2017 the coefficients decreased from 0 91 to 0 86 and from 0 99 to 0 57 for the 0 30 cm and 70 150 cm soil layers in 2018 respectively this indicated that the time lags had larger influence on the temporal patterns of swc in deep soil layers in the wet years the coefficients decreased from 0 78 to 0 66 from 0 77 to 0 70 and from 0 41 to 0 37 for the 0 30 cm 40 60 cm and 70 150 cm soil layers in 2019 respectively based on the spearman s correlation coefficients the similarity of temporal swc patterns i e monthly swc distribution pattern at seasonal scale decreased largely for the different soil layers with the increased time lags in addition as the annual rainfall decreased the similarity of temporal patterns decreased greatly in the wet years 2017 2018 the temporal pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was lower than that of the deep soil layer while in the dry year 2019 the temporal pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was higher than that of the deep soil layer the effect of time lags on the temporal stability of spatial patterns was thus a function of soil depth and precipitation these results could provide illumination for identifying the period of validity of the temporal stability that the simulation of swc using temporal stability is time sensitive and could be better simulated in years due to the time lag 3 2 2 temporal stability of swc for the different soil layers fig 5 shows the mean relative differences mrds and standard deviation sdrd for the study period at different depths most locations for a given depth reflected the temporal stability of swc in the study area with the relatively near zero mrd 0 01 0 1 and relatively low sdrd values 1 14 the ranges between the minimum and maximum values of mrd were larger in shallow soil during 2017 2019 table 3 fig 5 the decreasing ranges of mrd might be ascribed to the stronger spatial stability of swc with the increased soil depth fig 5 the range values of mrd were smaller for the soil layers at 40 90 cm during the study period the location f29 showed the maximum absolute values of mrd and sdrd indicating the lowest temporal stability of swc the observation site f 29 was located at the edge of the study area table 2 also the temporal stability of swc was also weaker for site f15 f26 f28 and f31 where the absolute values of mrd and sdrd were greater than other locations fig 5 it can be found that all those observation sites were located on steep slopes near the edge of the study area fig 1 table 2 suggesting that locations near catchment boundaries and steep slopes may lead to the increased variability in swc the average sdrd sdrd of the topsoil was highest sdrd 4 05 in 2017 and that of the 70 90 cm soil layer sdrd 1 91 was the lowest indicating that swc of the 70 90 cm soil layer had the strongest temporal stability in the study area consistently the average sdrd sdrd 5 42 and 6 36 of the 0 30 cm layer was also highest in 2018 and 2019 the averaged sdrd sdrd 2 16 and 2 62 of the 40 60 cm soil layer was the most temporally stable with the lowest values indicating that soil layer with the strongest temporal stability was closer to the surface soil in 2018 2019 than in 2017 generally the mean values of sdrd increased with the decreased annual rainfall table 3 these results indicated that the swc of the soil layers at 40 90 cm had the strongest stability in the study area and the greater the annual rainfall the greater the stability of swc 3 3 mean swc estimation using temporal stability in the 10 30 cm depth interval the location f12 and f30 were the most temporally stable as presented by the lowest sdrd values in 2017 2 02 and 2 09 and 2018 3 05 and 3 53 meanwhile the location f27 f30 and f12 had the lowest sdrd values 3 35 3 62 and 3 76 in 2019 for the 40 60 cm depth the three most stable locations were at f28 f30 and f12 in 2017 0 95 1 34 and 1 41 meanwhile the site f27 f30 and f12 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 1 31 1 45 and 1 78 in 2018 the most temporally stable locations with the three lowest sdrd values were f1 f12 and f16 1 31 1 45 and 1 78 in 2019 in the 70 90 cm depth interval f12 f28 and f16 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 0 86 0 87 and 1 19 in 2017 and f12 f29 and f16 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values 1 45 1 48 and 1 90 in 2018 while f16 f01 and f12were the three locations with the lowest sdrd values 1 43 1 43 and 1 81 in 2019 for the 100 150 cm depth interval the location f15 f16 and f12 were the three locations with the lowest sdrd value 1 2 1 5 and 2 19 the location f15 f16 f12 1 86 2 31 and 2 32 in 2018 and f01 f16 and f12 1 60 1 82 and 2 01 were the three most temporally stable with the lowest sdrd values in 2018 and 2019 respectively the sdrd values were between 1 2 and 3 6 during 2017 2019 it can be found that all the sdrd values of f12 f16 and f30 in different soil layers from 2017 to 2019 were low and the swc at those locations was characterized by extreme temporal stability the mean values of sdrd in 2017 2019 were 2 54 3 29 and 3 17 respectively which was negatively correlated with annual rainfall r 1 p 0 05 r2 0 90 sites with sdrd values under 5 were taken to be temporally stable starks et al 2006 hu et al 2010 martinez fernandez and ceballos 2005 defined those locations with the lowest sdrd values as representative of the mean value of swc for that specific depth two locations for each soil layer with minimum sdrd values were selected to simulate the swc of each layer the location f12 and f30 for 10 30 cm and 40 60 cm f12 and f16 for 70 90 cm and 100 150 cm depth and location f12 for 0 150 cm depth were selected as rmse root mean square error for the corresponding depth the linear fitting analysis indicated that the selected rmses could well estimate the mean swc for the study area table 4 the regression analysis of the mean value of swc and the representative measurement points indicated that the variation range of the determination coefficient r2 was 0 686 0 951 suggesting that the representative point has well reflected the corresponding swc of the soil layer the location f12 as the extremely stable point of swc had a high correlation with the swc of each soil layer and all soil layers in the study area the relationship between the mean swc of representative measuring sites and the mean swc of all soil layers for the study period was characterized by the linear equation y 1 13 3 2 r2 0 951 the comparison between the simulated swc by the representative location f12 and the measured swc of the area showed that the representative location could simulate the regional swc very well in the study area fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 the temporal variability of swc at various depths soil water is the main body of water storage in forest ecosystems and rainfall is the primary source of soil water recharge venkatesh et al 2011 lusheng et al 2017 compared with other soil layers the swc of the 0 30 cm layer showed the strongest variability over time zhao et al 2020 also found the swc of shallow layers had a stronger variability over time than that of deep layers several environmental factors especially temperature may cause greater variability in the shallow soil layer than in the lower layers fig 3 table 5 the deep soil layer was less affected by external environmental factors due to the insulation by the 0 30 cm soil layer table 5 the response of different soil layers to external environmental factors varied significantly which resulted in higher vertical spatial variation in 0 30 cm soils than in deep layers compared to 2017 and 2018 the cv value of swc for the soil layers was the largest in 2019 the variability of annual swc was low in years with high precipitation during the dry year soil water hardly moved as it was difficult for the soil to reach saturation whilst soils gradually became near saturated in the wet year and soil water can easily move from regions of higher soil water potential to regions of lower potential which decreased the spatial variability of swc penna et al 2009 rainfall had a large impact on swc variability in the study area besides vegetation growth was poor due to the lack of precipitation in dry years zhang et al 2019 which increased the variability of evapotranspiration in the study area and indirectly affected the swc table 5 owing to the decrease in precipitation plants need to obtain water from deep soil layers thus increased the variability of swc in deep soil layers during dry years therefore the variability of swc in the dry years was greater than that in the wet years however the variability of swc was greater in the rainy season than in the dry season the relationship between the seasonal variability of swc and rainfall was contrary to the relationship between the inter annual variability of swc and rainfall the temporal variability of swc was high from april to september especially in the 0 30 cm soil layer which received more than two thirds of the annual rainfall during this period takegi and lin 2012 also found obvious seasonal changes in swc of 0 30 cm layers during the rainy season in april as the temperature rose the vegetation entered the growth period and the water demand increased sharply which caused the swc in the topsoil to decrease with the advent of the rainy season the swc of the topsoil rose rapidly as the temperature rose evaporation and transpiration increased simultaneously leading to further changes in surface swc the high variability of surface swc would affect vegetation growth in the context of climate warming temperature changes have a greater impact on swc which can further affect hydroecological processes in the catchment therefore it is essential to raise awareness and analyze the variation of soil water content in each region the cv values of swc decreased with increasing depth in the wet years considering the influencing factors of swc the deep soil was less affected by the evaporation given that they were severed by the topsoil from being directly exposed to the atmospheric environment soil water maintains the mobility of water in the soil as a result of effectively receiving recharge from precipitation in the wet year while cv values of swc were relatively large with no obvious pattern of variation with depth in dry year soil water activity decreases in dry years when it is less recharged by external precipitation and soil water is regulated by the internal structure and texture of the soil korsunskaya et al 1995 gao and shao 2012 soil structure and texture heterogeneity result in no significant vertical distribution pattern of soil water variability 4 2 temporal stability analysis of swc in the three soil layers sdrd is widely used to describe the temporal stability of swc in this study the results of temporal stability as indicated by sdrd coincided with those based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient under different hydrological years the strongest temporal stability was found in the 40 90 cm soil layer based on sdrd values table 3 the water holding capacity of the soil was stronger with higher clay content entin et al 2000 jacobs et al 2004 jacobs et al 2010 the clay content showed a decreasing trend at different slope positions in the study area tabel 1 but the topsoil layer was not the most stable location for swc this is because the topsoil is more easily influenced by external variables e g precipitation temperature by contrast soil layers at 40 90 cm reduced dependence on the climatic biological and hydrological factors that determine the dynamics of swc guber et al 2008a gao and shao 2012 in addition the swc of the deepest soil layers was related to shallow groundwater level table 5 the shallow groundwater level in the study area varied with time due to the uneven distribution of rainfall seasons which led to the relatively instability of swc at the deepest soil layers compared with other research areas cosh et al 2008 gao et al 2011 the values of mrd and sdrd were very low in this study area in fact the sdrd values were all less than 5 and the mrd values were all close to 0 in the study area zhao et al 2010 indicating that the time stability of swc was relatively strong such stability could be explained to a large extent by relationships between soil texture and water content vachaud et al 1985 this may be related to the higher clay content in the study area table 1 jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 in addition the vegetation type in the study area was woodland which was a mature ecosystem with relatively stable hydrothermal conditions the sdrd values and the mrd range values at different soil depths increased over time during 2017 2019 this result indicated that the temporal stability of swc in this study area was stronger in the wetter years the degree of temporal stability in drier versus wetter locations has been debated some authors have found greater stability for drier locations cosh et al 2008 guber et al 2008 such research mostly occurred in arid and semi arid regions where the drier the climate the more stable the swc however the reverse is the case in the wet zones williams et al 2009 in our study as the annual precipitation decreased the most stable layer of swc appeared at a shallower location from 70 100 cm to 40 60 cm table 3 fig 5 according to previous results the high temporal stability under wet conditions may be related to the enhanced capillary movement of water from the subsoil to the surface soil which reduced the temporal variation of surface swc williams et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 the critical periods in terms of temporal stability are those in which the recharge of water in the profile occurs martinez fernandez and ceballos 2003 therefore when rainfall decreases the relative decrease in soil water recharge to the deep layers could lead to an increase in swc variability in the study area there were some locations f12 f16 f30 where the temporal stability of swc was extremely strong fig 5 the f12 was extremely stable location even in the dry year the time stable location had a relatively gentle slope and a relatively flat surface compared to other places with steep slopes e g f15 f26 f28 f29 and f31 in the study area fig 1 table3 grayson and western 1998 jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the temporal stability of swc in the central of the basin was stronger than that at the edge of the basin in terms of the soil texture the central part of the soil exhibited the highest clay content and high soil water holding capacity which led to the strong temporal stability of swc as with zhang et al 2019 throughfall at these locations had extreme temporal stability which affected the temporal stability of the swc by measuring the time distribution of the groundwater level it was found that the groundwater level at f12 f16 and f30 fluctuated little over time which may indirectly lead to the extreme stability of the swc in this area in conclusion soil properties clay content topography geographic location throughfall and the variability of groundwater level should be comprehensively considered when identifying the time stable locations of one study area 4 3 temporal patterns analysis of swc in the three soil layers many studies have focused on the relationship between temporal patterns of soil water and soil depth cassel et al 2000 guber et al 2008b gao and shao 2012 in the present work the mean rank correlation coefficients increased significantly with increasing soil depth the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers on the forested critical zone experimental block rainfall was the main resource for soil water the replenishment of soil water by a precipitation event was profound and lasting especially in forest ecosystems lin 2006 as a result of the high rate of woodland coverage in the study area and the process of vegetation interception the time for penetrating rain to reach the ground was longer thereby increasing the time for precipitation to infiltrate the ground the high clay content with strong water holding capacity further aggravated the time lags in the study area jacobs et al 2010 gao et al 2011 the time lags had more influence on the temporal patterns of swc in deep soil layers in dry years than in the wet years the swc decreased with the decline in rainfall which needed more time to move in the soil profile in the wet years 2017 2018 the time pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was lower than that of the deep soil layer whilst in the dry year 2019 the time pattern similarity of shallow soil layers was higher than that of the deep soil layer a continuously operating swc sensor network and a more detailed analysis of forest fields are thus necessary to corroborate all the results we obtained the temporal stability of a particular location and depth can be a good predictor of the utility of this location for estimating the area averaged swc at different depths temporal stability could be efficiently used to correct area average water content for missing data swc can be upscaled and efficiently monitored using the temporal stability of swc patterns guber et al 2008a our results provide valuable supporting evidence for soil water content management and hydrologic applications knowledge of the spatial and temporal patterns of swc promotes the effective use of soil water while providing a prerequisite basis for the study of hydrological processes the factors affecting swc differed at seasonal and interannual scales temperature has a critical role in soil horizons during the rainy season and the superimposed effect of rainfall and temperature results in high variability in the soil profile the crucial factor controlling the interannual variability of soil water is rainfall and a decrease in annual rainfall increases the variability of swc in the study area this work would be an asset to proper management of water resource in similar regions the temporal stability of swc patterns in the study area was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater levels with the area characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover finding a single representative site with temporal stability to estimate mean swc at several depths for a large area can reduce the costs of measurement and save time the soil water movement trajectory of the representative site is more stable so it can represent the soil water movement path and infiltration mode in the study area to a high degree therefore the study of the temporal stability of swc can also contribute to the study on soil hydraulics 5 conclusions based on the datasets of the swc within 0 150 cm layers at 34 locations on the forested critical zone experimental block the following conclusions were drawn 1 the temporal variability for swc decreased with increasing soil depth in the study area the swc of topsoil was strongly influenced by temperature and evaporation and deep swc was strongly influenced by groundwater level the variability of the swc in dry years was greater than that in wet years while the temporal stability of the swc in the dry season was greater than that in the rainy season precipitation controlled the interannual variation of swc while temperature controlled the seasonal variation of swc 2 the temporal stability showed a time associated drift in the three layers the time lag had less effect on the temporal pattern of swc in deep soils in wet years but more effect on that in dry years in wet years the temporal pattern was less similar in shallow soils than in deep soils while the opposite regularity was found in dry years 3 the locations representative of field mean swc were identified in all four layers the time stable location had a relatively flat surface in the central of the watershed and stable groundwater level with the high clay content where throughfall had temporal stability the temporal stability of swc patterns was controlled by topography geographic location throughfall and the groundwater level an area characterized by sloping terrain and forested cover the results presented herein provide evidence for the existence of time stable locations in the catchment and a reliable method to estimate field mean soil moisture from point based observations in this area the method should provide useful information for soil water management in this area authors contributions haowen

1307,groundwater fauna stygofauna comprises organisms that have adapted to the dark subterranean environment over a course of thousands and millions of years typically having slow metabolisms and long life cycles they are crucial players in the groundwater of oxygenic aquifers and contribute to various ecosystem services today s knowledge of their sensitivity to anthropogenic impacts is incomplete and a critical analysis of the general relevance of local findings is lacking in this review we focus on those areas with the highest interference between humans and stygofauna cities here is where local pollution by various contaminants and heat strongly stresses the unique groundwater ecosystems it is demonstrated that it is difficult to discern the influence of individual factors from the findings reported in field studies and to extrapolate laboratory results to field conditions the effects of temperature increase and chemical pollution vary strongly between tested species and test conditions in general previous findings indicate that heating especially in the long term will increase mortality and less adapted species are at risk of vanishing from their habitats the same may be true for salinity caused by road de icing in cold urban areas furthermore high sensitivities were shown for ammonium which will probably be even more pronounced with rising temperatures resulting in altered biodiversity patterns toxicity of heavy metals for a variety of invertebrates increases with time and chronic exposure our current knowledge reveals diverse potential impacts on groundwater

ecosystems that are much less understood than those of surface waters in fact aquifers are densely colonized and harbour highly diverse microbial ghiorse and wilson 1988 griebler and lueders 2009 hirsch et al 1992 karwautz and griebler 2022 malard 2022 and invertebrate stygofaunal communities including many relictual and endemic species gibert et al 2009 humphreys 2009 true groundwater fauna stygobites spend their whole life cycle in the subsurface and rarely establishes stable populations in surface waters gibert et al 1994 one reason is their long term adaptation to dark temperature stable and generally energy poor environments resulting in a slow metabolism and long lifespans the regression and lack of eyes and pigmentation along with the slow metabolism put groundwater invertebrates at a disadvantage when competing in surface water giere 2008 their high specialization augments sensitivity and vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts like temperature changes groundwater pollution altered hydrological conditions and habitat loss due to water table drawdown danielopol et al 2003 korbel and hose 2015 marmonier et al 2013 stein et al 2010 aquifers deviate the most from their natural state in urbanized regions schirmer et al 2013 this is where multiple direct anthropogenic stressors occur simultaneously causing abrupt spatial and temporal changes in water quantity and quality quantitative impacts stem from local well based extraction and injection of water as a part of urban water management from modifications of the hydraulic regime related to the installation of subsurface infrastructure as well as from substantial changes in groundwater recharge due to urban land use and surface sealing benz et al 2016 wong et al 2012 changes in the hydraulic conditions and subsurface water circulation have consequences for groundwater quality groundwater quality beneath cities is influenced by local pollution from industrial and communal waste waters underground pipe leakage atmospheric deposition and traffic as well as by a typically altered thermal regime fig 1 as a consequence aquifers located in rural regions are often favoured as primary freshwater sources to supply cities this limits the attention to urban aquifers as safeguard environments and habitats which also need be protected our current knowledge about subterranean ecosystems in urban areas is incomplete and disperse and the role of multiple interacting factors in particular has hardly been tackled moreover different urban realms are interconnected and can impact each other especially pressures occurring localized in a terrestrial realm can have an impact on a larger spatial scale in the groundwater ecosystem causing changes in ecological and chemical characteristics bugnot et al 2019 in the present review the focus lies on groundwater fauna in urban environments and the knowledge available from diverse case studies in the following first fundamental properties of groundwater fauna are introduced second key factors of anthropogenic disturbance in urban groundwater ecosystems such as warming oxygen depletion and chemical pollution including nutrients organic pollutants heavy metals and salt are elaborated upon based on this the major urban factors for survival diversity and metabolic mechanisms of groundwater fauna are summarized along with conclusions and future research needs 2 characteristics of groundwater fauna aquifers contain unique subterranean ecosystems with a vast diversity of invertebrates including micro meio and macrofauna stygofauna is adapted to its extraordinary environment characterized by the absence of light and low inputs of nutrients and organic matter through the reduction or even total loss of eyes and pigmentation the elongation of the body shape and the development of sensory features enabling it to move and forage in this habitat gibert et al 1994 moreover stygobionts are thought to be long lived gibert et al 1994 voituron et al 2011 they undergo slower growth and have fewer offspring than their surface relatives gibert et al 1994 humphreys 2009 groundwater fauna can also typically tolerate low oxygen concentrations malard and hervant 1999 stygofauna is typically dominated by arthropods in particular crustaceans from the classes ostracoda copepoda malacostraca amphipoda isopoda syncarida are highly represented further arthropods resemble mites acari beetles and other insects additionally abundant groups of organisms in groundwater are worms from the phyla plathelminthes turbellaria annelida oligochaeta and polychaeta and nematoda less frequently found members of stygofauna include molluscs gastropoda fig 2 humphreys 2009 the stygobiont community is characterized by high endemism and relict species whereby the latter successfully survived periods of geological and climatic change aquifers are living museums humphreys 2009 groundwater fauna inhabits all kinds of aquifer types and geographic regions usually with diversity hotspots in aquifers that provide sufficient space e g karst alluvial gravel deposits culver and sket 2000 humphreys 2009 iannella et al 2020 korbel and hose 2015 in addition to invertebrates microorganisms such as bacteria archaea protozoa and fungi are an important part of groundwater communities griebler and lueders 2009 the microbial communities do not only constitute the main fraction of biomass and biodiversity in the subsurface whitman et al 1998 but they also hold the key responsibility for biogeochemical processes and water purification feichtmayer et al 2017 griebler and avramov 2015 herrmann and taubert 2022 microbes mediate all important geochemical cycles as they form colonies and biofilms on sediments detritus and rock surfaces which are grazed on by invertebrates and therefore serve as the food base for the meso and macrofauna barlocher and murdoch 1989 saccò et al 2022 the grazing of these biofilms by stygofauna in turn may stimulate microbial activity and productivity and it may reduce clogging of pores and thereby modify local micro scale conditions griebler and avramov 2015 schmidt et al 2017 stygofauna is involved in the carbon cycle via retardation and decomposition of particulate organic matter griebler and avramov 2015 movement and burrowing bioturbation of stygofauna influence the hydraulic properties of aquifers voids are maintained open as well as created in materials with low conductivity e g clay and fine sand danielopol 1989 stumpp and hose 2017 ecosystem services and goods are processes and products provided by natural ecosystems and their inhabitants contributing to human well being groundwater ecosystem services are manifold including 1 purification storage and provision of clean water via biodegradation immobilization of contaminants and elimination of pathogens and 2 supply of geothermal energy to name two prominent examples griebler and avramov 2015 until now however a fundamental understanding of the relationship between stygofauna and groundwater ecosystem services is lacking without doubt due to the constantly increasing number and accumulation of pollutants in aquifers as well as their overuse and exploitation particularly in urban areas the risk of negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services is increasing di lorenzo et al 2021a di lorenzo et al 2018 griebler et al 2019 3 pressures in urban aquifers and groundwater fauna response 3 1 rising temperature 3 1 1 temperature in urban aquifers in the following we refer to absolute temperatures in degree celsius c and for clarity use the kelvin k scale to indicate relative thermal changes a prominent feature of urban aquifers is the altered thermal regime with elevated and highly spatially variable groundwater temperatures when compared to more natural and rural areas benz et al 2016 temperature is of particular importance in determining physiological activity and phenology of animals due to temperature dependence of enzymatic reactions colinet et al 2015 also temperature effects on the groundwater physico chemical characteristics are well known see a summary in griebler et al 2016 reduced oxygen concentrations and ph values for example have frequently been observed with groundwater warming riedel 2019 groundwater is typically thermally stable with temperatures in shallow aquifers close to the annual mean of the air temperature however in case of infiltrating conditions from surface water and in highly dynamic aquifers seasonal temperature variability may be more locally pronounced for instance in central europe natural groundwater temperatures are typically between 10 and 12 c bannick et al 2008 whereas they can be below 8 c in high mountain areas and scandinavian regions and above 18 c in mediterranean countries benz et al 2017 tissen et al 2019 seasonally uniformity and long term stability of the thermal regime is considerably changed by anthropogenic drivers due to climate change shallow quaternary aquifer temperatures are expected to rise by up to 5 k at a latitude of 45 within the next century menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 in urban areas these long term background changes are superimposed by the direct effects of modified land use heat release of basements and subsurface infrastructure as well as geothermal use fig 1 subsurface urban heat islands suhi have been observed in cities worldwide which are measured as elevated shallow groundwater and soil temperatures in urbanized regions the aquifers below more densely populated and older urban areas e g city centres often have higher temperatures than those below rural undisturbed regions where the temperatures can be more than 5 k colder most relevant anthropogenic heat sources were observed to be sealing of ground surface built up areas and underground structures e g basements tunnels benz et al 2015 böttcher and zosseder 2022 previati et al 2022 locally hot spots of more than 10 k elevation in temperature have been reported blum et al 2021 ferguson and woodbury 2007 hemmerle et al 2019 huang et al 2009 nevertheless groundwater warming is spatially heterogeneous and also dependent on the hydrogeological conditions such as flow velocity saturated thickness and depth to water and influence of anthropogenic heat sources differs strongly among cities bayer et al 2019 böttcher and zosseder 2022 zhu et al 2015 3 1 2 effects of temperature changes on groundwater organisms stygobionts are ectotherms with narrow thermal tolerance ranges and skewed temperature curves describing the relationship between temperature and physiological functions groundwater invertebrate species that have been exposed to thermal conditions deviating from their habitat temperatures exhibited thermal stress and a strong physiological response in incubation experiments of specific interest are upper thermal tolerance or and lethal temperature values survival rates are frequently expressed as lt50 values which describes the combination of temperature and time at which 50 of the observed population has died lt lethal temperature issartel et al 2005 compared the thermal stress response of the stygobiont amphipods niphargus rhenorhodanensis and niphargus virei with their surface water relative gammarus fossarum under laboratory conditions survival rates of n rhenorhodanensis were higher than those of n virei when acclimated to 12 c natural habitat temperature and were similar to the rates of the surface crustacean g fossarum which showed the highest thermal plasticity and longer duration of survival over the entire tested temperature range from 2 to 28 c fig 3a the high survival rates of n rhenorhodanensis were unexpected since they colonize similar habitats as n virei issartel et al 2005 brielmann et al 2011 found niphargus inopinatus to be more tolerant to temperature elevations than isopod proasellus cavaticus fig 3a lt50 values of both species decreased the longer the test lasted brielmann et al 2011 these results are in agreement with the observed narrow thermal tolerance breadths that apply to two p cavaticus morphospecies proasellus n sp 1 and proasellus n sp 2 reported in mermillod blondin et al 2013 in the same study survival rates found for proasellus valdensis were high 95 individual survivals at 11 c and comparable to those of n rhenorhodanensis which did not substantiate a specific adaptation to their thermally stable environment mermillod blondin et al 2013 brielmann et al 2011 performed temperature tolerance tests in a temperature gradient chamber with the two groundwater species n inopinatus amphipoda and p cavaticus isopoda in doing so a temperature gradient of 2 to 35 c was established in an acrylic glass chamber and individuals of both species were positioned at a temperature of 12 c within the gradient the temperature with the mean residence time of n inopintatus and p cavaticus was 11 7 3 4 c and 11 4 5 c respectively with most observed individuals found at temperatures between 8 and 16 c they set a threshold of 16 c above which no individuals showed survival or residence according to the lower thermal tolerance of p cavaticus detected during the temperature response tests the individuals in the temperature gradient chamber demonstrated rigidity at 22 9 23 5 and 25 c which was not identified for n inopinatus brielmann et al 2011 castano sanchez et al 2020b determined the upper thermal limits utl whereby the utl50 is the upper lethal temperature affecting 50 of the population and was estimated from the lt50s taken every 24 h within the warming period highest sensitivity was observed for members of the fauna group harpacticoida ameiridae n sp with utl50 values of 24 8 0 2 c followed by cyclopoida diacyclops n sp utl50 26 9 0 2 c and syncarida parabathynellidae n sp utl50 30 c in other experiments the influence of temperature changes on physiological features was investigated oxygen consumption or standard respiration rates srr revealed no significant change for different stygobiontic species of different phylogenetic groups e g diacyclops belgicus copepod n virei n rhenorhodanensis amphipoda with elevated temperatures 14 21 c di lorenzo and galassi 2017 issartel et al 2005 mermillod blondin et al 2013 the unaffected physiological activities of d belgicus may be due to adaptation to groundwater temperatures of 14 15 9 c in a mediterranean shallow aquifer and the wide geographical range of the species di lorenzo and galassi 2017 furthermore q10 values describing temperature dependence of a physiological process like respiration rate indicate temperature sensitivity of organisms thereby if the q10 value is estimated to be 1 the respiration rate is independent of temperature if q10 1 or q10 1 the process is considered to be temperature dependent and respiration is increasing or decreasing with temperature for example a q10 value of 2 indicates a doubling of the respiration rate when temperature increases by 10 c respiration rates and the q10 value were estimated by issartel et al 2005 very high or low q10 values indicate temperatures that cause irreparable protein damage and therefore inhibition of the physiological system hochachka and somero 2002 q10 values were always higher in n virei signifying a lower capacity to maintain enzymatic activities with elevated temperatures in comparison to n rhenorhodanensis issartel et al 2005 q10 value for d belgicus indicated a possible beginning of irreversible denaturation of enzymes at increased temperatures di lorenzo and galassi 2017 increasing temperatures stimulate metabolic processes which may be even more pronounced in thermally sensitive stygobionts compared to epigean relatives as presented by simčič and sket 2021 for the hypogean species n stygius and the epigean species n zagrebensis with higher temperatures the epigean eucyclops serrulatus exhibited accelerated metabolic activities as well as shortened development times nauplius to adult 20 d at 15 c 14 days at 20 c maier 1990 35 days at 18 c 21 days at 21 c cifoni et al 2017 and life spans 42 d at 20 c 96 5 d at 15 c cifoni et al 2017 maier 1990 another way to determine temperature sensitivity and tolerance of groundwater organisms is the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of stress responses for example via catecholamine levels avramov et al 2013 heat shock proteins colson proch et al 2010 or immune response detection of free amino acids and sugars mermillod blondin et al 2013 catecholamines noradrenaline adrenaline dopamine are involved in the physiological response to stress groundwater species already exhibiting very high initial catecholamine levels showed an increased stress response with a sudden temperature increase of 6 and 12 k due to their storage of catecholamines stygobionts are able to react faster to stress than their surface relatives which may be an adaptation to food scarcity and their energy limited environment however if this storage is emptied recovery may be critical avramov et al 2013 therefore in the long term groundwater organisms may be less tolerant to thermal changes with respect to an inhibited catecholamine synthesis this would be in agreement with the results of colson proch et al 2010 who observed a significant stress reaction n rhenorhodanensis exposed to a heat shock of 6 c after 1 and 2 months in a field study brielmann et al 2009 reported a decreased faunal diversity with elevated temperatures in observation wells distributed within and outside a heat plume originating from an industrial facility no effect was found with respect to the faunal abundance in another field survey by spengler 2017 the biodiversity of groundwater crustaceans in the upper rhine valley germany was observed to change significantly above 14 c in this study temperature increase was correlated with a decrease in stygobiont species abundance 3 2 salt pollution from road de icing 3 2 1 salt in urban aquifers salt in urban groundwater can originate from landfill leachate septic tank effluents animal feeds industrial effluents sewage effluents water conditioning salt fertilizers kcl and seasonally from road de icing fig 1 aghazadeh et al 2010 kelly 2008 kelly et al 2012 since the late 1940s the most commonly used de icing salt is nacl due to its low cost easy use and storage and its high efficiency jandová et al 2020 thirty five million metric tons of salt are used annually worldwide and the trend is increasing in response to the expansion of urban areas and impervious surfaces johnsson and adl zarrabi 2019 kelly 2008 approximately 60 of the applied salt is subjected to surface runoff each year and transported to surface waters during the spring snow melt the remainder accumulates in groundwater perera et al 2013 chloride as the primary environmental contaminant in salt is not toxic to human health in concentrations usually found in drinking water who 2011 and highly soluble and mobile in water foos 2003 concentrations vary greatly depending on background concentrations run off behaviour geology and hydrogeology as well as salt application amounts in the study areas a rapid degradation of water quality due to road salt in urban areas has been reported multiple times aghazadeh et al 2010 cooper et al 2014 daley et al 2009 kelly et al 2012 williams et al 2000 average concentrations of chloride in cities with intense road de icing salt applications ranged between 415 mg l 1 and 1100 mg l 1 aghazadeh et al 2010 williams et al 2000 particularly high chloride concentrations were observed along heavily treated roads in urban regions bester et al 2006 jamshidi et al 2020 jandová et al 2020 chloride contamination is a long lasting problem for groundwater as well as surface water it might take decades to wash out the chloride even after salt application would immediately be stopped bester et al 2006 jamshidi et al 2020 ludwikowski and peterson 2018 model scenarios by bester et al 2006 for southwest ontario canada or ludwikowski and peterson 2018 for illinois usa showed that even with a reduction of salt application by 100 it will take decades until groundwater reaches a safe drinking water quality again 3 2 2 salt effects on groundwater organisms studies which discuss the influence of road salt on groundwater organisms are rare research projects mainly focused on community level effects and the characterization of aquifers which were not necessarily anthropogenically used or polluted in australian aquifers most taxa were found in groundwater with electrical conductivity ec values below 1500 μs cm hancock and boulton 2008 whereby no significant correlation between faunal abundance and ec was identified in portuguese and algerian aquifers wells with highly saline groundwater had the lowest stygofaunal abundances compared to the total of collected fauna mahi et al 2019 mencio et al 2014 this was also the case for a coastal aquifer in portugal affected by seawater intrusion gastropods as well as ostracods seemed to be more abundant in wells with a lower salinity furthermore the absence of the stygobiont species eucyclops hadjebensis and acanthocyclops sensitivus in high salinity bores was observed however the presence of megacyclops brachypus for example was more related to high salinity bores shapouri et al 2016 the authors found ec to be one of the major parameters affecting the faunal assemblage which is in agreement with results of some other studies castano sanchez et al 2020b dole olivier et al 2009 shapouri et al 2016 in contrast to these findings schulz et al 2013 detected high stygofaunal abundances of the three taxa cyclopoida harpacticoida and bathynellacaea in highly saline waters exceeding marine conductivities also tione et al 2016 discovered exclusive copepod species stygonitocrella n sp in a brackish well with high salinity average 2737 mg l 1 chloride the authors concluded that groundwater species are able to adapt to special hydrochemical conditions and that salinity may be one main influencing factor for species to occur in three papers castano sanchez et al 2020b castaño sánchez et al 2021 castano sanchez et al 2021 observed mortality rates of stygobiont species under laboratory conditions or in situ fig 3b first the authors investigated the salinity tolerance of diacyclops n sp ameiridae n sp and parabathynellidae n sp over a time period of 96 h syncarida were the most tolerant taxa and cyclopoida species were more tolerant to salinity than harpacticoid species fig 3b the more tolerant taxa thereby were sampled from an aquifer with higher salinity and the authors assumed a pre adaptation to local conditions or a broader tolerance in these taxa castano sanchez et al 2020b in a second study adults and juvenile epigean diacyclops crassicaudis crassicaudis were shown to be slightly more tolerant than diacyclops n sp and twice as tolerant as the harpacticoid ameiridae n sp castano sanchez et al 2021 thereby copepodites were more sensitive than adult animals in a very recent study different isopods were tested in situ and under varying laboratory conditions all three species proasellus cavaticus proasellus lusitanicus and proasellus assaforensis were more tolerant to nacl under in situ conditions than the taxa tested in the previous studies fig 3b p assaforensis was more tolerant under lab conditions than the other tested taxa but had a lower mortality in situ which may be explained by induced transportation stress or acclimation to the laboratory conditions castaño sánchez et al 2021 3 3 organic chemicals 3 3 1 vocs in urban aquifers groundwater pollution with organic chemicals is a major issue in urban and industrial landscapes and include a variety of contaminant groups such as aliphatic aromatic or chlorinated organic chemicals many being quite soluble in water mobile and volatile vocs vocs are commonly represented by halogenated solvents e g pce tce dce vc dcm btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and pahs e g naphthalene phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene and fluorene bulatović et al 2021 gesels et al 2021 liu et al 2020 park et al 2005 squillace et al 2004 these organic chemicals originate from diverse sources including former gasification plants infrastructures like oil storage and gas stations urban traffic and transport of oil and gas including accidental spills textile and car industry with dry cleaning processes manufactured products used in buildings paints cleaning agents adhesives furnishings floor and wall coverings combustion products and leaking landfills fig 1 han et al 2013 kuroda and fukushi 2008 miller et al 2020 in particular big cities suffer from the legacy of gasification plants and the subsurface dumping of waste products such as tar oil meckenstock et al 2010 concentrations of organic chemicals in urban groundwater can span several orders of magnitude while at former gasification plants and specific sites of accidental spill and leakage btex and pah concentrations in contaminated groundwater can reach values of 100 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 e g anneser et al 2008 anneser et al 2010 bulatović et al 2021 griebler et al 2004 meckenstock et al 2010 urban groundwater concentrations are generally more in the μgl 1 range e g han et al 2013 liu et al 2020 ilić et al 2021 similarly chlorinated solvents at industrial megasites may exhibit concentrations up to the lower mg l 1 range e g wycisk et al 2003 frequently contamination levels in urban groundwater exceed who limits gesels et al 2021 3 3 2 cecs in urban aquifers other groups of organic chemicals are summarized as contaminants of emerging concern cecs summarizing chemicals which were detected only recently and are not yet regulated but may be of future concern bunting et al 2021 cecs include pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products fragrances water treatment by products drugs artificial sweeteners among others richardson and ternes 2011 and mainly originate from effluents of waste water treatment plants hospital effluents private and public gardens parks landfills and livestock farming li et al 2021 mojiri et al 2020 stuart et al 2012 cecs are not effectively removed by water treatment processes and are therefore released to the aquatic environment and infiltrate into shallow urban aquifers richards et al 2021 stuart et al 2012 the top ten cecs in european groundwater were recently compiled by bunting et al 2021 i e carbamazepine caffeine sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen acetaminophen n n diethyl m toluamide diclofenac chlorobenzene a similar set of compounds is found in urban groundwater all over the world with local and regional particularities e g higher fraction of pesticides and or drugs koroša et al 2016 pinasseau et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 pesticides in this context are of particular importance based on their mode of effect they are classified into four main groups namely fungicides herbicides insecticides and others miticides algaecides mojiri et al 2020 especially in the vicinity of agricultural areas and due to their application in urban gardens and parks pesticides can reach high concentrations in urban groundwater as it is shown for patna city india richards et al 2021 maribor slovenia koroša et al 2016 lyon france pinasseau et al 2019 or doncaster u k white et al 2016 even pesticides that are not authorized anymore like atrazine propazine and simazine are regularly found at elevated concentrations 2 230 ng l 1 koroša et al 2016 3 3 3 nitrate in urban aquifers high nitrate concentrations are one of the primary causes of groundwater pollution nitrate is characterized by a high solubility mobility in soils and sediments and stability at oxic conditions zhang et al 2015 it becomes toxic for humans at high concentrations and the drinking water threshold is set at 50 mg l 1 who 2011 urban sources of nitrate are irrigation runoff from fertilized urban green areas public gardens animal waste leaching of landfills domestic waste industrial wastewater leaking sewage pipelines and atmospheric depositions gu et al 2013 guimarães et al 2019 hosono et al 2011 ren and zhang 2020 wakida and lerner 2005 especially in areas with poor sanitation where pit latrines and septic tanks are common elevated nitrate levels can be observed walraevens et al 2015 in oxygenated aquifers nitrate may originate from nitrification of ammonia when conditions shift to hypoxic and anoxic nitrate is biologically reduced to n2o and n2 denitrification or ammonia dissimilar nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra groundwater can be affected very seriously by human activity with gradually increasing nitrate levels shown to accompany urbanization and economic development even if concentrations were within limits set by the world health organization who or only single wells exceeded these limits e g chicago lisbon milan and karlsruhe de caro et al 2017 gu et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 koch et al 2021 martin del campo et al 2014 ren and zhang 2020 teixeira et al 2018 with concentrations of 89 52 shijiazhuang 93 2 barcelona 145 manila or 60 porto mg l 1 on average groundwater in these cities is in an alarming state and certainly not suitable for drinking purposes guimarães et al 2019 hosono et al 2011 jurado et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 3 3 4 ammonium in urban aquifers natural levels of ammonium are typically below 0 2 mg l 1 who 2011 and increased concentrations are usually caused by faecal pollution from sewage leakages pit latrines industrial and domestic wastewaters fertilization livestock farming and landfill leachates bruce and mcmahon 1996 ikem et al 2002 kurilic et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 thresholds for drinking water quality are set at 0 5 mg l eu european union 2020 moreover contrary to nitrate ammonium is mainly present in reducing conditions in aquifers since nitrification may lead to a transformation to nitrate under oxic conditions high ammonium levels correlating with low levels of dissolved oxygen were observed in urban and industrial areas bruce and mcmahon 1996 jurado et al 2013 ammonium pollution in urban aquifers is of importance as the following values indicate some sites in lisbon 0 2 04 mg l 1 teixeira et al 2018 milan 0 1 43 mg l 1 de caro et al 2017 krakow 1 957 2 618 mg l 1 binkowski et al 2017 or temerin 0 07 4 2 mg l 1 kurilic et al 2015 exceeded national limits or natural background values especially urban and suburban areas where adequate sanitary conditions infrastructure for local water supply and waste water treatment is lacking high ammonium levels can frequently be detected as observed in serbia petkovic et al 2011 zimbabwe gumindoga et al 2019 or zambia de waele et al 2004 3 3 5 effects on groundwater fauna data available on the ecotoxicological effects of organic pollutants to stygobiontic fauna are extremely scarce and interpretation is difficult most toxicity studies with organic chemicals and stygobionts were carried out with pesticides including α endosulfan 3 4 dichlorophenol aldicarb ariane chlorpyrifos desethylatrazine imazamox penthaclorophenol s metolachlor and thiram sensitivity of groundwater organisms was highly variable and highest sensitivities were observed with the substances compiled in table 1 for example n rhenorhodanensis showed high survival with the highest concentration of s metolachlor and desethylatrazine tested which exceeded concentrations typically found in the environment maazouzi et al 2016 the authors therefore concluded that there is no short term threat of those two pesticides to groundwater fauna in comparison parastenocaris germanica was much more sensitive to pentachlorophenol or aldicarb table 1 moreover juveniles tended to be more sensitive and differences between higher and lower groundwater crustaceans with respect to their organismic complexity were found with the latter one seeming to be less tolerant notenboom and boessenkool 1992 schäfers et al 2001 groundwater crustaceans reacted with a delay or were less sensitive to individual pesticides when compared to related epigean species on the basis of metabolic activity measurements schäfers et al 2001 taking the slow metabolism of groundwater fauna into account it is a specific deficit that data from chronic ecotoxicity tests are missing completely volatile organic compounds vocs such as toluene acute lc50 64 68 mg l 1 or bpa are obviously highly tolerated lc50 24 h 6 mg l 1 respectively by selected groundwater invertebrates in acute tests gerhardt 2019 however the few compounds tested are not at all representative for the vast diversity of vocs present in urban groundwater and again information from chronic tests is extremely scarce e g toluene chronic lc50 36 50 mg l 1 avramov et al 2013 also pharmaceuticals like propranolol and diclofenac were tolerated at high concentrations by respectively one stgyobiont species diacyclops belgicus di lorenzo et al 2019a nitocrella achaia di lorenzo et al 2021a and a groundwater population of diacyclops crassicaudis crassicaudis castano sanchez et al 2021 especially by adult animals and the substances may pose no or a moderate risk to european groundwater bodies di lorenzo et al 2019a di lorenzo et al 2021a observed surface and groundwater concentrations of diclofenac on the other hand are between 0 0005 and 0 5 mg l 1 and already cause sub lethal effects to crustaceans which imply a risk of this substance to stygobionts castano sanchez et al 2021 reviewing field studies at sites with intense agricultural use ammonium contamination seems to affect the whole stygobiontic copepod assemblage with the most affected species being diacyclops italianus and nitocrella psammophila in bores with higher ammonium concentrations 0 032 mg l 1 di lorenzo et al 2015a di lorenzo et al 2014 the value of 0 032 mg l 1 nh4 was estimated by di lorenzo et al 2014 to be the chronic lethal concentration for diacyclops belgicus in the same study d belgicus was also more sensitive than the epigean eucyclops serrulatus to acute and chronic ammonium exposure but showed similar sensitivity as the epigean b echinatus fig 3c di marzio et al 2009 due to synergistic effects ammonium was even more toxic to stygobionts when combined with the herbicide imazamox di marzio et al 2018 in another study metacrangonyx spinicaudatus had a higher sensitivity to ammonium chloride than typhlocirolana haouzensis fig 3c boutin et al 1995 di lorenzo et al 2015b noticed that temperature affects the toxicity of ammonia the stygoxene cyclopoid e serrulatus showed chronic lethality at 1 mg l 1 nh4 di lorenzo et al 2014 with increasing sensitivity under warmer conditions lc50 96 h at 15 c 52 mg l 1 nh4 at 18 c 24 76 mg l 1 nh4 di lorenzo et al 2015b di lorenzo et al 2014 ammonium has an impact on the growth and survival via the disruption of various physiological mechanisms osmoregulation immunology acid base balance gas exchange and induction of oxidative stress pathogenic susceptibility and histopathological damage romano and zeng 2013 only few ecotoxicological studies with nitrate and stygobionts are available gerhardt 2020 examined a slightly increased mortality from 50 to 100 mg l 1 nitrate with chronic 5 weeks nitrate exposure for the stygobiont amphipod niphargopsis casparyi proasellus slavus indicated no sensitivity to nitrate nevertheless mortality never reached 50 also ventilatory activity was significantly reduced whereas locomotor activity was independent upon nitrate levels furthermore effects of potassium nitrate on survival rates of three stygobiont species p slavus vindobonensis metacrangonyx n sp and typhlocirotana n sp were merely moderate el abiari et al 1998 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 with lc50 96 h values above 50 mg l 1 these results suggest that groundwater crustaceans may not be as sensitive to nitrate as expected similar observations were made in field studies in italy and the french pyrénées which revealed that even at sites heavily contaminated by nitrate copepod or crustacean assemblages as a whole were highly diversified and nitrate concentrations up to 150 mg l 1 had low effect on the stygobiontic community di lorenzo et al 2021b di lorenzo and galassi 2013 dumas et al 2001 dumas and lescher moutoué 2001 galassi et al 2009 however di lorenzo et al 2021b also described low juvenile to adult and male to female ratios and altered copepod assemblages reasons may be that the long term nitrate pollution has induced the disappearance of sensitive species and the following exploitation of stygophile species again juveniles may be more sensitive than adult animals di lorenzo et al 2021b often abundance and biomass did not correlate with physico chemical parameters or organic variables concluding that nutrients only play a minor role as drivers for groundwater fauna di lorenzo et al 2015a dole olivier et al 2009 dumas et al 2001 galassi et al 2009 marmonier et al 2018 consistent with these findings stein et al 2010 concluded that the effect of nitrate on groundwater fauna is indirect displaying the correlation with groundwater surface water interactions and land use impacts 3 4 metal pollution metals and metalloids are present in soils and water in colloidal particulate or dissolved form some of the most common metals in groundwater include iron fe lead pb mercury hg cadmium cd copper cu chromium cr manganese mn zinc zn nickel ni and the metalloid arsenic as groundwater naturally contains metals and although individual metals including some heavy metals are essentially required at low concentrations by micro organisms at elevated concentrations these can have neuro toxic carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic effects on organisms including microbes fauna and humans momodu and anyakora 2010 therefore the who 2011 has evaluated maximum contaminant levels mg l 1 for critical metals in drinking water fig 4 main causes for metal contamination and accumulation in groundwater today are urbanization industrialisation agriculture and consequently acidification which are factors that often appear side by side and can therefore interact with each other kumar et al 2012 in urban areas metals enter groundwater bodies mainly through road run off corrosion of building materials spills industrial domestic waste and surface water with areas near to pollution sources as well as older and inner parts of cities being the most impacted kumar et al 2012 santos et al 2002 wieczorek et al 2020 analyses of urban soils have shown that the level of metal contamination can be connected to traffic volume and distance to roads wang et al 2016 urban agricultural areas e g gardens parks impact groundwater through the application of pesticides fertilizers since these agents contain metals and alter groundwater properties like the ph leading to higher mobility of metals khan et al 2018 depending on the hydrogeology the composition and concentrations of metals in groundwater is very heterogeneous in space and time some metals e g fe mn can bind and release trace metals by changing from solid under oxic conditions to soluble state under reducing conditions or low ph making the redox conditions and ph important controlling factors vesper 2019 vranković et al 2017 however other influencing factors are co2 the partial pressure of o2 the impact of microbial activity and the presence of organic compounds e g humics and other pollutants including nutrients hosono et al 2011 khan et al 2018 vesper 2019 although a generalised ranking of the presence of metals in groundwater cannot be achieved due to the different geological settings and pollution situations worldwide there are differences in the solubility and association of metals with each other santos et al 2002 observed a high mobility for zn most soluble tested metal in water and cd intermediate mobility for cu and low mobility for pb furthermore kumar et al 2012 revealed positive correlations between the appearances of cd cr and cu as well as pb and zn in urban groundwater the composition mobility toxicity and bioavailability of metals in groundwater is associated with the speciation origin and age of the metals and other compounds e g phosphates and is especially in urban areas dependent on the type of industrial influence santos et al 2002 3 4 1 effects on groundwater fauna since several metals can have highly toxic effects on organisms at low concentrations they are the most tested contaminants in subterranean environments castano sanchez et al 2020a momodu and anyakora 2010 the assimilation of essential metals including some heavy metals e g fe mn cu and zn is obligatory at low levels since they are needed for growth and energy metabolism e g metals are frequent components of proteins momodu and anyakora 2010 vranković et al 2017 stygofauna can reduce the availability of metals in solution in the groundwater ecosystem to a small extent due to their ability of bioaccumulation canivet and gibert 2002 it has been observed that cave dwelling arthropods exhibit higher accumulation rates for non essential metals than for essential metals which makes them potential bioindicators for groundwater quality vranković et al 2017 in several laboratory studies hypogean species were found to be less sensitive and to have a greater tolerance to metals than epigean species reasons for this could be that groundwater species have lower metabolisms lower assimilation rates lower growth and reproduction rates and increased longevity canivet et al 2001 canivet and gibert 2002 krupa and guidolin 2003 plénet 1999 toxicity in groundwater species also increases with exposure time and chronic stress is assumed to impact the durability of groundwater populations hose et al 2016 furthermore the harsh conditions in underground habitats may be reasons for groundwater species being potentially more prone to devastating effects of metal contamination in the long run hose 2005 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 metal toxicity data are available for five groups of groundwater invertebrates namely amphipoda isopoda copepoda syncarida and oligochaeta the metals that have been tested are as cd cu cr pb and zn fig 4 toxicity values of stygofauna within and between taxonomic groups are generally variable as the sensitivity of the individual species originating from different habitats is diverse and there are mostly no correlations found between water quality taxon and sensitivity to metals hose et al 2016 however some general patterns have been observed in groundwater copepoda cr was the most toxic metal in comparison to as and zn hose et al 2016 canivet et al 2001 reported that the crustacean n rhenorhodanensis was more sensitive to cr lc50 96 h 0 23 mg l 1 cr than to as lc50 96 h 3 97 mg l 1 as in syncarids bathynellidae n sp hose et al 2019 found as lc50 336 h 0 25 mg l 1 as to be the most toxic metal followed by cr lc50 336 h 0 51 mg l 1 cr and zn lc50 336 h 1 77 mg l 1 zn the syncarids furthermore regulated zn accumulation at exposure concentrations below 1 mg zn l with increased body concentrations and mortality above that level while accumulation of as was not regulated additionally krupa and guidolin 2003 found that groundwater amphipods niphargus montellianus are more tolerant to zn than to cd and they are most sensitive to cu cr was the only metal that hypogean fauna was more sensitive to than epigean fauna in laboratory tests fig 4 the lc50 lc100 values did not differ greatly between three amphipod species m spinicaudatus n rhenorhodanensis and n aquilex aside from one value which was zn for n aquilex 180 mg l 1 the other two amphipods showed the least sensitivity to cd 3 4 5 mg l 1 cd and as 3 97 mg l 1 as in comparison to cr 0 23 1 18 mg l 1 cr pb 0 8 mg l 1 pb and especially cu 0 15 mg l 1 cu and zn 0 45 mg l 1 zn since the lc values for these were below the maximum contaminant level that is suggested for drinking water by the who fig 4 boutin et al 1995 canivet et al 2001 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 plénet 1999 the genus that was tested most extensively in isopoda was proasellus including five species p lusitanicus p assaforensis p cavaticus p coxalis cavaticus and p slavus vindobonensis followed by caecidatea including two species c bicrenata and c stygia and typhlocirolana haouzensis t haouzensis thereby was observed as the most tolerant species over all with comparatively high lc50 48 h values for cd 150 mg l 1 cd cu 17 mg l 1 cu and pb 90 mg l 1 pb and equally high values for zn 19 5 mg l 1 zn compared to the other isopod species fig 4 furthermore isopoda generally seem to be less sensitive to zn 9 5 127 mg l 1 zn than amphipoda 0 45 180 mg l 1 zn and copepoda 0 5 10 mg l 1 zn for cd cr cu and pb the values were highly variable between isopod species as well as isopoda and other groups fig 4 bosnak and morgan 1981a 1981b boutin et al 1995 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 reboleira et al 2013 with respect to copepoda which are generally the most abundant group in groundwater many species were tested for metal toxicity including the stygobite parastenocaris germanica incl lc values for copepodites notenboom and boessenkool 1992 notenboom et al 1992 two undetermined groundwater species of cyclopoida and one species of harpacticoida hose et al 2016 stygophile populations of acanthocyclops vernalis diacyclops bicuspidatus megacyclops viridis mösslacher and notenboom 1999 and bryocamptus echinatus di marzio et al 2009 as well as stygoxene species including attheyella crassa di marzio et al 2009 bryocamptus zschokkei burton et al 2002 b pygmaeus and b minutus all belonging to the genus bryocamptus di marzio et al 2009 in comparison to other stygofauna groups the lc values for copepoda were in close range of the different species tested indicating comparable metal tolerance toxicity for all tested species increased with test duration fig 4 furthermore the tolerance of b zschokkei for cu 0 29 mg l 1 cu and of a harpacticoid species for cr in 14 and 28 day experiments 0 03 and 0 02 mg l 1 cr as well as the ec50 lc50 values for zn in several groundwater crustaceans including amphipods copepods and syncarids were below the maximum contaminant levels for drinking water recommended by the who 2 mg l 1 cu 0 05 mg l 1 cr and 3 mg l 1 zn fig 4 burton et al 2002 di marzio et al 2009 hose et al 2019 hose et al 2016 notenboom and boessenkool 1992 notenboom et al 1992 for the group oligochaeta only one groundwater species trichodrilus tenuis has been tested tested metals lc50 96 h were cd of which the tolerance in t tenuis was relatively low 1 05 mg l 1 cd compared to the other groundwater invertebrates and zn 8 3 mg l 1 zn of which the value was within the highly variable range between the groups fig 4 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 3 5 oxygen depletion 3 5 1 dissolved oxygen in urban aquifers in natural aquifers dissolved oxygen do levels are spatially heterogeneous at macro meso and microscales they also reflect sediment composition and structure groundwater flow velocity mineralogy and organic matter content as well as abundance and activity of organisms malard and hervant 1999 usually groundwater is undersaturated with dissolved oxygen and do with concentrations below 0 1 mg l is suspected to be a limiting factor for groundwater fauna strayer 1994 for confined aquifers malard and hervant 1999 indicated gradients between 9 10 5 and 1 5 10 2 mg l 1 o2 m 2 whereby no replenishment of oxygen from the surface is possible in parafluvial aquifers oxygen levels range from 2 10 2 to 1 mg l 1 o2 m 2 and in unconfined aquifers oxygen consumption can be compensated by do replenishment from the atmosphere by groundwater recharge oxygen is more rapidly consumed if the groundwater table is near the surface due to the degradation of soil dissolved organic carbon if the groundwater table is far from the surface do is gradually consumed along the direction of flow malard and hervant 1999 it is assumed that do levels near industrial facilities agricultural areas and urban areas are lower than in natural regions due to pollution and anthropogenic effects which enhance chemical and biological oxygen consumption griebler et al 2014 kunkel et al 2004 in the city of karlsruhe germany for example high average do levels of 7 96 2 95 mg l 1 were measured in groundwater below forest areas n 8 and significant lower levels of 4 47 2 31 mg l 1 in wells in the city centre n 31 koch et al 2021 3 5 2 reaction of groundwater fauna low do concentrations and oxidative stress are habitual to groundwater organisms malard and hervant 1999 under anaerobiosis the production of reactive oxygen species ros is enhanced and results in cell damage lawniczak et al 2013 to prevent damage organisms have developed non enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms simčič and sket 2021 low metabolic rates of subterranean organisms may be favourable in such oxygen limited systems stygobiont species show high survival rates under low do levels 0 01 0 5 mg l 1 danielopol 1989 malard and hervant 1999 notenboom et al 1992 and are able to cope with hypoxic to normoxic conditions mösslacher 2000 for example the copepod acanthocyclops n sp sampled from a hypoxic habitat had only small metabolic differences compared to the copepod diacyclops bicuspidatus from a normoxic condition habitat the stygobiont niphargus stygius had a lower oxygen consumption in recovery after anoxia than the stygophile niphargus zagrebensis also oxygen consumption after hypoxia at 20 c was greater in the stygobiont species than at 10 c simčič and sket 2021 hypogean species tend to be less sensitive to hypoxic conditions and show lower metabolic rates than closely related surface organisms this was shown for example for the hypogean species niphargus n sp compared to the epigean species gammarus n sp danielopol 1989 or the hypogean copepod d belgicus compared to the epigean eucyclops serrulatus inhabiting the same aquifer di lorenzo et al 2015c these results are in agreement with the findings of wilhelm et al 2006 who detected 2 4 5 times lower oxygen consumption rates in the stygobite gammarus acherondytes than in the stygophile species gammarus troglophilus hypogean and epigean populations of gammarus minus on the other hand showed similar survival times and metabolic responses under hypoxic conditions hervant et al 1999 both not being very tolerant to do depletion the assumption may be that hypogean species are able to regulate their respiration which is highly efficient in environments with fluctuating oxygen levels lawniczak et al 2013 perceived a very fast and effective system to cope with anoxic conditions in n rhenorhodanensis the animals were able to restore their cells oxidative balance very quickly after hypoxia and therefore avoid oxidative cell damage due to free radicals however studies indicated that this is not universally the case for subterranean organisms and also demonstrated that metabolic rates are related to oxygen availability and or the energetic state of the ecosystem malard and hervant 1999 mösslacher and creuzé des châtelliers 1996 4 synopsis urban aquifers are huge complex and mostly unexplored ecosystems harbouring a vast biodiversity of microorganisms and invertebrates these organisms are responsible for providing a diverse collection of essential ecosystem services and may be endangered by the various stressors associated with the concentrated human activity in urban areas here not only single pollutants pose a risk to the groundwater organisms but multiple stressors and contaminant mixtures can cause dramatic changes in groundwater quality and environmental conditions turning the habitat hostile to groundwater communities especially metals a range of organic chemicals and elevated temperatures are stressors present in every city s subsurface and therefore impose a serious risk to the vulnerable groundwater ecosystems due to their persistence organic chemicals introduced to groundwater may remain for decades and are toxic to non targeted organisms even at low concentrations li et al 2021 some organic chemical e g btex show a high mobility with groundwater bulatović et al 2021 and an increase in temperature will further accelerate the solubility and mobility of many organics niculae et al 2018 as a consequence of increased temperatures and organic pollution low levels of dissolved oxygen are very common to occur in urban groundwater with conditions frequently switching from oxic to hypoxic and anoxic brielmann et al 2011 this is resulting in a highly stressful environment for groundwater invertebrates in urban areas point source pollution such as sewage leakage may play an important role at a very local scale with altered faunal communities notenboom et al 1995 scarsbrook and fenwick 2003 tione et al 2016 for example higher numbers of oligochaeta as well as microturbellaria and nematoda which are known to cope with less favourable conditions low do contents and higher temperatures hahn et al 2013 were spotted in urban wells compared to wells in forest areas in the city of karlsruhe germany koch et al 2021 stygobionts have shown to react sensitively to some of these stressors with increased mortality and changes in community diversity yet the few data available are often inconclusive and especially testing of chemical mixtures or long term chronic tests are missing by this the conclusions that can be drawn so far are affected by a high uncertainty in field and laboratory studies stygobiontic invertebrates showed high sensitivity to ammonium and organic contaminants including a wide range of pesticides due to accumulation of these pollutants in groundwater organisms invertebrates and microbes and interactions with other substances the whole ecosystem functioning may be affected for example michel et al 2021 observed an inhibition of denitrification due to esa metolachlor 10 μg l 1 and propiconazole as well as 1 2 4 triazole 2 and 10 μg l 1 which are metabolites of the pesticide s metolachlor thereby the reduction of nitrate to nitrite was affected on the protein level in microorganisms also the toxicity of several metals e g lc50 values below the who drinking water limits for cr cu and zn observed in some copepoda amphipoda and synacrida and the sensitivity to mid to long term groundwater temperature increases or repeated heat stress may be of high risk for urban stygobionts groundwater organisms with narrow tolerance breadths are likely to be at risk at increasing habitat pollution and will be replaced by competitive stronger surface relatives which may result in altered structures of trophic chains and related ecosystem processes mermillod blondin et al 2013 little is known about these complex interactions involving microorganisms and invertebrates and potentially affecting groundwater ecosystem services several studies targeting surface ecosystems demonstrated that a reduction in biodiversity has negative effects on ecosystem functions boulton et al 2008 loreau et al 2001 and same may be expected for groundwater habitats moreover in the subsurface extinction of species will not be easily reversible as groundwater ecosystems are highly fragmented harbouring extremely rare and often endemic species physiological and biogeochemical responses in organisms which are temperature dependent are also linked to increasing temperature in urban groundwater hochachka and somero 2002 increasing temperatures stimulate metabolic rates lushchak 2011 simčič and sket 2021 consequently an elevated temperature in combination with organic pollution increases the pollution uptake as observed for juveniles of e serrulatus by di lorenzo et al 2015b also juveniles seem to be more sensitive than adults this may be due to a thinner exoskeleton pollutant uptake mainly through the body surface and higher metabolic rates compared to adults elevated influx rate no or just a low risk seems to come from low oxygen levels for which stygofaunal animals were shown to be very tolerant to studies have shown that oxygen levels below 0 01 mg l 1 are lethal to stygobionts in the long run even though stygobiont species are much more tolerant to low oxygen levels than epigean species and have evolved strategies to cope effectively with hypoxic conditions nevertheless due to fast oxygen depletion occurring with high amounts of organic matter and stimulated microbial metabolisms due to higher temperatures for example anoxic zones in urban aquifers may arise with these invertebrates will be eliminated and anaerobic microbial metabolisms will prevail toxic by products e g hydrogen sulphide of such processes will additionally impair groundwater quality those zones typically occur only locally in urban aquifers but can easily spread to larger areas due to import of organic chemicals and heat fauna in groundwater is reported within a wide range of do levels several studies indicated do levels as well as land use to be drivers of faunal assemblage patterns and shifts in niche occupation dole olivier et al 2009 dumas and lescher moutoué 2001 hahn 2002 marmonier et al 2018 tione et al 2016 for example koch et al 2021 found a significant correlation between the number of taxa and the do levels in the city of karlsruhe germany for nitrate altered juvenile to adult and female to male ratios were detected indicating that long term nitrate pollution may have altered the stygofaunal assemblage as a whole and less tolerant species may have vanished over time which is also likely to occur in cities existing and developing for decades many field studies also observed the vanishing of stygobiont species in aquifers with high salinity indicating the high sensitivity of groundwater invertebrates castano sanchez et al 2020b which may also be true for long term contaminated urban aquifers 5 further perspectives and conclusions it is worth mentioning that there are no established standard methods for sampling and toxicity testing or representative groundwater test organisms as critically discussed by di lorenzo et al 2019b due to the difficulties in proper feeding and cultivation of stygobionts in the laboratory they worked out ten recommendations for toxicological testing of stygobionts including for example acclimation times of at least 48 h before testing test durations including the standard times but also exceeding 96 h no feed throughout short term testing or species identification of tested stygobionts compared to the wide range of toxicants and pollution sources in urban areas only a small number of contaminants was intensively tested until now especially the effect of microplastics on groundwater organisms is still unclear microplastics are already found widely in groundwater with amounts of 16 pieces l campos and pestana 2020 or 15 2 pieces l in karst groundwater systems panno et al 2019 despite the fact that microplastic were found in 93 of 260 drinking water sources in 11 countries marsden et al 2019 their impact on the environment and organisms is rarely discovered chia et al 2021 the destructive effect on soil organisms earthworms mites nematodes snails includes metabolism disruption increased mortality decreased growth rate or damage of gut chia et al 2021 huang et al 2021 microplastic can originate from landfills sewage sludge fertilizer covering plastic covering littering or dumping in the future more research is needed to identify sources transport pathways incorporation in organisms and adsorption of toxic substances chia et al 2021 also typical cecs in urban groundwater like a variety of drugs pesticides food additives and personal care products need more research regarding effective sampling and analysing techniques and their effects on stygofauna tang et al 2020 in particular studies observing the effects of contaminant mixtures and other superpositioning factors typical for urban subsurface are rare furthermore increasing temperatures revealed to affect the sensitivity to the possible pollutants due to observed differing bioaccumulation rates of contaminants and sensitivities as well as lower oxygen consumption rates of stygobionts canivet et al 2001 di lorenzo et al 2014 di marzio et al 2009 di marzio et al 2018 schäfers et al 2001 wilhelm et al 2006 in comparison with surface relatives but also within stygobiontic species it may be important to measure a variety of metabolic processes and by products for a better comparison and understanding of organisms sensitivities for improvement of knowledge field surveys must include the sampling of fauna routinely record of physio chemical and microbiological parameters in general the knowledge about the origin fate and distribution of urban contaminants and hydraulic properties of urban aquifers needs to be improved by constant monitoring and modelling of current and possible future conditions miller et al 2020 until now only one study has tried to acquire an absolute understanding of urban groundwater characteristics and their influence on the groundwater ecosystem by this koch et al 2021 found no significant correlations between physico chemical characteristics and biodiversity patterns of the stygofaunal community contrastingly differences in spatial distributions were supported the future goal is to increase the number of such studies to gain knowledge about the effects of urban pollution and if biological parameters are suitable for groundwater quality monitoring even in urban areas one main question is also if existing thresholds are needed to improve or if new thresholds for example for temperature pollution have to be defined for this detailed assessments and validation of existing thresholds of different contaminants based on intensive field studies and toxicity tests have to be carried out also research and management strategies need to consider the interactions between different realms and that pressures occurring in one realm can have impacts on another for example groundwater extraction or surface sealing can result in a loss or change of connectivity of water bodies and with that recharge rates groundwater quality biodiversity or biomass in groundwater ecosystems can be affected effluents from industrial facilities contaminated with different chemicals can affect physico chemical and ecological habitat loss biodiversity conditions of the aquifer furthermore such local pressures concerning groundwater bodies chemical contamination heat pollution water extraction surface sealing affecting the urban groundwater overlap with regional and global pressures like climate change or land use changes bugnot et al 2019 in conclusion tolerance breadths seem to be very species specific as well as location dependent and forms of pre adaptations to high pollution concentrations must be considered in spite of this it is unclear if these observations are just valid for the short term or will last for a longer period of time periods especially since pollution in groundwater can remain for several years and decades the water quality only recovers slowly even after elimination of the source of pollution and remediation are very expensive and often not possible prevention is the recommended strategy evanko and dzombak 1997 hashim et al 2011 hose 2005 to ensure a sustainable use of groundwater while conserving a diverse and functional ecosystem it will be important to limit metal salt and organic contamination pollution as well

1307,groundwater fauna stygofauna comprises organisms that have adapted to the dark subterranean environment over a course of thousands and millions of years typically having slow metabolisms and long life cycles they are crucial players in the groundwater of oxygenic aquifers and contribute to various ecosystem services today s knowledge of their sensitivity to anthropogenic impacts is incomplete and a critical analysis of the general relevance of local findings is lacking in this review we focus on those areas with the highest interference between humans and stygofauna cities here is where local pollution by various contaminants and heat strongly stresses the unique groundwater ecosystems it is demonstrated that it is difficult to discern the influence of individual factors from the findings reported in field studies and to extrapolate laboratory results to field conditions the effects of temperature increase and chemical pollution vary strongly between tested species and test conditions in general previous findings indicate that heating especially in the long term will increase mortality and less adapted species are at risk of vanishing from their habitats the same may be true for salinity caused by road de icing in cold urban areas furthermore high sensitivities were shown for ammonium which will probably be even more pronounced with rising temperatures resulting in altered biodiversity patterns toxicity of heavy metals for a variety of invertebrates increases with time and chronic exposure our current knowledge reveals diverse potential impacts on groundwater fauna by urban pollution but our insights gained so far can only be validated by standardized and long term test concepts graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords stygofauna groundwater ecology thermal impacts groundwater pollution urban ecology 1 introduction groundwater is the most extracted raw material it supplies half of the world s population with drinking water and is used extensively for irrigation and industry griebler and avramov 2015 siebert et al 2010 the perception of groundwater as an essential resource however ignores that aquifers host vulnerable ecosystems to date the protection of aquifers is mainly motivated by economic considerations for securing freshwater production there is little attention to the biodiversity and functionality of hidden subterranean ecosystems that are much less understood than those of surface waters in fact aquifers are densely colonized and harbour highly diverse microbial ghiorse and wilson 1988 griebler and lueders 2009 hirsch et al 1992 karwautz and griebler 2022 malard 2022 and invertebrate stygofaunal communities including many relictual and endemic species gibert et al 2009 humphreys 2009 true groundwater fauna stygobites spend their whole life cycle in the subsurface and rarely establishes stable populations in surface waters gibert et al 1994 one reason is their long term adaptation to dark temperature stable and generally energy poor environments resulting in a slow metabolism and long lifespans the regression and lack of eyes and pigmentation along with the slow metabolism put groundwater invertebrates at a disadvantage when competing in surface water giere 2008 their high specialization augments sensitivity and vulnerability to anthropogenic impacts like temperature changes groundwater pollution altered hydrological conditions and habitat loss due to water table drawdown danielopol et al 2003 korbel and hose 2015 marmonier et al 2013 stein et al 2010 aquifers deviate the most from their natural state in urbanized regions schirmer et al 2013 this is where multiple direct anthropogenic stressors occur simultaneously causing abrupt spatial and temporal changes in water quantity and quality quantitative impacts stem from local well based extraction and injection of water as a part of urban water management from modifications of the hydraulic regime related to the installation of subsurface infrastructure as well as from substantial changes in groundwater recharge due to urban land use and surface sealing benz et al 2016 wong et al 2012 changes in the hydraulic conditions and subsurface water circulation have consequences for groundwater quality groundwater quality beneath cities is influenced by local pollution from industrial and communal waste waters underground pipe leakage atmospheric deposition and traffic as well as by a typically altered thermal regime fig 1 as a consequence aquifers located in rural regions are often favoured as primary freshwater sources to supply cities this limits the attention to urban aquifers as safeguard environments and habitats which also need be protected our current knowledge about subterranean ecosystems in urban areas is incomplete and disperse and the role of multiple interacting factors in particular has hardly been tackled moreover different urban realms are interconnected and can impact each other especially pressures occurring localized in a terrestrial realm can have an impact on a larger spatial scale in the groundwater ecosystem causing changes in ecological and chemical characteristics bugnot et al 2019 in the present review the focus lies on groundwater fauna in urban environments and the knowledge available from diverse case studies in the following first fundamental properties of groundwater fauna are introduced second key factors of anthropogenic disturbance in urban groundwater ecosystems such as warming oxygen depletion and chemical pollution including nutrients organic pollutants heavy metals and salt are elaborated upon based on this the major urban factors for survival diversity and metabolic mechanisms of groundwater fauna are summarized along with conclusions and future research needs 2 characteristics of groundwater fauna aquifers contain unique subterranean ecosystems with a vast diversity of invertebrates including micro meio and macrofauna stygofauna is adapted to its extraordinary environment characterized by the absence of light and low inputs of nutrients and organic matter through the reduction or even total loss of eyes and pigmentation the elongation of the body shape and the development of sensory features enabling it to move and forage in this habitat gibert et al 1994 moreover stygobionts are thought to be long lived gibert et al 1994 voituron et al 2011 they undergo slower growth and have fewer offspring than their surface relatives gibert et al 1994 humphreys 2009 groundwater fauna can also typically tolerate low oxygen concentrations malard and hervant 1999 stygofauna is typically dominated by arthropods in particular crustaceans from the classes ostracoda copepoda malacostraca amphipoda isopoda syncarida are highly represented further arthropods resemble mites acari beetles and other insects additionally abundant groups of organisms in groundwater are worms from the phyla plathelminthes turbellaria annelida oligochaeta and polychaeta and nematoda less frequently found members of stygofauna include molluscs gastropoda fig 2 humphreys 2009 the stygobiont community is characterized by high endemism and relict species whereby the latter successfully survived periods of geological and climatic change aquifers are living museums humphreys 2009 groundwater fauna

lueders 2009 the microbial communities do not only constitute the main fraction of biomass and biodiversity in the subsurface whitman et al 1998 but they also hold the key responsibility for

biofilms on sediments detritus and rock surfaces which are grazed on by invertebrates and therefore serve as the food base for the meso and macrofauna barlocher and murdoch 1989 saccò et al 2022 the grazing of these biofilms by stygofauna in turn may stimulate microbial activity and productivity and it may reduce clogging of pores and thereby modify local micro scale conditions griebler and avramov 2015 schmidt et al 2017 stygofauna is involved in the carbon cycle via retardation and decomposition of particulate organic matter griebler and avramov 2015 movement and burrowing bioturbation of stygofauna influence the hydraulic properties of aquifers voids are maintained open as well as created in materials with low conductivity e g clay and fine sand danielopol 1989 stumpp and hose 2017 ecosystem services and goods are processes and products provided by natural ecosystems and their inhabitants contributing to human well being groundwater ecosystem services are manifold including 1 purification storage and provision of clean water via biodegradation immobilization of contaminants and elimination of pathogens and 2 supply of geothermal energy to name two prominent examples griebler and avramov 2015 until now however a fundamental understanding of the relationship between stygofauna and groundwater ecosystem services is lacking without doubt due to the constantly increasing number and accumulation of pollutants in aquifers as well as their overuse and exploitation particularly in urban areas the risk of negative effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services is increasing di lorenzo et al 2021a di lorenzo et al 2018 griebler et al 2019 3 pressures in urban aquifers and groundwater fauna response 3 1 rising temperature 3 1 1 temperature in urban aquifers in the following we refer to absolute temperatures in degree celsius c and for clarity use the kelvin k scale to indicate relative thermal changes a prominent feature of urban aquifers is the altered thermal regime with elevated and highly spatially variable groundwater temperatures when compared to more natural and rural areas benz et al 2016 temperature is of particular importance in determining physiological activity and phenology of animals due to temperature dependence of enzymatic reactions colinet et al 2015 also temperature effects on the groundwater physico chemical characteristics are well known see a summary in griebler et al 2016 reduced oxygen concentrations and ph values for example have frequently been observed with groundwater warming riedel 2019 groundwater is typically thermally stable with temperatures in shallow aquifers close to the annual mean of the air temperature however in case of infiltrating conditions from surface water and in highly dynamic aquifers seasonal temperature variability may be more locally pronounced for instance in central europe natural groundwater temperatures are typically between 10 and 12 c bannick et al 2008 whereas they can be below 8 c in high mountain areas and scandinavian regions and above 18 c in mediterranean countries benz et al 2017 tissen et al 2019 seasonally uniformity and long term stability of the thermal regime is considerably changed by anthropogenic drivers due to climate change shallow quaternary aquifer temperatures are expected to rise by up to 5 k at a latitude of 45 within the next century menberg et al 2014 taylor and stefan 2009 in urban areas these long term background changes are superimposed by the direct effects of modified land use heat release of basements and subsurface infrastructure as well as geothermal use fig 1 subsurface urban heat islands suhi have been observed in cities worldwide which are measured as elevated shallow groundwater and soil temperatures in urbanized regions the aquifers below more densely populated and older urban areas e g city centres often have higher temperatures than those below rural undisturbed regions where the temperatures can be more than 5 k colder most relevant anthropogenic heat sources were observed to be sealing of ground surface built up areas and underground structures e g basements tunnels benz et al 2015 böttcher and zosseder 2022 previati et al 2022 locally hot spots of more than 10 k elevation in temperature have been reported blum et al 2021 ferguson and woodbury 2007 hemmerle et al 2019 huang et al 2009 nevertheless groundwater warming is spatially heterogeneous and also dependent on the hydrogeological conditions such as flow velocity saturated thickness and depth to water and influence of anthropogenic heat sources differs strongly among cities bayer et al 2019 böttcher and zosseder 2022 zhu et al 2015 3 1 2 effects of temperature changes on groundwater organisms stygobionts are ectotherms with narrow thermal tolerance ranges and skewed temperature curves describing the relationship between temperature and physiological functions groundwater invertebrate species that have been exposed to thermal conditions deviating from their habitat temperatures exhibited thermal stress and a strong physiological response in incubation experiments of specific interest are upper thermal tolerance or and lethal temperature values survival rates are frequently expressed as lt50 values which describes the combination of temperature and time at which 50 of the observed population has died lt lethal temperature issartel et al 2005 compared the thermal stress response of the stygobiont amphipods niphargus rhenorhodanensis and niphargus virei with their surface water relative gammarus fossarum under laboratory conditions survival rates of n rhenorhodanensis were higher than those of n virei when acclimated to 12 c natural habitat temperature and were similar to the rates of the surface crustacean g fossarum which showed the highest thermal plasticity and longer duration of survival over the entire tested temperature range from 2 to 28 c fig 3a the high survival rates of n rhenorhodanensis were unexpected since they colonize similar habitats as n virei issartel et al 2005 brielmann et al 2011 found niphargus inopinatus to be more tolerant to temperature elevations than isopod proasellus cavaticus fig 3a lt50 values of both species decreased the longer the test lasted brielmann et al 2011 these results are in agreement with the observed narrow thermal tolerance breadths that apply to two p cavaticus morphospecies proasellus n sp 1 and proasellus n sp 2 reported in mermillod blondin et al 2013 in the same study survival rates found for proasellus valdensis were high 95 individual survivals at 11 c and comparable to those of n rhenorhodanensis which did not substantiate a specific adaptation to their thermally stable environment mermillod blondin et al 2013 brielmann et al 2011 performed temperature tolerance tests in a temperature gradient chamber with the two groundwater species n inopinatus amphipoda and p cavaticus isopoda in doing so a temperature gradient of 2 to 35 c was established in an acrylic glass chamber and individuals of both species were positioned at a temperature of 12 c within the gradient the temperature with the mean residence time of n inopintatus and p cavaticus was 11 7 3 4 c and 11 4 5 c respectively with most observed individuals found at temperatures between 8 and 16 c they set a threshold of 16 c above which no individuals showed survival or residence according to the lower thermal tolerance of p cavaticus detected during the temperature response tests the individuals in the temperature gradient chamber demonstrated rigidity at 22 9 23 5 and 25 c which was not identified for n inopinatus brielmann et al 2011 castano sanchez et al 2020b determined the upper thermal limits utl whereby the utl50 is the upper lethal temperature affecting 50 of the population and was estimated from the lt50s taken every 24 h within the warming period highest sensitivity was observed for members of the fauna group harpacticoida ameiridae n sp with utl50 values of 24 8 0 2 c followed by cyclopoida diacyclops n sp utl50 26 9 0 2 c and syncarida parabathynellidae n sp utl50 30 c in other experiments the influence of temperature changes on physiological features was investigated oxygen consumption or standard respiration rates srr revealed no significant change for different stygobiontic species of different phylogenetic groups e g diacyclops belgicus copepod n virei n rhenorhodanensis amphipoda with elevated temperatures 14 21 c di lorenzo and galassi 2017 issartel et al 2005 mermillod blondin et al 2013 the unaffected physiological activities of d belgicus may be due to adaptation to groundwater temperatures of 14 15 9 c in a mediterranean shallow aquifer and the wide geographical range of the species di lorenzo and galassi 2017 furthermore q10 values describing temperature dependence of a physiological process like respiration rate indicate temperature sensitivity of organisms thereby if the q10 value is estimated to be 1 the respiration rate is independent of temperature if q10 1 or q10 1 the process is considered to be temperature dependent and respiration is increasing or decreasing with temperature for example a q10 value of 2 indicates a doubling of the respiration rate when temperature increases by 10 c respiration rates and the q10 value were estimated by issartel et al 2005 very high or low q10 values indicate temperatures that cause irreparable protein damage and therefore inhibition of the physiological system hochachka and somero 2002 q10 values were always higher in n virei signifying a lower capacity to maintain enzymatic activities with elevated temperatures in comparison to n rhenorhodanensis issartel et al 2005 q10 value for d belgicus indicated a possible beginning of irreversible denaturation of enzymes at increased temperatures di lorenzo and galassi 2017 increasing temperatures stimulate metabolic processes which may be even more pronounced in thermally sensitive stygobionts compared to epigean relatives as presented by simčič and sket 2021 for the hypogean species n stygius and the epigean species n zagrebensis with higher temperatures the epigean eucyclops serrulatus exhibited accelerated metabolic activities as well as shortened development times nauplius to adult 20 d at 15 c 14 days at 20 c maier 1990 35 days at 18 c 21 days at 21 c cifoni et al 2017 and life spans 42 d at 20 c 96 5 d at 15 c cifoni et al 2017 maier 1990 another way to determine temperature sensitivity and tolerance of groundwater organisms is the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of stress responses for example via catecholamine levels avramov et al 2013 heat shock proteins colson proch et al 2010 or immune response detection of free amino acids and sugars mermillod blondin et al 2013 catecholamines noradrenaline adrenaline dopamine are involved in the physiological response to stress groundwater species already exhibiting very high initial catecholamine levels showed an increased stress response with a sudden temperature increase of 6 and 12 k due to their storage of catecholamines stygobionts are able to react faster to stress than their surface relatives which may be an adaptation to food scarcity and their energy limited environment however if this storage is emptied recovery may be critical avramov et al 2013 therefore in the long term groundwater organisms may be less tolerant to thermal changes with respect to an inhibited catecholamine synthesis this would be in agreement with the results of colson proch et al 2010 who observed a significant stress reaction n rhenorhodanensis exposed to a heat shock of 6 c after 1 and 2 months in a field study brielmann et al 2009 reported a decreased faunal diversity with elevated temperatures in observation wells distributed within and outside a heat plume originating from an industrial facility no effect was found with respect to the faunal abundance in another field survey by spengler 2017 the biodiversity of groundwater crustaceans in the upper rhine valley germany was observed to change significantly above 14 c in this study temperature increase was correlated with a decrease in stygobiont species abundance 3 2 salt pollution from road de icing 3 2 1 salt in urban aquifers salt in urban groundwater can originate from landfill leachate septic tank effluents animal feeds industrial effluents sewage effluents water conditioning salt fertilizers kcl and seasonally from road de icing fig 1 aghazadeh et al 2010 kelly 2008 kelly et al 2012 since the late 1940s the most commonly used de icing salt is nacl due to its low cost easy use and storage and its high efficiency jandová et al 2020 thirty five million metric tons of salt are used annually worldwide and the trend is increasing in response to the expansion of urban areas and impervious surfaces johnsson and adl zarrabi 2019 kelly 2008 approximately 60 of the applied salt is subjected to surface runoff each year and transported to surface waters during the spring snow melt the remainder accumulates in groundwater perera et al 2013 chloride as the primary environmental contaminant in salt is not toxic to human health in concentrations usually found in drinking water who 2011 and highly soluble and mobile in water foos 2003 concentrations vary greatly depending on background concentrations run off behaviour geology and hydrogeology as well as salt application amounts in the study areas a rapid degradation of water quality due to road salt in urban areas has been reported multiple times aghazadeh et al 2010 cooper et al 2014 daley et al 2009 kelly et al 2012 williams et al 2000 average concentrations of chloride in cities with intense road de icing salt applications ranged between 415 mg l 1 and 1100 mg l 1 aghazadeh et al 2010 williams et al 2000 particularly high chloride concentrations were observed along heavily treated roads in urban regions bester et al 2006 jamshidi et al 2020 jandová et al 2020 chloride contamination is a long lasting problem for groundwater as well as surface water it might take decades to wash out the chloride even after salt application would immediately be stopped bester et al 2006 jamshidi et al 2020 ludwikowski and peterson 2018 model scenarios by bester et al 2006 for southwest ontario canada or ludwikowski and peterson 2018 for illinois usa showed that even with a reduction of salt application by 100 it will take decades until groundwater reaches a safe drinking water quality again 3 2 2 salt effects on groundwater organisms studies which discuss the influence of road salt on groundwater organisms are rare research projects mainly focused on community level effects and the characterization of aquifers which were not necessarily anthropogenically used or polluted in australian aquifers most taxa were found in groundwater with electrical conductivity ec values below 1500 μs cm hancock and boulton 2008 whereby no significant correlation between faunal abundance and ec was identified in portuguese and algerian aquifers wells with highly saline groundwater had the lowest stygofaunal abundances compared to the total of collected fauna mahi et al 2019 mencio et al 2014 this was also the case for a coastal aquifer in portugal affected by seawater intrusion gastropods as well as ostracods seemed to be more abundant in wells with a lower salinity furthermore the absence of the stygobiont species eucyclops hadjebensis and acanthocyclops sensitivus in high salinity bores was observed however the presence of megacyclops brachypus for example was more related to high salinity bores shapouri et al 2016 the authors found ec to be one of the major parameters affecting the faunal assemblage which is in agreement with results of some other studies castano sanchez et al 2020b dole olivier et al 2009 shapouri et al 2016 in contrast to these findings schulz et al 2013 detected high stygofaunal abundances of the three taxa cyclopoida harpacticoida and bathynellacaea in highly saline waters exceeding marine conductivities also tione et al 2016 discovered exclusive copepod species stygonitocrella n sp in a brackish well with high salinity average 2737 mg l 1 chloride the authors concluded that groundwater species are able to adapt to special hydrochemical conditions and that salinity may be one main influencing factor for species to occur in three papers castano sanchez et al 2020b castaño sánchez et al 2021 castano sanchez et al 2021 observed mortality rates of stygobiont species under laboratory conditions or in situ fig 3b first the authors investigated the salinity tolerance of diacyclops n sp ameiridae n sp and parabathynellidae n sp over a time period of 96 h syncarida were the most tolerant taxa and cyclopoida species were more tolerant to salinity than harpacticoid species fig 3b the more tolerant taxa thereby were sampled from an aquifer with higher salinity and the authors assumed a pre adaptation to local conditions or a broader tolerance in these taxa castano sanchez et al 2020b in a second study adults and juvenile epigean diacyclops crassicaudis crassicaudis were shown to be slightly more tolerant than diacyclops n sp and twice as tolerant as the harpacticoid ameiridae n sp castano sanchez et al 2021 thereby copepodites were more sensitive than adult animals in a very recent study different isopods were tested in situ and under varying laboratory conditions all three species proasellus cavaticus proasellus lusitanicus and proasellus assaforensis were more tolerant to nacl under in situ conditions than the taxa tested in the previous studies fig 3b p assaforensis was more tolerant under lab conditions than the other tested taxa but had a lower mortality in situ which may be explained by induced transportation stress or acclimation to the laboratory conditions castaño sánchez et al 2021 3 3 organic chemicals 3 3 1 vocs in urban aquifers groundwater pollution with organic chemicals is a major issue in urban and industrial landscapes and include a variety of contaminant groups such as aliphatic aromatic or chlorinated organic chemicals many being quite soluble in water mobile and volatile vocs vocs are commonly represented by halogenated solvents e g pce tce dce vc dcm btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and pahs e g naphthalene phenanthrene fluoranthene pyrene and fluorene bulatović et al 2021 gesels et al 2021 liu et al 2020 park et al 2005 squillace et al 2004 these organic chemicals originate from diverse sources including former gasification plants infrastructures like oil storage and gas stations urban traffic and transport of oil and gas including accidental spills textile and car industry with dry cleaning processes manufactured products used in buildings paints cleaning agents adhesives furnishings floor and wall coverings combustion products and leaking landfills fig 1 han et al 2013 kuroda and fukushi 2008 miller et al 2020 in particular big cities suffer from the legacy of gasification plants and the subsurface dumping of waste products such as tar oil meckenstock et al 2010 concentrations of organic chemicals in urban groundwater can span several orders of magnitude while at former gasification plants and specific sites of accidental spill and leakage btex and pah concentrations in contaminated groundwater can reach values of 100 mg l 1 and 10 mg l 1 e g anneser et al 2008 anneser et al 2010 bulatović et al 2021 griebler et al 2004 meckenstock et al 2010 urban groundwater concentrations are generally more in the μgl 1 range e g han et al 2013 liu et al 2020 ilić et al 2021 similarly chlorinated solvents at industrial megasites may exhibit concentrations up to the lower mg l 1 range e g wycisk et al 2003 frequently contamination levels in urban groundwater exceed who limits gesels et al 2021 3 3 2 cecs in urban aquifers other groups of organic chemicals are summarized as contaminants of emerging concern cecs summarizing chemicals which were detected only recently and are not yet regulated but may be of future concern bunting et al 2021 cecs include pesticides pharmaceuticals personal care products fragrances water treatment by products drugs artificial sweeteners among others richardson and ternes 2011 and mainly originate from effluents of waste water treatment plants hospital effluents private and public gardens parks landfills and livestock farming li et al 2021 mojiri et al 2020 stuart et al 2012 cecs are not effectively removed by water treatment processes and are therefore released to the aquatic environment and infiltrate into shallow urban aquifers richards et al 2021 stuart et al 2012 the top ten cecs in european groundwater were recently compiled by bunting et al 2021 i e carbamazepine caffeine sulfamethoxazole bisphenol a bpa ibuprofen acetaminophen n n diethyl m toluamide diclofenac chlorobenzene a similar set of compounds is found in urban groundwater all over the world with local and regional particularities e g higher fraction of pesticides and or drugs koroša et al 2016 pinasseau et al 2019 sharma et al 2019 pesticides in this context are of particular importance based on their mode of effect they are classified into four main groups namely fungicides herbicides insecticides and others miticides algaecides mojiri et al 2020 especially in the vicinity of agricultural areas and due to their application in urban gardens and parks pesticides can reach high concentrations in urban groundwater as it is shown for patna city india richards et al 2021 maribor slovenia koroša et al 2016 lyon france pinasseau et al 2019 or doncaster u k white et al 2016 even pesticides that are not authorized anymore like atrazine propazine and simazine are regularly found at elevated concentrations 2 230 ng l 1 koroša et al 2016 3 3 3 nitrate in urban aquifers high nitrate concentrations are one of the primary causes of groundwater pollution nitrate is characterized by a high solubility mobility in soils and sediments and stability at oxic conditions zhang et al 2015 it becomes toxic for humans at high concentrations and the drinking water threshold is set at 50 mg l 1 who 2011 urban sources of nitrate are irrigation runoff from fertilized urban green areas public gardens animal waste leaching of landfills domestic waste industrial wastewater leaking sewage pipelines and atmospheric depositions gu et al 2013 guimarães et al 2019 hosono et al 2011 ren and zhang 2020 wakida and lerner 2005 especially in areas with poor sanitation where pit latrines and septic tanks are common elevated nitrate levels can be observed walraevens et al 2015 in oxygenated aquifers nitrate may originate from nitrification of ammonia when conditions shift to hypoxic and anoxic nitrate is biologically reduced to n2o and n2 denitrification or ammonia dissimilar nitrate reduction to ammonia dnra groundwater can be affected very seriously by human activity with gradually increasing nitrate levels shown to accompany urbanization and economic development even if concentrations were within limits set by the world health organization who or only single wells exceeded these limits e g chicago lisbon milan and karlsruhe de caro et al 2017 gu et al 2013 hwang et al 2015 koch et al 2021 martin del campo et al 2014 ren and zhang 2020 teixeira et al 2018 with concentrations of 89 52 shijiazhuang 93 2 barcelona 145 manila or 60 porto mg l 1 on average groundwater in these cities is in an alarming state and certainly not suitable for drinking purposes guimarães et al 2019 hosono et al 2011 jurado et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 3 3 4 ammonium in urban aquifers natural levels of ammonium are typically below 0 2 mg l 1 who 2011 and increased concentrations are usually caused by faecal pollution from sewage leakages pit latrines industrial and domestic wastewaters fertilization livestock farming and landfill leachates bruce and mcmahon 1996 ikem et al 2002 kurilic et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 thresholds for drinking water quality are set at 0 5 mg l eu european union 2020 moreover contrary to nitrate ammonium is mainly present in reducing conditions in aquifers since nitrification may lead to a transformation to nitrate under oxic conditions high ammonium levels correlating with low levels of dissolved oxygen were observed in urban and industrial areas bruce and mcmahon 1996 jurado et al 2013 ammonium pollution in urban aquifers is of importance as the following values indicate some sites in lisbon 0 2 04 mg l 1 teixeira et al 2018 milan 0 1 43 mg l 1 de caro et al 2017 krakow 1 957 2 618 mg l 1 binkowski et al 2017 or temerin 0 07 4 2 mg l 1 kurilic et al 2015 exceeded national limits or natural background values especially urban and suburban areas where adequate sanitary conditions infrastructure for local water supply and waste water treatment is lacking high ammonium levels can frequently be detected as observed in serbia petkovic et al 2011 zimbabwe gumindoga et al 2019 or zambia de waele et al 2004 3 3 5 effects on groundwater fauna data available on the ecotoxicological effects of organic pollutants to stygobiontic fauna are extremely scarce and interpretation is difficult most toxicity studies with organic chemicals and stygobionts were carried out with pesticides including α endosulfan 3 4 dichlorophenol aldicarb ariane chlorpyrifos desethylatrazine imazamox penthaclorophenol s metolachlor and thiram sensitivity of groundwater organisms was highly variable and highest sensitivities were observed with the substances compiled in table 1 for example n rhenorhodanensis showed high survival with the highest concentration of s metolachlor and desethylatrazine tested which exceeded concentrations typically found in the environment maazouzi et al 2016 the authors therefore concluded that there is no short term threat of those two pesticides to groundwater fauna in comparison parastenocaris germanica was much more sensitive to pentachlorophenol or aldicarb table 1 moreover juveniles tended to be more sensitive and differences between higher and lower groundwater crustaceans with respect to their organismic complexity were found with the latter one seeming to be less tolerant notenboom and boessenkool 1992 schäfers et al 2001 groundwater crustaceans reacted with a delay or were less sensitive to individual pesticides when compared to related epigean species on the basis of metabolic activity measurements schäfers et al 2001 taking the slow metabolism of groundwater fauna into account it is a specific deficit that data from chronic ecotoxicity tests are missing completely volatile organic compounds vocs such as toluene acute lc50 64 68 mg l 1 or bpa are obviously highly tolerated lc50 24 h 6 mg l 1 respectively by selected groundwater invertebrates in acute tests gerhardt 2019 however the few compounds tested are not at all representative for the vast diversity of vocs present in urban groundwater and again information from chronic tests is extremely scarce e g toluene chronic lc50 36 50 mg l 1 avramov et al 2013 also pharmaceuticals like propranolol and diclofenac were tolerated at high concentrations by respectively one stgyobiont species diacyclops belgicus di lorenzo et al 2019a nitocrella achaia di lorenzo et al 2021a and a groundwater population of diacyclops crassicaudis crassicaudis castano sanchez et al 2021 especially by adult animals and the substances may pose no or a moderate risk to european groundwater bodies di lorenzo et al 2019a di lorenzo et al 2021a observed surface and groundwater concentrations of diclofenac on the other hand are between 0 0005 and 0 5 mg l 1 and already cause sub lethal effects to crustaceans which imply a risk of this substance to stygobionts castano sanchez et al 2021 reviewing field studies at sites with intense agricultural use ammonium contamination seems to affect the whole stygobiontic copepod assemblage with the most affected species being diacyclops italianus and nitocrella psammophila in bores with higher ammonium concentrations 0 032 mg l 1 di lorenzo et al 2015a di lorenzo et al 2014 the value of 0 032 mg l 1 nh4 was estimated by di lorenzo et al 2014 to be the chronic lethal concentration for diacyclops belgicus in the same study d belgicus was also more sensitive than the epigean eucyclops serrulatus to acute and chronic ammonium exposure but showed similar sensitivity as the epigean b echinatus fig 3c di marzio et al 2009 due to synergistic effects ammonium was even more toxic to stygobionts when combined with the herbicide imazamox di marzio et al 2018 in another study metacrangonyx spinicaudatus had a higher sensitivity to ammonium chloride than typhlocirolana haouzensis fig 3c boutin et al 1995 di lorenzo et al 2015b noticed that temperature affects the toxicity of ammonia the stygoxene cyclopoid e serrulatus showed chronic lethality at 1 mg l 1 nh4 di lorenzo et al 2014 with increasing sensitivity under warmer conditions lc50 96 h at 15 c 52 mg l 1 nh4 at 18 c 24 76 mg l 1 nh4 di lorenzo et al 2015b di lorenzo et al 2014 ammonium has an impact on the growth and survival via the disruption of various physiological mechanisms osmoregulation immunology acid base balance gas exchange and induction of oxidative stress pathogenic susceptibility and histopathological damage romano and zeng 2013 only few ecotoxicological studies with nitrate and stygobionts are available gerhardt 2020 examined a slightly increased mortality from 50 to 100 mg l 1 nitrate with chronic 5 weeks nitrate exposure for the stygobiont amphipod niphargopsis casparyi proasellus slavus indicated no sensitivity to nitrate nevertheless mortality never reached 50 also ventilatory activity was significantly reduced whereas locomotor activity was independent upon nitrate levels furthermore effects of potassium nitrate on survival rates of three stygobiont species p slavus vindobonensis metacrangonyx n sp and typhlocirotana n sp were merely moderate el abiari et al 1998 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 with lc50 96 h values above 50 mg l 1 these results suggest that groundwater crustaceans may not be as sensitive to nitrate as expected similar observations were made in field studies in italy and the french pyrénées which revealed that even at sites heavily contaminated by nitrate copepod or crustacean assemblages as a whole were highly diversified and nitrate concentrations up to 150 mg l 1 had low effect on the stygobiontic community di lorenzo et al 2021b di lorenzo and galassi 2013 dumas et al 2001 dumas and lescher moutoué 2001 galassi et al 2009 however di lorenzo et al 2021b also described low juvenile to adult and male to female ratios and altered copepod assemblages reasons may be that the long term nitrate pollution has induced the disappearance of sensitive species and the following exploitation of stygophile species again juveniles may be more sensitive than adult animals di lorenzo et al 2021b often abundance and biomass did not correlate with physico chemical parameters or organic variables concluding that nutrients only play a minor role as drivers for groundwater fauna di lorenzo et al 2015a dole olivier et al 2009 dumas et al 2001 galassi et al 2009 marmonier et al 2018 consistent with these findings stein et al 2010 concluded that the effect of nitrate on groundwater fauna is indirect displaying the correlation with groundwater surface water interactions and land use impacts 3 4 metal pollution metals and metalloids are present in soils and water in colloidal particulate or dissolved form some of the most common metals in groundwater include iron fe lead pb mercury hg cadmium cd copper cu chromium cr manganese mn zinc zn nickel ni and the metalloid arsenic as groundwater naturally contains metals and although individual metals including some heavy metals are essentially required at low concentrations by micro organisms at elevated concentrations these can have neuro toxic carcinogenic mutagenic or teratogenic effects on organisms including microbes fauna and humans momodu and anyakora 2010 therefore the who 2011 has evaluated maximum contaminant levels mg l 1 for critical metals in drinking water fig 4 main causes for metal contamination and accumulation in groundwater today are urbanization industrialisation agriculture and consequently acidification which are factors that often appear side by side and can therefore interact with each other kumar et al 2012 in urban areas metals enter groundwater bodies mainly through road run off corrosion of building materials spills industrial domestic waste and surface water with areas near to pollution sources as well as older and inner parts of cities being the most impacted kumar et al 2012 santos et al 2002 wieczorek et al 2020 analyses of urban soils have shown that the level of metal contamination can be connected to traffic volume and distance to roads wang et al 2016 urban agricultural areas e g gardens parks impact groundwater through the application of pesticides fertilizers since these agents contain metals and alter groundwater properties like the ph leading to higher mobility of metals khan et al 2018 depending on the hydrogeology the composition and concentrations of metals in groundwater is very heterogeneous in space and time some metals e g fe mn can bind and release trace metals by changing from solid under oxic conditions to soluble state under reducing conditions or low ph making the redox conditions and ph important controlling factors vesper 2019 vranković et al 2017 however other influencing factors are co2 the partial pressure of o2 the impact of microbial activity and the presence of organic compounds e g humics and other pollutants including nutrients hosono et al 2011 khan et al 2018 vesper 2019 although a generalised ranking of the presence of metals in groundwater cannot be achieved due to the different geological settings and pollution situations worldwide there are differences in the solubility and association of metals with each other santos et al 2002 observed a high mobility for zn most soluble tested metal in water and cd intermediate mobility for cu and low mobility for pb furthermore kumar et al 2012 revealed positive correlations between the appearances of cd cr and cu as well as pb and zn in urban groundwater the composition mobility toxicity and bioavailability of metals in groundwater is associated with the speciation origin and age of the metals and other compounds e g phosphates and is especially in urban areas dependent on the type of industrial influence santos et al 2002 3 4 1 effects on groundwater fauna since several metals can have highly toxic effects on organisms at low concentrations they are the most tested contaminants in subterranean environments castano sanchez et al 2020a momodu and anyakora 2010 the assimilation of essential metals including some heavy metals e g fe mn cu and zn is obligatory at low levels since they are needed for growth and energy metabolism e g metals are frequent components of proteins momodu and anyakora 2010 vranković et al 2017 stygofauna can reduce the availability of metals in solution in the groundwater ecosystem to a small extent due to their ability of bioaccumulation canivet and gibert 2002 it has been observed that cave dwelling arthropods exhibit higher accumulation rates for non essential metals than for essential metals which makes them potential bioindicators for groundwater quality vranković et al 2017 in several laboratory studies hypogean species were found to be less sensitive and to have a greater tolerance to metals than epigean species reasons for this could be that groundwater species have lower metabolisms lower assimilation rates lower growth and reproduction rates and increased longevity canivet et al 2001 canivet and gibert 2002 krupa and guidolin 2003 plénet 1999 toxicity in groundwater species also increases with exposure time and chronic stress is assumed to impact the durability of groundwater populations hose et al 2016 furthermore the harsh conditions in underground habitats may be reasons for groundwater species being potentially more prone to devastating effects of metal contamination in the long run hose 2005 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 metal toxicity data are available for five groups of groundwater invertebrates namely amphipoda isopoda copepoda syncarida and oligochaeta the metals that have been tested are as cd cu cr pb and zn fig 4 toxicity values of stygofauna within and between taxonomic groups are generally variable as the sensitivity of the individual species originating from different habitats is diverse and there are mostly no correlations found between water quality taxon and sensitivity to metals hose et al 2016 however some general patterns have been observed in groundwater copepoda cr was the most toxic metal in comparison to as and zn hose et al 2016 canivet et al 2001 reported that the crustacean n rhenorhodanensis was more sensitive to cr lc50 96 h 0 23 mg l 1 cr than to as lc50 96 h 3 97 mg l 1 as in syncarids bathynellidae n sp hose et al 2019 found as lc50 336 h 0 25 mg l 1 as to be the most toxic metal followed by cr lc50 336 h 0 51 mg l 1 cr and zn lc50 336 h 1 77 mg l 1 zn the syncarids furthermore regulated zn accumulation at exposure concentrations below 1 mg zn l with increased body concentrations and mortality above that level while accumulation of as was not regulated additionally krupa and guidolin 2003 found that groundwater amphipods niphargus montellianus are more tolerant to zn than to cd and they are most sensitive to cu cr was the only metal that hypogean fauna was more sensitive to than epigean fauna in laboratory tests fig 4 the lc50 lc100 values did not differ greatly between three amphipod species m spinicaudatus n rhenorhodanensis and n aquilex aside from one value which was zn for n aquilex 180 mg l 1 the other two amphipods showed the least sensitivity to cd 3 4 5 mg l 1 cd and as 3 97 mg l 1 as in comparison to cr 0 23 1 18 mg l 1 cr pb 0 8 mg l 1 pb and especially cu 0 15 mg l 1 cu and zn 0 45 mg l 1 zn since the lc values for these were below the maximum contaminant level that is suggested for drinking water by the who fig 4 boutin et al 1995 canivet et al 2001 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 plénet 1999 the genus that was tested most extensively in isopoda was proasellus including five species p lusitanicus p assaforensis p cavaticus p coxalis cavaticus and p slavus vindobonensis followed by caecidatea including two species c bicrenata and c stygia and typhlocirolana haouzensis t haouzensis thereby was observed as the most tolerant species over all with comparatively high lc50 48 h values for cd 150 mg l 1 cd cu 17 mg l 1 cu and pb 90 mg l 1 pb and equally high values for zn 19 5 mg l 1 zn compared to the other isopod species fig 4 furthermore isopoda generally seem to be less sensitive to zn 9 5 127 mg l 1 zn than amphipoda 0 45 180 mg l 1 zn and copepoda 0 5 10 mg l 1 zn for cd cr cu and pb the values were highly variable between isopod species as well as isopoda and other groups fig 4 bosnak and morgan 1981a 1981b boutin et al 1995 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 mösslacher and notenboom 1999 reboleira et al 2013 with respect to copepoda which are generally the most abundant group in groundwater many species were tested for metal toxicity including the stygobite parastenocaris germanica incl lc values for copepodites notenboom and boessenkool 1992 notenboom et al 1992 two undetermined groundwater species of cyclopoida and one species of harpacticoida hose et al 2016 stygophile populations of acanthocyclops vernalis diacyclops bicuspidatus megacyclops viridis mösslacher and notenboom 1999 and bryocamptus echinatus di marzio et al 2009 as well as stygoxene species including attheyella crassa di marzio et al 2009 bryocamptus zschokkei burton et al 2002 b pygmaeus and b minutus all belonging to the genus bryocamptus di marzio et al 2009 in comparison to other stygofauna groups the lc values for copepoda were in close range of the different species tested indicating comparable metal tolerance toxicity for all tested species increased with test duration fig 4 furthermore the tolerance of b zschokkei for cu 0 29 mg l 1 cu and of a harpacticoid species for cr in 14 and 28 day experiments 0 03 and 0 02 mg l 1 cr as well as the ec50 lc50 values for zn in several groundwater crustaceans including amphipods copepods and syncarids were below the maximum contaminant levels for drinking water recommended by the who 2 mg l 1 cu 0 05 mg l 1 cr and 3 mg l 1 zn fig 4 burton et al 2002 di marzio et al 2009 hose et al 2019 hose et al 2016 notenboom and boessenkool 1992 notenboom et al 1992 for the group oligochaeta only one groundwater species trichodrilus tenuis has been tested tested metals lc50 96 h were cd of which the tolerance in t tenuis was relatively low 1 05 mg l 1 cd compared to the other groundwater invertebrates and zn 8 3 mg l 1 zn of which the value was within the highly variable range between the groups fig 4 meinel and krause 1988 meinel et al 1989 3 5 oxygen depletion 3 5 1 dissolved oxygen in urban aquifers in natural aquifers dissolved oxygen do levels are spatially heterogeneous at macro meso and microscales they also reflect sediment composition and structure groundwater flow velocity mineralogy and organic matter content as well as abundance and activity of organisms malard and hervant 1999 usually groundwater is undersaturated with dissolved oxygen and do with concentrations below 0 1 mg l is suspected to be a limiting factor for groundwater fauna strayer 1994 for confined aquifers malard and hervant 1999 indicated gradients between 9 10 5 and 1 5 10 2 mg l 1 o2 m 2 whereby no replenishment of oxygen from the surface is possible in parafluvial aquifers oxygen levels range from 2 10 2 to 1 mg l 1 o2 m 2 and in unconfined aquifers oxygen consumption can be compensated by do replenishment from the atmosphere by groundwater recharge oxygen is more rapidly consumed if the groundwater table is near the surface due to the degradation of soil dissolved organic carbon if the groundwater table is far from the surface do is gradually consumed along the direction of flow malard and hervant 1999 it is assumed that do levels near industrial facilities agricultural areas and urban areas are lower than in natural regions due to pollution and anthropogenic effects which enhance chemical and biological oxygen consumption griebler et al 2014 kunkel et al 2004 in the city of karlsruhe germany for example high average do levels of 7 96 2 95 mg l 1 were measured in groundwater below forest areas n 8 and significant lower levels of 4 47 2 31 mg l 1 in wells in the city centre n 31 koch et al 2021 3 5 2 reaction of groundwater fauna low do concentrations and oxidative stress are habitual to groundwater organisms malard and hervant 1999 under anaerobiosis the production of reactive oxygen species ros is enhanced and results in cell damage lawniczak et al 2013 to prevent damage organisms have developed non enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant mechanisms simčič and sket 2021 low metabolic rates of subterranean organisms may be favourable in such oxygen limited systems stygobiont species show high survival rates under low do levels 0 01 0 5 mg l 1 danielopol 1989 malard and hervant 1999 notenboom et al 1992 and are able to cope with hypoxic to normoxic conditions mösslacher 2000 for example the copepod acanthocyclops n sp sampled from a hypoxic habitat had only small metabolic differences compared to the copepod diacyclops bicuspidatus from a normoxic condition habitat the stygobiont niphargus stygius had a lower oxygen consumption in recovery after anoxia than the stygophile niphargus zagrebensis also oxygen consumption after hypoxia at 20 c was greater in the stygobiont species than at 10 c simčič and sket 2021 hypogean species tend to be less sensitive to hypoxic conditions and show lower metabolic rates than closely related surface organisms this was shown for example for the hypogean species niphargus n sp compared to the epigean species gammarus n sp danielopol 1989 or the hypogean copepod d belgicus compared to the epigean eucyclops serrulatus inhabiting the same aquifer di lorenzo et al 2015c these results are in agreement with the findings of wilhelm et al 2006 who detected 2 4 5 times lower oxygen consumption rates in the stygobite gammarus acherondytes than in the stygophile species gammarus troglophilus hypogean and epigean populations of gammarus minus on the other hand showed similar survival times and metabolic responses under hypoxic conditions hervant et al 1999 both not being very tolerant to do depletion the assumption may be that hypogean species are able to regulate their respiration which is highly efficient in environments with fluctuating oxygen levels lawniczak et al 2013 perceived a very fast and effective system to cope with anoxic conditions in n rhenorhodanensis the animals were able to restore their cells oxidative balance very quickly after hypoxia and therefore avoid oxidative cell damage due to free radicals however studies indicated that this is not universally the case for subterranean organisms and also demonstrated that metabolic rates are related to oxygen availability and or the energetic state of the ecosystem malard and hervant 1999 mösslacher and creuzé des châtelliers 1996 4 synopsis urban aquifers are huge complex and mostly unexplored ecosystems harbouring a vast biodiversity of microorganisms and invertebrates these organisms are responsible for providing a diverse collection of essential ecosystem services and may be endangered by the various stressors associated with the concentrated human activity in urban areas here not only single pollutants pose a risk to the groundwater organisms but multiple stressors and contaminant mixtures can cause dramatic changes in groundwater quality and environmental conditions turning the habitat hostile to groundwater communities especially metals a range of organic chemicals and elevated temperatures are stressors present in every city s subsurface and therefore impose a serious risk to the vulnerable groundwater ecosystems due to their persistence organic chemicals introduced to groundwater may remain for decades and are toxic to non targeted organisms even at low concentrations li et al 2021 some organic chemical e g btex show a high mobility with groundwater bulatović et al 2021 and an increase in temperature will further accelerate the solubility and mobility of many organics niculae et al 2018 as a consequence of increased temperatures and organic pollution low levels of dissolved oxygen are very common to occur in urban groundwater with conditions frequently switching from oxic to hypoxic and anoxic brielmann et al 2011 this is resulting in a highly stressful environment for groundwater invertebrates in urban areas point source pollution such as sewage leakage may play an important role at a very local scale with altered faunal communities notenboom et al 1995 scarsbrook and fenwick 2003 tione et al 2016 for example higher numbers of oligochaeta as well as microturbellaria and nematoda which are known to cope with less favourable conditions low do contents and higher temperatures hahn et al 2013 were spotted in urban wells compared to wells in forest areas in the city of karlsruhe germany koch et al 2021 stygobionts have shown to react sensitively to some of these stressors with increased mortality and changes in community diversity yet the few data available are often inconclusive and especially testing of chemical mixtures or long term chronic tests are missing by this the conclusions that can be drawn so far are affected by a high uncertainty in field and laboratory studies stygobiontic invertebrates showed high sensitivity to ammonium and organic contaminants including a wide range of pesticides due to accumulation of these pollutants in groundwater organisms invertebrates and microbes and interactions with other substances the whole ecosystem functioning may be affected for example michel et al 2021 observed an inhibition of denitrification due to esa metolachlor 10 μg l 1 and propiconazole as well as 1 2 4 triazole 2 and 10 μg l 1 which are metabolites of the pesticide s metolachlor thereby the reduction of nitrate to nitrite was affected on the protein level in microorganisms also the toxicity of several metals e g lc50 values below the who drinking water limits for cr cu and zn observed in some copepoda amphipoda and synacrida and the sensitivity to mid to long term groundwater temperature increases or repeated heat stress may be of high risk for urban stygobionts groundwater organisms with narrow tolerance breadths are likely to be at risk at increasing habitat pollution and will be replaced by competitive stronger surface relatives which may result in altered structures of trophic chains and related ecosystem processes mermillod blondin et al 2013 little is known about these complex interactions involving microorganisms and invertebrates and potentially affecting groundwater ecosystem services several studies targeting surface ecosystems demonstrated that a reduction in biodiversity has negative effects on ecosystem functions boulton et al 2008 loreau et al 2001 and same may be expected for groundwater habitats moreover in the subsurface extinction of species will not be easily reversible as groundwater ecosystems are highly fragmented harbouring extremely rare and often endemic species physiological and biogeochemical responses in organisms which are temperature dependent are also linked to increasing temperature in urban groundwater hochachka and somero 2002 increasing temperatures stimulate metabolic rates lushchak 2011 simčič and sket 2021 consequently an elevated temperature in combination with organic pollution increases the pollution uptake as observed for juveniles of e serrulatus by di lorenzo et al 2015b also juveniles seem to be more sensitive than adults this may be due to a thinner exoskeleton pollutant uptake mainly through the body surface and higher metabolic rates compared to adults elevated influx rate no or just a low risk seems to come from low oxygen levels for which stygofaunal animals were shown to be very tolerant to studies have shown that oxygen levels below 0 01 mg l 1 are lethal to stygobionts in the long run even though stygobiont species are much more tolerant to low oxygen levels than epigean species and have evolved strategies to cope effectively with hypoxic conditions nevertheless due to fast oxygen depletion occurring with high amounts of organic matter and stimulated microbial metabolisms due to higher temperatures for example anoxic zones in urban aquifers may arise with these invertebrates will be eliminated and anaerobic microbial metabolisms will prevail toxic by products e g hydrogen sulphide of such processes will additionally impair groundwater quality those zones typically occur only locally in urban aquifers but can easily spread to larger areas due to import of organic chemicals and heat fauna in groundwater is reported within a wide range of do levels several studies indicated do levels as well as land use to be drivers of faunal assemblage patterns and shifts in niche occupation dole olivier et al 2009 dumas and lescher moutoué 2001 hahn 2002 marmonier et al 2018 tione et al 2016 for example koch et al 2021 found a significant correlation between the number of taxa and the do levels in the city of karlsruhe germany for nitrate altered juvenile to adult and female to male ratios were detected indicating that long term nitrate pollution may have altered the stygofaunal assemblage as a whole and less tolerant species may have vanished over time which is also likely to occur in cities existing and developing for decades many field studies also observed the vanishing of stygobiont species in aquifers with high salinity indicating the high sensitivity of groundwater invertebrates castano sanchez et al 2020b which may also be true for long term contaminated urban aquifers 5 further perspectives and conclusions it is worth mentioning that there are no established standard methods for sampling and toxicity testing or representative groundwater test organisms as critically discussed by di lorenzo et al 2019b due to the difficulties in proper feeding and cultivation of stygobionts in the laboratory they worked out ten recommendations for toxicological testing of stygobionts including for example acclimation times of at least 48 h before testing test durations including the standard times but also exceeding 96 h no feed throughout short term testing or species identification of tested stygobionts compared to the wide range of toxicants and pollution sources in urban areas only a small number of contaminants was intensively tested until now especially the effect of microplastics on groundwater organisms is still unclear microplastics are already found widely in groundwater with amounts of 16 pieces l campos and pestana 2020 or 15 2 pieces l in karst groundwater systems panno et al 2019 despite the fact that microplastic were found in 93 of 260 drinking water sources in 11 countries marsden et al 2019 their impact on the environment and organisms is rarely discovered chia et al 2021 the destructive effect on soil organisms earthworms mites nematodes snails includes metabolism disruption increased mortality decreased growth rate or damage of gut chia et al 2021 huang et al 2021 microplastic can originate from landfills sewage sludge fertilizer covering plastic covering littering or dumping in the future more research is needed to identify sources transport pathways incorporation in organisms and adsorption of toxic substances chia et al 2021 also typical cecs in urban groundwater like a variety of drugs pesticides food additives and personal care products need more research regarding effective sampling and analysing techniques and their effects on stygofauna tang et al 2020 in particular studies observing the effects of contaminant mixtures and other superpositioning factors typical for urban subsurface are rare furthermore increasing temperatures revealed to affect the sensitivity to the possible pollutants due to observed differing bioaccumulation rates of contaminants and sensitivities as well as lower oxygen consumption rates of stygobionts canivet et al 2001 di lorenzo et al 2014 di marzio et al 2009 di marzio et al 2018 schäfers et al 2001 wilhelm et al 2006 in comparison with surface relatives but also within stygobiontic species it may be important to measure a variety of metabolic processes and by products for a better comparison and understanding of organisms sensitivities for improvement of knowledge field surveys must include the sampling of fauna routinely record of physio chemical and microbiological parameters in general the knowledge about the origin fate and distribution of urban contaminants and hydraulic properties of urban aquifers needs to be improved by constant monitoring and modelling of current and possible future conditions miller et al 2020 until now only one study has tried to acquire an absolute understanding of urban groundwater characteristics and their influence on the groundwater ecosystem by this koch et al 2021 found no significant correlations between physico chemical characteristics and biodiversity patterns of the stygofaunal community contrastingly differences in spatial distributions were supported the future goal is to increase the number of such studies to gain knowledge about the effects of urban pollution and if biological parameters are suitable for groundwater quality monitoring even in urban areas one main question is also if existing thresholds are needed to improve or if new thresholds for example for temperature pollution have to be defined for this detailed assessments and validation of existing thresholds of different contaminants based on intensive field studies and toxicity tests have to be carried out also research and management strategies need to consider the interactions between different realms and that pressures occurring in one realm can have impacts on another for example groundwater extraction or surface sealing can result in a loss or change of connectivity of water bodies and with that recharge rates groundwater quality biodiversity or biomass in groundwater ecosystems can be affected effluents from industrial facilities contaminated with different chemicals can affect physico chemical and ecological habitat loss biodiversity conditions of the aquifer furthermore such local pressures concerning groundwater bodies chemical contamination heat pollution water extraction surface sealing affecting the urban groundwater overlap with regional and global pressures like climate change or land use changes bugnot et al 2019 in conclusion tolerance breadths seem to be very species specific as well as location dependent and forms of pre adaptations to high pollution concentrations must be considered in spite of this it is unclear if these observations are just valid for the short term or will last for a longer period of time periods especially since pollution in groundwater can remain for several years and decades the water quality only recovers slowly even after elimination of the source of pollution and remediation are very expensive and often not possible prevention is the recommended strategy evanko and dzombak 1997 hashim et al 2011 hose 2005 to ensure a sustainable use of groundwater while conserving a diverse and functional ecosystem it will be important to limit metal salt and organic contamination pollution as well

1308,the diavik waste rock project dwrp project included four principal components focused on the development of techniques for assessing the environmental impacts of waste rock at mine sites these components were small volume laboratory experiments intermediate and large volume field experiments and assessment of the operational scale waste rock stockpiles which facilitated characterization of waste rock weathering at different scales the heavily instrumented large scale field experiments test piles were constructed to replicate as closely as practicable the temperature water flow and gas transport regimes of a waste rock pile that is exposed to annual freezing and thawing cycles and to facilitate characterization of the long term weathering of a low sulfide waste rock an integrated conceptual model of sulfide bearing waste rock weathering developed at the small scale was applied to assess the capacity of the conceptual model to capture the geochemical evolution of the waste rock at the large field scale test pile experiment the integrated conceptual model was implemented using reactive transport code min3p taking into account scale dependent mechanisms the test pile mineralogy was similar to the small scale laboratory experiments and included low sulfide waste rock with an s content of 0 053 wt primarily pyrrhotite the flow regime of the test pile was simulated using parameters measured as part of other dwrp investigations including temporally variable infiltration estimates that represented the measured precipitation events at the site the temporally and spatially variable temperature of the test pile was interpolated from values measured using instrumentation installed at the beginning of the experiment and was included in the simulation to refine the temperature dependence of the geochemical reactions to allow continuous multi year simulation freezing was also simulated to represent the conditions experienced at the test pile experiment normalized root mean square error analysis of the large scale field experiment simulation results indicated most parameters compare well to measured daily mass flux i e the fraction of the range of annual values encompassed in the residual was less than 0 5 for so4 fe ni si ca k mg na and ph and 1 0 or less for all parameters except cu the method of using an integrated conceptual model developed from the results of humidity cell experiments to implement a mechanistic approach for assessing the primary geochemical processes of waste rock weathering on a large scale was shown to provide reasonable results however the results are specific to the study site and the approach requires application to various sites under different geological and climatological conditions to facilitate further refinement keywords reactive transport sulfide oxidation scale up waste rock 1 introduction due to the costs involved in construction and the length of time required to produce results large scale field experiments test piles are rarely used for the purpose of mine waste rock characterization test piles have been used in research programs focused on the characterization of the geochemical and physical attributes of waste rock nichol et al 2005 andrina et al 2006 stockwell et al 2006 corazao et al 2007 smith et al 2013a plante et al 2014 blackmore et al 2014 bornhorst and logsdon 2016 more often smaller scale field experiments e g barrel experiments have been used to assess the geochemical evolution of waste rock demers et al 2013 smith et al 2013a parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 where available the results of larger and smaller scale field experiments can be used together to gain an understanding of the influence of dynamic infiltration and temperature regimes and heterogeneous particle size distribution on the geochemical evolution of waste rock the process of extrapolating the results of small scale experiments to full scale waste rock piles is commonly referred to as scale up parameters including ph particle size distribution moisture content rock water contact ratios temperature oxygen availability and mineral surface area are understood to influence effluent quality and these relationships are typically scaled using empirical factors kempton 2012 amos et al 2015 the ability of empirical scale factors to capture the geochemical evolution of waste rock in full size piles can be hampered by the heterogeneity of physical parameters e g particle size and mineral distribution and exposure of the waste rock to atmospheric conditions i e variable temperature and precipitation scale up methods reliant on empirical factors are generally incapable of providing an adequate assessment of waste rock evolution amos et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 mechanistic approaches such as reactive transport modelling provide the capacity to incorporate dynamic temperature and precipitation regimes and heterogeneity in physical parameters to address the inherent weaknesses of empirical scale up methodology reactive transport models have recently been used in studies for several sites to enhance understanding of climate influences yi et al 2021a remediation design raymond et al 2020 kalonji kabambi et al 2020 yi et al 2021b and pile construction methods raymond et al 2021 on the geochemical evolution of mine wastes reactive transport models continue to undergo development to enhance their overall capabilities for example to accommodate complex domains su et al 2020 and for the assessment of the geochemical evolution of mine wastes e g muniruzzaman et al 2020 yi et al 2021a these studies and others e g muniruzzaman et al 2021 have also highlighted the challenges associated with using reactive transport models including incorporation of spatial heterogeneity in physical and geochemical parameters temporal influences such as short term temperature fluctuations and long term shifts in climate and comparison of simulation results to measured site data this study provides a practical mechanistic approach to forecasting waste rock effluent geochemistry using reactive transport modelling based on parameters that are routinely measured while accounting for temporally dynamic temperature and infiltration and using site measured data as a comparison for simulation results reactive transport models have primarily been used in academia to date however the wide range of capabilities set forth here and in the above noted studies indicate wider adoption would provide a versatile advanced interpretation and forecasting tool to practitioners developing mine waste management strategies the experiments conducted as part of the diavik waste rock project dwrp were designed to facilitate the investigation of mechanistic approaches to scale up small scale laboratory experiments were complemented by intermediate and large scale field experiments the laboratory experiments included small scale 1 kg humidity cells the intermediate scale 9300 kg experiments consisted of 2 m diameter barrel style active zone lysimeter experiments and the large scale 8 2 107 kg experiments included densely instrumented test piles the field experiments were conducted at diavik diamond mine diavik located approximately 300 km northeast of yellowknife nt canada research on scaling laboratory experiment results has been conducted as part of the dwrp by bailey et al 2022 sinclair et al 2015 and wilson et al 2018ab bailey et al 2022 determined sulfide mineral weathering rates using effluent data from the dwrp humidity cell experiments langman et al 2014 and scaled those rates mechanistically to assess solute loading from the intermediate scale experiment bailey et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 demonstrated that assessment of mass loading from the intermediate scale experiment could be conducted reasonably well for relatively conservative solutes such as zn and cu the method was limited because geochemical processes known to be active in the systems including secondary mineral precipitation ion sorption and microbiological catalysis were not considered as part of the calculations sinclair et al 2015 developed a loading model that simulated so4 production within the core of a test pile with 0 053 wt s designated type iii see below sinclair et al 2015 suggested mechanistic approaches can be used to assess the geochemical evolution of waste rock wilson et al 2018ab developed an integrated conceptual model of geochemical evolution for the humidity cell experiments and used the reactive transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 to simulate the effluent concentrations and mass loading from the intermediate scale experiment this mechanistic approach provided a reasonable assessment of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock while considering secondary mineral precipitation and dissolution sorption and dynamic temperature and infiltration regimes the work of bailey et al 2022 and wilson et al 2018b showed mechanistic approaches can facilitate an effluent quality forecasting method that captures the complex processes involved with waste rock weathering providing realistic assessments of effluent concentrations and mass loading the work documented here consists of implementing the integrated conceptual model developed by wilson et al 2018a using min3p to simulate one dimensional 1 d flow and geochemical evolution through the core of one of the large scale field experiments min3p is a multi component reactive transport code that can be used to simulate water flow through the unsaturated zone and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions a geochemical framework can be developed using the code that includes mineral dissolution and precipitation sorption complexation and oxidation reduction reactions using project specific reaction stoichiometry and kinetics the objective of the simulations was to investigate the capability of the integrated conceptual model developed from the small laboratory experiments to forecast the effluent geochemistry from the larger field experiment considering dynamic temperature and flow regimes this investigation is the third in a series of studies and builds on the previous numerical simulation work the first study involved implementation of an integrated conceptual model for laboratory scale experiments i e humidity cells within a reactive transport model wilson et al 2018a the second study involved applying the calibrated model from the first study to the intermediate scale field experiments including the larger domain size measured s and c content and the temporally dynamic temperature of the field experiment wilson et al 2018b the simulation in this study makes use of the same reactive transport model used in the intermediate scale study but at a larger scale which inherently incorporates complexities in the physical system particularly thermal and freeze thaw dynamics that impact geochemical reaction rates and water flow that cannot be explored at smaller scales 2 test pile methodology the focus of this study is one of three test pile experiments conducted at diavik over a period of more than 10 years starting in 2006 specifically the geochemical evolution of waste rock was investigated at a large scale test pile 50 m 60 m 15 m high with a thermal regime controlled by the arctic climate in a continuous permafrost region the annual temperature at diavik ranges from an average summer high of 18 c to an average winter low of 31 c with an annual mean 1998 2007 of 9 c smith et al 2013a precipitation occurs as approximately 40 rain and 60 snow smith et al 2013a the mineralogy of the waste rock used to build the test pile experiments was similar to that of the dwrp humidity cells langman et al 2014 wilson et al 2018a and included approximately 75 granite primarily quartz k feldspar and albite 14 pegmatitic granite primarily quartz k feldspar and albite 10 biotite schist primarily albite quartz and biotite and 1 diabase primarily plagioclase blowes and logsdon 1998 langman et al 2014 the metal sulfide minerals were primarily contained in the biotite schist langman et al 2014 the mean sulfide content of the biotite schist was 0 24 wt s langman et al 2014 pyrrhotite fe 1 x s was the dominant metal sulfide mineral in the waste material in which minor substitution of ni and co for fe occurred in the following approximate ratio fe0 852ni0 004co0 001s jambor 1997 metal sulfide minerals chalcopyrite cufes2 sphalerite zns and pentlandite fe ni 9s8 were found to be present in small quantities langman et al 2014 mineralogical characterization conducted by jambor 1997 did not indicate the presence of partially or fully oxidized s bearing minerals suggesting the waste rock s content was dominated by sulfide s the mineralogical analyses conducted by jambor 1997 indicated c was present only as carbonate waste rock at diavik is segregated according to s content where type i 0 04 wt s 0 04 wt type ii 0 08 wt and type iii 0 08 wt s the focus of this study was the type iii test pile experiment samples collected from waste rock used to construct the type iii test pile have mean s and c contents of 0 053 wt and 0 027 wt respectively smith et al 2013c the test pile experiments were constructed with freshly blasted rock the total s and c contents measured as part of the construction of the test pile experiment were assumed to consist entirely of sulfide and carbonate respectively for the reactive transport simulations the type iii test pile was constructed of approximately 8 2 107 kg of waste rock exposed to atmospheric temperature and precipitation conditions for the duration the experiment water flow from the type iii experiment was measured from both a basal drain system that collected water exiting the entire pile and a series of basal collection lysimeters constructed near the base of the test pile see sinclair et al 2015 for further details that collected water from the core of the pile only i e excluded preferential flow from the sides of the pile fig 1 rain was measured at the dwrp research station using tipping bucket rain gauges fig 2 snow depth was only measured at discrete intervals and is not shown as a result of wind scouring snow did not typically accumulate on the crest of the pile to a significant depth the basal collection lysimeters were installed to facilitate measurement of the flow volume and collection of samples for geochemical analysis of water that infiltrated from the crest through the core of the test pile smith et al 2013a flow volume from the core of the test pile was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges installed at each basal collection lysimeter drain outlet smith et al 2013a effluent samples were collected regularly every 3 5 days from the basal collection lysimeter drains during the flow seasons of 2008 when flow at the drains started to 2012 the samples were analyzed for a suite of 42 inorganic and general parameters which included parameters indicative of diavik waste rock weathering fe ni co cu zn al si ca mg k na and so4 ph and alkalinity smith et al 2013b thorough descriptions of the test pile and drain system construction and sampling procedures are provided by smith et al 2013a and sinclair et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 supplemented their characterization of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock with analysis of pore water samples collected from soil water solution samplers installed in the core of the type iii test pile the soil water solution samplers were installed at depths of approximately 2 3 5 7 and 9 m from the crest of the pile and samples were collected regularly approximately bi weekly during periods when the test pile was not frozen more details about the installation of the soil water solution samplers and sampling protocol can be found in smith et al 2013a and sinclair et al 2015 3 conceptual model the integrated conceptual model for sulfidic mine waste rock weathering developed by wilson et al 2018a was implemented to simulate the geochemical evolution of the type iii test pile experiment the integrated conceptual model was developed from site specific data informed by the results of previous studies conducted through the dwrp amos et al 2009 bailey et al 2013 2015 2016 bailey et al 2022 chi et al 2013 neuner et al 2013 pham et al 2013 smith et al 2013a 2013b 2013c langman et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2017 matthies et al 2014 sinclair et al 2015 and designed to be scaled and coupled with site specific flow and temperature regimes to provide a realistic assessment of the geochemical evolution of waste rock at diavik the integrated conceptual model implemented here contains the same mineralogy used by wilson et al 2018b for simulation of the geochemical evolution at the intermediate dwrp scale this mineralogy is specific to the dwrp due to the larger size of the test pile experiment the flow and temperature regimes of the experiment were anticipated to be more complex when compared to the intermediate scale simulation described by wilson et al 2018b and this increased complexity would likely be reflected in the geochemical system the simulated flow regime was based on the dwrp test pile experiments described by smith et al 2013a and neuner et al 2013 measured precipitation fig 2 at diavik was used to estimate infiltration to the test pile through application of the fao penman monteith fao p m method described by neuner et al 2013 tracer tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 supplied additional water to the flow system approximately 34 7 m3 in 2006 and 36 2 m3 in 2007 and were included in the infiltration volume used in the simulations tracer water was obtained from lac de gras analysis of samples of the lake water indicated solute concentrations of most parameters at least an order of magnitude below test pile effluent concentrations and circumneutral ph wilson et al 2018b neuner et al 2013 indicated water flow through the system was dominated by matrix flow with the matrix material particle diameters 5 mm making up approximately 20 of the total material in the type iii test pile the dominance of matrix flow in the system suggests use of the richards equation is appropriate for the simulation of water flow through the test pile and indicates that the matrix material mineralogy will control water geochemistry through the core of the test pile water flow through the unsaturated test pile was therefore simulated as intermittent events that coincided with the calculated infiltration events under the assumption of a single porosity domain i e flow is conceptualized to occur only through the matrix material preferential flow is not included and is considered to be a minor component of overall flow in the waste rock piles at diavik due in part to the arid climate the large size of the test pile experiment and its exposure to atmospheric temperature necessitated incorporation of a temperature regime within the pile that was spatially and temporally variable temperature was measured during the experiment with a series of instrument strings with thermistors spaced at regular approximately 0 5 m intervals within the core of the test pile additional thermistors were installed in boreholes beneath the test pile prior to construction automated monitoring of the thermistor network provided temperature measurements approximately every 6 h from the crest of the pile to approximately 11 m depth combined with deeper measurements from approximately 14 to 16 m below the crest of pile although the thermistors installed inside the pile could not be re calibrated post installation thermistors near the pile surface showed similar temperatures and temperature patterns to locally measured ambient air temperatures pham et al 2013 smith et al 2013a and pham et al 2013 provide further details on the construction and operation of the thermal data collection system sinclair et al 2015 described a conceptual model of freezing and thawing within the test pile based on the measured temperatures sinclair et al 2015 showed the test pile was fully frozen each year from december to may and fully thawed from august to october with transitional periods in june july and november the june july transitional period was characterized by relatively uniform warming front migration from top and sides to bottom the november transitional period was characterized by cooling front migration from top and sides to bottom and additional slight cooling front migration up from the bottom of the pile resulting in an inner core of thawed waste rock surrounded by frozen material the proposed conceptual model of freezing and thawing suggested a regime of spatially and temporally variable temperature would be required to accurately assess the geochemical evolution of the waste rock at the test pile scale a one dimensional temperature field based on the measured data and varied on a daily basis was generated to represent the complex temperature regime within the test pile the integrated conceptual model of sulfidic mineral weathering presented by wilson et al 2018ab is briefly summarized here oxidants o2 aq and fe3 are recognized as dominant drivers of sulfide mineral oxidation nordstrom and southam 1997 blowes et al 2003 the following reaction stoichiometry for diavik specific pyrrhotite was used to describe the overall reactions after nicholson and scharer 1998 janzen et al 2000 belzile et al 2004 1 fe 0

ni 9s8 by o2 aq table 1 three parallel reactions were used to represent the role of fe3 in sulfide mineral weathering the three reactions follow the reaction mechanism described by schippers and sand 1999 in which the intermediary s species is represented by elemental s s0 elemental s was selected as a proxy for intermediary s species because its presence was noted by langman et al 2015a in samples of weathered dwrp pyrrhotite and the inclusion of s0 in both the polysulfide and thiosulfate pathways of s oxidation described by schippers and sand 1999 more information regarding the selection of s0 as a proxy for the intermediary s species is provided by wilson et al 2018a the reaction stoichiometry shown in eqs 2 and 3 after nicholson and scharer 1998 represents the introduction

s 0 1 5 o 2 aq h 2 o s o 4 2 2 h the oxidation of fe2 eq 4 was included as an important component of the conceptual model in part because of its role in supplying fe3 in this instance the reaction was represented as kinetically controlled singer and stumm 1970 schippers and sand 1999 rohwerder et al 2003 4 fe 2 0 25 o 2 aq h fe 3 0 5 h 2 o eqs 5 and 6 describe rate expressions used to represent the shrinking core model levenspiel 1972 wunderly et al 1996 mayer et al 2002 for oxidation of each of the sulfide minerals by o2 aq and fe3 the example rate expressions were used to represent the oxidation of diavik fe 1 x s by o2 aq and fe3 respectively after mayer et al 2002 5 r po ox 10 3 s fe 0 852 ni 0 004 co 0 001 s r p r p r r r r d o 2 aq o 2 aq 1 9285 6 r po ox 10 3 s fe 0 852 ni 0

and 2 respectively reaction stoichiometry and rate expressions represented irreversible surface weathering in all cases except for calcite and dolomite for which representative reactions were reversible secondary minerals included in the simulations were also based on site specific mineralogy and included minerals considered likely to be present based on the results of a saturation index analysis of effluent geochemistry or reasonably likely to be present because of their association with the geochemical weathering of sulfidic waste rock the secondary minerals considered in the simulation included fe iii oxy hydroxide fe oh 3 jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 gypsum caso4 2h2o siderite feco3 gibbsite al oh 3 and amorphous silica sio2 all secondary minerals precipitated or dissolved in accordance with the reaction stoichiometry and equilibrium controlled expressions shown in tables 1 and 2 the set of secondary minerals included in the test pile simulation was the same as described by wilson et al 2018ab no calibration was conducted as part of this simulation with respect to secondary minerals wilson et al 2018a provide further detail on the selected set of included secondary minerals the interpolated temperatures within the test pile were used in conjunction with the results of the calibration conducted by wilson et al 2018a and the arrhenius expression to capture the temperature dependence of waste rock weathering in the test pile experiment the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient used in calculation of sulfide mineral weathering rates was adjusted with respect to the spatial and temporal temperature variation using the activation enthalpy calculated by wilson et al 2018a 9 h r t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 ln d 1 eff d 2 eff the temperature dependence of host mineral weathering rates was simulated according to their respective activation energies as previously calibrated as part of the development of the integrated conceptual model wilson et al 2018a no additional calibration for temperature was conducted as part of the test pile experiment simulations 4 model parameters the type iii test pile domain was constructed as a 1 d column with a depth of 12 5 m corresponding to the approximate depth from the test pile crest to the midpoint of the basal collection lysimeters located at the base of the pile the simulation domain was discretized in the z direction as 125 10 cm control volumes the simulation was run for 2555 days to correspond with the years 2006 2012 construction of the type iii test pile was completed in 2006 precipitation measured at the test pile research area was used to estimate the infiltration with the fao p m method described by neuner et al 2013 infiltration resulting from snowmelt was insignificant because most snowfall at the top of the test pile experiment was scoured from the crest by wind before the onset of the melting season neuner et al 2013 and therefore was not considered the partial pressure of o2 g was set at atmospheric 0 21 atm as a boundary condition at the top of the simulation domain and infiltrating water was assumed to be at equilibrium with atmospheric o2 g gas measurements conducted at the test pile experiment indicated the partial pressure of o2 within the pile was at atmospheric concentration suggesting o2 ingress was not a limiting factor in the oxidation of sulfide minerals amos et al 2009 chi et al 2013 the temperature at each control volume in the simulation was calculated by linear interpolation within the min3p code from an input file of measured temperatures at 2 0 m intervals temperature data were collected throughout the test pile from late 2006 to 2012 and the temperature of the simulations accurately represented the measured temperature at that time in the test pile e g the interpolated temperature at 5 m depth on december 31 2007 was approximately the same as measured in the type iii test pile for that date and depth simulation temperature changed daily and was the average of four values measured at a given location on a given day porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil hydraulic function parameters table 3 were based on the work of neuner et al 2013 and not adjusted to calibrate the flow solution the porosity value was the portion of the bulk porosity represented by the matrix material i e 20 of the matrix material porosity measured by neuner et al 2013 the matrix material porosity was conceptualized in this manner to facilitate a representative simulation of flow only through a matrix material that makes up approximately 20 of the rock in the test pile experiment the soil hydraulic function parameters were not adjusted to account for freezing conditions a tracer simulation was conducted to assess the physical flow parameters used for the reactive transport simulations during construction of the type iii test pile smith et al 2013a collected samples for s and c analyses that provide the mineral volume fractions ϕi tables 4 and 5 for sulfide and carbonate minerals mineral volume fractions for less abundant sulfide minerals i e cufes2 and zns were estimated by wilson et al 2018a from bulk metal analysis conducted on humidity cell samples fe4 5ni3 6co0 9s8 ϕi was calibrated as part of the humidity cell simulations wilson et al 2018a the initial radius for sulfide minerals was established as part of the laboratory experiment simulations documented by wilson et al 2018a mineral volume fractions for host minerals were the same as those used by wilson et al 2018ab table 5 simulation ϕi values were adjusted to represent the portion of minerals in the matrix material and available to geochemical processes this is equivalent to 20 of their measured values because the matrix makes up approximately 20 of the bulk rock based on surface area to volume ratios it was assumed that minerals contained within larger material fractions would not be exposed to o2 and moisture and therefore would not significantly influence the waste rock geochemistry for multi year simulations the min3p code was modified to consider periods during the experiment when part or all of the test pile was frozen during periods of freezing conditions hydraulic conductivity was reduced to 1 10 7 m s 1 two orders of magnitude lower than the measured hydraulic conductivity effectively stopping water flow within the frozen portion of the pile elberling 2005 measured o2 depletion associated with frozen pyritic mine waste and concluded that oxidation reactions can proceed at temperatures below freezing using the oxygen depletion measurements elberling found the q10 temperature coefficient rate of change of chemical or biological process due to a 10 c increase in temperature of the oxidation reaction rate decreased significantly i e the reaction rate slowed significantly at temperatures 2 c due to limited availability of aqueous and gaseous o2 geochemical reactions within the domain were effectively stopped under freezing conditions i e when temperature within a control volume was below 0 c by reducing reaction rates to zero to assess the influence of freezing conditions on the geochemical evolution of the waste rock in the test pile experiment previous dwrp studies including the deconstruction and detailed sampling of the type i test pile which was constructed using the same techniques as the type iii test pile indicates that i the matrix material is well mixed in the core of the experimental piles i e the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix material is relatively uniform throughout the piles wilson 2018 and ii the s and c distribution within the matrix material is relatively uniform throughout the piles smith et al 2013c atherton 2017 a 1 d domain and homogeneous parameters were selected for this work to determine if a simplified representation of the waste rock experiment would provide a reasonable forecast of effluent quality supplemental simulations were conducted to assess i the influence of temperature on effluent flow and geochemistry from the test pile and ii the influence of calibration of the large scale simulation the influence of temperature was assessed using a homogeneous temperature distribution that included a constant temperature for the portion of the year when water flow was active 4 4 c and a constant temperature for the frozen portion of the year 0 c the active water flow season temperature was the average test pile temperature under thawed conditions over the 6 year simulation period in addition limited calibration was conducted on the forecast simulation to improve the results specifically ph and concentrations of cu the calibration involved removal of cu sorption inclusion of covellite cus as a secondary sink for cu reduction of the effective diffusion coefficient for chalcopyrite oxidation by o2 aq an increase of the rate constant for fe2 oxidation and reduction of the calcite mineral content 5 results 5 1 temperature one of the refinements of the test pile simulation relative to the previous dwrp reactive transport simulations wilson et al 2018a b was the introduction of a spatially dynamic temperature regime the measured temperature data were compiled according to depth within the test pile and provided as input to the simulations using a temperature field temperature data were available at approximately 0 5 m intervals throughout the depth of the test pile except for the region between approximately 11 5 m depth and the base of the test pile approximately 14 0 m the simulation temperature compares well with the measured temperature variation at and between temperature input nodes fig 3 the simulations started on january 1 2006 however temperature data from the test pile were not available until august 2006 temperature data from 2007 were substituted for the missing 2006 temperature data other than averaging up to four measurements per day to provide a daily average temperature for a given point the input temperature data were not modified or smoothed in any way additional processing of the temperature data did not improve the fit of the simulated outflow to the observed outflow 5 2 water flow flow simulations were conducted in conjunction with the temperature regime interpolations for comparison to the simulated outflow the total daily measured outflow volume was divided by the total basal collection lysimeter area contributing to that outflow to calculate the daily volume of outflow from the type iii core per square meter all flow to the basal collection lysimeters was assumed to be due to infiltration from the top of the test pile comparison of the measured outflow volume and the simulated outflow through the core of the type iii test pile indicates good agreement over the six year simulation period fig 4 a tracer test was simulated for the test pile domain to estimate water velocity through the test pile and residence time the simulated water velocity of 0 01 m d 1 averaged over the year compares well with the velocity of 0 006 m d 1 calculated from the results of the 2007 tracer test conducted at the type iii test pile experiment krentz 2014 the simulated residence time of approximately 5 3 years is consistent with the measured peak tracer arrival representing flow through the core of the test pile of approximately 5 years krentz 2014 zak 2017 the normalized root mean square error nrmse was calculated to analyze the error in the simulation of flow through the test pile normalization was conducted using the range of measured daily flow values the nrmse is 0 08 when all days of the simulation are included in the calculation and 0 19 when only days where flow was measured at the experiment drains are included the simulation underpredicts or overpredicts the total flow in some years however the overall flow throughout the simulation period is consistent with the measured outflow fig 4b 5 3 uncalibrated simulation water chemistry the simulated effluent geochemistry was compared to effluent geochemistry measured from samples collected at the basal collection lysimeter drains at the base of the type iii test pile the measured effluent geochemistry was an average of all basal collection lysimeter samples collected during a given sampling event compared parameters included concentrations mg l 1 of so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k and na ph su alkalinity as mg l 1 caco3 fig 5 and daily mass loading mg m 2 d 1 of so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k and na fig 6 sinclair et al 2015 analyzed effluent concentrations from the core of the type iii test pile and noted an early season flush of higher solute concentration was followed by a relatively steady decline in solute concentration for the duration of the flow season sporadic flow often occurred from the core of the test pile prior to the onset of the regular flow season however this early season flow was likely water frozen in the drain system during the previous year and not representative of the geochemical conditions in the core of the test pile sinclair et al 2015 high solute loads observed at the start of each flow season have been hypothesized to result from two related factors i water residence time and ii extended sulfide oxidation occurring during periods of little or no flow near pile freeze up sinclair et al 2015 briefly summarizing general trends the average annual concentrations of solutes that are indicators of sulfide weathering including so4 ni co cu and zn increase from 2008 to 2012 average annual concentrations of solutes indicating host rock weathering including ca k mg na al and si remain relatively stable or increase slightly throughout the 2008 to 2012 period measured ph from the core of the type iii test pile declines slightly with average annual values of 4 7 in 2008 and 4 3 in 2012 note average ph values were calculated by converting to h averaging then converting back to ph over the same period average annual alkalinity declines from approximately 9 to 2 mg l 1 as caco3 sinclair et al 2015 the uncalibrated simulation captures the 2008 2012 general concentration trend and some annual variation well for most parameters e g so4 ni co zn al si ca k and alkalinity fig 5 the largest differences between measured and simulated solute concentrations are observed for fe cu and ph the concentrations of fe are apparently underestimated in most years of the simulation 2008 to 2011 and well represented in the last year of the simulation 2012 the underestimation may be a result of fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation occurring at early simulation times but not to the same extent within the experiment speciation calculations conducted using test pile effluent geochemistry indicate the experiment effluent was undersaturated with respect to fe iii oxy hydroxide represented as fe oh 3 for a portion of 2008 the first year that effluent reported to the drains the simulation results indicate fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation occurred during all years of the simulation 2006 2012 suggesting a discrepancy in fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation rates between the simulation and experiment may have resulted in underestimation of the fe concentrations this difference in fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation rates may be influenced by simulation ph which is somewhat overestimated at times in the simulation and the simulated rate of fe2 oxidation the measured fe concentrations reach a maximum of 6 mg l 1 the discrepancy between the simulated and measured maximum concentrations of 1 5 mg l 1 and 6 mg l 1 is not significant in terms of environmental impact these estimates will result in appropriate guidance for waste rock management strategies the largest discrepancy between measured and simulated values is observed for cu the simulation results indicate maximum estimated cu concentrations of 39 mg l 1 vs maximum measured concentrations of 13 mg l 1 this discrepancy may be due to specification of an inappropriate constraint on cu concentrations the simulations are based on the assumption that cu adsorption to fe iii oxy hydroxides constrains the maximum cu concentrations the elevated concentrations of simulated cu suggest variation in the sorption parameters from the smaller scale experiments humidity cells and active zone lysimeters to the large scale field experiment or the presence of a secondary phase not considered in the simulations e g covellite the comparison of the measured and simulated cu concentrations suggests the dominant mechanism of cu attenuation may be dependent on the scale of the observations and would not be apparent in the small scale experiments that formed the basis for the conceptual model the simulated ph and alkalinity generally overpredict measured values intra annual concentration variations are partially captured by the simulations discrepancies in intra annual variation between the measured and simulated values are likely because the simplified implementation of freeze thaw dynamics did not fully represent the freeze thaw conceptual model proposed by sinclair et al 2015 the implementation was not intended as a robust representation of freeze thaw cycling the simulation results show improved agreement relative to the dwrp intermediate scale simulation results which did not consider freeze thaw cycling wilson et al 2018b this observation suggests the freeze thaw cycling implemented at the large scale simulation better represents the geochemical evolution of the field experiments additionally the timing of and total daily mass flux from the experiment are well captured for most parameters e g so4 ni co zn si al ca and k fig 6 the apparent early time underestimation of fe concentrations is reflected in daily mass flux however the mean simulated daily mass flux for fe is 0 48 mg m 2 d 1 consistent with the mean measured daily mass flux observed 0 41 throughout the 5 year experiment as stated previously the discrepancy in fe daily mass flux may be the result of a differences between simulated and experimental fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation and or rates of fe2 oxidation the simulation overestimates the daily mass load of cu possibly due to the specification of an inappropriate concentration control processes similar results are indicated in the cumulative mass loads with reasonable fits for most parameters e g so4 ni co si al ca and k fig 11 slight overestimation of fe and zn approximately 2 and significant overestimation of cu approximately 4 and significant underestimation of mg and na approximately 7 a review of the simulation results indicates most parameters except cu follow the measured vertical spatial trends figs 7 and 8 the simulated ph generally overestimates measured ph within the experiment and variations in ph versus depth present in the measured profiles are not always reflected in the simulation results the simulated alkalinity profiles follow a similar progression to the measured alkalinity profile except in early years where the simulated alkalinity is higher than measured the al concentration is generally overestimated deeper in the pile in the early year profiles likely caused by differences in the temperature dependence of al bearing minerals vs the secondary al mineral included in the simulation fe concentrations are somewhat underestimated throughout the 2007 and 2008 profiles suggesting early simulation fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation may have overly influenced fe concentrations in the simulated test pile outflow simulated profiles of so4 ni and zn generally show good agreement with the measured concentration profiles for most years although the range of concentrations in the profiles is representative of the field measurements some detailed variations in concentrations are not captured the concentration of cu is consistently overestimated suggesting the sorption process specified as a limitation on dissolved cu concentrations may be inappropriate the results of the constant temperature simulation indicate so4 ni co cu zn al mg and na concentrations are higher compared to results from the temporally and spatially dynamic temperature simulation resulting in poorer agreement between field measurements and the simulation results for all assessed parameters with the exception of mg and na minimal differences are noted for fe si ca ph and alkalinity although the intra annual variation for fe is present for the dynamic temperature simulation simulated k concentrations are generally lower in the constant temperature simulation resulting in a poorer fit to the measured data in addition the timing and volume of flow from the simulated constant temperature system is not consistent with the measured flow these observations confirm the requirement to incorporate temperature variation in multi year simulations where freezing is present 5 4 uncalibrated forecast model performance assessment to assess the performance of the large scale model the simulation results were compared to the entire set of measured effluent and internal pile i e soil water solution sampler geochemistry data figs 5 8 the measured data were only used for performance assessment and not to calibrate the model annual mean measured daily mass flux was compared to the simulation results for selected parameters so4 fe ni cu zn mg m 2 d 1 and ph su fig 9 the results of the mean flux comparison indicate the mean annual simulated daily mass flux is within one standard deviation of the measured mean for so4 fe ni cu and zn for most years of the simulation larger discrepancies include underestimation of daily mass flux for so4 in 2011 and overestimation of fe cu and zn in 2012 the mean and standard deviation for these selected parameters are consistent with the indications of the concentration fig 5 and daily mass flux fig 6 comparisons the mean and standard deviation comparison indicates the concentration and daily mass flux of fe is captured somewhat more precisely than shown in figs 5 and 6 although the simulation did not capture the higher concentrations of fe in the earlier years of the experiment the statistical evaluation suggests the simulation captures a larger portion of the measured values and provides an adequate representation of the fe migrating from the test pile the nrmse was calculated to analyze the performance of the simulation with respect to geochemical parameters so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k na mg m 2 d 1 and ph su the nrmse was calculated on an annual basis and normalized using the range of measured daily mass flux values annual basis for each parameter the nrmse table 6 represents the fraction of the range of annual values for a given parameter that is encompassed in the residual although the nrmse can vary significantly from year to year the results obtained represent reasonable values for most parameters including so4 fe ni co zn al si ca k and ph larger nrmse values for cu are consistent with the observation that this parameter is not as well represented by the simulation 5 5 forecast model calibration to further assess the forecast simulation a calibration was conducted to provide a better fit to the measured test pile basal collection lysimeter effluent concentration data presented in fig 5 the target parameters of the calibration were fe cu and ph due to underestimated and overestimated concentrations fe and cu compared to measured and the general overestimation of ph the indicated fit fig 10 was obtained by increasing the rate of fe2 oxidation less than one order of magnitude inclusion of covellite as a potential secondary sink for cu covellite did not precipitate removing cu sorption reduction of the effective diffusion coefficient for chalcopyrite oxidation by o2 aq one order of magnitude and reduction of calcite content to 20 of uncalibrated content the reduction of calcite content resulted in a simulated ph consistent with measured ph and calcite content was exhausted from the simulated domain in a time period consistent with previous research at diavik fig 12 discussion acid neutralization sinclair et al 2015 similar to the concentration results the cumulative mass loads generated with the calibrated simulation indicate improved fits consistent with measured cumulative mass loads for most metals e g fe co cu and zn fig 11 6 discussion the integrated conceptual model implemented for the dwrp test pile experiment was developed using widely applicable mechanisms e g shrinking core model sorption model such that when coupled with routinely measured site specific physical parameters e g mineral surface area mineral volume fraction hydraulic conductivity temperature and infiltration can be used to simulate the geochemical evolution of waste rock under a variety of conditions the integrated conceptual model implemented for the dwrp experiments makes use of site specific mineralogy and physical parameters that will not necessarily be applicable to other sites the simulations conducted for the test pile experiment were intended to test the previously developed integrated conceptual model under complex conditions more closely replicating full size waste rock piles and highlighting discrepancies that may occur when scaling a mechanistic method of geochemical simulation the integrated conceptual model implemented using parameters consistent with the small scale simulations captured the effluent concentrations of most parameters quite well over the course of the simulation to quantify the goodness of fit of the simulations the simulated concentrations were compared to the distribution of measured concentrations this analysis indicated mean concentrations of most parameters ca co fe si mg na ni so4 ph and alkalinity averaged over the simulation period were within two standard deviations of the measured mean concentrations averaged over the same period mean concentrations of al k and zn were within three standard deviations of the measured mean but the mean concentrations of simulated cu were outside this range daily mass flux was also captured well for most parameters to quantify the goodness of fit with regards to measured daily mass flux the mean simulated daily mass flux was compared to the distribution about the mean of the measured values this analysis indicated the mean simulated daily mass flux was within two standard deviations of the measured mean daily mass flux for al ca co fe si k mg na ni so4 and zn cu was outside three standard deviations analysis of blasting residuals bailey et al 2013 indicated the first flush of matrix water through the test pile experiment occurred in 2008 and 2009 the analysis of the simulated to measured daily mass flux was repeated using only the years 2010 2012 because an initial experiment flush period was not considered in the simulation the results of the supplemental statistical analysis indicated the mean simulated daily mass flux was within two standard deviations of the measured mean daily mass flux for all parameters except cu excluding the years 2008 and 2009 from the analysis of simulated to measured concentrations did not improve the statistical analysis results the goodness of fit analysis in conjunction with the nrmse analysis suggests the mechanistic approach inherent to the simulations provides a suitable strategy for estimating effluent solute concentrations from waste rock piles furthermore the comparison between measured and simulated concentrations indicates implementation of a well constrained integrated conceptual model within a reactive solute transport framework provides reasonable estimates of solute concentrations and where inaccurate tends to be conservative and therefore appropriate for anticipating potential environmental impacts one of the core outcomes of this investigation into mechanistic methods for scale up was the development of an integrated conceptual model capable of being implemented to simulate the geochemical evolution of waste rock exposed to atmospheric conditions as a result two significant additions to the integrated conceptual model not considered for the intermediate scale simulations wilson et al 2018b were i spatially dynamic temperature and ii intermittent water flow and geochemical reaction progress due to the development of freezing conditions 6 1 temperature the interpolated temperature regime captured the measured temperature of the core of the test pile however the presence of heat trace within the test pile and the associated influence on temperature were not considered as part of the simulations heat trace cables within the pile are primarily located around drains and lysimeter installations but the influence of their temperature signal on the geochemical evolution of the waste rock was expected to be minimal additionally temperature data were only available to a depth of approximately 11 5 m measured from the test pile crest the temperature at depth 12 5 m bottom of simulation was linearly interpolated between deepest pile measurements and measurements from below the test pile at approximately 14 m depth the interpolated temperature value likely underestimated the actual temperature due to the presence of heat trace at drains and lysimeters and may account for a portion of the difference in timing of measured outflow versus simulated outflow e g measured outflow occurs in 2009 2010 and 2012 prior to simulated outflow supplemental simulations using constant temperatures one for the frozen season and one for the flow season indicated a constant temperature regime was not sufficient to satisfactorily replicate the flow and geochemistry from the core of the test pile 6 2 infiltration and flow the temporally dynamic infiltration regime along with a temporally and spatially dynamic temperature regime included in the simulation captured the general outflow from the core of the test pile the infiltration regime was based on the estimates of infiltration calculated using the same fao pm method used for the intermediate scale simulations neuner et al 2013 infiltration events initiated water flow through the test pile core by pressure wave propagation and displacement of resident pore water neuner et al 2013 the simulation of water flow from the core of the test pile agreed well with the timing of flow measured in each of the five flow seasons 2008 2012 no flow occurred from the simulation domain in 2006 and 2007 as was the case at the test pile the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix material 9 10 6 m s 1 measured by neuner et al 2013 was used to simulate the flow system and no calibration of the hydraulic conductivity was conducted as part of the scale up from intermediate to large scale field experiments simulated cumulative flow volume diverged from measured volume by a wider margin in 2011 and 2012 indicating potential external influences e g flow from other sections of the pile to the internal flow system or incongruous freezing and thawing as the experiment matured it should be noted that one basal lysimeter malfunctioned in 2012 and flow from this location was removed from the cumulative measured flow calculation potentially resulting in an underestimation of the 2012 measured cumulative volume water freezing was considered in the test pile experiment simulations the min3p code was developed such that hydraulic conductivity was reduced to 1 10 7 m s 1 as a step function when temperature at a given control volume was less than 0 c effectively stopping flow under freezing conditions this refinement in the implementation of the integrated conceptual model meant flow occurred in some parts of the test pile and not others according to the temperature regime providing reasonable agreement between timing of measured and simulated outflow 6 3 mineral volume fraction for the type iii test pile simulations the sulfide mineral volume fractions were identical to those used for the intermediate scale simulations wilson et al 2018b the test pile simulations were conducted assuming the significant geochemical weathering occurred in the fine grained component of the pile consistent with the intermediate scale simulations and the calibration of the conceptual model at the humidity cell scale the reliance of the test pile simulations on mineral surface area is consistent with suggestions by previous researchers e g strömberg and banwart 1999 hollings et al 2001 lefebvre et al 2001 amos et al 2011 that a primary parameter of consideration when assessing the geochemical evolution of waste rock at various scales is mineral surface area this provides further indication that reactions within the high surface area matrix material exert significant influence on the geochemical evolution of waste rock 6 4 secondary mineral control the geochemical characterization of the type iii test pile conducted by bailey et al 2016 and sinclair et al 2015 included an analysis of the influences of secondary minerals on pore water concentrations of fe al ca and so4 the results of the reactive transport simulation indicated secondary mineral precipitation exerted control on solute concentrations thus confirming the importance of including secondary minerals when characterizing the geochemical evolution of waste rock using scale up approaches the precipitation of secondary fe minerals fe oh 3 and kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 occurred throughout the test pile for the duration of the simulation with kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 lagging three years behind fe oh 3 simulated fe oh 3 started precipitating in 2006 kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 did not precipitate until part way through 2009 iron oxy hydroxide precipitation generally occurred throughout the flow season in the shallower portions of the test pile dissolution occurred in the test pile beginning in 2010 approximately corresponding with periods of higher temperature and higher rates of sulfide oxidation this observation is consistent with the sinclair et al 2015 hypothesis that fe oh 3 could be acting as a ph control within the system the dominance of fe oh 3 precipitation over dissolution in the simulations especially from 2007 to 2009 indicates fe oh 3 is also acting as a control on fe concentrations in pore water and may have contributed to the underestimation of peak fe concentrations and daily mass flux jarosite precipitation in the simulations occurred in 2010 2012 following a pattern of early season precipitation and later season dissolution indicating its influence as a temporary delay mechanism in release of fe and so4 and its bimodal influence on ph moderation the precipitation dissolution cycle of kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 in the test pile simulations is consistent with the behavior of kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 in the intermediate scale simulations the simulation results indicated caso4 2h2o precipitation occurred within the test pile exerting only temporary control on ca concentrations as proposed by sinclair et al 2015 gypsum precipitation and dissolution also occurred in the simulations primarily in the mid to upper portions of the test pile 9 m depth during all years of the simulation sinclair et al 2015 proposed the precipitation of al secondary minerals including al oh 3 as an initial control on al concentrations in pore water becoming a secondary source of al as the capacity of calcite to consume h is exhausted the results of the simulations indicated al oh 3 precipitated throughout the pile during all years of the simulation but did not dissolve at any point the simulation indicated the primary influence of al oh 3 on the test pile system from 2008 to 2012 was as a control on the release of al to pore water amorphous si precipitated in the simulated test pile domain for the duration of the simulation period exerting a control on si effluent concentrations 6 5 acid neutralization the trend of decreasing ph and alkalinity at the type iii test pile experiment during the 2008 2012 period was indicative of decreased calcite availability and complete depletion of calcite by 2010 sinclair et al 2015 the simulation results indicated the mass of calcite was sufficient to consume much of the h produced by sulfide oxidation resulting in a simulated ph remained elevated compared to the measured results indicating the calcite mineral content may have been overestimated the reduction of calcite content in the calibrated simulation resulted in simulated ph consistent with measured ph the simulation of the geochemical evolution of the test pile illustrated the acid neutralization sequence within the pile fig 12 an acid neutralization sequence that starts with calcite dissolution has been observed in the type iii test pile bailey et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 following calcite exhaustion a sequence of limited al oh 3 dissolution that progressed to fe oh 3 dissolution as the primary acid neutralization phase likely occurred bailey et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 the calibrated model results indicate the simulated neutralization sequence is consistent with this hypothesis the calcite content of the matrix material was exhausted within the simulation by early 2009 subsequent acid neutralization was dominated by fe oh 3 dissolution particularly when sulfide mineral oxidation rates were at their peak in the mid flow season limited al oh 3 dissolution occurred in the calibrated simulation the carbonate mineral dolomite was present within the simulated system and contributed to acid neutralization throughout the simulation period at all depths of the test pile domain however because the rate of dolomite dissolution was approximately one order of magnitude lower than for calcite dissolution the influence of dolomite in the acid neutralization sequence may be of secondary importance 6 6 implications of simulation results for forecasting the simulations documented here comprise the third part of a series to investigate the efficacy of using reactive transport models for forecasting the first part of the study involved calibration of the reactive transport model as implementation of a geochemical conceptual model developed for the humidity cell experiments wilson et al 2018a and the second part applied the reactive transport model to intermediate scale field experiments with simplified temperature and hydrological regimes wilson et al 2018b the results of the simulation documented in this paper indicate reasonable estimations of solute concentrations and mass loading can be obtained by applying this method to large field scale experiments that more closely approximate the physicochemical conditions in operational waste rock piles when compared to the measured results from the test pile experiment the simulated concentration and loading results are not always in close agreement however they are sufficiently accurate to provide appropriate guidance regarding the management of waste rock e g whether ph conditions will induce metal transport order of magnitude of metal concentrations the calibrated simulations show that model refinements provide a better fit to measured data providing confidence in the geochemical conceptual model but highlight the uncertainty and variability inherent in natural systems and waste rock systems in particular however given that these refinements cannot be anticipated a priori the need to account for this uncertainty in forecasting exercises is further highlighted consistent with the findings of bailey et al 2022 outstanding challenges remain to be addressed in future work with regard to the application of the proposed mechanistic scale up methodology these challenges include physical and geochemical based processes e g freezing water and its influence on the geochemical evolution of minerals sorption of metals effects of secondary mineral recrystallization and estimation of the uncertainties inherent in modelling a heterogeneous physical system with averaged parameters finally the study focused primarily on the comparison of simulation results with measured concentration and mass loading of metals and associated parameters at the effluent point of one of the test pile experiments in addition to this information the simulations from all three studies provided a large amount of information at a spatial and temporal density not possible using only measured results leading to a better understanding of the processes involved in mine waste weathering that is not possible using traditional scale up approaches waste mixing scenarios pile structure scenarios and the resulting geochemical changes over time could be investigated once a base case of waste rock weathering has been implemented the dynamic nature of the modelling approach not only provides a feasible forecasting tool but also creates opportunities to approach the management of mine wastes in a much more constrained and informative way 7 conclusions simulation of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock through implementation of the integrated conceptual model provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of mechanistic forecasting techniques the measured data in this paper were only used for performance assessment and not to calibrate the model analysis of the flow portion of the simulation indicated some of the divergence in the simulation mass flux from the measured values can be attributed to simulated flow volume illustrating the importance of adequately representing the flow regime at the more complex larger scales implementing the integrated conceptual model at the large field scale as a forecasting tool resulted in good agreement between measured and simulated concentrations and daily mass flux of most parameters including so4 ni co zn al si ca k and alkalinity the concentration of fe was underestimated but mean values were consistent with those measured other parameters including cu and ph were not as well captured and required calibration to improve simulation fit the integrated conceptual model provided a reasonable assessment of type iii test pile weathering under a temporally and spatially dynamic temperature regime the mechanistic approach to forecasting documented here illustrates a detailed conceptual model implemented using a reactive transport model can provide a reasonable characterization of the geochemical evolution of a waste rock the central parameters of the integrated conceptual model including mineral surface area mineral content temperature and infiltration have been shown here to provide appropriate factors for the mechanistic simulation of the geochemical evolution of waste rock the reliance on a relatively limited number of easily measurable parameters suggests this approach could be implemented at other sites using appropriate site specific details a careful and comprehensive quantification of site mineralogy specifically sulfide acid neutralization and geochemically active host minerals physical parameters e g particle size distribution hydraulic conductivity infiltration and climatological parameters e g precipitation temperature are required to conduct mechanistic forecasting of this type the mechanistic scaling of the integrated conceptual model to facilitate assessment of the primary geochemical processes of waste rock weathering on a large scale has been shown in this study to provide results that are appropriate for decision making purposes however these results are specific to the study

1308,the diavik waste rock project dwrp project included four principal components focused on the development of techniques for assessing the environmental impacts of waste rock at mine sites these components were small volume laboratory experiments intermediate and large volume field experiments and assessment of the operational scale waste rock stockpiles which facilitated characterization of waste rock weathering at different scales the heavily instrumented large scale field experiments test piles were constructed to replicate as closely as practicable the temperature water flow and gas transport regimes of a waste rock pile that is exposed to annual freezing and thawing cycles and to facilitate characterization of the long term weathering of a low sulfide waste rock an integrated conceptual model of sulfide bearing waste rock weathering developed at the small scale was applied to assess the capacity of the conceptual model to capture the geochemical evolution of the waste rock at the large field scale test pile experiment the integrated conceptual model was implemented using reactive transport code min3p taking into account scale dependent mechanisms the test pile mineralogy was similar to the small scale laboratory experiments and included low sulfide waste rock with an s content of 0 053 wt primarily pyrrhotite the flow regime of the test pile was simulated using parameters measured as part of other dwrp investigations including temporally variable infiltration estimates that represented the measured precipitation events at the site the temporally and spatially variable temperature of the test pile was interpolated from values measured using instrumentation installed at the beginning of the experiment and was included in the simulation to refine the temperature dependence of the geochemical reactions to allow continuous multi year simulation freezing was also simulated to represent the conditions experienced at the test pile experiment normalized root mean square error analysis of the large scale field experiment simulation results indicated most parameters compare well to measured daily mass flux i e the fraction of the range of annual values encompassed in the residual was less than 0 5 for so4 fe ni si ca k mg na and ph and 1 0 or less for all parameters except cu the method of using an integrated conceptual model developed from the results of humidity cell experiments to implement a mechanistic approach for assessing the primary geochemical processes of waste rock weathering on a large scale was shown to provide reasonable results however the results are specific to the study site and the approach requires application to various sites under different geological and climatological conditions to facilitate further refinement keywords reactive transport sulfide oxidation scale up waste rock 1 introduction due to the costs involved in construction and the length of time required to produce results large scale field experiments test piles are rarely used for the purpose of mine waste rock characterization test piles have been used in research programs focused on the characterization of the geochemical and physical attributes of waste rock nichol et al 2005 andrina et al 2006 stockwell et al 2006 corazao et al 2007 smith et al 2013a plante et al 2014 blackmore et al 2014 bornhorst and logsdon 2016 more often smaller scale field experiments e g barrel experiments have been used to assess the geochemical evolution of waste rock demers et al 2013 smith et al 2013a parbhakar fox and lottermoser 2015 where available the results of larger and smaller scale field experiments can be used together to gain an understanding of the influence of dynamic infiltration and temperature regimes and heterogeneous particle size distribution on the geochemical evolution of waste rock the process of extrapolating the results of small scale experiments to full scale waste rock piles is commonly referred to as scale up parameters including ph particle size distribution moisture content rock water contact ratios temperature oxygen availability and mineral surface area are understood to influence effluent quality and these relationships are typically scaled using empirical factors kempton 2012 amos et al 2015 the ability of empirical scale factors to capture the geochemical evolution of waste rock in full size piles can be hampered by the heterogeneity of physical parameters e g particle size and mineral distribution and exposure of the waste rock to atmospheric conditions i e variable temperature and precipitation scale up methods reliant on empirical factors are generally incapable of providing an adequate assessment of waste rock evolution amos et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 mechanistic approaches such as reactive transport modelling provide the capacity to incorporate dynamic temperature and precipitation regimes and heterogeneity in physical parameters to address the inherent weaknesses of empirical scale up methodology reactive transport models have recently been used in studies for several sites to enhance understanding of climate influences yi et al 2021a remediation design raymond et al 2020 kalonji kabambi et al 2020 yi et al 2021b and pile construction methods raymond et al 2021 on the geochemical evolution of mine wastes reactive transport models continue to undergo development to enhance their overall capabilities for example to accommodate complex domains su et al 2020 and for the assessment of the geochemical evolution of mine wastes e g muniruzzaman et al 2020 yi et al 2021a these studies and others e g muniruzzaman et al 2021 have also highlighted the challenges associated with using reactive transport models including incorporation of spatial heterogeneity in physical and geochemical parameters temporal influences such as short term temperature fluctuations and long term shifts in climate and comparison of simulation results to measured site data this study provides a practical mechanistic approach to forecasting waste rock effluent geochemistry using reactive transport modelling based on parameters that are routinely measured while accounting for temporally dynamic temperature and infiltration and using site measured data as a comparison for simulation results reactive transport models have primarily been used in academia to date however the wide range of capabilities set forth here and in the above noted studies indicate wider adoption would provide a versatile advanced interpretation and forecasting tool to practitioners developing mine waste management strategies the experiments conducted as part of the diavik waste rock project dwrp were designed to facilitate the investigation of mechanistic approaches to scale up small scale laboratory experiments were complemented by intermediate and large scale field experiments the laboratory experiments included small scale 1 kg humidity cells the intermediate scale 9300 kg experiments consisted of 2 m diameter barrel style active zone lysimeter experiments and the large scale 8 2 107 kg experiments included densely instrumented test piles the field experiments were conducted at diavik diamond mine diavik located approximately 300 km northeast of yellowknife nt canada research on scaling laboratory experiment results has been conducted as part of the dwrp by bailey et al 2022 sinclair et al 2015 and wilson et al 2018ab bailey et al 2022 determined sulfide mineral weathering rates using effluent data from the dwrp humidity cell experiments langman et al 2014 and scaled those rates mechanistically to assess solute loading from the intermediate scale experiment bailey et al 2015 bailey et al 2022 demonstrated that assessment of mass loading from the intermediate scale experiment could be conducted reasonably well for relatively conservative solutes such as zn and cu the method was limited because geochemical processes known to be active in the systems including secondary mineral precipitation ion sorption and microbiological catalysis were not considered as part of the calculations sinclair et al 2015 developed a loading model that simulated so4 production within the core of a test pile with 0 053 wt s designated type iii see below sinclair et al 2015 suggested mechanistic approaches can be used to assess the geochemical evolution of waste rock wilson et al 2018ab developed an integrated conceptual model of geochemical evolution for the humidity cell experiments and used the reactive transport code min3p mayer et al 2002 to simulate the effluent concentrations and mass loading from the intermediate scale experiment this mechanistic approach provided a reasonable assessment of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock while considering secondary mineral precipitation and dissolution sorption and dynamic temperature and infiltration regimes the work of bailey et al 2022 and wilson et al 2018b showed mechanistic approaches can facilitate an effluent quality forecasting method that captures the complex processes involved with waste rock weathering providing realistic assessments of effluent concentrations and mass loading the work documented here consists of implementing the integrated conceptual model developed by wilson et al 2018a using min3p to simulate one dimensional 1 d flow and geochemical evolution through the core of one of the large scale field experiments min3p is a multi component reactive transport code that can be used to simulate water flow through the unsaturated zone and kinetically controlled geochemical reactions a geochemical framework can be developed using the code that includes mineral dissolution and precipitation sorption complexation and oxidation reduction reactions using project specific reaction stoichiometry and kinetics the objective of the simulations was to investigate the capability of the integrated conceptual model developed from the small laboratory experiments to forecast the effluent geochemistry from the larger field experiment considering dynamic temperature and flow regimes this investigation is the third in a series of studies and builds on the previous numerical simulation work the first study involved implementation of an integrated conceptual model for laboratory scale experiments i e humidity cells within a reactive transport model wilson et al 2018a the second study involved applying the calibrated model from the first study to the intermediate scale field experiments including the larger domain size measured s and c content and the temporally dynamic temperature of the field experiment wilson et al 2018b the simulation in this study makes use of the same reactive transport model used in the intermediate scale study but at a larger scale which inherently incorporates complexities in the physical system particularly thermal and freeze thaw dynamics that impact geochemical reaction rates and water flow that cannot be explored at smaller scales 2 test pile methodology the focus of this study is one of three test pile experiments conducted at diavik over a period of more than 10 years starting in 2006 specifically the geochemical evolution of waste rock was investigated at a large scale test pile 50 m 60 m 15 m high with a thermal regime controlled by the arctic climate in a continuous permafrost region the annual temperature at diavik ranges from an average summer high of 18 c to an average winter low of 31 c with an annual mean 1998 2007 of 9 c smith et al 2013a precipitation occurs as approximately 40 rain and 60 snow smith et al 2013a the mineralogy of the waste rock used to build the test pile experiments was similar to that of the dwrp humidity cells langman et al 2014 wilson et al 2018a and included approximately 75 granite primarily quartz k feldspar and albite 14 pegmatitic granite primarily quartz k feldspar and albite 10 biotite schist primarily albite quartz and biotite and 1 diabase primarily plagioclase blowes and logsdon 1998 langman et al 2014 the metal sulfide minerals were primarily contained in the biotite schist langman et al 2014 the mean sulfide content of the biotite schist was 0 24 wt s langman et al 2014 pyrrhotite fe 1 x s was the dominant metal sulfide mineral in the waste material in which minor substitution of ni and co for fe occurred in the following approximate ratio fe0 852ni0 004co0 001s jambor 1997 metal sulfide minerals chalcopyrite cufes2 sphalerite zns and pentlandite fe ni 9s8 were found to be present in small quantities langman et al 2014 mineralogical characterization conducted by jambor 1997 did not indicate the presence of partially or fully oxidized s bearing minerals suggesting the waste rock s content was dominated by sulfide s the mineralogical analyses conducted by jambor 1997 indicated c was present only as carbonate waste rock at diavik is segregated according to s content where type i 0 04 wt s 0 04 wt type ii 0 08 wt and type iii 0 08 wt s the focus of this study was the type iii test pile experiment samples collected from waste rock used to construct the type iii test pile have mean s and c contents of 0 053 wt and 0 027 wt respectively smith et al 2013c the test pile experiments were constructed with freshly blasted rock the total s and c contents measured as part of the construction of the test pile experiment were assumed to consist entirely of sulfide and carbonate respectively for the reactive transport simulations the type iii test pile was constructed of approximately 8 2 107 kg of waste rock exposed to atmospheric temperature and precipitation conditions for the duration the experiment water flow from the type iii experiment was measured from both a basal drain system that collected water exiting the entire pile and a series of basal collection lysimeters constructed near the base of the test pile see sinclair et al 2015 for further details that collected water from the core of the pile only i e excluded preferential flow from the sides of the pile fig 1 rain was measured at the dwrp research station using tipping bucket rain gauges fig 2 snow depth was only measured at discrete intervals and is not shown as a result of wind scouring snow did not typically accumulate on the crest of the pile to a significant depth the basal collection lysimeters were installed to facilitate measurement of the flow volume and collection of samples for geochemical analysis of water that infiltrated from the crest through the core of the test pile smith et al 2013a flow volume from the core of the test pile was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges installed at each basal collection lysimeter drain outlet smith et al 2013a effluent samples were collected regularly every 3 5 days from the basal collection lysimeter drains during the flow seasons of 2008 when flow at the drains started to 2012 the samples were analyzed for a suite of 42 inorganic and general parameters which included parameters indicative of diavik waste rock weathering fe ni co cu zn al si ca mg k na and so4 ph and alkalinity smith et al 2013b thorough descriptions of the test pile and drain system construction and sampling procedures are provided by smith et al 2013a and sinclair et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 supplemented their characterization of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock with analysis of pore water samples collected from soil water solution samplers installed in the core of the type iii test pile the soil water solution samplers were installed at depths of approximately 2 3 5 7 and 9 m from the crest of the pile and samples were collected regularly approximately bi weekly during periods when the test pile was not frozen more details about the installation of the soil water solution samplers and sampling protocol can be found in smith et al 2013a and sinclair et al 2015 3 conceptual model the integrated conceptual model for sulfidic mine waste rock weathering developed by wilson et al 2018a was implemented to simulate the geochemical evolution of the type iii test pile experiment the integrated conceptual model was developed from site specific data informed by the results of previous studies conducted through the dwrp amos et al 2009 bailey et al 2013 2015 2016 bailey et al 2022 chi et al 2013 neuner et al 2013 pham et al 2013 smith et al 2013a 2013b 2013c langman et al 2014 2015a 2015b 2017 matthies et al 2014 sinclair et al 2015 and designed to be scaled and coupled with site specific flow and temperature regimes to provide a realistic assessment of the geochemical evolution of waste rock at diavik the integrated conceptual model implemented here contains the same mineralogy used by wilson et al 2018b for simulation of the geochemical evolution at the intermediate dwrp scale this mineralogy is specific to the dwrp due to the larger size of the test pile experiment the flow and temperature regimes of the experiment were anticipated to be more complex when compared to the intermediate scale simulation described by wilson et al 2018b and this increased complexity would likely be reflected in the geochemical system the simulated flow regime was based on the dwrp test pile experiments described by smith et al 2013a and neuner et al 2013 measured precipitation fig 2 at diavik was used to estimate infiltration to the test pile through application of the fao penman monteith fao p m method described by neuner et al 2013 tracer tests conducted in 2006 and 2007 supplied additional water to the flow system approximately 34 7 m3 in 2006 and 36 2 m3 in 2007 and were included in the infiltration volume used in the simulations tracer water was obtained from lac de gras analysis of samples of the lake water indicated solute concentrations of most parameters at least an order of magnitude below test pile effluent concentrations and circumneutral ph wilson et al 2018b neuner et al 2013 indicated water flow through the system was dominated by matrix flow with the matrix material particle diameters 5 mm making up approximately 20 of the total material in the type iii test pile the dominance of matrix flow in the system suggests use of the richards equation is appropriate for the simulation of water flow through the test pile and indicates that the matrix material mineralogy will control water geochemistry through the core of the test pile water flow through the unsaturated test pile was therefore simulated as intermittent events that coincided with the calculated infiltration events under the assumption of a single porosity domain i e flow is conceptualized to occur only through the matrix material preferential flow is not included and is considered to be a minor component of overall flow in the waste rock piles at diavik due in part to the arid climate the large size of the test pile experiment and its exposure to atmospheric temperature necessitated incorporation of a temperature regime within the pile that was spatially and temporally variable temperature was measured during the experiment with a series of instrument strings with thermistors spaced at regular approximately 0 5 m intervals within the core of the test pile additional thermistors were installed in boreholes beneath the test pile prior to construction automated monitoring of the thermistor network provided temperature measurements approximately every 6 h from the crest of the pile to approximately 11 m depth combined with deeper measurements from approximately 14 to 16 m below the crest of pile although the thermistors installed inside the pile could not be re calibrated post installation thermistors near the pile surface showed similar temperatures and temperature patterns to locally measured ambient air temperatures pham et al 2013 smith et al 2013a and pham et al 2013 provide further details on the construction and operation of the thermal data collection system sinclair et al 2015 described a conceptual model of freezing and thawing within the test pile based on the measured temperatures sinclair et al 2015 showed the test pile was fully frozen each year from december to may and fully thawed from august to october with transitional periods in june july and november the june july transitional period was characterized by relatively uniform warming front migration from top and sides to bottom the november transitional period was characterized by cooling front migration from top and sides to bottom and additional slight cooling front migration up from the bottom of the pile resulting in an inner core of thawed waste rock surrounded by frozen material the proposed conceptual model of freezing and thawing suggested a regime of spatially and temporally variable temperature would be required to accurately assess the geochemical evolution of the waste rock at the test pile scale a one dimensional temperature field based on the measured data and varied on a daily basis was generated to represent the complex temperature regime within the test pile the integrated conceptual model of sulfidic mineral weathering presented by wilson et al 2018ab is briefly summarized here oxidants o2 aq and fe3 are recognized as dominant drivers of sulfide mineral oxidation nordstrom and southam 1997 blowes et al 2003 the following reaction stoichiometry for diavik specific pyrrhotite was used to describe the overall reactions after nicholson and scharer 1998 janzen et al 2000 belzile et al 2004 1 fe 0

and 2 respectively reaction stoichiometry and rate expressions represented irreversible surface weathering in all cases except for calcite and dolomite for which representative reactions were reversible secondary minerals included in the simulations were also based on site specific mineralogy and included minerals considered likely to be present based on the results of a saturation index analysis of effluent geochemistry or reasonably likely to be present because of their association with the geochemical weathering of sulfidic waste rock the secondary minerals considered in the simulation included fe iii oxy hydroxide fe oh 3 jarosite kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 gypsum caso4 2h2o siderite feco3 gibbsite al oh 3 and amorphous silica sio2 all secondary minerals precipitated or dissolved in accordance with the reaction stoichiometry and equilibrium controlled expressions shown in tables 1 and 2 the set of secondary minerals included in the test pile simulation was the same as described by wilson et al 2018ab no calibration was conducted as part of this simulation with respect to secondary minerals wilson et al 2018a provide further detail on the selected set of included secondary minerals the interpolated temperatures within the test pile were used in conjunction with the results of the calibration conducted by wilson et al 2018a and the arrhenius expression to capture the temperature dependence of waste rock weathering in the test pile experiment the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient used in calculation of sulfide mineral weathering rates was adjusted with respect to the spatial and temporal temperature variation using the activation enthalpy calculated by wilson et al 2018a 9 h r t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 ln d 1 eff d 2 eff the temperature dependence of host mineral weathering rates was simulated according to their respective activation energies as previously calibrated as part of the development of the integrated conceptual model wilson et al 2018a no additional calibration for temperature was conducted as part of the test pile experiment simulations 4 model parameters the type iii test pile domain was constructed as a 1 d column with a depth of 12 5 m corresponding to the approximate depth from the test pile crest to the midpoint of the basal collection lysimeters located at the base of the pile the simulation domain was discretized in the z direction as 125 10 cm control volumes the simulation was run for 2555 days to correspond with the years 2006 2012 construction of the type iii test pile was completed in 2006 precipitation measured at the test pile research area was used to estimate the infiltration with the fao p m method described by neuner et al 2013 infiltration resulting from snowmelt was insignificant because most snowfall at the top of the test pile experiment was scoured from the crest by wind before the onset of the melting season neuner et al 2013 and therefore was not considered the partial pressure of o2 g was set at atmospheric 0 21 atm as a boundary condition at the top of the simulation domain and infiltrating water was assumed to be at equilibrium with atmospheric o2 g gas measurements conducted at the test pile experiment indicated the partial pressure of o2 within the pile was at atmospheric concentration suggesting o2 ingress was not a limiting factor in the oxidation of sulfide minerals amos et al 2009 chi et al 2013 the temperature at each control volume in the simulation was calculated by linear interpolation within the min3p code from an input file of measured temperatures at 2 0 m intervals temperature data were collected throughout the test pile from late 2006 to 2012 and the temperature of the simulations accurately represented the measured temperature at that time in the test pile e g the interpolated temperature at 5 m depth on december 31 2007 was approximately the same as measured in the type iii test pile for that date and depth simulation temperature changed daily and was the average of four values measured at a given location on a given day porosity hydraulic conductivity and soil hydraulic function parameters table 3 were based on the work of neuner et al 2013 and not adjusted to calibrate the flow solution the porosity value was the portion of the bulk porosity represented by the matrix material i e 20 of the matrix material porosity measured by neuner et al 2013 the matrix material porosity was conceptualized in this manner to facilitate a representative simulation of flow only through a matrix material that makes up approximately 20 of the rock in the test pile experiment the soil hydraulic function parameters were not adjusted to account for freezing conditions a tracer simulation was conducted to assess the physical flow parameters used for the reactive transport simulations during construction of the type iii test pile smith et al 2013a collected samples for s and c analyses that provide the mineral volume fractions ϕi tables 4 and 5 for sulfide and carbonate minerals mineral volume fractions for less abundant sulfide minerals i e cufes2 and zns were estimated by wilson et al 2018a from bulk metal analysis conducted on humidity cell samples fe4 5ni3 6co0 9s8 ϕi was calibrated as part of the humidity cell simulations wilson et al 2018a the initial radius for sulfide minerals was established as part of the laboratory experiment simulations documented by wilson et al 2018a mineral volume fractions for host minerals were the same as those used by wilson et al 2018ab table 5 simulation ϕi values were adjusted to represent the portion of minerals in the matrix material and available to geochemical processes this is equivalent to 20 of their measured values because the matrix makes up approximately 20 of the bulk rock based on surface area to volume ratios it was assumed that minerals contained within larger material fractions would not be exposed to o2 and moisture and therefore would not significantly influence the waste rock geochemistry for multi year simulations the min3p code was modified to consider periods during the experiment when part or all of the test pile was frozen during periods of freezing conditions hydraulic conductivity was reduced to 1 10 7 m s 1 two orders of magnitude lower than the measured hydraulic conductivity effectively stopping water flow within the frozen portion of the pile elberling 2005 measured o2 depletion associated with frozen pyritic mine waste and concluded that oxidation reactions can proceed at temperatures below freezing using the oxygen depletion measurements elberling found the q10 temperature coefficient rate of change of chemical or biological process due to a 10 c increase in temperature of the oxidation reaction rate decreased significantly i e the reaction rate slowed significantly at temperatures 2 c due to limited availability of aqueous and gaseous o2 geochemical reactions within the domain were effectively stopped under freezing conditions i e when temperature within a control volume was below 0 c by reducing reaction rates to zero to assess the influence of freezing conditions on the geochemical evolution of the waste rock in the test pile experiment previous dwrp studies including the deconstruction and detailed sampling of the type i test pile which was constructed using the same techniques as the type iii test pile indicates that i the matrix material is well mixed in the core of the experimental piles i e the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix material is relatively uniform throughout the piles wilson 2018 and ii the s and c distribution within the matrix material is relatively uniform throughout the piles smith et al 2013c atherton 2017 a 1 d domain and homogeneous parameters were selected for this work to determine if a simplified representation of the waste rock experiment would provide a reasonable forecast of effluent quality supplemental simulations were conducted to assess i the influence of temperature on effluent flow and geochemistry from the test pile and ii the influence of calibration of the large scale simulation the influence of temperature was assessed using a homogeneous temperature distribution that included a constant temperature for the portion of the year when water flow was active 4 4 c and a constant temperature for the frozen portion of the year 0 c the active water flow season temperature was the average test pile temperature under thawed conditions over the 6 year simulation period in addition limited calibration was conducted on the forecast simulation to improve the results specifically ph and concentrations of cu the calibration involved removal of cu sorption inclusion of covellite cus as a secondary sink for cu reduction of the effective diffusion coefficient for chalcopyrite oxidation by o2 aq an increase of the rate constant for fe2 oxidation and reduction of the calcite mineral content 5 results 5 1 temperature one of the refinements of the test pile simulation relative to the previous dwrp reactive transport simulations wilson et al 2018a b was the introduction of a spatially dynamic temperature regime the measured temperature data were compiled according to depth within the test pile and provided as input to the simulations using a temperature field temperature data were available at approximately 0 5 m intervals throughout the depth of the test pile except for the region between approximately 11 5 m depth and the base of the test pile approximately 14 0 m the simulation temperature compares well with the measured temperature variation at and between temperature input nodes fig 3 the simulations started on january 1 2006 however temperature data from the test pile were not available until august 2006 temperature data from 2007 were substituted for the missing 2006 temperature data other than averaging up to four measurements per day to provide a daily average temperature for a given point the input temperature data were not modified or smoothed in any way additional processing of the temperature data did not improve the fit of the simulated outflow to the observed outflow 5 2 water flow flow simulations were conducted in conjunction with the temperature regime interpolations for comparison to the simulated outflow the total daily measured outflow volume was divided by the total basal collection lysimeter area contributing to that outflow to calculate the daily volume of outflow from the type iii core per square meter all flow to the basal collection lysimeters was assumed to be due to infiltration from the top of the test pile comparison of the measured outflow volume and the simulated outflow through the core of the type iii test pile indicates good agreement over the six year simulation period fig 4 a tracer test was simulated for the test pile domain to estimate water velocity through the test pile and residence time the simulated water velocity of 0 01 m d 1 averaged over the year compares well with the velocity of 0 006 m d 1 calculated from the results of the 2007 tracer test conducted at the type iii test pile experiment krentz 2014 the simulated residence time of approximately 5 3 years is consistent with the measured peak tracer arrival representing flow through the core of the test pile of approximately 5 years krentz 2014 zak 2017 the normalized root mean square error nrmse was calculated to analyze the error in the simulation of flow through the test pile normalization was conducted using the range of measured daily flow values the nrmse is 0 08 when all days of the simulation are included in the calculation and 0 19 when only days where flow was measured at the experiment drains are included the simulation underpredicts or overpredicts the total flow in some years however the overall flow throughout the simulation period is consistent with the measured outflow fig 4b 5 3 uncalibrated simulation water chemistry the simulated effluent geochemistry was compared to effluent geochemistry measured from samples collected at the basal collection lysimeter drains at the base of the type iii test pile the measured effluent geochemistry was an average of all basal collection lysimeter samples collected during a given sampling event compared parameters included concentrations mg l 1 of so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k and na ph su alkalinity as mg l 1 caco3 fig 5 and daily mass loading mg m 2 d 1 of so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k and na fig 6 sinclair et al 2015 analyzed effluent concentrations from the core of the type iii test pile and noted an early season flush of higher solute concentration was followed by a relatively steady decline in solute concentration for the duration of the flow season sporadic flow often occurred from the core of the test pile prior to the onset of the regular flow season however this early season flow was likely water frozen in the drain system during the previous year and not representative of the geochemical conditions in the core of the test pile sinclair et al 2015 high solute loads observed at the start of each flow season have been hypothesized to result from two related factors i water residence time and ii extended sulfide oxidation occurring during periods of little or no flow near pile freeze up sinclair et al 2015 briefly summarizing general trends the average annual concentrations of solutes that are indicators of sulfide weathering including so4 ni co cu and zn increase from 2008 to 2012 average annual concentrations of solutes indicating host rock weathering including ca k mg na al and si remain relatively stable or increase slightly throughout the 2008 to 2012 period measured ph from the core of the type iii test pile declines slightly with average annual values of 4 7 in 2008 and 4 3 in 2012 note average ph values were calculated by converting to h averaging then converting back to ph over the same period average annual alkalinity declines from approximately 9 to 2 mg l 1 as caco3 sinclair et al 2015 the uncalibrated simulation captures the 2008 2012 general concentration trend and some annual variation well for most parameters e g so4 ni co zn al si ca k and alkalinity fig 5 the largest differences between measured and simulated solute concentrations are observed for fe cu and ph the concentrations of fe are apparently underestimated in most years of the simulation 2008 to 2011 and well represented in the last year of the simulation 2012 the underestimation may be a result of fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation occurring at early simulation times but not to the same extent within the experiment speciation calculations conducted using test pile effluent geochemistry indicate the experiment effluent was undersaturated with respect to fe iii oxy hydroxide represented as fe oh 3 for a portion of 2008 the first year that effluent reported to the drains the simulation results indicate fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation occurred during all years of the simulation 2006 2012 suggesting a discrepancy in fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation rates between the simulation and experiment may have resulted in underestimation of the fe concentrations this difference in fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation rates may be influenced by simulation ph which is somewhat overestimated at times in the simulation and the simulated rate of fe2 oxidation the measured fe concentrations reach a maximum of 6 mg l 1 the discrepancy between the simulated and measured maximum concentrations of 1 5 mg l 1 and 6 mg l 1 is not significant in terms of environmental impact these estimates will result in appropriate guidance for waste rock management strategies the largest discrepancy between measured and simulated values is observed for cu the simulation results indicate maximum estimated cu concentrations of 39 mg l 1 vs maximum measured concentrations of 13 mg l 1 this discrepancy may be due to specification of an inappropriate constraint on cu concentrations the simulations are based on the assumption that cu adsorption to fe iii oxy hydroxides constrains the maximum cu concentrations the elevated concentrations of simulated cu suggest variation in the sorption parameters from the smaller scale experiments humidity cells and active zone lysimeters to the large scale field experiment or the presence of a secondary phase not considered in the simulations e g covellite the comparison of the measured and simulated cu concentrations suggests the dominant mechanism of cu attenuation may be dependent on the scale of the observations and would not be apparent in the small scale experiments that formed the basis for the conceptual model the simulated ph and alkalinity generally overpredict measured values intra annual concentration variations are partially captured by the simulations discrepancies in intra annual variation between the measured and simulated values are likely because the simplified implementation of freeze thaw dynamics did not fully represent the freeze thaw conceptual model proposed by sinclair et al 2015 the implementation was not intended as a robust representation of freeze thaw cycling the simulation results show improved agreement relative to the dwrp intermediate scale simulation results which did not consider freeze thaw cycling wilson et al 2018b this observation suggests the freeze thaw cycling implemented at the large scale simulation better represents the geochemical evolution of the field experiments additionally the timing of and total daily mass flux from the experiment are well captured for most parameters e g so4 ni co zn si al ca and k fig 6 the apparent early time underestimation of fe concentrations is reflected in daily mass flux however the mean simulated daily mass flux for fe is 0 48 mg m 2 d 1 consistent with the mean measured daily mass flux observed 0 41 throughout the 5 year experiment as stated previously the discrepancy in fe daily mass flux may be the result of a differences between simulated and experimental fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation and or rates of fe2 oxidation the simulation overestimates the daily mass load of cu possibly due to the specification of an inappropriate concentration control processes similar results are indicated in the cumulative mass loads with reasonable fits for most parameters e g so4 ni co si al ca and k fig 11 slight overestimation of fe and zn approximately 2 and significant overestimation of cu approximately 4 and significant underestimation of mg and na approximately 7 a review of the simulation results indicates most parameters except cu follow the measured vertical spatial trends figs 7 and 8 the simulated ph generally overestimates measured ph within the experiment and variations in ph versus depth present in the measured profiles are not always reflected in the simulation results the simulated alkalinity profiles follow a similar progression to the measured alkalinity profile except in early years where the simulated alkalinity is higher than measured the al concentration is generally overestimated deeper in the pile in the early year profiles likely caused by differences in the temperature dependence of al bearing minerals vs the secondary al mineral included in the simulation fe concentrations are somewhat underestimated throughout the 2007 and 2008 profiles suggesting early simulation fe iii oxy hydroxide precipitation may have overly influenced fe concentrations in the simulated test pile outflow simulated profiles of so4 ni and zn generally show good agreement with the measured concentration profiles for most years although the range of concentrations in the profiles is representative of the field measurements some detailed variations in concentrations are not captured the concentration of cu is consistently overestimated suggesting the sorption process specified as a limitation on dissolved cu concentrations may be inappropriate the results of the constant temperature simulation indicate so4 ni co cu zn al mg and na concentrations are higher compared to results from the temporally and spatially dynamic temperature simulation resulting in poorer agreement between field measurements and the simulation results for all assessed parameters with the exception of mg and na minimal differences are noted for fe si ca ph and alkalinity although the intra annual variation for fe is present for the dynamic temperature simulation simulated k concentrations are generally lower in the constant temperature simulation resulting in a poorer fit to the measured data in addition the timing and volume of flow from the simulated constant temperature system is not consistent with the measured flow these observations confirm the requirement to incorporate temperature variation in multi year simulations where freezing is present 5 4 uncalibrated forecast model performance assessment to assess the performance of the large scale model the simulation results were compared to the entire set of measured effluent and internal pile i e soil water solution sampler geochemistry data figs 5 8 the measured data were only used for performance assessment and not to calibrate the model annual mean measured daily mass flux was compared to the simulation results for selected parameters so4 fe ni cu zn mg m 2 d 1 and ph su fig 9 the results of the mean flux comparison indicate the mean annual simulated daily mass flux is within one standard deviation of the measured mean for so4 fe ni cu and zn for most years of the simulation larger discrepancies include underestimation of daily mass flux for so4 in 2011 and overestimation of fe cu and zn in 2012 the mean and standard deviation for these selected parameters are consistent with the indications of the concentration fig 5 and daily mass flux fig 6 comparisons the mean and standard deviation comparison indicates the concentration and daily mass flux of fe is captured somewhat more precisely than shown in figs 5 and 6 although the simulation did not capture the higher concentrations of fe in the earlier years of the experiment the statistical evaluation suggests the simulation captures a larger portion of the measured values and provides an adequate representation of the fe migrating from the test pile the nrmse was calculated to analyze the performance of the simulation with respect to geochemical parameters so4 ni co cu zn fe al si ca mg k na mg m 2 d 1 and ph su the nrmse was calculated on an annual basis and normalized using the range of measured daily mass flux values annual basis for each parameter the nrmse table 6 represents the fraction of the range of annual values for a given parameter that is encompassed in the residual although the nrmse can vary significantly from year to year the results obtained represent reasonable values for most parameters including so4 fe ni co zn al si ca k and ph larger nrmse values for cu are consistent with the observation that this parameter is not as well represented by the simulation 5 5 forecast model calibration to further assess the forecast simulation a calibration was conducted to provide a better fit to the measured test pile basal collection lysimeter effluent concentration data presented in fig 5 the target parameters of the calibration were fe cu and ph due to underestimated and overestimated concentrations fe and cu compared to measured and the general overestimation of ph the indicated fit fig 10 was obtained by increasing the rate of fe2 oxidation less than one order of magnitude inclusion of covellite as a potential secondary sink for cu covellite did not precipitate removing cu sorption reduction of the effective diffusion coefficient for chalcopyrite oxidation by o2 aq one order of magnitude and reduction of calcite content to 20 of uncalibrated content the reduction of calcite content resulted in a simulated ph consistent with measured ph and calcite content was exhausted from the simulated domain in a time period consistent with previous research at diavik fig 12 discussion acid neutralization sinclair et al 2015 similar to the concentration results the cumulative mass loads generated with the calibrated simulation indicate improved fits consistent with measured cumulative mass loads for most metals e g fe co cu and zn fig 11 6 discussion the integrated conceptual model implemented for the dwrp test pile experiment was developed using widely applicable mechanisms e g shrinking core model sorption model such that when coupled with routinely measured site specific physical parameters e g mineral surface area mineral volume fraction hydraulic conductivity temperature and infiltration can be used to simulate the geochemical evolution of waste rock under a variety of conditions the integrated conceptual model implemented for the dwrp experiments makes use of site specific mineralogy and physical parameters that will not necessarily be applicable to other sites the simulations conducted for the test pile experiment were intended to test the previously developed integrated conceptual model under complex conditions more closely replicating full size waste rock piles and highlighting discrepancies that may occur when scaling a mechanistic method of geochemical simulation the integrated conceptual model implemented using parameters consistent with the small scale simulations captured the effluent concentrations of most parameters quite well over the course of the simulation to quantify the goodness of fit of the simulations the simulated concentrations were compared to the distribution of measured concentrations this analysis indicated mean concentrations of most parameters ca co fe si mg na ni so4 ph and alkalinity averaged over the simulation period were within two standard deviations of the measured mean concentrations averaged over the same period mean concentrations of al k and zn were within three standard deviations of the measured mean but the mean concentrations of simulated cu were outside this range daily mass flux was also captured well for most parameters to quantify the goodness of fit with regards to measured daily mass flux the mean simulated daily mass flux was compared to the distribution about the mean of the measured values this analysis indicated the mean simulated daily mass flux was within two standard deviations of the measured mean daily mass flux for al ca co fe si k mg na ni so4 and zn cu was outside three standard deviations analysis of blasting residuals bailey et al 2013 indicated the first flush of matrix water through the test pile experiment occurred in 2008 and 2009 the analysis of the simulated to measured daily mass flux was repeated using only the years 2010 2012 because an initial experiment flush period was not considered in the simulation the results of the supplemental statistical analysis indicated the mean simulated daily mass flux was within two standard deviations of the measured mean daily mass flux for all parameters except cu excluding the years 2008 and 2009 from the analysis of simulated to measured concentrations did not improve the statistical analysis results the goodness of fit analysis in conjunction with the nrmse analysis suggests the mechanistic approach inherent to the simulations provides a suitable strategy for estimating effluent solute concentrations from waste rock piles furthermore the comparison between measured and simulated concentrations indicates implementation of a well constrained integrated conceptual model within a reactive solute transport framework provides reasonable estimates of solute concentrations and where inaccurate tends to be conservative and therefore appropriate for anticipating potential environmental impacts one of the core outcomes of this investigation into mechanistic methods for scale up was the development of an integrated conceptual model capable of being implemented to simulate the geochemical evolution of waste rock exposed to atmospheric conditions as a result two significant additions to the integrated conceptual model not considered for the intermediate scale simulations wilson et al 2018b were i spatially dynamic temperature and ii intermittent water flow and geochemical reaction progress due to the development of freezing conditions 6 1 temperature the interpolated temperature regime captured the measured temperature of the core of the test pile however the presence of heat trace within the test pile and the associated influence on temperature were not considered as part of the simulations heat trace cables within the pile are primarily located around drains and lysimeter installations but the influence of their temperature signal on the geochemical evolution of the waste rock was expected to be minimal additionally temperature data were only available to a depth of approximately 11 5 m measured from the test pile crest the temperature at depth 12 5 m bottom of simulation was linearly interpolated between deepest pile measurements and measurements from below the test pile at approximately 14 m depth the interpolated temperature value likely underestimated the actual temperature due to the presence of heat trace at drains and lysimeters and may account for a portion of the difference in timing of measured outflow versus simulated outflow e g measured outflow occurs in 2009 2010 and 2012 prior to simulated outflow supplemental simulations using constant temperatures one for the frozen season and one for the flow season indicated a constant temperature regime was not sufficient to satisfactorily replicate the flow and geochemistry from the core of the test pile 6 2 infiltration and flow the temporally dynamic infiltration regime along with a temporally and spatially dynamic temperature regime included in the simulation captured the general outflow from the core of the test pile the infiltration regime was based on the estimates of infiltration calculated using the same fao pm method used for the intermediate scale simulations neuner et al 2013 infiltration events initiated water flow through the test pile core by pressure wave propagation and displacement of resident pore water neuner et al 2013 the simulation of water flow from the core of the test pile agreed well with the timing of flow measured in each of the five flow seasons 2008 2012 no flow occurred from the simulation domain in 2006 and 2007 as was the case at the test pile the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the matrix material 9 10 6 m s 1 measured by neuner et al 2013 was used to simulate the flow system and no calibration of the hydraulic conductivity was conducted as part of the scale up from intermediate to large scale field experiments simulated cumulative flow volume diverged from measured volume by a wider margin in 2011 and 2012 indicating potential external influences e g flow from other sections of the pile to the internal flow system or incongruous freezing and thawing as the experiment matured it should be noted that one basal lysimeter malfunctioned in 2012 and flow from this location was removed from the cumulative measured flow calculation potentially resulting in an underestimation of the 2012 measured cumulative volume water freezing was considered in the test pile experiment simulations the min3p code was developed such that hydraulic conductivity was reduced to 1 10 7 m s 1 as a step function when temperature at a given control volume was less than 0 c effectively stopping flow under freezing conditions this refinement in the implementation of the integrated conceptual model meant flow occurred in some parts of the test pile and not others according to the temperature regime providing reasonable agreement between timing of measured and simulated outflow 6 3 mineral volume fraction for the type iii test pile simulations the sulfide mineral volume fractions were identical to those used for the intermediate scale simulations wilson et al 2018b the test pile simulations were conducted assuming the significant geochemical weathering occurred in the fine grained component of the pile consistent with the intermediate scale simulations and the calibration of the conceptual model at the humidity cell scale the reliance of the test pile simulations on mineral surface area is consistent with suggestions by previous researchers e g strömberg and banwart 1999 hollings et al 2001 lefebvre et al 2001 amos et al 2011 that a primary parameter of consideration when assessing the geochemical evolution of waste rock at various scales is mineral surface area this provides further indication that reactions within the high surface area matrix material exert significant influence on the geochemical evolution of waste rock 6 4 secondary mineral control the geochemical characterization of the type iii test pile conducted by bailey et al 2016 and sinclair et al 2015 included an analysis of the influences of secondary minerals on pore water concentrations of fe al ca and so4 the results of the reactive transport simulation indicated secondary mineral precipitation exerted control on solute concentrations thus confirming the importance of including secondary minerals when characterizing the geochemical evolution of waste rock using scale up approaches the precipitation of secondary fe minerals fe oh 3 and kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 occurred throughout the test pile for the duration of the simulation with kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 lagging three years behind fe oh 3 simulated fe oh 3 started precipitating in 2006 kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 did not precipitate until part way through 2009 iron oxy hydroxide precipitation generally occurred throughout the flow season in the shallower portions of the test pile dissolution occurred in the test pile beginning in 2010 approximately corresponding with periods of higher temperature and higher rates of sulfide oxidation this observation is consistent with the sinclair et al 2015 hypothesis that fe oh 3 could be acting as a ph control within the system the dominance of fe oh 3 precipitation over dissolution in the simulations especially from 2007 to 2009 indicates fe oh 3 is also acting as a control on fe concentrations in pore water and may have contributed to the underestimation of peak fe concentrations and daily mass flux jarosite precipitation in the simulations occurred in 2010 2012 following a pattern of early season precipitation and later season dissolution indicating its influence as a temporary delay mechanism in release of fe and so4 and its bimodal influence on ph moderation the precipitation dissolution cycle of kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 in the test pile simulations is consistent with the behavior of kfe3 so4 2 oh 6 in the intermediate scale simulations the simulation results indicated caso4 2h2o precipitation occurred within the test pile exerting only temporary control on ca concentrations as proposed by sinclair et al 2015 gypsum precipitation and dissolution also occurred in the simulations primarily in the mid to upper portions of the test pile 9 m depth during all years of the simulation sinclair et al 2015 proposed the precipitation of al secondary minerals including al oh 3 as an initial control on al concentrations in pore water becoming a secondary source of al as the capacity of calcite to consume h is exhausted the results of the simulations indicated al oh 3 precipitated throughout the pile during all years of the simulation but did not dissolve at any point the simulation indicated the primary influence of al oh 3 on the test pile system from 2008 to 2012 was as a control on the release of al to pore water amorphous si precipitated in the simulated test pile domain for the duration of the simulation period exerting a control on si effluent concentrations 6 5 acid neutralization the trend of decreasing ph and alkalinity at the type iii test pile experiment during the 2008 2012 period was indicative of decreased calcite availability and complete depletion of calcite by 2010 sinclair et al 2015 the simulation results indicated the mass of calcite was sufficient to consume much of the h produced by sulfide oxidation resulting in a simulated ph remained elevated compared to the measured results indicating the calcite mineral content may have been overestimated the reduction of calcite content in the calibrated simulation resulted in simulated ph consistent with measured ph the simulation of the geochemical evolution of the test pile illustrated the acid neutralization sequence within the pile fig 12 an acid neutralization sequence that starts with calcite dissolution has been observed in the type iii test pile bailey et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 following calcite exhaustion a sequence of limited al oh 3 dissolution that progressed to fe oh 3 dissolution as the primary acid neutralization phase likely occurred bailey et al 2015 sinclair et al 2015 the calibrated model results indicate the simulated neutralization sequence is consistent with this hypothesis the calcite content of the matrix material was exhausted within the simulation by early 2009 subsequent acid neutralization was dominated by fe oh 3 dissolution particularly when sulfide mineral oxidation rates were at their peak in the mid flow season limited al oh 3 dissolution occurred in the calibrated simulation the carbonate mineral dolomite was present within the simulated system and contributed to acid neutralization throughout the simulation period at all depths of the test pile domain however because the rate of dolomite dissolution was approximately one order of magnitude lower than for calcite dissolution the influence of dolomite in the acid neutralization sequence may be of secondary importance 6 6 implications of simulation results for forecasting the simulations documented here comprise the third part of a series to investigate the efficacy of using reactive transport models for forecasting the first part of the study involved calibration of the reactive transport model as implementation of a geochemical conceptual model developed for the humidity cell experiments wilson et al 2018a and the second part applied the reactive transport model to intermediate scale field experiments with simplified temperature and hydrological regimes wilson et al 2018b the results of the simulation documented in this paper indicate reasonable estimations of solute concentrations and mass loading can be obtained by applying this method to large field scale experiments that more closely approximate the physicochemical conditions in operational waste rock piles when compared to the measured results from the test pile experiment the simulated concentration and loading results are not always in close agreement however they are sufficiently accurate to provide appropriate guidance regarding the management of waste rock e g whether ph conditions will induce metal transport order of magnitude of metal concentrations the calibrated simulations show that model refinements provide a better fit to measured data providing confidence in the geochemical conceptual model but highlight the uncertainty and variability inherent in natural systems and waste rock systems in particular however given that these refinements cannot be anticipated a priori the need to account for this uncertainty in forecasting exercises is further highlighted consistent with the findings of bailey et al 2022 outstanding challenges remain to be addressed in future work with regard to the application of the proposed mechanistic scale up methodology these challenges include physical and geochemical based processes e g freezing water and its influence on the geochemical evolution of minerals sorption of metals effects of secondary mineral recrystallization and estimation of the uncertainties inherent in modelling a heterogeneous physical system with averaged parameters finally the study focused primarily on the comparison of simulation results with measured concentration and mass loading of metals and associated parameters at the effluent point of one of the test pile experiments in addition to this information the simulations from all three studies provided a large amount of information at a spatial and temporal density not possible using only measured results leading to a better understanding of the processes involved in mine waste weathering that is not possible using traditional scale up approaches waste mixing scenarios pile structure scenarios and the resulting geochemical changes over time could be investigated once a base case of waste rock weathering has been implemented the dynamic nature of the modelling approach not only provides a feasible forecasting tool but also creates opportunities to approach the management of mine wastes in a much more constrained and informative way 7 conclusions simulation of the geochemical evolution of the diavik waste rock through implementation of the integrated conceptual model provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of mechanistic forecasting techniques the measured data in this paper were only used for performance assessment and not to calibrate the model analysis of the flow portion of the simulation indicated some of the divergence in the simulation mass flux from the measured values can be attributed to simulated flow volume illustrating the importance of adequately representing the flow regime at the more complex larger scales implementing the integrated conceptual model at the large field scale as a forecasting tool resulted in good agreement between measured and simulated concentrations and daily mass flux of most parameters including so4 ni co zn al si ca k and alkalinity the concentration of fe was underestimated but mean values were consistent with those measured other parameters including cu and ph were not as well captured and required calibration to improve simulation fit the integrated conceptual model provided a reasonable assessment of type iii test pile weathering under a temporally and spatially dynamic temperature regime the mechanistic approach to forecasting documented here illustrates a detailed conceptual model implemented using a reactive transport model can provide a reasonable characterization of the geochemical evolution of a waste rock the central parameters of the integrated conceptual model including mineral surface area mineral content temperature and infiltration have been shown here to provide appropriate factors for the mechanistic simulation of the geochemical evolution of waste rock the reliance on a relatively limited number of easily measurable parameters suggests this approach could be implemented at other sites using appropriate site specific details a careful and comprehensive quantification of site mineralogy specifically sulfide acid neutralization and geochemically active host minerals physical parameters e g particle size distribution hydraulic conductivity infiltration and climatological parameters e g precipitation temperature are required to conduct mechanistic forecasting of this type the mechanistic scaling of the integrated conceptual model to facilitate assessment of the primary geochemical processes of waste rock weathering on a large scale has been shown in this study to provide results that are appropriate for decision making purposes however these results are specific to the study

1309,microplastics are emerging pollutants with sizes less than 5 mm and they are ubiquitous the occurrence of algal blooms has become a major problem affecting water quality in chaohu lake to understand the relationship between the microplastic distribution and algal bloom density from a macroscopic point of view in chaohu lake we collected microplastic samples from water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons and collected satellite remote sensing images of the algae density in recent years the research results showed that the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics were uneven and varied greatly the average abundances of microplastics in the water samples were 2133 1534 n m 3 in the dry season and 1679 1577 n m 3 in the wet season and the average abundance of microplastics in sediments was 308 231 n kg 1 the abundance of microplastics in the estuaries was higher than those in other locations and it was higher in the western part of the lake than in the eastern part the microplastics in water and sediments presented different sizes colors shapes and compositions the abundance distribution and migration of microplastics were mainly affected by population density rainfall runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction at a more macroscopic level the distribution of microplastics was similar to that of algal blooms tn and tp to some extent especially in the early stage of algal bloom outbreaks and the algal density was significantly positively correlated with the flux of microplastics into the lake microplastics as carriers of algae could promote the growth of algae blooms in the early stage while in the later stage microplastics and algal blooms could aggregate and coprecipitate through adsorption or adhesion and then inhibit the growth of algae graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics spatial and temporal distributions fluxes algal bloom chaohu lake 1 introduction at the end of the 19th century after the invention of plastics they brought great convenience to human life and were widely used however microplastics did not attract worldwide attention until the 21st century moore et al 2002 thompson et al 2004 researchers have continued to find microplastics in a variety of environmental media including food dikareva and simon 2019 cox et al 2019 rainieri et al 2018 obbard et al 2018 matsuguma et al 2017 dris et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 fok and cheung 2015 fossi et al 2014 rochman et al 2014 microplastics pose a great threat to the ecological environment and human health microplastics in water are easily ingested by organisms directly affecting the digestive and reproductive systems and even leading to death microplastics are carriers of organic pollutants heavy metals bacteria and viruses and the longer the time in water the higher the concentration of accumulated pops heavy metals and other chemical pollutants xu et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 lakes are the focus of microplastic research in terrestrial fresh water researchers have reported the distribution and abundance of microplastics in water and sediment in many lakes such as the great lakes of north america eriksen et al 2013 borsena lake of italy fischer et al 2016 salt lake of argentina alfonso et al 2020 naivasha lake of kenya migwi et al 2020 and many lakes in china such as poyang lake yuan et al 2019 taihu lake su et al 2016 dongting lake wang et al 2018 and qinghai lake xiong et al 2019 although the sampling methods and abundance expression methods were not exactly the same the abundance and distribution of microplastics in these lakes were closely related to population and human activities and the abundance of microplastics was higher in densely populated areas with frequent human activities research on microplastics gradually extended from size shape color composition and other physical indicators to the distribution mechanism migration patterns and biological interaction tien et al 2020 lin et al 2018 due to the variation in density and hydrodynamic force biological interactions microplastics float are resuspended and settle in water lebreton et al 2017 and they constantly interact with other factors in these processes including phagocytosis adsorption agglomeration and biofilm formation especially low density and tiny microplastics in water zhao et al 2018 alimi et al 2018 studies on microplastics in chaohu lake have not been reported thus far a large amount of literature has shown that chaohu lake has constantly experienced eutrophication cyanobacterial blooms with large areas often occur in the lake and the genera microcystis and anabaena of cyanophyta are the dominant cyanobacterial groups he 2019 wu et al 2019a 2019b xu 2012 wang 2010 from the 11th five year plan to the 13th five year plan the local government invested many financial resources to prevent and control algal blooms in chaohu lake the relationship between microplastics and algal blooms is a new research topic at present few in situ surveys or studies around the world have examined the correlation between microplastics and algal blooms both long long et al 2015 and lagarde lagarde et al 2016 found that microplastics could be adsorbed by microalgae and their extracellular polysaccharides which made the microplastics accumulate since microplastics are very light and easily float adsorbed microalgae float on the water surface which could promote the photosynthesis of microalgae besseling et al 2014 when the gathered community of microplastics and microalgae grew sufficiently heavy it could settle downward to the sediments bhattacharya et al 2010 the microalgae biofilms formed on the surfaces of floating microplastics experienced different growth rates among different seasons the thickened biofilms favored the deposition of microplastics and generally deposition more easily occurred in summer than in other seasons chen et al 2019 based on in situ surveys and remote sensing data this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of microplastics and algal blooms in chaohu lake using a multiparameter correlation analysis the relationship between the microplastic distribution and algal bloom development was obtained from a macroscopic point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the chaohu lake basin is located in the central part of anhui province fig 1 and is part of the yangtze river watershed the total area of the chaohu lake basin is 13 486 km2 and the area of chaohu lake is 769 6 km2 with an average water depth of 2 69 m the chaohu lake outlet is located at the far eastern end in conjunction with a sluice gate and the lake water moves from west to east nine rivers flow into chaohu lake the combined runoff of the hangbu river nanfei river and baishitan river accounts for 75 of the total water inflow into the lake and the annual runoff of the hangbu river alone is 1 923 billion m3 accounting for 55 1 of the total runoff the annual average rainfall over the chaohu lake region is 1021 mm and the dominant wind direction is southeast in this study 54 water samples and 25 sediment samples were collected on october 18 19 2019 dry season and june 23 25 2020 wet season fig 1 table a 1 in supplemental materials at each station 50 l of surface water depth 0 30 cm was collected using a stainless steel hydrophore and filtered on site onto a silk sieve hole size of mesh 45 μm meanwhile 1 kg of surface sediment was collected with a small portable shovel wu et al 2019a 2019b di and wang 2018 placed into a prepared bag with tin foil inside and brought back to the laboratory the water temperature dissolved oxygen do conductivity spc salinity ph and turbidity were measured on site 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 microplastic extraction and identification the microplastics in the water samples were pretreated through washing centrifugation filtration digestion and flotation in the laboratory noaa 2015 1 a silk sieve was first rinsed with a large amount of milli q water to ensure that the samples were transferred to a clean beaker 2 the sample was centrifuged at 1000 r min for 30 min carr et al 2016 pumped through a 45 μm filter membrane and placed in a constant temperature water bath at 60 c 3 100 ml 30 h2o2 was added for digestion for 24 36 h and 4 a 3 dilute hydrochloric acid solution was added to configure 1 5 g cm 3 zncl2 flotation solution tagg et al 2017 and the sample was floated 2 3 times pumped and filtered into the filter membrane the filter membrane with microplastics was placed into a box for cold storage the pretreatment steps applied to the sediment samples were more complex than those used for the water samples in addition to the pretreatment steps used for the water samples drying flotation and aeration steps had to be added when drying 51 g l 1 sodium hexametaphosphate was added to disperse the sediment samples during flotation and aeration the continuous flow microplastic separation flotation device developed by zhao zhao et al 2018 was used first scanning electron microscopy sem model supra55 was used to observe the shape of pretreated microplastics on each filter membrane then fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher model nicolet in10 was used to identify the composition of the microplastics hendrickson et al 2018 the parameters of ftir were as follows transmission mode wavelength range of 4000 675 cm 1 acquisition time of 3 s scanning 16 times and spectral resolution of 8 cm 1 omnic picta software was used to scan and compare with the omnic polymer spectral library and the samples with a spectral matching ratio of 70 were finally identified as the microplastic components the microplastic abundances in water samples were expressed in units of n m 3 namely number m 3 and the microplastic abundances in the sediments were expressed in units of n kg 1 dry weight of sediment 2 2 2 quality assurance and quality control during sampling and the experiment all instruments and equipment were washed three times with ultrapure water and all containers and tools were made of nonplastic materials the experimenter wore a 100 cotton lab coat and nonpolymer gloves during the entire process all open containers were covered or sealed with aluminum foil after use the laboratory windows were kept closed during the experiment recovery tests and blank control experiments were carried out during the experimental processes plastic microbeads of 100 300 μm were prepared in the laboratory 150 of which were added to 50 l of ultrapure water for the recovery test the experimental treatment of the blank control group was carried out in parallel with the sample treatment group experiment the recovery test results showed that the recovery rate was 85 indicating that the systematic error was acceptable for the blank control experiment 0 8 1 6 microplastics were found in each sample and these microplastics were fibrous in shape indicating that there was less microplastic pollution in the air this amount of fibrous microplastics needed to be subtracted from the results of each sample 2 2 3 remote sensing data processing the original remote sensing image data were preprocessed by orthographic correction radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction in envi 5 3 software he et al 2019 the water boundary of chaohu lake was trimmed based on google earth images in all the images the pink area in the red green blue rgb false color composite image indicated the distribution area of algal blooms and the normalized vegetation index method ndvi was used to extract the characteristic information of the algal blooms gu et al 2016 ndvi is often used to represent vegetation coverage the envi band operation tool was used to calculate the ndvi values and the calculation formula was as follows 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρnir denotes the near infrared band reflectance and ρr denotes the infrared band reflectance ndvi values ranged from 1 1 after repeated debugging the ndvi threshold range of 0 0 6 which could represent algal bloom information was determined then according to this threshold range pixels whose ndvi values were greater than the threshold were judged as the area of algal blooms and pixels whose ndvi values were less than the threshold were judged as general water areas sotille et al 2020 2 2 4 data analysis methods canoco 4 5 software was used to analyze the relationship between the abundance of microplastics mps and the density of algae the kriging interpolation tool and contour tool in arcgis were used to map the spatial distributions of microplastics in the surface water 2 3 fluxes from rivers to the lake the human development index hdi model is generally considered to explain the comprehensive impact of the regional population s education level economic prosperity and living standards on solid waste the provincial development level index pdi and regional development level index rdi were developed by sun 2018 mai et al 2020 collected a total of 80 measured values from 24 rivers in multiple countries

application and national earth system science data center the topographic map was derived from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection aster global digital elevation map gdem data and was derived from the v2 version of the geospatial data cloud platform of the computer network information center of the chinese academy of sciences the data sources of the water quality monitoring rainfall evaporation hydrology algal density economy and population are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of microplastics the abundance of microplastics in all water samples ranged from 333 n m 3 to 6250 n m 3 in the dry season and from 240 n m 3 to 4940 n m 3 in the wet season and the average abundances were 2133 1534 n m 3 in the dry season and 1679 1577 n m 3 in the wet season the abundance of microplastics in the sediments ranged from 60 n kg 1 to 1064 n kg 1 and the average abundance was 308 231 n kg 1 the average abundances of microplastics were much higher in the river water dry season 1700 n m 3 wet season 2740 n m 3 and estuaries dry season 3334 n m 3 wet season 2556 n m 3 than in the central part of the lake water dry season 1277 n m 3 wet season 360 n m 3 for the western part of the lake the microplastic average abundance 999 n m 3 in the dry season was lower than that 1080 n m 3 in the wet season while for the eastern part of the lake the microplastic average abundance 1805 n m 3 in the dry season was higher than that 1440 n m 3 in the wet season the detailed data are shown in table 2 as well as table a 2 and table a 3 in the supplemental materials the distribution of microplastic abundance is illustrated in fig 2 the microplastic abundance distribution of in chaohu lake was not uniform and varied with different sampling sites and different seasons which was not only affected by regional pollutant discharge but also related to the hydrological characteristics of the lake and wind direction chaohu lake is a relatively closed environmental system eerkes medrano et al 2015 the water storage capacity of chaohu lake in october 24 60 108 m3 was higher than that in june 21 06 108 m3 during the dry season the hydrologic conditions of the lake were relatively stable the flow rate was lower and microplastics easily remained in the central area and eastern part of the lake during the wet season with the increase in water inflow into the lake it was necessary to open the floodgate to discharge water and the abundance of microplastics in the western part of the lake 1080 n m 3 was lower than that 1440 n m 3 in the eastern lake according to the annual wind direction data recorded at the laoshan meteorological observation station the largest wind speed in chaohu lake occurred over the center of the lake followed by over the southern eastern and western parts of the lake the dominant wind direction in summer was southeast while the dominant wind direction in winter was northeast frère et al 2017 yin et al 2012 influenced by wind direction and speed the microplastic abundance of the surface water near the north shore of the lake was higher than that near the south shore of the lake the distribution of microplastics in sediments was affected by the water depth water flow direction and water velocity within chaohu lake zhou 2005 the microplastic abundance in the sediments was higher in the estuary and near the northeastern shore of the lake and lower in the central part of the lake the reason was that microplastics tended to sink due to the decrease in hydrodynamic force in estuaries in the process of water moving from the west to the east due to the blockage from the sluice the water speed decreased resulting in more microplastics settling downward in the sediments in the eastern part of the lake the central area of the lake was further away from the estuaries and thus fewer microplastics were transported to the center part of the lake compared with other lakes in china the sequence of microplastic abundance in water was poyang lake 5000 34 000 n m 3 yuan et al 2019 taihu lake 3400 25 800 n m 3 su et al 2016 honghu lake 1250 4650 n m 3 wang et al 2018 chaohu lake 1679 2133 n m 3 this study dongting lake 900 2800 n m 3 wang et al 2018 the abundance of microplastics in the sediments of poyang lake and taihu lake ranged from 54 to 506 n kg 2 and 11 to 235 n kg 2 respectively in chiusi lake of italy the microplastic abundance ranged from 0 82 to 4 42 n m 3 in the water and from 205 to 266 n kg 2 in the sediments fischer et al 2016 the microplastic abundance in the water of lake ontario was 800 n m3 grbic et al 2020 the microplastic abundance in the water in oxbow lake of nigeria was 201 8369 n m3 wet season and 1004 8329 n m3 dry season and the abundance in the sediments was 507 7593 n kg 2 the wet season and 347 4031 n kg dry season oni et al 2020 in summary the average microplastic abundance in both water and sediment in chaohu lake was generally at a medium level 3 2 size color shape and composition of the microplastics the representative photographs of microplastics under the microscope and their shape under sem are shown in fig 3 the size color shape and main composition of all microplastics are illustrated in fig 4 the size of all microplastics ranged from 47 36 μm to 4989 97 μm of which microplastics less than 1 mm accounted for 59 6 among the microplastics with a particle size less than 1 mm 400 550 μm accounted for 18 27 and 100 μm accounted for 5 11 the colors of all microplastics included transparent black blue gray and red the shape of microplastics presented various forms such as fibrous flake granular and thin films the average proportion of fibrous microplastics in the water of the estuary was higher than that in other areas of the lake while the average proportion of fibrous microplastics in the sediments of the estuary was lower than that in other areas of the lake under scanning electron microscopy sem the surface of the sheet microplastics was relatively smooth without dents or biofilms but the surface of the film and fiber microplastics was quite undulating most of the fibrous microplastics came from domestic sewage and washing wastewater kelly et al 2019 plastic debris mainly came from residential plastic products such as plastic bottles plastic toys etc and plastic woven bags used in river dikes the thin film microplastics mainly came from plastic bags food packaging bags and plastic films in addition small amounts of resin particles and foamed ps microplastics were found in the paihe river and the sluice gate of the lake which were derived from some industrial materials and fishery farming the composition of microplastics included polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe styrene acrylonitrile san pp pe copolymers polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps cellophane cellulose nylon and polyacrylonitrile pan pet accounted for the highest proportion of microplastics followed by pe pp and cellophane comparing the composition of microplastics in the water with that in the sediments the higher density microplastics such as ps pvc nylon and cellophane were more abundant in the sediments because they tended to deposit on the bottom of the lake and mixed with sediments under stable hydrological conditions while the lighter density microplastics tended to float in the surface water and were easily disturbed by water flow the existence of different compositions of microplastics in the lake was closely related to social and economic development and human activities in the chaohu lake basin over the past decade the population increased nearly 200 and the gdp increased two fold a large number of plastic factories located near the river around chaohu lake were the main source of microplastics and fisheries and shipping activities were also sources of microplastics therefore a dense population a developed economy and frequent human activities were the main causes of microplastic pollution in chaohu lake 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of algal blooms observed by remote sensing the algae in the water samples in this study were identified under a microscope in the lab and microcystis belonging to cyanophyta was found fig 5 satellite data were used to analyze the distribution and change in algae in the chaohu lake water from the results of image interpretation algal blooms began to occur in march 2019 when an algal bloom area of 5 14 km2 was found and the first peak appeared in june with an algal bloom area of 163 14 km2 after june the algal bloom area remained relatively stable until september followed by the appearance of a second peak in october with an algal bloom area of 197 km2 fig 6 in december due to the drop in temperature the distribution area of algal blooms decreased to 36 19 km2 in short algal blooms mainly occurred in summer and autumn algal blooms began to germinate in march and the distribution area of algal blooms rapidly increased from may to october and then declined in winter the location of algal blooms is mainly distributed in the northwestern part of the lake 3 4 estimation of microplastic fluxes into chaohu lake the rdi model was used to calculate the microplastic flux into the lake the demographic and economic data used in the model were from the statistical yearbook of the chaohu lake area 2016 2019 and the runoff data of major tributaries of chaohu lake basin were from the anhui provincial water resources department http slt ah gov cn the values of parameters a and b were 1 83 and 1 12 respectively mai et al 2020 and swg and p were 1 2 and 11 respectively kaza et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 hoornweg and bhada tata 2012 the estimated microplastics fluxes into the lake ranged from 98 52 t a 1 to 111 36 t a 1 and the annual average microplastics fluxes into the lake was 105 57 t a 1 table a 4 in the supplemental materials the order of magnitude of average microplastics fluxes was similar to other rivers mai et al 2020 based on the algal density data monthly microplastic fluxes into the lake from april to october from 2016 to 2019 were calculated table a 4 and table a 5 in the supplemental materials 3 5 statistical analysis of microplastic fluxes and algal blooms as shown in fig 7 and table a 6 in the supplemental materials the microplastic fluxes into the lake and the distribution area of algal blooms were consistent with the rainfall water temperature and chlorophyll a concentration from april to october 2019 and the distribution area of algal blooms declined at the end of october wang 2010 canoco 4 5 was used to conduct a correlation analysis between the microplastics flux into the lake and the algal density obtained at the different stages fig 8 table a 5 in the supplemental materials the adjusted r2 value obtained between the microplastic fluxes and algal density during the germination stage april to june of the algal blooms was 0 79 indicating a relatively significant positive correlation in the late stage july to october of the algal blooms the adjusted r2 value obtained between the microplastic fluxes and the algal density was 0 47 indicating a negative correlation in terms of the above positive correlation and negative correlation an analysis and discussion were made as follows the floating effect of microplastics as carriers could make algal blooms conduct photosynthesis better in the early growth stage of algae and might promote the growth and outbreak of algal blooms which was consistent with the conclusion that the microplastic fluxes into the lake were significantly positively correlated with the density of algae during the later stage of algae growth with the extracellular polysaccharides of algae thickened the adsorption of microplastics and algae was enhanced and the aggregation between microplastics and algae could help settle downward sediments thus inhibiting the growth of algae which was consistent with the conclusion that the microplastics fluxes into the lake were negatively correlated with the density of algae 3 6 macroscopic comparison between microplastics and algal blooms based on the data of the microplastic distribution in the water in this study and water quality monitoring data provided by the water bureau the contours of microplastic abundance total phosphorus tp concentration and total nitrogen tn concentration were drawn fig 9 and the similar areas of spatial distribution were circled by blue lines according to the macroscopic comparison shown in fig 9 the high value areas of microplastic abundance tn concentration and algal bloom density in the water were mainly distributed in the estuary of the nanfei river in the northwest shore of chaohu lake in the dry season fig 9 a c e and g and tp concentration and microplastic abundance were consistent in the central area fig 9 a and c with the increase in water quantity in the wet season the high value area of each item shifted to the east and outlet of the lake fig 9 b d f and h the microplastic abundance and tn and tp concentrations decreased in the central area of the lake fig 9 b d and f the distribution range of algal blooms expanded to the central and eastern parts of the lake and the microplastic abundance was consistent with the distribution of the tn concentration at the outlet of the lake fig 9 b and f the reasons for the distribution differences in different seasons were likely related to the runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction 3 7 mechanisms of interaction between microplastics and algal blooms the experimental results obtained by long et al 2015 showed that diatoms excrete high quantities of sticky transparent polymer particles teps and rhodomonas salina also excrete some teps lagarde et al 2016 observed the growth of freshwater microalgae chlamydomas reinhardtii by changing the size and concentration of the microplastics pp and hdpe and the results showed that microplastics with high concentrations and sizes greater than 400 μm did not directly affect the growth of microalgae in a short period of time with the lapse of time the flake of low density 0 91 mg cm 3 pp aggregates with microalgae and their extracellular polysaccharides which increased the density of microplastics 1 2 mg cm 3 and resulted in the microplastics originally floating on the surface of water to migrate vertically to the sediment bhattacharya et al 2010 studied the effect of microplastics on algae photosynthesis by the physical adsorption of charged ps microbeads with freshwater algae the experimental results showed that the concentration of plastic microbeads was positively correlated with absorption and the plastic microbeads adsorbed on algae blocked the sunlight and the pores on the cell wall which inhibited photosynthesis besseling et al 2014 placed green algae scendesmus obliquus into water with 44 1100 mg l 1 microplastic ps for 72 h and found that the microplastic concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the chlorophyll a concentration chen et al 2019 conducted seasonal pp exposure experiments in the east lake of wuhan and the biofilms formed on floating microplastics presented different growth rates and algal compositions in different seasons which were closely related to temperature nutrient level and suspended solids in addition the biofilms promoted the settling of microplastics with a seasonal pattern easy to settle in summer not easy to settle in spring and winter cunha et al 2019 found that microalgae microcystis panniformis and scenedesmus sp excreted exopolymer substances eps to form aggregates with microplastics in summary the high density of microplastic particles or aggregation could inhibit the growth of algae and the physical properties of microplastics such as size and shape might affect the adsorption and migration between algae and microplastics through the analysis described above we obtained a certain understanding of the sources migration and fate of microplastics the microplastics total phosphorus and total nitrogen in chaohu lake all resulted from human activities they were released into rivers and then flowed into chaohu lake at the same time atmospheric pollutants containing some microplastics also settled to chaohu lake through dry and wet precipitation most microplastics in the lake were suspended on the water surface and a small number of microplastics settled downstream from the sediments under the conditions of high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations algae grew rapidly on the one hand some microplastics were adsorbed with algae on the other hand some microplastics were adsorbed and trapped by suspended particles such as silt and clay particles this adsorption and trapping made microplastics aggregate with algae and other solid particles the smaller aggregating bodies floated and migrated on the water surface while the larger aggregating bodies precipitated into the sediments the microplastics deposited in the sediments could be resuspended lin et al 2018 these processes affected the migration and distribution of microplastics in the water and sediments fig 10 4 conclusions the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in the water and sediments in chaohu lake was uneven and varied greatly the average abundance of microplastics was lower in the wet season than in the dry season higher in the estuary than in the lake higher in the western part of the lake than in the eastern part and higher in the northern shore of the lake than in the southern shore the abundance distribution and migration of microplastics were affected by population density rainfall runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction macroscopically the distribution of microplastics was similar to those of tn tp and algal blooms to some extent in the early stage of algal bloom outbreaks there was a significant positive correlation between algal density and microplastic flux into the lake and a negative correlation in the late stage microplastics as carriers of algae could promote the growth of algae blooms in the early stage while in the later stage microplastics and algal blooms could aggregate and coprecipitate through adsorption or adhesion and thus inhibit the growth of algae author statement it is well known that eutrophication of water bodies is the main cause of algal blooms and the role of microplastics in this process is of interest to the authors in this study based on a field investigation of microplastics in chaohu lake a large amount of water quality monitoring data dozens of remote sensing images and the correlational analysis between microplastics algal blooms and the water quality index we found that the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics were uneven and varied greatly additionally the distribution of microplastics was macroscopically similar to those of tn tp and algal blooms to some extent in the early stage of algal bloom outbreak there was a significant positive correlation between the algal density and microplastic flux into the lake and a negative correlation in the late stage microplastics might have promoted the outbreak of algal blooms in the early stage and inhibited them in the late stage our findings indicated that there was a degree of correlation between microplastics and algal blooms and the influence of microplastics should be considered when controlling algal blooms reducing microplastic emissions might inhibit the growth of algal blooms declaration of competing interest i am huatai liu an associate professor from the college of environment and ecology xiamen

1309,microplastics are emerging pollutants with sizes less than 5 mm and they are ubiquitous the occurrence of algal blooms has become a major problem affecting water quality in chaohu lake to understand the relationship between the microplastic distribution and algal bloom density from a macroscopic point of view in chaohu lake we collected microplastic samples from water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons and collected satellite remote sensing images of the algae density in recent years the research results showed that the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics were uneven and varied greatly the average abundances of microplastics in the water samples were 2133 1534 n m 3 in the dry season and 1679 1577 n m 3 in the wet season and the average abundance of microplastics in sediments was 308 231 n kg 1 the abundance of microplastics in the estuaries was higher than those in other locations and it was higher in the western part of the lake than in the eastern part the microplastics in water and sediments presented different sizes colors shapes and compositions the abundance distribution and migration of microplastics were mainly affected by population density rainfall runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction at a more macroscopic level the distribution of microplastics was similar to that of algal blooms tn and tp to some extent especially in the early stage of algal bloom outbreaks and the algal density was significantly positively correlated with the flux of microplastics into the lake microplastics as carriers of algae could promote the growth of algae blooms in the early stage while in the later stage microplastics and algal blooms could aggregate and coprecipitate through adsorption or adhesion and then inhibit the growth of algae graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microplastics spatial and temporal distributions fluxes algal bloom chaohu lake 1 introduction at the end of the 19th century after the invention of plastics they brought great convenience to human life and were widely used however microplastics did not attract worldwide attention until the 21st century moore et al 2002 thompson et al 2004 researchers have continued to find microplastics in a variety of environmental media including food dikareva and simon 2019 cox et al 2019 rainieri et al 2018 obbard et al 2018 matsuguma et al 2017 dris et al 2017 lusher et al 2015 fok and cheung 2015 fossi et al 2014 rochman et al 2014 microplastics pose a great threat to the ecological environment and human health microplastics in water are easily ingested by organisms directly affecting the digestive and reproductive systems and even leading to death microplastics are carriers of organic pollutants heavy metals bacteria and viruses and the longer the time in water the higher the concentration of accumulated pops heavy metals and other chemical pollutants xu et al 2018 rochman et al 2013 lakes are the focus of microplastic research in terrestrial fresh water researchers have reported the distribution and abundance of microplastics in water and sediment in many lakes such as the great lakes of north america eriksen et al 2013 borsena lake of italy fischer et al 2016 salt lake of argentina alfonso et al 2020 naivasha lake of kenya migwi et al 2020 and many lakes in china such as poyang lake yuan et al 2019 taihu lake su et al 2016 dongting lake wang et al 2018 and qinghai lake xiong et al 2019 although the sampling methods and abundance expression methods were not exactly the same the abundance and distribution of microplastics in these lakes were closely related to population and human activities and the abundance of microplastics was higher in densely populated areas with frequent human activities research on microplastics gradually extended from size shape color composition and other physical indicators to the distribution mechanism migration patterns and biological interaction tien et al 2020 lin et al 2018 due to the variation in density and hydrodynamic force biological interactions microplastics float are resuspended and settle in water lebreton et al 2017 and they constantly interact with other factors in these processes including phagocytosis adsorption agglomeration and biofilm formation especially low density and tiny microplastics in water zhao et al 2018 alimi et al 2018 studies on microplastics in chaohu lake have not been reported thus far a large amount of literature has shown that chaohu lake has constantly experienced eutrophication cyanobacterial blooms with large areas often occur in the lake and the genera microcystis and anabaena of cyanophyta are the dominant cyanobacterial groups he 2019 wu et al 2019a 2019b xu 2012 wang 2010 from the 11th five year plan to the 13th five year plan the local government invested many financial resources to prevent and control algal blooms in chaohu lake the relationship between microplastics and algal blooms is a new research topic at present few in situ surveys or studies around the world have examined the correlation between microplastics and algal blooms both long long et al 2015 and lagarde lagarde et al 2016 found that microplastics could be adsorbed by microalgae and their extracellular polysaccharides which made the microplastics accumulate since microplastics are very light and easily float adsorbed microalgae float on the water surface which could promote the photosynthesis of microalgae besseling et al 2014 when the gathered community of microplastics and microalgae grew sufficiently heavy it could settle downward to the sediments bhattacharya et al 2010 the microalgae biofilms formed on the surfaces of floating microplastics experienced different growth rates among different seasons the thickened biofilms favored the deposition of microplastics and generally deposition more easily occurred in summer than in other seasons chen et al 2019 based on in situ surveys and remote sensing data this study analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of microplastics and algal blooms in chaohu lake using a multiparameter correlation analysis the relationship between the microplastic distribution and algal bloom development was obtained from a macroscopic point of view 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the chaohu lake basin is located in the central part of anhui province fig 1 and is part of the yangtze river watershed the total area of the chaohu lake basin is 13 486 km2 and the area of chaohu lake is 769 6 km2 with an average water depth of 2 69 m the chaohu lake outlet is located at the far eastern end in conjunction with a sluice gate and the lake water moves from west to east nine rivers flow into chaohu lake the combined runoff of the hangbu river nanfei river and baishitan river accounts for 75 of the total water inflow into the lake and the annual runoff of the hangbu river alone is 1 923 billion m3 accounting for 55 1 of the total runoff the annual average rainfall over the chaohu lake region is 1021 mm and the dominant wind direction is southeast in this study 54 water samples and 25 sediment samples were collected on october 18 19 2019 dry season and june 23 25 2020 wet season fig 1 table a 1 in supplemental materials at each station 50 l of surface water depth 0 30 cm was collected using a stainless steel hydrophore and filtered on site onto a silk sieve hole size of mesh 45 μm meanwhile 1 kg of surface sediment was collected with a small portable shovel wu et al 2019a 2019b di and wang 2018 placed into a prepared bag with tin foil inside and brought back to the laboratory the water temperature dissolved oxygen do conductivity spc salinity ph and turbidity were measured on site 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 microplastic extraction and identification the microplastics in the water samples were pretreated through washing centrifugation filtration digestion and flotation in the laboratory noaa 2015 1 a silk sieve was first rinsed with a large amount of milli q water to ensure that the samples were transferred to a clean beaker 2 the sample was centrifuged at 1000 r min for 30 min carr et al 2016 pumped through a 45 μm filter membrane and placed in a constant temperature water bath at 60 c 3 100 ml 30 h2o2 was added for digestion for 24 36 h and 4 a 3 dilute hydrochloric acid solution was added to configure 1 5 g cm 3 zncl2 flotation solution tagg et al 2017 and the sample was floated 2 3 times pumped and filtered into the filter membrane the filter membrane with microplastics was placed into a box for cold storage the pretreatment steps applied to the sediment samples were more complex than those used for the water samples in addition to the pretreatment steps used for the water samples drying flotation and aeration steps had to be added when drying 51 g l 1 sodium hexametaphosphate was added to disperse the sediment samples during flotation and aeration the continuous flow microplastic separation flotation device developed by zhao zhao et al 2018 was used first scanning electron microscopy sem model supra55 was used to observe the shape of pretreated microplastics on each filter membrane then fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir thermo fisher model nicolet in10 was used to identify the composition of the microplastics hendrickson et al 2018 the parameters of ftir were as follows transmission mode wavelength range of 4000 675 cm 1 acquisition time of 3 s scanning 16 times and spectral resolution of 8 cm 1 omnic picta software was used to scan and compare with the omnic polymer spectral library and the samples with a spectral matching ratio of 70 were finally identified as the microplastic components the microplastic abundances in water samples were expressed in units of n m 3 namely number m 3 and the microplastic abundances in the sediments were expressed in units of n kg 1 dry weight of sediment 2 2 2 quality assurance and quality control during sampling and the experiment all instruments and equipment were washed three times with ultrapure water and all containers and tools were made of nonplastic materials the experimenter wore a 100 cotton lab coat and nonpolymer gloves during the entire process all open containers were covered or sealed with aluminum foil after use the laboratory windows were kept closed during the experiment recovery tests and blank control experiments were carried out during the experimental processes plastic microbeads of 100 300 μm were prepared in the laboratory 150 of which were added to 50 l of ultrapure water for the recovery test the experimental treatment of the blank control group was carried out in parallel with the sample treatment group experiment the recovery test results showed that the recovery rate was 85 indicating that the systematic error was acceptable for the blank control experiment 0 8 1 6 microplastics were found in each sample and these microplastics were fibrous in shape indicating that there was less microplastic pollution in the air this amount of fibrous microplastics needed to be subtracted from the results of each sample 2 2 3 remote sensing data processing the original remote sensing image data were preprocessed by orthographic correction radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction in envi 5 3 software he et al 2019 the water boundary of chaohu lake was trimmed based on google earth images in all the images the pink area in the red green blue rgb false color composite image indicated the distribution area of algal blooms and the normalized vegetation index method ndvi was used to extract the characteristic information of the algal blooms gu et al 2016 ndvi is often used to represent vegetation coverage the envi band operation tool was used to calculate the ndvi values and the calculation formula was as follows 1 ndvi ρ nir ρ r ρ nir ρ r where ρnir denotes the near infrared band reflectance and ρr denotes the infrared band reflectance ndvi values ranged from 1 1 after repeated debugging the ndvi threshold range of 0 0 6 which could represent algal bloom information was determined then according to this threshold range pixels whose ndvi values were greater than the threshold were judged as the area of algal blooms and pixels whose ndvi values were less than the threshold were judged as general water areas sotille et al 2020 2 2 4 data analysis methods canoco 4 5 software was used to analyze the relationship between the abundance of microplastics mps and the density of algae the kriging interpolation tool and contour tool in arcgis were used to map the spatial distributions of microplastics in the surface water 2 3 fluxes from rivers to the lake the human development index hdi model is generally considered to explain the comprehensive impact of the regional population s education level economic prosperity and living standards on solid waste the provincial development level index pdi and regional development level index rdi were developed by sun 2018 mai et al 2020 collected a total of 80 measured values from 24 rivers in multiple countries

application and national earth system science data center the topographic map was derived from the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection aster global digital elevation map gdem data and was derived from the v2 version of the geospatial data cloud platform of the computer network information center of the chinese academy of sciences the data sources of the water quality monitoring rainfall evaporation hydrology algal density economy and population are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 abundance of microplastics the abundance of microplastics in all water samples ranged from 333 n m 3 to 6250 n m 3 in the dry season and from 240 n m 3 to 4940 n m 3 in the wet season and the average abundances were 2133 1534 n m 3 in the dry season and 1679 1577 n m 3 in the wet season the abundance of microplastics in the sediments ranged from 60 n kg 1 to 1064 n kg 1 and the average abundance was 308 231 n kg 1 the average abundances of microplastics were much higher in the river water dry season 1700 n m 3 wet season 2740 n m 3 and estuaries dry season 3334 n m 3 wet season 2556 n m 3 than in the central part of the lake water dry season 1277 n m 3 wet season 360 n m 3 for the western part of the lake the microplastic average abundance 999 n m 3 in the dry season was lower than that 1080 n m 3 in the wet season while for the eastern part of the lake the microplastic average abundance 1805 n m 3 in the dry season was higher than that 1440 n m 3 in the wet season the detailed data are shown in table 2 as well as table a 2 and table a 3 in the supplemental materials the distribution of microplastic abundance is illustrated in fig 2 the microplastic abundance distribution of in chaohu lake was not uniform and varied with different sampling sites and different seasons which was not only affected by regional pollutant discharge but also related to the hydrological characteristics of the lake and wind direction chaohu lake is a relatively closed environmental system eerkes medrano et al 2015 the water storage capacity of chaohu lake in october 24 60 108 m3 was higher than that in june 21 06 108 m3 during the dry season the hydrologic conditions of the lake were relatively stable the flow rate was lower and microplastics easily remained in the central area and eastern part of the lake during the wet season with the increase in water inflow into the lake it was necessary to open the floodgate to discharge water and the abundance of microplastics in the western part of the lake 1080 n m 3 was lower than that 1440 n m 3 in the eastern lake according to the annual wind direction data recorded at the laoshan meteorological observation station the largest wind speed in chaohu lake occurred over the center of the lake followed by over the southern eastern and western parts of the lake the dominant wind direction in summer was southeast while the dominant wind direction in winter was northeast frère et al 2017 yin et al 2012 influenced by wind direction and speed the microplastic abundance of the surface water near the north shore of the lake was higher than that near the south shore of the lake the distribution of microplastics in sediments was affected by the water depth water flow direction and water velocity within chaohu lake zhou 2005 the microplastic abundance in the sediments was higher in the estuary and near the northeastern shore of the lake and lower in the central part of the lake the reason was that microplastics tended to sink due to the decrease in hydrodynamic force in estuaries in the process of water moving from the west to the east due to the blockage from the sluice the water speed decreased resulting in more microplastics settling downward in the sediments in the eastern part of the lake the central area of the lake was further away from the estuaries and thus fewer microplastics were transported to the center part of the lake compared with other lakes in china the sequence of microplastic abundance in water was poyang lake 5000 34 000 n m 3 yuan et al 2019 taihu lake 3400 25 800 n m 3 su et al 2016 honghu lake 1250 4650 n m 3 wang et al 2018 chaohu lake 1679 2133 n m 3 this study dongting lake 900 2800 n m 3 wang et al 2018 the abundance of microplastics in the sediments of poyang lake and taihu lake ranged from 54 to 506 n kg 2 and 11 to 235 n kg 2 respectively in chiusi lake of italy the microplastic abundance ranged from 0 82 to 4 42 n m 3 in the water and from 205 to 266 n kg 2 in the sediments fischer et al 2016 the microplastic abundance in the water of lake ontario was 800 n m3 grbic et al 2020 the microplastic abundance in the water in oxbow lake of nigeria was 201 8369 n m3 wet season and 1004 8329 n m3 dry season and the abundance in the sediments was 507 7593 n kg 2 the wet season and 347 4031 n kg dry season oni et al 2020 in summary the average microplastic abundance in both water and sediment in chaohu lake was generally at a medium level 3 2 size color shape and composition of the microplastics the representative photographs of microplastics under the microscope and their shape under sem are shown in fig 3 the size color shape and main composition of all microplastics are illustrated in fig 4 the size of all microplastics ranged from 47 36 μm to 4989 97 μm of which microplastics less than 1 mm accounted for 59 6 among the microplastics with a particle size less than 1 mm 400 550 μm accounted for 18 27 and 100 μm accounted for 5 11 the colors of all microplastics included transparent black blue gray and red the shape of microplastics presented various forms such as fibrous flake granular and thin films the average proportion of fibrous microplastics in the water of the estuary was higher than that in other areas of the lake while the average proportion of fibrous microplastics in the sediments of the estuary was lower than that in other areas of the lake under scanning electron microscopy sem the surface of the sheet microplastics was relatively smooth without dents or biofilms but the surface of the film and fiber microplastics was quite undulating most of the fibrous microplastics came from domestic sewage and washing wastewater kelly et al 2019 plastic debris mainly came from residential plastic products such as plastic bottles plastic toys etc and plastic woven bags used in river dikes the thin film microplastics mainly came from plastic bags food packaging bags and plastic films in addition small amounts of resin particles and foamed ps microplastics were found in the paihe river and the sluice gate of the lake which were derived from some industrial materials and fishery farming the composition of microplastics included polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp polyethylene pe styrene acrylonitrile san pp pe copolymers polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene ps cellophane cellulose nylon and polyacrylonitrile pan pet accounted for the highest proportion of microplastics followed by pe pp and cellophane comparing the composition of microplastics in the water with that in the sediments the higher density microplastics such as ps pvc nylon and cellophane were more abundant in the sediments because they tended to deposit on the bottom of the lake and mixed with sediments under stable hydrological conditions while the lighter density microplastics tended to float in the surface water and were easily disturbed by water flow the existence of different compositions of microplastics in the lake was closely related to social and economic development and human activities in the chaohu lake basin over the past decade the population increased nearly 200 and the gdp increased two fold a large number of plastic factories located near the river around chaohu lake were the main source of microplastics and fisheries and shipping activities were also sources of microplastics therefore a dense population a developed economy and frequent human activities were the main causes of microplastic pollution in chaohu lake 3 3 spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of algal blooms observed by remote sensing the algae in the water samples in this study were identified under a microscope in the lab and microcystis belonging to cyanophyta was found fig 5 satellite data were used to analyze the distribution and change in algae in the chaohu lake water from the results of image interpretation algal blooms began to occur in march 2019 when an algal bloom area of 5 14 km2 was found and the first peak appeared in june with an algal bloom area of 163 14 km2 after june the algal bloom area remained relatively stable until september followed by the appearance of a second peak in october with an algal bloom area of 197 km2 fig 6 in december due to the drop in temperature the distribution area of algal blooms decreased to 36 19 km2 in short algal blooms mainly occurred in summer and autumn algal blooms began to germinate in march and the distribution area of algal blooms rapidly increased from may to october and then declined in winter the location of algal blooms is mainly distributed in the northwestern part of the lake 3 4 estimation of microplastic fluxes into chaohu lake the rdi model was used to calculate the microplastic flux into the lake the demographic and economic data used in the model were from the statistical yearbook of the chaohu lake area 2016 2019 and the runoff data of major tributaries of chaohu lake basin were from the anhui provincial water resources department http slt ah gov cn the values of parameters a and b were 1 83 and 1 12 respectively mai et al 2020 and swg and p were 1 2 and 11 respectively kaza et al 2018 jambeck et al 2015 hoornweg and bhada tata 2012 the estimated microplastics fluxes into the lake ranged from 98 52 t a 1 to 111 36 t a 1 and the annual average microplastics fluxes into the lake was 105 57 t a 1 table a 4 in the supplemental materials the order of magnitude of average microplastics fluxes was similar to other rivers mai et al 2020 based on the algal density data monthly microplastic fluxes into the lake from april to october from 2016 to 2019 were calculated table a 4 and table a 5 in the supplemental materials 3 5 statistical analysis of microplastic fluxes and algal blooms as shown in fig 7 and table a 6 in the supplemental materials the microplastic fluxes into the lake and the distribution area of algal blooms were consistent with the rainfall water temperature and chlorophyll a concentration from april to october 2019 and the distribution area of algal blooms declined at the end of october wang 2010 canoco 4 5 was used to conduct a correlation analysis between the microplastics flux into the lake and the algal density obtained at the different stages fig 8 table a 5 in the supplemental materials the adjusted r2 value obtained between the microplastic fluxes and algal density during the germination stage april to june of the algal blooms was 0 79 indicating a relatively significant positive correlation in the late stage july to october of the algal blooms the adjusted r2 value obtained between the microplastic fluxes and the algal density was 0 47 indicating a negative correlation in terms of the above positive correlation and negative correlation an analysis and discussion were made as follows the floating effect of microplastics as carriers could make algal blooms conduct photosynthesis better in the early growth stage of algae and might promote the growth and outbreak of algal blooms which was consistent with the conclusion that the microplastic fluxes into the lake were significantly positively correlated with the density of algae during the later stage of algae growth with the extracellular polysaccharides of algae thickened the adsorption of microplastics and algae was enhanced and the aggregation between microplastics and algae could help settle downward sediments thus inhibiting the growth of algae which was consistent with the conclusion that the microplastics fluxes into the lake were negatively correlated with the density of algae 3 6 macroscopic comparison between microplastics and algal blooms based on the data of the microplastic distribution in the water in this study and water quality monitoring data provided by the water bureau the contours of microplastic abundance total phosphorus tp concentration and total nitrogen tn concentration were drawn fig 9 and the similar areas of spatial distribution were circled by blue lines according to the macroscopic comparison shown in fig 9 the high value areas of microplastic abundance tn concentration and algal bloom density in the water were mainly distributed in the estuary of the nanfei river in the northwest shore of chaohu lake in the dry season fig 9 a c e and g and tp concentration and microplastic abundance were consistent in the central area fig 9 a and c with the increase in water quantity in the wet season the high value area of each item shifted to the east and outlet of the lake fig 9 b d f and h the microplastic abundance and tn and tp concentrations decreased in the central area of the lake fig 9 b d and f the distribution range of algal blooms expanded to the central and eastern parts of the lake and the microplastic abundance was consistent with the distribution of the tn concentration at the outlet of the lake fig 9 b and f the reasons for the distribution differences in different seasons were likely related to the runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction 3 7 mechanisms of interaction between microplastics and algal blooms the experimental results obtained by long et al 2015 showed that diatoms excrete high quantities of sticky transparent polymer particles teps and rhodomonas salina also excrete some teps lagarde et al 2016 observed the growth of freshwater microalgae chlamydomas reinhardtii by changing the size and concentration of the microplastics pp and hdpe and the results showed that microplastics with high concentrations and sizes greater than 400 μm did not directly affect the growth of microalgae in a short period of time with the lapse of time the flake of low density 0 91 mg cm 3 pp aggregates with microalgae and their extracellular polysaccharides which increased the density of microplastics 1 2 mg cm 3 and resulted in the microplastics originally floating on the surface of water to migrate vertically to the sediment bhattacharya et al 2010 studied the effect of microplastics on algae photosynthesis by the physical adsorption of charged ps microbeads with freshwater algae the experimental results showed that the concentration of plastic microbeads was positively correlated with absorption and the plastic microbeads adsorbed on algae blocked the sunlight and the pores on the cell wall which inhibited photosynthesis besseling et al 2014 placed green algae scendesmus obliquus into water with 44 1100 mg l 1 microplastic ps for 72 h and found that the microplastic concentration was significantly negatively correlated with the chlorophyll a concentration chen et al 2019 conducted seasonal pp exposure experiments in the east lake of wuhan and the biofilms formed on floating microplastics presented different growth rates and algal compositions in different seasons which were closely related to temperature nutrient level and suspended solids in addition the biofilms promoted the settling of microplastics with a seasonal pattern easy to settle in summer not easy to settle in spring and winter cunha et al 2019 found that microalgae microcystis panniformis and scenedesmus sp excreted exopolymer substances eps to form aggregates with microplastics in summary the high density of microplastic particles or aggregation could inhibit the growth of algae and the physical properties of microplastics such as size and shape might affect the adsorption and migration between algae and microplastics through the analysis described above we obtained a certain understanding of the sources migration and fate of microplastics the microplastics total phosphorus and total nitrogen in chaohu lake all resulted from human activities they were released into rivers and then flowed into chaohu lake at the same time atmospheric pollutants containing some microplastics also settled to chaohu lake through dry and wet precipitation most microplastics in the lake were suspended on the water surface and a small number of microplastics settled downstream from the sediments under the conditions of high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations algae grew rapidly on the one hand some microplastics were adsorbed with algae on the other hand some microplastics were adsorbed and trapped by suspended particles such as silt and clay particles this adsorption and trapping made microplastics aggregate with algae and other solid particles the smaller aggregating bodies floated and migrated on the water surface while the larger aggregating bodies precipitated into the sediments the microplastics deposited in the sediments could be resuspended lin et al 2018 these processes affected the migration and distribution of microplastics in the water and sediments fig 10 4 conclusions the spatial and temporal distribution of microplastics in the water and sediments in chaohu lake was uneven and varied greatly the average abundance of microplastics was lower in the wet season than in the dry season higher in the estuary than in the lake higher in the western part of the lake than in the eastern part and higher in the northern shore of the lake than in the southern shore the abundance distribution and migration of microplastics were affected by population density rainfall runoff hydrodynamic force and wind direction macroscopically the distribution of microplastics was similar to those of tn tp and algal blooms to some extent in the early stage of algal bloom outbreaks there was a significant positive correlation between algal density and microplastic flux into the lake and a negative correlation in the late stage microplastics as carriers of algae could promote the growth of algae blooms in the early stage while in the later stage microplastics and algal blooms could aggregate and coprecipitate through adsorption or adhesion and thus inhibit the growth of algae author statement it is well known that eutrophication of water bodies is the main cause of algal blooms and the role of microplastics in this process is of interest to the authors in this study based on a field investigation of microplastics in chaohu lake a large amount of water quality monitoring data dozens of remote sensing images and the correlational analysis between microplastics algal blooms and the water quality index we found that the spatial and temporal distributions of microplastics were uneven and varied greatly additionally the distribution of microplastics was macroscopically similar to those of tn tp and algal blooms to some extent in the early stage of algal bloom outbreak there was a significant positive correlation between the algal density and microplastic flux into the lake and a negative correlation in the late stage microplastics might have promoted the outbreak of algal blooms in the early stage and inhibited them in the late stage our findings indicated that there was a degree of correlation between microplastics and algal blooms and the influence of microplastics should be considered when controlling algal blooms reducing microplastic emissions might inhibit the growth of algal blooms declaration of competing interest i am huatai liu an associate professor from the college of environment and ecology xiamen
