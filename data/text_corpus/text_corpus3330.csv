16650,the vertical migrations of toxic and persistent short chain chlorinated paraffins sccps in soils as well as the microbial responses have been reported however there is a paucity of data on the resulting groundwater contamination here we determined the concentration and congener profile of sccps in the groundwater beneath a production plant of chlorinated paraffins cps and characterized the microbial community to explore their responses to sccps results showed that sccps ranged from not detected to 70 3 μg l with c13 cps 11 2 65 8 and cl7 cps 27 2 50 6 in mass ratio as the dominant groups similar to the distribution pattern in soils sccps in groundwater were distributed in hotspot pattern cp synthesis was the source of sccps in groundwater and the entire contamination plume significantly migrated downgradient while there was an apparent hysteresis of c13 cp migration groundwater microbial community was likely shaped by both hydrogeological condition ph and depth and sccps specifically the microbial community responded to the contamination by forming a co occurrence network with small world feature where desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were the keystone taxa furthermore the interrelations between bacterial taxa and sccps indicated that the microbial community might cooperate to achieve the dechlorination and mineralization of sccps through either anaerobic organohalide respiration mainly functioned by the keystone taxa or cometabolic degradation processes functioned by aquabacterium and hydrogenophaga results of this study would provide a better understanding of the environmental behavior and ecological effects of sccps in groundwater systems graphical

of the most concern because of their persistent organic pollutant pop like properties including recalcitrance wei et al 2016 carcinogenicity wang et al 2019d bioaccumulation jiang et al 2018 and potential for long distance transport through the long range atmospheric transport and global ocean currents li et al 2016 vorkamp et al 2019 wang et al 2013 sccps are toxic to mammals by inducing damage to the liver kidney and thyroid and parathyroid glands their presence in the environment may adversely affect the growth survival and reproduction of aquatic and terrestrial organisms despite that the underlying toxic mechanisms and specific dose response remain unclear wei et al 2016 we previously found that the composition and structure of the soil bacterial community were significantly influenced by sccps despite their lower contents compared to mccps and petroleum hydrocarbons phcs wu et al 2020 as a chemical category with large global consumption sccps are inevitably released into the environment during their life cycle including production usage and disposal thus sccps have been detected globally in various media including soil sediment dust air water sewage sludge animals plants and humans marvin et al 2003 přibylová et al 2006 štejnarová et al 2005 sun et al 2017 in particular as sccps are hydrophobic soils and sediments are considered to be important sinks several studies have identified the vertical migration of sccps in soils and sediments moeckel et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a while studies on the cp distributions in sediment water systems have reported a high portion of sccps in water pan et al 2021 the occurrence and behavior of sccps in groundwater related to soil contamination have rarely been reported organic contaminants in groundwater are usually more persistent and recalcitrant than in other environmental matrices peng et al 2014 because of the darkness reduced redox conditions and lower microbial activities in the aquifer postigo and barceló 2015 they may have the potential for long distance migration in the aquifer resulting in the enlargement of the contamination area therefore the investigation of sccp occurrence in groundwater is urgently needed on the other hand microbial communities dominate biogeochemical processes including c and n cycles and the attenuation of anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater thus the microbial community structure and function are important to groundwater quality and are mainly shaped by environmental selection yan et al 2020 however they are not always coupled with the environmental conditions because of the limited dispersal of microbial taxa or in contrast strong persistent dispersal depending on the hydrogeological conditions fillinger et al 2021 to date the microbial responses to the newly emerging sccp contaminants in groundwater remain unclear concerning these issues this study investigated the occurrence of sccps in the groundwater of a brownfield site that had been used for cp production furthermore the composition and diversity of the microbial communities in groundwater were studied to elucidate the microbial responses to contamination we conducted investigations to address the following hypotheses 1 sccps in groundwater follow a hotspot distribution pattern and migrate with groundwater flow and through particle bound transport resulting in the distinct migration patterns of different congener groups 2 the exposure to sccps together with the groundwater hydrogeological conditions shaped the microbial community results shed lights on the dispersion of sccps and microbial community changes in groundwater for the first time in this study overall the results of this study will promote our understanding of the environmental behaviors and ecological effects of sccps in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples were collected at a cp production plant brownfield site in the pearl river delta prd of south china this area was reported to be abundant in groundwater at a shallow water table peng et al 2014 hence there is a high risk of soil and groundwater co contamination the description and soil contamination profile of this site have been previously reported wu et al 2020 briefly the closed plant was involved in the production of commercial formula cp 42 and cp 52 for more than 20 years soils at this site were contaminated by sccps mccps and lccps with total contents ranging from not detected nd to 5090 ng g 1 6670 ng g 1 and 1450 ng g 1 dry weight dw respectively wu et al 2020 sixteen groundwater monitoring wells locations presented in fig 1 were established in june 2018 six months after the complete shutdown of the plant each monitoring well was constructed following astm 2004 according to the depth of phreatic aquifer ranging 6 4 13 7 m listed in table s1 of supporting information si water in the monitoring wells were filtered by the siliceous filter pack to remove coarse soil particles samples were collected using a peristaltic pump at an average water table of 2 7 m beneath the surface from the monitoring wells along the predominant downgradient groundwater flow path samples were stored at 0 4 c during transfer and were treated immediately after arriving at the laboratory a control well denoted as ck was selected at the upstream of this plant which may be less influenced by sccps 2 2 materials standard mixtures of sccps 51 5 cl 55 5 cl and 63 cl in cyclohexane were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 13c10 trans chlordane was purchased from cambridge isotop laboratory inc usa high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade organic solvents including n hexane hex dichloromethane dcm methanol and acetonitrile merck germany were used without pretreatment other chemicals were purchased from anpel chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 3 sccp detection sccps in the aquifer may present in the particulate or dissolved phases both of which are important for their transport as water samples were filtered through the siliceous filter pack in the monitoring wells they were not filtered in the laboratory to retain fine particles sccps in groundwater samples containing both particulate and dissolved phases were extracted with dcm by liquid liquid extraction method using 13c10 trans chlordane as surrogate following zhou et al 2020 the extract was concentrated dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and cleaned up with 8 g florisil using 42 ml dcm hex 15 85 and 52 ml dcm hex 1 1 in sequence the eluent was concentrated evaporated under mild nitrogen flow and then re dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile prior to detection the detection method was previously reported wu et al 2020 briefly an hplc with electron spray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer hplc esi qtof ms agilent 1290 6540 usa was introduced for sccp detection as described by zhou et al 2019 the method detection limit was 1 μg l the average recovery of surrogate was 89 ranging 76 107 instrumental parameters and quantification are detailed in si along with the analysis methods for other parameters including ph oxidation reduction potential orp and electronic conductivity ec as well as the contents of phcs distribution of sccps in groundwater was visualized by arcgis version 10 3 esri usa using inverse distance weighting model 2 4 characterization of microbial community water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters and the dna for each sample was extracted from the filter using the proteinase k cleavage method köchl et al 2005 each dna sample was amplified twice using the 515f 806r primer set with a sample specific 12 bp barcode sequence on 806r after amplification the samples in the electrophoresis gel were pooled and purified using an axyprepdna gel extraction kit axygen scientific inc usa the purified sample was sequenced via the illumina miseq sequencing platform the raw paired end sequences were trimmed using sickle software to remove low quality reads with a q value 20 at the 5 or 3 ends and trimmomatic software was used for quality control the flash software was then used to merge the trimmed paired end reads the obtained sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level and representative sequences were selected after removing putative chimeras edgar 2010 the taxonomy reads were assigned at an 80 identity level with the greengene and ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 the raw sequence data reported in this study are available in the ncbi sequence read archive bioproject prjna723805 alpha diversity was characterized based on a subset of randomly selected sequences from each sample to analyze the relationship between microbial community diversity and the studied environmental variables we conducted a redundancy analysis rda to determine the contributions of these selected variables to the variation in community composition the data were normalized via logarithmic or square root transformation before analysis to reduce heteroscedasticity the microbial association network was further established to explore the interrelations of bacterial genera using a previously described method wu et al 2020 briefly all robust correlations between each genera pair correlation coefficient r 0 6 p 0 05 spearman s test were identified by pairwise comparison of their abundance then a network was established with each node representing a genus and each edge indicating a robust correlation the igraph csardi and nepusz 2005 package in the r environment was used to calculate the topological parameters of the network including the number of nodes and edges network diameter average degree graph density average path length and clustering coefficient ten thousand erdöse réyni random networks were generated for comparison with the real network where each edge has the same probability of assignment to any node erdős and rényi 1960 a module is defined as the cluster of highly interconnected nodes banerjee et al 2018 which was calculated with igraph using group fast greedy keystone taxa were identified based on the degrees referred to as the number of connections for a particular node and centrality closenesses referred to as the average distance of a node to any other node high values of both parameters indicate the core position of the node in the network jiao et al 2020 the network was visualized using cytoscape v3 4 0 shannon et al 2003 3 results 3 1 sccp distribution in groundwater the sccp distribution in the groundwater of the cp production plant brownfield site is illustrated in fig 2a b sccps were detected surrounding the cp synthesis workshop the total sccp contents ranged from nd to 70 3 μg l with an average content of 9 1 μg l data detailed in table s1 their distribution in the groundwater is presented in a hotspot pattern in which the highest sccp content was detected in the sample from g6 this was the downgradient well of the cp synthesis workshop and the content gradually decreased in the surroundings despite the hotspot distribution pattern sccps were detected 100 m downstream of the workshop g3 besides the total sccp content we also analyzed the congener profile which can provide information on the sccp source and migration pattern based on the chloride and carbon atom numbers the congener profiles were examined for all samples with detected sccps as illustrated in fig 3 the sccp congener profiles varied among the samples generally the relative abundances of c13 cps and cl7 cps were the highest in all samples ranging from 11 2 to 65 8 in mass ratio and from 27 2 to 50 6 respectively table s2 the varied congener profiles in different samples also indicate distinct migration patterns of sccp congeners for example c13 cps the most abundant congener group seemed to be less migratable than the other groups as shown in fig 2c d the hotspot of c13 cps in groundwater was also downstream of the cp synthesis workshop g6 as the total sccps while there was an apparent hysteresis of c13 cps migration compared to the entire plume the weaker migration capacity of c13 cps was also confirmed by the congener profiles in different samples as shown in fig 2 monitoring wells g4 g6 g9 and g8 are along the flow direction in a sequence from upstream to downstream the relative abundance of c13 cps was 40 2 beneath the cp synthesis workshop g4 whereas that in the nearby downstream well g6 was 24 1 and successively decreased to 14 7 and 11 2 for g9 and g8 samples respectively fig 3 one would also notice the high relative abundance of c13 cps in g1 g2 and g3 samples the total sccp contents of these samples were rather low from 1 0 to 2 1 μg l at such low contents the responses of congeners with low carbon or chloride numbers might be underestimated by the mass yuan et al 2017 leading to the apparent high abundance of c13 congeners on the other hand the high relative abundance of c13 cps may suggest the particle bound transport of sccps in the aquifer 3 2 microbial community composition and diversity in groundwater the microbial communities in the groundwater were characterized totally 727 885 quality sequences with an average size range of 457 465 bp were generated from all groundwater samples the average number of sequences per sample was 45 493 ranging from 31 167 to 50 663 with 1 332 identified otus fig s1 shows the distinct microbial composition of each sample at the phylum and genus levels generally 11 22 phyla 47 82 genera were detected in each sample at the phylum level the microbial community of all samples was dominated by the surface heterotroph proteobacteria at the genus level the microbial community in ck was dominated by dechloromonas pseudogulbenkiania and vogesella whereas those in other samples were dominated by aquabacterium geobacter and ralstonia based on shannon s and simpson s indices table s3 the g2 sample which was slightly contaminated had the most diverse microbial community whereas the g6 sample which was the most contaminated sample had a moderate diversity degree similar to that of ck to understand the influence of environmental contamination on the diversity of the microbial community we further determined the phcs in each groundwater sample table s1 coexisting with sccps then rda and spearman s correlation analyzes were conducted to quantify the contributions of the contaminants and other environmental factors ph ec orp and depth table s1 to the variation in community composition the results showed that ph and depth significantly influenced the microbial composition fig s2 based on spearman s correlation analysis the contents of sccp congeners and phcs were significantly correlated with the abundance of several genera including dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga fig 4 which were reported to transform chlorinated organic contaminants cocs lambo and patel 2006a qiao et al 2018 3 3 microbial co occurrence pattern in groundwater the co occurrence network of the groundwater samples was established to better understand the interrelations of taxa in the microbial community fig 5 this network consisted of 71 nodes genera and 987 edges with a mean of 13 9 edges per node compared with a random network erdős and rényi 1960 this network presented higher mean degree clustering coefficiency and graph density but lower average path length table s4 indicating a more connected network structure with closer associations among taxa namely the small world feature barberán et al 2012 the nodes in the network were assigned to 10 phyla fig 5b with proteobacteria being the most abundant accounting for 69 0 of all nodes most correlations between nodes 580 987 represented by edges and all those within module 3 21 21 are positive fig 5b all correlations mentioned hereinbelow are significant with p 0 05 indicating commensalism or mutualistic relationships the remaining 407 edges represent negative correlations between nodes indicating competition and antagonism according to the degree and centrality closeness eight nodes representing desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were identified as the keystone taxa in the network they were clustered to form a keystone taxa guild except for syntrophobacter and syntrophorhabdus indicating their similarity in functioning or their cooperation to alter the structure or dynamics of the ecosystem that they thrived in banerjee et al 2018 these eight nodes were positively correlated fig 5b suggesting their commensalism or mutualistic relationships and spearman s correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the keystone taxa and sccp phc contents fig 4 suggesting similar responses of these taxa to sccps and phcs furthermore the distribution of the nodes was grouped into three modules fig 5a module 1 was the largest one containing 41 nodes and 509 edges including the keystone taxa most otus were proteobacteria fig 5b and were significantly correlated with sccp congeners and phcs fig 4 module 2 consisted of 23 nodes with 143 edges the abundances of most nodes were insignificantly correlated with sccp congeners or phcs while several taxa were negatively correlated with sccp congeners fig 4 module 3 consisted of 7 nodes with small otu sizes average 0 00012 and 21 edges all nodes were positively correlated fig 5b and were positively correlated with sccp congeners except for candidatus methylospira and methylobacter fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 hotspot distribution and transport of sccps in this study we reported the occurrence of sccps in the aquifer to compare with previous studies we listed the available information on sccp contents in other aqueous media including seawater natural water and wastewater table 1 while information on groundwater is not found in general the sccp content in natural waters i e surface and seawater was relatively low ranging from nd to 1978 ng l gao et al 2012 iino et al 2005 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2019a compared to the influent of sewage treatment plants stps the highest reported sccp content 4200 4700 ng l was from the influent of an stp receiving 20 industrial wastewater zeng et al 2011 and the contents usually decreased dramatically during the sewage treatment processes wang et al 2019a comparatively this study reported the highest sccp content in the hydrosphere this may be attributed to 1 the darkness reduced redox conditions and lower diversity of microbial communities in the groundwater postigo and barceló 2015 which hindered the natural attenuation process peng et al 2014 and 2 the direct reception of leaked cps during their synthesis by the aquifer previously we demonstrated that chronic cp leachate in the synthesis workshop was the source of soil sccp contamination wu et al 2020 similarly as supported by the predominance of c13 cps and cl7 cps in both soil and groundwater as well as the similar sccp congener profiles compared to that of cp 52 gao et al 2016 the main commercial products in the studied site the source of groundwater sccps was also the cp synthesis although cp leakage induced both soil and groundwater contaminations sccps in groundwater presented different distribution patterns from those in soils specifically the downstream migration of the entire contaminant plume from the synthesis workshop was significant leading to the different sccp hotspots in groundwater and soil the sccp hotspot in soils was located beneath the synthesis workshop g4 while that in groundwater was located downstream g6 moreover the contaminated area in groundwater was enlarged as sccps were detected 100 m downstream the workshop g3 fig 2a b these phenomena suggest that sccp migration in the aquifer should not be ignored especially in regions with shallow groundwater tables such as the prd area sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport at the same time the migration with groundwater flow was consistent with the fractionation effects of sccps that is the octanol water partition coefficients kow of organic compounds such as cps increase as the carbon chain length increases while the water solubility usually decreases bettina et al 2011 for example the congener profiles in the g4 soil samples table s2 were predominated by c13 cps at a higher abundance average 52 5 than in the groundwater samples 40 2 then the relative abundance of c13 cps decreased succesively from 40 2 g4 to 11 2 g8 along the flow direction fig 3 and table s2 this fractionation effects led to the hysteresis of c13 cps migration compared with other sccp groups fig 2c and table s2 on the other hand particle bound transport was also an important migration pathway for sccps contrast to the fractionation effects samples from downstream monitoring wells such as g1 g2 and g3 presented high relative abundances of c13 cps despite the possible overestimation by the instrument due to the low contents yuan et al 2017 this phenomenon also suggests that hydrophobic congeners might bind with fine particles in the groundwater and migrate with them this is consistent with previous reports that c10 11 cps usually predominated in dissolved phase while c12 13 cps predominated in particulate phase pan et al 2021 overall our results indicate that cp production is an important source of sccps in groundwater that induces severe contamination compared to other aqueous media and that sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport leading to the enlargement of the contamination area 4 2 microbial assemblages in sccp contaminated groundwater the composition and diversity of the soil microbial community are significantly influenced by sccps which were at lower content compared to mccps and phcs wu et al 2020 however unlike soils microbiomes in groundwater are affected by not only contaminants but also by the hydrogeological conditions the influence of the latter may be even more important in near surface groundwater as discovered in this study hydrodynamics including recharge events and flow regimes may induce the rapid changes of hydrogeological conditions that drive both stochastic and deterministic community assembly in aquatic habitats leading to high microbial heterogeneity in different monitoring wells yan et al 2020 this is consistent with the varied bacterial community compositions in different sampling sites of this study fig s1 in the groundwater with high flow velocity microbial organisms did not likely gain enough time to respond and adapt to extraneous compounds such as phcs and sccps therefore the apparent effects of environmental selection by contaminations might be overruled by those of the hydrogeological conditions the groundwater ecology is complicated and different from that of aerobic ecosystems such as shallow rivers and topsoils in addition to contamination the microbial community is sensitive to changes in groundwater chemistry such as ph dissolved oxygen content and the content and speciation of nutrient elements c n s p etc costeira et al 2019 fillinger et al 2021 němeček et al 2018 these hydrogeological parameters are usually related to depth and are likely selected for microbial taxa that outcompete the others in specific habitats thus in this study the extraneous taxa or the newly selected taxa by contamination would be less abundant owing to the higher cost of competition even though they might somehow respond to the contamination however their roles in the ecosystem functioning may not be negligible shade et al 2018 they are effective opportunists in response to environmental contamination and may provide corresponding functions in the ecosystem wang et al 2017 in this study the rda results fig s2 suggested that the composition and diversity of the whole bacterial community did not change significantly due to sccps or phcs rather they were more sensitive to changes in groundwater chemistry such as ph which are usually related to depth despite that several groups of bacterial taxa especially those in module 1 significantly responded to sccp and phc congeners fig 4 overall the distinct responses of microbial taxa to sccp and phc congeners fig 4 and the rda results fig s2 were consistent illustrating the combined effects of contaminants and hydrogeological conditions on the microbial community the abundance of bacterial taxa among groundwater samples can provide information on microbial composition and diversity however previous studies have revealed that ecosystem function may be more related to specific functional groups irrespective of their spatiotemporal abundance rather than the diversity of the entire community especially in stressed conditions such as contamination huang et al 2020 it is less appropriate to estimate the microbial metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination only through the entire microbial composition as it may not strongly correspond with the prediction of microbial functions sjöstedt et al 2018 to overcome the limitation of understanding environmental drivers for shaping the microbial community and functions in specific environments microbial interactions visualized by co occurrence network were proposed barberán et al 2012 in the microbial co occurrence network of the studied groundwater fig 5a eight positively correlated genera namely desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were identified as keystone taxa despite the relatively low abundances of these genera the high degrees and centrality closenesses indicated their core positions in the community and their similarity or cooperation in ecological functions banerjee et al 2018 these genera were all related to the dehalogenation and mineralization processes some of which were syntrophic among them desulfomonile and desulfobacca are anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfomonile is capable of anaerobic metabolic degradation of cocs by consuming hydrogen dolinová et al 2017 sulfur metabolism mediated by desulfobacca might be linked with phc and pah degraders as the so4 2 reduction could provide oxygen to the degraders and consumes hydrogen during the sulfur reduction daghio et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b which may be involved in the mineralization of cocs on the other hand previous studies identified ferritrophicum as the dominant genus in sulfur autotrophic reduction systems of perchlorate and nitrate wan et al 2019 wan et al 2017 suggesting a reduced capacity of cocs in the sulfur metabolism cycle as a methane oxidizing bacterium the cometabolic degradation of trichloroethylene by methylomonas has been reported via methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the transformation of methane to methanol shigematsu et al 1999 syntrophorhabdus and syntrophus genera have recently been reported to have potential for aromatic ring cleavage under anaerobic conditions by phylogenetic analysis of the beta oxidation step of bama sequences centurion et al 2018 delforno et al 2019 junghare et al 2019 moreover syntrophus was reported to degrade fluoro hydrocarbons mouttaki et al 2009 and achieve anaerobic mineralization of cocs with desulfomonile becker et al 2005 the other syntrophic genus syntrophobacter was previously reported as an indigenous microbe in oil reservoirs which converts propionate to acetate h2 and co2 during the overall degradation of organic matter its released products can serve as substrates for other taxa plugge et al 2012 wang et al 2019c in this network syntrophobacter may not be directly involved in coc degradation but may be an important hydrogen donor when mediating the degradation of phcs or other carbon sources such as natural organic matters thermoanaerobaculum is a thermophilic anaerobe that converts organic matters into volatile fatty acids similar to syntrophobacter the degradation of carbon sources mediated by thermoanaerobaculum may also be an important hydrogen donating process lienen et al 2017 interestingly spearman s correlation analysis fig 4 showed positive correlations between the relative abundance of the keystone taxa and sccp phc content this result suggests that sccps and phcs may be important drivers for the growth of the keystone taxa and in turn the keystone taxa may exploit sccps and phcs during the metabolism process leading to the degradation of both contaminants thus dechlorination and mineralization might be important functions in the microbial community of groundwater from the cp synthesis brownfield site this also supports the opinion that the entire microbial composition may not respond significantly to environmental contamination rather a specific microbial group with lower abundance may correspond more strongly to the metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination 4 3 modularity of the microbial community to further understand the metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination the modularity of a co occurrence network can provide information on microbial functions sjöstedt et al 2018 there were three modules in the microbial co occurrence network of this study fig 5a module 1 contained all keystone taxa and was mainly related to the biogeochemical cycles of c and n and many others besides the keystone taxa could achieve the dechlorination of cocs and mineralization of phcs for example aquabacterium the most abundant taxon in the network has been observed at sites contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons that have similar molecular structures to sccps guan et al 2013 it has also been reported as an oil degrading bacterium pham et al 2015 azospira a nitrogen fixer that was reported to completely dechlorinate and mineralize pentachlorophenol long et al 2018 was also abundant in this network two genera dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga were reported to transform cocs lambo and patel 2006b qiao et al 2018 despite the similar reported function dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga correlated negatively with each other fig 5b indicating their competition or antagonism moreover dehalogenimonas was positively correlated with the syntrophic syntrophorhabdus syntrophobacter and syntrophus and desulphurizing desulfomonile and desulfococcus groups all of which were positively correlated with the sccp congeners fig 4 conversely aquabacterium azospira and hydrogenophaga were negatively correlated with the syntrophic and desulphurizing groups fig 5b and sccp congeners fig 4 these results suggest two incompatible metabolic processes related to coc removal from the module the metabolism processes were then identified by further exploring the chloride removing mechanisms of the taxa involved first dehalogenimonas was reported as an organohalide respiring genus growing via coupling energy conservation to anaerobic respiration of cocs with hydrogen as an electron donor dolinová et al 2017 dehalogenimonas may form a syntrophic association with hydrogen generating donating genera such as syntrophus and syntrophobacter dolinová et al 2017 moreover as shown in the co occurrence network fig 5b dehalogenimonas was positively correlated with other hydrogen consuming groups such as desulfomonile and desulfococcus indicating that they shared similar habitat danilova et al 2016 conversely hydrogenophaga was reported to transform cocs via the cometabolic pathway which occurs as a by product during the metabolism of other growth substrates without any energy or carbon benefit lambo and patel 2006a similarly the biodegradation of cocs mediated by aquabacterium was reported to be linked to carbon uptake suggesting a cometabolic pathway which usually occurs in an aerobic condition wilson et al 2016 however these two taxa did not significantly relate to the orp fig 4 a parameter closely varying with oxygen content in water this might be attributed to the complicated hydrogeological conditions at field site thus two distinct processes in module 1 might be related to the process of dechlorination 1 anaerobic organohalide respiration conducted by syntrophic groups including hydrogen donating and consuming taxa which were dominated by the keystone taxa and might be promoted by the presence of sccps and 2 cometabolic degradation via other genera such as aquabacterium and hydrogenophaga might be suppressed by sccps as they were negatively correlated with sccps fig 4 these two dechlorination processes tended to occur individually as indicated by their negatively correlated abundance fig 5b module 2 was also related to the c and n cycles but was less related to the dechlorination or mineralization processes for example sediminibacterium has been found in phc contaminated groundwater and pah contaminated soil yet without reported hydrocarbon degradation potential chen et al 2019 poi et al 2018 similarly genera such as azospirillum candidatus methylomirabilis desulfotomaculum rubellimicrobium noviherbaspirillum and paracoccus were commonly related to c or n cycles with few reports on their potential for dechlorination or mineralization of contaminants moreover members of module 2 was insensitive to the presence of sccps or phcs but were sensitive to ph and depth fig 4 this might suggest that module 2 was related to the hydrogeological conditions overall members of module 2 were mainly involved in c and n metabolism irrespective of the contamination module 3 was involved in the electron transfer process this process usually occurs during a biological redox reaction in previous studies electron transfer was identified in the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfatiglans and desulfococcus and methane reducing oxidating bacteria candidatus methylospira methylocaldum and methylobacter bodrossy et al 1997 danilova et al 2016 gomes et al 2014 gutiérrez acosta et al 2014 li et al 2015 richter et al 2007 notably all nodes in module 3 were positively correlated with the nodes in module 1 that were involved in the anaerobic organohalide respiration process including dehalogenimonas ferritrophicum syntrophus thermoanaerobaculum and desulfomonile fig 5b nodes except for candidatus methylospira and methylobacter were also positively correlated with sccp congeners fig 4 these results suggested that the taxa of module 3 participated in the anaerobic organohalide respiration process by transferring electrons and their relative abundances were related to the contaminants a comparison of the properties and possible functions of the three modules further supported the idea that sccp and phc contaminations affected the microbial community structure and functions despite the effects of groundwater hydrogeological parameters a three year observation revealed that an indigenous microbial group usually occupies the core ecological niche in the groundwater owing to long term environmental selection yan et al 2020 the members of such a group survive and flourish because they are the most competitive under specific subsurface conditions meanwhile groundwater hydrodynamics and environmental changes such as the introduction of sccps and phcs would significantly influence microbial diversity by importing other taxa or promoting the growth of effective opportunists however their survival and colonization would not be a facile or rapid process as the entry of other taxa into the community requires a much higher cost of competition thus the observed diverse microbial composition across all samples fig s1 and the influence of contamination on the relative abundances of most members in modules 1 and 3 fig 4 were the comprehensive results of the environmental selection of both hydrogeological condition and sccp contamination to promote natural attenuation in this contaminated groundwater efforts should be made to facilitate the colonization and flourishing of opportunists with degradation potential 5 conclusion this study focused on the distribution of sccps in groundwater from a contaminated field and the response of bacterial community the hotspot of sccps were found downstream of the cp synthesis workshop while a hysteresis of c13 cp migration was observed the dominant sccp groups were c13 cps 11 2 65 8 and cl7 cps 27 2 50 6 which were similar to the cp 52 commercial product indiciating that leakage of cp products during synthesis was the main cause of groundwater contamination and that sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport the groundwater microbial community was likely shaped by both hydrogeological condition and sccps furthermore the groundwater microbial community responded to sccp contamination by developing a small world co occurrence pattern that led to the dechlorination and mineralization of sccps possibly through either anaerobic organohalide respiration or cometabolic degradation processes further studies should be conducted to understand the ecological risk of sccps and the health risks they pose to local people who consume groundwater declaration of competing

16650,the vertical migrations of toxic and persistent short chain chlorinated paraffins sccps in soils as well as the microbial responses have been reported however there is a paucity of data on the resulting groundwater contamination here we determined the concentration and congener profile of sccps in the groundwater beneath a production plant of chlorinated paraffins cps and characterized the microbial community to explore their responses to sccps results showed that sccps ranged from not detected to 70 3 μg l with c13 cps 11 2 65 8 and cl7 cps 27 2 50 6 in mass ratio as the dominant groups similar to the distribution pattern in soils sccps in groundwater were distributed in hotspot pattern cp synthesis was the source of sccps in groundwater and the entire contamination plume significantly migrated downgradient while there was an apparent hysteresis of c13 cp migration groundwater microbial community was likely shaped by both hydrogeological condition ph and depth and sccps specifically the microbial community responded to the contamination by forming a co occurrence network with small world feature where desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were the keystone taxa furthermore the interrelations between bacterial taxa and sccps indicated that the microbial community might cooperate to achieve the dechlorination and mineralization of sccps through either anaerobic organohalide respiration mainly functioned by the keystone taxa or cometabolic degradation processes functioned by aquabacterium and hydrogenophaga results of this study would provide a better understanding of the environmental behavior and ecological effects of sccps in groundwater systems graphical

of the most concern because of their persistent organic pollutant pop like properties including recalcitrance wei et al 2016 carcinogenicity wang et al 2019d bioaccumulation jiang et al 2018 and potential for long distance transport through the long range atmospheric transport and global ocean currents li et al 2016 vorkamp et al 2019 wang et al 2013 sccps are toxic to mammals by inducing damage to the liver kidney and thyroid and parathyroid glands their presence in the environment may adversely affect the growth survival and reproduction of aquatic and terrestrial organisms despite that the underlying toxic mechanisms and specific dose response remain unclear wei et al 2016 we previously found that the composition and structure of the soil bacterial community were significantly influenced by sccps despite their lower contents compared to mccps and petroleum hydrocarbons phcs wu et al 2020 as a chemical category with large global consumption sccps are inevitably released into the environment during their life cycle including production usage and disposal thus sccps have been detected globally in various media including soil sediment dust air water sewage sludge animals plants and humans marvin et al 2003 přibylová et al 2006 štejnarová et al 2005 sun et al 2017 in particular as sccps are hydrophobic soils and sediments are considered to be important sinks several studies have identified the vertical migration of sccps in soils and sediments moeckel et al 2020 zhao et al 2019a while studies on the cp distributions in sediment water systems have reported a high portion of sccps in water pan et al 2021 the occurrence and behavior of sccps in groundwater related to soil contamination have rarely been reported organic contaminants in groundwater are usually more persistent and recalcitrant than in other environmental matrices peng et al 2014 because of the darkness reduced redox conditions and lower microbial activities in the aquifer postigo and barceló 2015 they may have the potential for long distance migration in the aquifer resulting in the enlargement of the contamination area therefore the investigation of sccp occurrence in groundwater is urgently needed on the other hand microbial communities dominate biogeochemical processes including c and n cycles and the attenuation of anthropogenic contaminants in groundwater thus the microbial community structure and function are important to groundwater quality and are mainly shaped by environmental selection yan et al 2020 however they are not always coupled with the environmental conditions because of the limited dispersal of microbial taxa or in contrast strong persistent dispersal depending on the hydrogeological conditions fillinger et al 2021 to date the microbial responses to the newly emerging sccp contaminants in groundwater remain unclear concerning these issues this study investigated the occurrence of sccps in the groundwater of a brownfield site that had been used for cp production furthermore the composition and diversity of the microbial communities in groundwater were studied to elucidate the microbial responses to contamination we conducted investigations to address the following hypotheses 1 sccps in groundwater follow a hotspot distribution pattern and migrate with groundwater flow and through particle bound transport resulting in the distinct migration patterns of different congener groups 2 the exposure to sccps together with the groundwater hydrogeological conditions shaped the microbial community results shed lights on the dispersion of sccps and microbial community changes in groundwater for the first time in this study overall the results of this study will promote our understanding of the environmental behaviors and ecological effects of sccps in groundwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection samples were collected at a cp production plant brownfield site in the pearl river delta prd of south china this area was reported to be abundant in groundwater at a shallow water table peng et al 2014 hence there is a high risk of soil and groundwater co contamination the description and soil contamination profile of this site have been previously reported wu et al 2020 briefly the closed plant was involved in the production of commercial formula cp 42 and cp 52 for more than 20 years soils at this site were contaminated by sccps mccps and lccps with total contents ranging from not detected nd to 5090 ng g 1 6670 ng g 1 and 1450 ng g 1 dry weight dw respectively wu et al 2020 sixteen groundwater monitoring wells locations presented in fig 1 were established in june 2018 six months after the complete shutdown of the plant each monitoring well was constructed following astm 2004 according to the depth of phreatic aquifer ranging 6 4 13 7 m listed in table s1 of supporting information si water in the monitoring wells were filtered by the siliceous filter pack to remove coarse soil particles samples were collected using a peristaltic pump at an average water table of 2 7 m beneath the surface from the monitoring wells along the predominant downgradient groundwater flow path samples were stored at 0 4 c during transfer and were treated immediately after arriving at the laboratory a control well denoted as ck was selected at the upstream of this plant which may be less influenced by sccps 2 2 materials standard mixtures of sccps 51 5 cl 55 5 cl and 63 cl in cyclohexane were purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh germany 13c10 trans chlordane was purchased from cambridge isotop laboratory inc usa high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade organic solvents including n hexane hex dichloromethane dcm methanol and acetonitrile merck germany were used without pretreatment other chemicals were purchased from anpel chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china 2 3 sccp detection sccps in the aquifer may present in the particulate or dissolved phases both of which are important for their transport as water samples were filtered through the siliceous filter pack in the monitoring wells they were not filtered in the laboratory to retain fine particles sccps in groundwater samples containing both particulate and dissolved phases were extracted with dcm by liquid liquid extraction method using 13c10 trans chlordane as surrogate following zhou et al 2020 the extract was concentrated dehydrated with anhydrous sodium sulfate and cleaned up with 8 g florisil using 42 ml dcm hex 15 85 and 52 ml dcm hex 1 1 in sequence the eluent was concentrated evaporated under mild nitrogen flow and then re dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile prior to detection the detection method was previously reported wu et al 2020 briefly an hplc with electron spray ionization quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer hplc esi qtof ms agilent 1290 6540 usa was introduced for sccp detection as described by zhou et al 2019 the method detection limit was 1 μg l the average recovery of surrogate was 89 ranging 76 107 instrumental parameters and quantification are detailed in si along with the analysis methods for other parameters including ph oxidation reduction potential orp and electronic conductivity ec as well as the contents of phcs distribution of sccps in groundwater was visualized by arcgis version 10 3 esri usa using inverse distance weighting model 2 4 characterization of microbial community water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm millipore filters and the dna for each sample was extracted from the filter using the proteinase k cleavage method köchl et al 2005 each dna sample was amplified twice using the 515f 806r primer set with a sample specific 12 bp barcode sequence on 806r after amplification the samples in the electrophoresis gel were pooled and purified using an axyprepdna gel extraction kit axygen scientific inc usa the purified sample was sequenced via the illumina miseq sequencing platform the raw paired end sequences were trimmed using sickle software to remove low quality reads with a q value 20 at the 5 or 3 ends and trimmomatic software was used for quality control the flash software was then used to merge the trimmed paired end reads the obtained sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at a 97 similarity level and representative sequences were selected after removing putative chimeras edgar 2010 the taxonomy reads were assigned at an 80 identity level with the greengene and ribosomal database project classifier wang et al 2007 the raw sequence data reported in this study are available in the ncbi sequence read archive bioproject prjna723805 alpha diversity was characterized based on a subset of randomly selected sequences from each sample to analyze the relationship between microbial community diversity and the studied environmental variables we conducted a redundancy analysis rda to determine the contributions of these selected variables to the variation in community composition the data were normalized via logarithmic or square root transformation before analysis to reduce heteroscedasticity the microbial association network was further established to explore the interrelations of bacterial genera using a previously described method wu et al 2020 briefly all robust correlations between each genera pair correlation coefficient r 0 6 p 0 05 spearman s test were identified by pairwise comparison of their abundance then a network was established with each node representing a genus and each edge indicating a robust correlation the igraph csardi and nepusz 2005 package in the r environment was used to calculate the topological parameters of the network including the number of nodes and edges network diameter average degree graph density average path length and clustering coefficient ten thousand erdöse réyni random networks were generated for comparison with the real network where each edge has the same probability of assignment to any node erdős and rényi 1960 a module is defined as the cluster of highly interconnected nodes banerjee et al 2018 which was calculated with igraph using group fast greedy keystone taxa were identified based on the degrees referred to as the number of connections for a particular node and centrality closenesses referred to as the average distance of a node to any other node high values of both parameters indicate the core position of the node in the network jiao et al 2020 the network was visualized using cytoscape v3 4 0 shannon et al 2003 3 results 3 1 sccp distribution in groundwater the sccp distribution in the groundwater of the cp production plant brownfield site is illustrated in fig 2a b sccps were detected surrounding the cp synthesis workshop the total sccp contents ranged from nd to 70 3 μg l with an average content of 9 1 μg l data detailed in table s1 their distribution in the groundwater is presented in a hotspot pattern in which the highest sccp content was detected in the sample from g6 this was the downgradient well of the cp synthesis workshop and the content gradually decreased in the surroundings despite the hotspot distribution pattern sccps were detected 100 m downstream of the workshop g3 besides the total sccp content we also analyzed the congener profile which can provide information on the sccp source and migration pattern based on the chloride and carbon atom numbers the congener profiles were examined for all samples with detected sccps as illustrated in fig 3 the sccp congener profiles varied among the samples generally the relative abundances of c13 cps and cl7 cps were the highest in all samples ranging from 11 2 to 65 8 in mass ratio and from 27 2 to 50 6 respectively table s2 the varied congener profiles in different samples also indicate distinct migration patterns of sccp congeners for example c13 cps the most abundant congener group seemed to be less migratable than the other groups as shown in fig 2c d the hotspot of c13 cps in groundwater was also downstream of the cp synthesis workshop g6 as the total sccps while there was an apparent hysteresis of c13 cps migration compared to the entire plume the weaker migration capacity of c13 cps was also confirmed by the congener profiles in different samples as shown in fig 2 monitoring wells g4 g6 g9 and g8 are along the flow direction in a sequence from upstream to downstream the relative abundance of c13 cps was 40 2 beneath the cp synthesis workshop g4 whereas that in the nearby downstream well g6 was 24 1 and successively decreased to 14 7 and 11 2 for g9 and g8 samples respectively fig 3 one would also notice the high relative abundance of c13 cps in g1 g2 and g3 samples the total sccp contents of these samples were rather low from 1 0 to 2 1 μg l at such low contents the responses of congeners with low carbon or chloride numbers might be underestimated by the mass yuan et al 2017 leading to the apparent high abundance of c13 congeners on the other hand the high relative abundance of c13 cps may suggest the particle bound transport of sccps in the aquifer 3 2 microbial community composition and diversity in groundwater the microbial communities in the groundwater were characterized totally 727 885 quality sequences with an average size range of 457 465 bp were generated from all groundwater samples the average number of sequences per sample was 45 493 ranging from 31 167 to 50 663 with 1 332 identified otus fig s1 shows the distinct microbial composition of each sample at the phylum and genus levels generally 11 22 phyla 47 82 genera were detected in each sample at the phylum level the microbial community of all samples was dominated by the surface heterotroph proteobacteria at the genus level the microbial community in ck was dominated by dechloromonas pseudogulbenkiania and vogesella whereas those in other samples were dominated by aquabacterium geobacter and ralstonia based on shannon s and simpson s indices table s3 the g2 sample which was slightly contaminated had the most diverse microbial community whereas the g6 sample which was the most contaminated sample had a moderate diversity degree similar to that of ck to understand the influence of environmental contamination on the diversity of the microbial community we further determined the phcs in each groundwater sample table s1 coexisting with sccps then rda and spearman s correlation analyzes were conducted to quantify the contributions of the contaminants and other environmental factors ph ec orp and depth table s1 to the variation in community composition the results showed that ph and depth significantly influenced the microbial composition fig s2 based on spearman s correlation analysis the contents of sccp congeners and phcs were significantly correlated with the abundance of several genera including dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga fig 4 which were reported to transform chlorinated organic contaminants cocs lambo and patel 2006a qiao et al 2018 3 3 microbial co occurrence pattern in groundwater the co occurrence network of the groundwater samples was established to better understand the interrelations of taxa in the microbial community fig 5 this network consisted of 71 nodes genera and 987 edges with a mean of 13 9 edges per node compared with a random network erdős and rényi 1960 this network presented higher mean degree clustering coefficiency and graph density but lower average path length table s4 indicating a more connected network structure with closer associations among taxa namely the small world feature barberán et al 2012 the nodes in the network were assigned to 10 phyla fig 5b with proteobacteria being the most abundant accounting for 69 0 of all nodes most correlations between nodes 580 987 represented by edges and all those within module 3 21 21 are positive fig 5b all correlations mentioned hereinbelow are significant with p 0 05 indicating commensalism or mutualistic relationships the remaining 407 edges represent negative correlations between nodes indicating competition and antagonism according to the degree and centrality closeness eight nodes representing desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were identified as the keystone taxa in the network they were clustered to form a keystone taxa guild except for syntrophobacter and syntrophorhabdus indicating their similarity in functioning or their cooperation to alter the structure or dynamics of the ecosystem that they thrived in banerjee et al 2018 these eight nodes were positively correlated fig 5b suggesting their commensalism or mutualistic relationships and spearman s correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between the relative abundance of the keystone taxa and sccp phc contents fig 4 suggesting similar responses of these taxa to sccps and phcs furthermore the distribution of the nodes was grouped into three modules fig 5a module 1 was the largest one containing 41 nodes and 509 edges including the keystone taxa most otus were proteobacteria fig 5b and were significantly correlated with sccp congeners and phcs fig 4 module 2 consisted of 23 nodes with 143 edges the abundances of most nodes were insignificantly correlated with sccp congeners or phcs while several taxa were negatively correlated with sccp congeners fig 4 module 3 consisted of 7 nodes with small otu sizes average 0 00012 and 21 edges all nodes were positively correlated fig 5b and were positively correlated with sccp congeners except for candidatus methylospira and methylobacter fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 hotspot distribution and transport of sccps in this study we reported the occurrence of sccps in the aquifer to compare with previous studies we listed the available information on sccp contents in other aqueous media including seawater natural water and wastewater table 1 while information on groundwater is not found in general the sccp content in natural waters i e surface and seawater was relatively low ranging from nd to 1978 ng l gao et al 2012 iino et al 2005 wang et al 2019b zhao et al 2019a compared to the influent of sewage treatment plants stps the highest reported sccp content 4200 4700 ng l was from the influent of an stp receiving 20 industrial wastewater zeng et al 2011 and the contents usually decreased dramatically during the sewage treatment processes wang et al 2019a comparatively this study reported the highest sccp content in the hydrosphere this may be attributed to 1 the darkness reduced redox conditions and lower diversity of microbial communities in the groundwater postigo and barceló 2015 which hindered the natural attenuation process peng et al 2014 and 2 the direct reception of leaked cps during their synthesis by the aquifer previously we demonstrated that chronic cp leachate in the synthesis workshop was the source of soil sccp contamination wu et al 2020 similarly as supported by the predominance of c13 cps and cl7 cps in both soil and groundwater as well as the similar sccp congener profiles compared to that of cp 52 gao et al 2016 the main commercial products in the studied site the source of groundwater sccps was also the cp synthesis although cp leakage induced both soil and groundwater contaminations sccps in groundwater presented different distribution patterns from those in soils specifically the downstream migration of the entire contaminant plume from the synthesis workshop was significant leading to the different sccp hotspots in groundwater and soil the sccp hotspot in soils was located beneath the synthesis workshop g4 while that in groundwater was located downstream g6 moreover the contaminated area in groundwater was enlarged as sccps were detected 100 m downstream the workshop g3 fig 2a b these phenomena suggest that sccp migration in the aquifer should not be ignored especially in regions with shallow groundwater tables such as the prd area sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport at the same time the migration with groundwater flow was consistent with the fractionation effects of sccps that is the octanol water partition coefficients kow of organic compounds such as cps increase as the carbon chain length increases while the water solubility usually decreases bettina et al 2011 for example the congener profiles in the g4 soil samples table s2 were predominated by c13 cps at a higher abundance average 52 5 than in the groundwater samples 40 2 then the relative abundance of c13 cps decreased succesively from 40 2 g4 to 11 2 g8 along the flow direction fig 3 and table s2 this fractionation effects led to the hysteresis of c13 cps migration compared with other sccp groups fig 2c and table s2 on the other hand particle bound transport was also an important migration pathway for sccps contrast to the fractionation effects samples from downstream monitoring wells such as g1 g2 and g3 presented high relative abundances of c13 cps despite the possible overestimation by the instrument due to the low contents yuan et al 2017 this phenomenon also suggests that hydrophobic congeners might bind with fine particles in the groundwater and migrate with them this is consistent with previous reports that c10 11 cps usually predominated in dissolved phase while c12 13 cps predominated in particulate phase pan et al 2021 overall our results indicate that cp production is an important source of sccps in groundwater that induces severe contamination compared to other aqueous media and that sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport leading to the enlargement of the contamination area 4 2 microbial assemblages in sccp contaminated groundwater the composition and diversity of the soil microbial community are significantly influenced by sccps which were at lower content compared to mccps and phcs wu et al 2020 however unlike soils microbiomes in groundwater are affected by not only contaminants but also by the hydrogeological conditions the influence of the latter may be even more important in near surface groundwater as discovered in this study hydrodynamics including recharge events and flow regimes may induce the rapid changes of hydrogeological conditions that drive both stochastic and deterministic community assembly in aquatic habitats leading to high microbial heterogeneity in different monitoring wells yan et al 2020 this is consistent with the varied bacterial community compositions in different sampling sites of this study fig s1 in the groundwater with high flow velocity microbial organisms did not likely gain enough time to respond and adapt to extraneous compounds such as phcs and sccps therefore the apparent effects of environmental selection by contaminations might be overruled by those of the hydrogeological conditions the groundwater ecology is complicated and different from that of aerobic ecosystems such as shallow rivers and topsoils in addition to contamination the microbial community is sensitive to changes in groundwater chemistry such as ph dissolved oxygen content and the content and speciation of nutrient elements c n s p etc costeira et al 2019 fillinger et al 2021 němeček et al 2018 these hydrogeological parameters are usually related to depth and are likely selected for microbial taxa that outcompete the others in specific habitats thus in this study the extraneous taxa or the newly selected taxa by contamination would be less abundant owing to the higher cost of competition even though they might somehow respond to the contamination however their roles in the ecosystem functioning may not be negligible shade et al 2018 they are effective opportunists in response to environmental contamination and may provide corresponding functions in the ecosystem wang et al 2017 in this study the rda results fig s2 suggested that the composition and diversity of the whole bacterial community did not change significantly due to sccps or phcs rather they were more sensitive to changes in groundwater chemistry such as ph which are usually related to depth despite that several groups of bacterial taxa especially those in module 1 significantly responded to sccp and phc congeners fig 4 overall the distinct responses of microbial taxa to sccp and phc congeners fig 4 and the rda results fig s2 were consistent illustrating the combined effects of contaminants and hydrogeological conditions on the microbial community the abundance of bacterial taxa among groundwater samples can provide information on microbial composition and diversity however previous studies have revealed that ecosystem function may be more related to specific functional groups irrespective of their spatiotemporal abundance rather than the diversity of the entire community especially in stressed conditions such as contamination huang et al 2020 it is less appropriate to estimate the microbial metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination only through the entire microbial composition as it may not strongly correspond with the prediction of microbial functions sjöstedt et al 2018 to overcome the limitation of understanding environmental drivers for shaping the microbial community and functions in specific environments microbial interactions visualized by co occurrence network were proposed barberán et al 2012 in the microbial co occurrence network of the studied groundwater fig 5a eight positively correlated genera namely desulfobacca desulfomonile ferritrophicum methylomonas syntrophobacter syntrophorhabdus syntrophus and thermoanaerobaculum were identified as keystone taxa despite the relatively low abundances of these genera the high degrees and centrality closenesses indicated their core positions in the community and their similarity or cooperation in ecological functions banerjee et al 2018 these genera were all related to the dehalogenation and mineralization processes some of which were syntrophic among them desulfomonile and desulfobacca are anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb desulfomonile is capable of anaerobic metabolic degradation of cocs by consuming hydrogen dolinová et al 2017 sulfur metabolism mediated by desulfobacca might be linked with phc and pah degraders as the so4 2 reduction could provide oxygen to the degraders and consumes hydrogen during the sulfur reduction daghio et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b which may be involved in the mineralization of cocs on the other hand previous studies identified ferritrophicum as the dominant genus in sulfur autotrophic reduction systems of perchlorate and nitrate wan et al 2019 wan et al 2017 suggesting a reduced capacity of cocs in the sulfur metabolism cycle as a methane oxidizing bacterium the cometabolic degradation of trichloroethylene by methylomonas has been reported via methane monooxygenase which catalyzes the transformation of methane to methanol shigematsu et al 1999 syntrophorhabdus and syntrophus genera have recently been reported to have potential for aromatic ring cleavage under anaerobic conditions by phylogenetic analysis of the beta oxidation step of bama sequences centurion et al 2018 delforno et al 2019 junghare et al 2019 moreover syntrophus was reported to degrade fluoro hydrocarbons mouttaki et al 2009 and achieve anaerobic mineralization of cocs with desulfomonile becker et al 2005 the other syntrophic genus syntrophobacter was previously reported as an indigenous microbe in oil reservoirs which converts propionate to acetate h2 and co2 during the overall degradation of organic matter its released products can serve as substrates for other taxa plugge et al 2012 wang et al 2019c in this network syntrophobacter may not be directly involved in coc degradation but may be an important hydrogen donor when mediating the degradation of phcs or other carbon sources such as natural organic matters thermoanaerobaculum is a thermophilic anaerobe that converts organic matters into volatile fatty acids similar to syntrophobacter the degradation of carbon sources mediated by thermoanaerobaculum may also be an important hydrogen donating process lienen et al 2017 interestingly spearman s correlation analysis fig 4 showed positive correlations between the relative abundance of the keystone taxa and sccp phc content this result suggests that sccps and phcs may be important drivers for the growth of the keystone taxa and in turn the keystone taxa may exploit sccps and phcs during the metabolism process leading to the degradation of both contaminants thus dechlorination and mineralization might be important functions in the microbial community of groundwater from the cp synthesis brownfield site this also supports the opinion that the entire microbial composition may not respond significantly to environmental contamination rather a specific microbial group with lower abundance may correspond more strongly to the metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination 4 3 modularity of the microbial community to further understand the metabolism and biodegradation capability under environmental contamination the modularity of a co occurrence network can provide information on microbial functions sjöstedt et al 2018 there were three modules in the microbial co occurrence network of this study fig 5a module 1 contained all keystone taxa and was mainly related to the biogeochemical cycles of c and n and many others besides the keystone taxa could achieve the dechlorination of cocs and mineralization of phcs for example aquabacterium the most abundant taxon in the network has been observed at sites contaminated with chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons that have similar molecular structures to sccps guan et al 2013 it has also been reported as an oil degrading bacterium pham et al 2015 azospira a nitrogen fixer that was reported to completely dechlorinate and mineralize pentachlorophenol long et al 2018 was also abundant in this network two genera dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga were reported to transform cocs lambo and patel 2006b qiao et al 2018 despite the similar reported function dehalogenimonas and hydrogenophaga correlated negatively with each other fig 5b indicating their competition or antagonism moreover dehalogenimonas was positively correlated with the syntrophic syntrophorhabdus syntrophobacter and syntrophus and desulphurizing desulfomonile and desulfococcus groups all of which were positively correlated with the sccp congeners fig 4 conversely aquabacterium azospira and hydrogenophaga were negatively correlated with the syntrophic and desulphurizing groups fig 5b and sccp congeners fig 4 these results suggest two incompatible metabolic processes related to coc removal from the module the metabolism processes were then identified by further exploring the chloride removing mechanisms of the taxa involved first dehalogenimonas was reported as an organohalide respiring genus growing via coupling energy conservation to anaerobic respiration of cocs with hydrogen as an electron donor dolinová et al 2017 dehalogenimonas may form a syntrophic association with hydrogen generating donating genera such as syntrophus and syntrophobacter dolinová et al 2017 moreover as shown in the co occurrence network fig 5b dehalogenimonas was positively correlated with other hydrogen consuming groups such as desulfomonile and desulfococcus indicating that they shared similar habitat danilova et al 2016 conversely hydrogenophaga was reported to transform cocs via the cometabolic pathway which occurs as a by product during the metabolism of other growth substrates without any energy or carbon benefit lambo and patel 2006a similarly the biodegradation of cocs mediated by aquabacterium was reported to be linked to carbon uptake suggesting a cometabolic pathway which usually occurs in an aerobic condition wilson et al 2016 however these two taxa did not significantly relate to the orp fig 4 a parameter closely varying with oxygen content in water this might be attributed to the complicated hydrogeological conditions at field site thus two distinct processes in module 1 might be related to the process of dechlorination 1 anaerobic organohalide respiration conducted by syntrophic groups including hydrogen donating and consuming taxa which were dominated by the keystone taxa and might be promoted by the presence of sccps and 2 cometabolic degradation via other genera such as aquabacterium and hydrogenophaga might be suppressed by sccps as they were negatively correlated with sccps fig 4 these two dechlorination processes tended to occur individually as indicated by their negatively correlated abundance fig 5b module 2 was also related to the c and n cycles but was less related to the dechlorination or mineralization processes for example sediminibacterium has been found in phc contaminated groundwater and pah contaminated soil yet without reported hydrocarbon degradation potential chen et al 2019 poi et al 2018 similarly genera such as azospirillum candidatus methylomirabilis desulfotomaculum rubellimicrobium noviherbaspirillum and paracoccus were commonly related to c or n cycles with few reports on their potential for dechlorination or mineralization of contaminants moreover members of module 2 was insensitive to the presence of sccps or phcs but were sensitive to ph and depth fig 4 this might suggest that module 2 was related to the hydrogeological conditions overall members of module 2 were mainly involved in c and n metabolism irrespective of the contamination module 3 was involved in the electron transfer process this process usually occurs during a biological redox reaction in previous studies electron transfer was identified in the sulfate reducing bacteria desulfatiglans and desulfococcus and methane reducing oxidating bacteria candidatus methylospira methylocaldum and methylobacter bodrossy et al 1997 danilova et al 2016 gomes et al 2014 gutiérrez acosta et al 2014 li et al 2015 richter et al 2007 notably all nodes in module 3 were positively correlated with the nodes in module 1 that were involved in the anaerobic organohalide respiration process including dehalogenimonas ferritrophicum syntrophus thermoanaerobaculum and desulfomonile fig 5b nodes except for candidatus methylospira and methylobacter were also positively correlated with sccp congeners fig 4 these results suggested that the taxa of module 3 participated in the anaerobic organohalide respiration process by transferring electrons and their relative abundances were related to the contaminants a comparison of the properties and possible functions of the three modules further supported the idea that sccp and phc contaminations affected the microbial community structure and functions despite the effects of groundwater hydrogeological parameters a three year observation revealed that an indigenous microbial group usually occupies the core ecological niche in the groundwater owing to long term environmental selection yan et al 2020 the members of such a group survive and flourish because they are the most competitive under specific subsurface conditions meanwhile groundwater hydrodynamics and environmental changes such as the introduction of sccps and phcs would significantly influence microbial diversity by importing other taxa or promoting the growth of effective opportunists however their survival and colonization would not be a facile or rapid process as the entry of other taxa into the community requires a much higher cost of competition thus the observed diverse microbial composition across all samples fig s1 and the influence of contamination on the relative abundances of most members in modules 1 and 3 fig 4 were the comprehensive results of the environmental selection of both hydrogeological condition and sccp contamination to promote natural attenuation in this contaminated groundwater efforts should be made to facilitate the colonization and flourishing of opportunists with degradation potential 5 conclusion this study focused on the distribution of sccps in groundwater from a contaminated field and the response of bacterial community the hotspot of sccps were found downstream of the cp synthesis workshop while a hysteresis of c13 cp migration was observed the dominant sccp groups were c13 cps 11 2 65 8 and cl7 cps 27 2 50 6 which were similar to the cp 52 commercial product indiciating that leakage of cp products during synthesis was the main cause of groundwater contamination and that sccps in the aquifer may migrate with the groundwater flow and through the particle bound transport the groundwater microbial community was likely shaped by both hydrogeological condition and sccps furthermore the groundwater microbial community responded to sccp contamination by developing a small world co occurrence pattern that led to the dechlorination and mineralization of sccps possibly through either anaerobic organohalide respiration or cometabolic degradation processes further studies should be conducted to understand the ecological risk of sccps and the health risks they pose to local people who consume groundwater declaration of competing

16651,the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc integrates electrocoagulation ec and ozonation simultaneously in a single unit nevertheless the performance of the ec process is highly dependent on the polar connection configuration monopolar vs bipolar connection and the type of generated coagulants single coagulant vs dual coagulants in this study the removal efficiency of the e hoc process with different connection configurations and types of coagulants was assessed the e hoc process with bipolar connection be hoc exhibited higher removal efficiency for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent organic matter and ibuprofen ibp compared with the e hoc process with monopolar connection me hoc furthermore dual coagulant generation released from both al and fe electrodes in the be hoc process greatly improved the wwtp effluent organic matter and ibp removal efficiency lower energy consumption was observed for the be hoc process compared with the me hoc process it was found that ozonation promoted the polymerization reactions during coagulant hydrolyzis in the e hoc process compared with the me hoc process the be hoc configuration and dual coagulant mode further facilitated polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species formation thereby improving ozone catalytic and coagulation performance according to trapping experiments and epr analysis oh formation was enhanced in the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode in addition more active reaction sites of generated hydrolyzed coagulant species were observed with bipolar connection and in the dual coagulant

reactive oxygen species soc synergistic reactions between ozone and coagulants wwtp wastewater treatment plant xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is a water and wastewater treatment technology that produces metal coagulant in situ by electrochemically dissolving sacrificial electrodes submerged in contaminated water ingelsson et al 2020 ec has shown promise as an alternative treatment process to conventional chemical coagulation for certain drinking water heffron et al 2019 municipal bicudo et al 2021 and industrial wastewater ghahrchi et al 2021 treatment applications however the ec process does not effectively destroy some resistant pollutants ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 therefore the use of the ec process as a sole treatment process faces serious practical limitations especially when the wastewater is highly polluted al qodah et al 2020 ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 the performance of ec can be greatly enhanced by coupling it with other treatment processes previous studies have reported that ec can be synergistically coupled with other treatment processes including electrocoagulation ozonation processes electrocoagulation adsorption processes electrocoagulation ultrasound processes and electrocoagulation pulses processes al qodah et al 2020 carlos et al 2014 among these processes the integrated ozone assisted electrocoagulation technique has shown excellent organic matter removal efficiency for the treatment of textile wastewater bilińska et al 2019 mature landfill leachate ghahrchi and rezaee 2021 steel industry wastewater das et al 2021 greywater barzegar et al 2019 and municipal wastewater jin et al 2020b additionally our previous study has suggested that synergistic reactions between ozone and coagulants soc in the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc with al and stainless steel as anode and cathode respectively played a significant role in the removal of organic matter in addition to coagulation peroxone molecular ozone oxidation and oh oxidation from chain reactions during ozonation jin et al 2020b although the integrated ozone assisted electrocoagulation technique showed higher organic matter removal efficiency the systems applied in the previous studies were operated in monopolar connection mode ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 2021 jin et al 2020b which may limit the further improvement of the removal performance the electrode arrangement can have a substantial effect on the removal efficiency of the electrochemical processes abdessamad et al 2013 ghosh et al 2008 monopolar electrodes require an external electrical contact to the power supply and their two faces are active with the same polarity kobya et al 2011 however in the bipolar arrangement only the extreme electrodes are connected to the power source golder et al 2007 every electrode excluding the electrodes at the end acts as an anode on one side and cathode on the other side koparal and öğütveren 2002 fluoride ghosh et al 2008 and cr3 golder et al 2007 removal efficiency are higher under bipolar connections than under monopolar connections however the monopolar series electrode mode has a higher arsenic removal efficiency compared with bipolar electrodes in serial connections kobya et al 2011 abdessamad et al 2013 and asselin et al 2008 also indicated that higher organic matter removal performance can be achieved in bipolar electrode systems compared with monopolar electrode systems using either al or fe electrodes moreover bipolar arrangements show high energy saving potential ghosh et al 2008 and are easy to maintain in practical applications asselin et al 2008 nevertheless there is little comparative information available relating to the removal performance of the e hoc process with monopolar and bipolar electrodes for the treatment of wwtp effluent in addition differences in the hydrolyzed coagulant species generated in different electrode connection configurations also need to be characterized in the ec process electrochemical oxidation of a suitable anode material al and fe leads to the in situ formation of metal ions serving as coagulants heffron et al 2019 immediately after the generation of metal ions in the ec process a series of hydrolyzis reactions occur duan and gregory 2003 thereafter many hydrolyzed species including monomers oligomers and polymeric hydroxyl complexes for both al and fe coagulants can be generated from deprotonation and hydroxyl bridging duan and gregory 2003 yan et al 2008 however ozone can react with the hydrolyzed coagulant species to generate reactive oxygen species ros in the hoc process jin et al 2020a the hydrolyzis of metal coagulants in the e hoc process might be affected by the reactions between the ozone and metal coagulants nevertheless the effect of ozonation on the hydrolyzed species of electro generated coagulants needs to be further investigated furthermore previous studies have found that the use of fe and al as dual coagulants i e the combined use of different coagulants is superior for water treatment compared with the use of each coagulant alone cheng et al 2003 ma et al 2014 for the e hoc process the formation of dual coagulants can be achieved by simply using two different metal anodes fe and al at the same time generally characterizing the effects of generated dual coagulants on the removal efficiency of the e hoc process is of great practical significance the above findings indicated that the e hoc process can improve the organic matter removal efficiency compared with the ec process in addition higher removal efficiency can be obtained in ec with bipolar connection and dual coagulants mode than that with monopolar connection and single coagulant mode there is thus a need to combine the e hoc process with bipolar connection and dual coagulants mode to further enhance organic matter removal in this study the wwtp effluent organic matter and ibuprofen ibp removal efficiency for the e hoc process with different types of coagulants generated single coagulant and dual coagulants and different electrode arrangements monopolar and bipolar connections was studied ibp is a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and an emerging contaminant frequently detected in wwtp effluent and natural waters li et al 2014 the al and fe hydrolyzed species were also analyzed using the ferron assay and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms to better characterize the significance of polar types and connection configurations in the e hoc process moreover the underlying mechanism within the e hoc process was also elucidated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and experimental setup wwtp effluent collected from a secondary sedimentation tank in xi an china was used as the raw water the experiments were carried out in a rectangular batch reactor with dimensions of 10 7 12 cm length width height with effective volume of 500 ml fig 1 the experiments were conducted at different initial ph initial ph 5 7 and 9 the detailed information about the raw water quality experimental setup and operation condition is provided in text s1 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 dissolved organic matter doc and ibp analysis doc was measured by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer with infrared detection detection limit 50 μg l the doc analyzer was calibrated with potassium hydrogen phthalate standard solutions before each run all samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm filter acidified with h2so4 and purged with nitrogen to remove inorganic carbon before measurement all analyzes were performed in triplicate for doc measurements a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system was used to measure the concentration of ibp according to jin et al 2020b and detailed information is provided in text s2 2 2 2 al and fe species detection al and fe species distributions were analyzed through both the ferron colorimetric method and esi ms using a waters xevo tqd mass spectrometer detailed procedures can be seen in text s3 2 2 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr analysis

spectrometer germany was applied for epr experiments at room temperature specific operation parameters are provided in text s5 2 2 4 energy consumption and faradaic efficiency calculation the electrical energy per order e eo was calculated according to barazesh et al 2015 which is defined as the electrical energy in kwh required to reduce a contaminant concentration by 1 order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water the detailed calculation procedure is provided in text s6 faradaic efficiencies fe within the reaction systems was calculated according to ingelsson et al 2020 detailed information is provided in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of the e hoc process the removal performance of the ec and e hoc processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at initial ph of 5 7 and 9 was investigated fig 2 a ph variation in the different systems at different initial ph was shown in fig s1 fig 2a shows that both the ec and e hoc processes exhibited higher doc removal efficiency at initial ph 5 compared with initial ph 7 and 9 higher ph can lead to the formation of soluble al oh 4 or fe oh 4 ions duan and gregory 2003 which reduced the neutralization capacity of the generated coagulants thereby decreasing the doc removal efficiency generally the ec and e hoc with bipolar connection and dual coagulant generation model exhibited higher doc removal efficiency compared with the ec and e hoc with monopolar connection and single coagulant generation mode in addition e eo was calculated at different initial ph the results are shown in table s1 because of the addition of ozone higher energy consumption was observed for the e hoc processes in general table s1 for both the ec and e hoc processes the bipolar connection exhibited lower energy consumption compared with monopolar connection which is consistent with the results of ghosh et al 2008 in addition the e hoc processes with dual coagulants generation had lower energy consumption compared with the e hoc with single coagulant generation the removal performance of dissolved organic matter in the wwtp effluent was comparatively investigated for the different processes at different current densities 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 at initial ph 5 fig 2b which was the optimal initial ph in fig 2a the doc removal efficiency was higher for the ec processes with 10 ma cm2 current density than with current densities of 5 and 15 ma cm2 nevertheless the highest doc removal efficiency for the ec processes was less than 25 the current density is directly related to the efficiency of reactions occurring on the anode surface lacasa et al 2012 and faradaic efficiency fe of different processes with different current densities at initial ph 5 was calculated table s2 table s2 showed that lower fe can be obtained with the increase of current density in general which indicated increased passivation effects on the surface of electrodes at a current density of 15 ma cm2 the passivation of the electrodes became serious which resulted in lower doc removal efficiency at 15 ma cm2 this was consistent with the results of chen et al 2020 and dubrawski et al 2015 the processes with fe as anode exhibited lower fe according to table s2 ingelsson et al 2020 reported that low efficiencies are more frequently observed in fe ec than in al ec previous studies indicated that once a surface layer has formed electrochemically produced fe ii was trapped within the lattice of the surface layer which hindered the dissolved fe from diffusing to the bulk solution accelerating the surface layer buildup bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 in addition the lower removal efficiency at a current density of 15 ma cm2 may also be attributed to the water oxidation at the anode which inhibits the production of al3 and fe3 mouedhen et al 2008 previous studies also implied that higher current density can resulted in the charge reversal in the ec process at initial ph 5 harif et al 2012 jin et al 2020b which may also lead to the poor doc removal at higher current density the removal efficiency was higher for the ec processes with bipolar connection than with monopolar connection at different current densities and the concentrations of alt and fet in the treated water were similar for the ec processes with bipolar and monopolar connection at the same current density table s3 these results were consistent with those of hu et al 2016 showing that a larger solution electrode interface can be provided for electrochemical reactions in the bipolar ec process hu et al 2016 also suggested that al3 and oh can be generated from the bipolar electrode surface more homogeneously and can be fully arranged in bulk solution which is more favorable for al13 formation to enhance coagulation furthermore the bipolar ec processes had higher doc removal efficiency with dual coagulant generation than with single coagulant generation ma et al 2014 suggested that the positively charged hydrolyzates of fe can accelerate the cross linking and clustering of organic al complexes and al hydrolyzates in the case of ec with dual coagulants generation of the be al fe process the al and fe electrodes were placed close to the stainless steel anode and cathode respectively similarly in the be fe al process the fe and al electrodes were placed close to the stainless steel anode and cathode respectively according to fig 2b it can be seen that significantly higher doc removal efficiency was observed for the e hoc processes than for the ec processes at the same current densities furthermore as the current densities increased the doc removal efficiency improved and peaked at 31 38 35 69 43 67 46 86 53 44 and 56 89 at 10 ma cm2 in the me hoc al me hoc fe be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc al fe and be hoc fe al processes respectively compared with the e hoc process with monopolar electrodes me hoc the e hoc process with bipolar electrodes also exhibited higher removal efficiency at different densities fig 2b and the concentrations of alt and fet in treated water were similar for the me hoc and be hoc processes at the same current density table s4 with al electrodes the average doc removal efficiency was 6 03 12 29 and 3 39 higher for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process with current densities of 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 respectively moreover the results were similar when fe electrodes were used specifically the average doc removal efficiency was 5 70 11 17 and 3 70 higher for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process with current densities of 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 respectively in addition fe was higher with bipolar connection than corresponding monopolar configuration in general table s2 which was consistent with asselin et al 2008 although lower fe was obtained for me hoc and be hoc with fe electrodes table s2 the me hoc and be hoc processes achieved higher doc removal efficiency with fe electrodes than with al electrodes this can be ascribed to the higher hydrolyzis rate of generated fe species than that of generated al species wang et al 2013 in addition generated fe species possess a higher content of surface hydroxyl groups that can react with ozone compared with generated al species jin et al 2020a wang et al 2013 according to fig 2b it is the same with the ec processes that the generation of dual coagulants in the bipolar connection mode which are released from both the electrolysis of the al and fe electrodes can greatly improve the average doc removal efficiency under different densities in the be hoc process 3 2 hydrolyzed species analysis the generated hydrolyzed coagulant species can affect the removal performance of the ec processes hu et al 2016 and there are interactions between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species within the e hoc process jin et al 2020b to get more insight into the e hoc process the al fe species distributions were obtained through the al fe ferron method quantitatively in ultrapure water system without the interference of organic matter at initial ph 5 fig 3 the distributions of al fe species at 1 min at different initial ph are shown in fig s2 as shown in fig 3 as the reaction time increased the dominant al fe species transformed from monomer ala fea to medium polymers alb feb and subsequently to larger polymers or al oh s alc fec initially the monomer and medium polymer increased rapidly and reached a maximum at 1 min in all of the ec and e hoc processes at initial ph 5 and decreased as the reaction time increased the distributions of monomer and medium polymer were similar larger polymer increased throughout all the ec and e hoc processes fig 3 also revealed that the addition of ozone promoted al fe polymer formation in all of the e hoc processes furthermore compared with monopolar connection the generation of alb feb was increased in the ec and e hoc processes with bipolar electrodes fig 3 these results were consistent with those of hu et al 2016 showing that yields of alb species were higher for ec with bipolar connection than ec with monopolar connection additionally the formation of alb feb can also be enhanced in the dual coagulant generation mode according to fig 3 the content of alb has been reported to be correlated to the tridecamer al13o4 oh 24 7 often denoted as al13 duan and gregory 2003 yan et al 2008 al13 is considered a highly efficient polymeric aluminum species for coagulation not only because of its strong charge neutralization capacity lin et al 2008 but also its nucleation ability to form flocs with soluble organic matter to produce colloids and precipitates efficiently yan et al 2008 because of the advantages of al13 polycation in coagulation preformed al13 species have been applied as coagulants to enhance the removal performance of coagulation jin et al 2020b xu et al 2011 our previous study also found that preformed al13 exhibited higher catalytic ability for ozonation compared with in situ generated al species from alcl3 6h2o jin et al 2019 in this case the ec and e hoc with bipolar connections and the dual coagulant generation mode produced more alb feb therefore higher organic matter removal efficiency can be achieved according to fig 2 the generated al fe species of different processes at initial ph 7 and ph 9 through the ferron assay were also compared the results can be seen in fig s3 and fig s4 in general higher alb feb can also be obtained from bipolar connection and dual coagulant generation mode at initial ph 7 and 9 in addition the addition of ozone can also lead to the increased formation of al fe polymer in all the e hoc processes compared with alb feb generation at initial ph 7 and 9 higher alb feb can be formed at initial ph 5 which can lead to higher doc removal efficiency for the ec and e hoc process at initial ph 5 the effect of ozonation on electro generated al and fe hydrolyzis was further investigated by esi ms fig s5 s16 show the esi ms spectra of al and fe speciation according to the esi ms spectra fig s5 s10 the al species were classified into four categories small polymeric aluminum species al3 al5 median polymeric aluminum species al6 al10 large polymeric aluminum species al11 al21 and undetected part alu al oh 3 and al oh 4 zhao et al 2009a based on the esi ms spectra fig s11 s16 fe species can be divided into monomeric fe species fe1 dimeric fe species fe2 trimeric fe species fe3 tetrameric fe species fe4 and undetected part feu fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 hellman et al 2006 ma et al 2014 the distributions of al and fe species in the ec and e hoc processes at different initial ph are provided in table 1 and table 2 respectively as shown in table 1 in both the ec al and e hoc al processes the polymer al al11 al21 and the undetected part alu were greater with bipolar connection at different initial ph this may stem from the higher ph within the bipolar connection process for the same initial ph fig s1 which accelerates the hydrolyzis polymerization reaction ghosh et al 2008 also confirmed that the ph of the solution was higher for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection in the e hoc al process al3 produced by the electrolytic dissolution of the anode immediately undergoes spontaneous hydrolyzis reactions that form various monomeric species and subsequently aggregate into multiple polymeric species such as small and median polymeric al mouedhen et al 2008 al is usually present in the form of al3 and six water molecules are combined to produce al oh 6 octahedra in aqueous solution tang et al 2015 as the ph increases the six water molecules around al3 can gradually deprotonate and form a series of al oh compounds al oh compounds can then form a pair of octaeth structures by forming oh bridges baes and mesmer 1976 therefore hydrolyzis and polymerization processes were accelerated in the bipolar connection process because of the higher ph compared with monopolar connection esi ms was also applied to compare the hydrolyzis behaviors of electro generated al and fe in the be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes to provide further insight into the hydrolyzis of fe and al as dual coagulants fig s17 fig s18 and fig s19 the total ion count tic in the spectra of the be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes at different initial ph is shown in fig 4 at the same initial ph the tic value of al and fe in all the be hoc fe al or be hoc al fe process was less than the sum of the tic values of the be hoc al and be hoc fe processes fig 4 this finding was consistent with the result of ma et al 2014 which indicates that the coexistence of al and fe hydrolyzis can improve the precipitation of coagulants compared with fe or al alone thus dual coagulant generation confers a superior coagulation ability and provides a practical approach for controlling coagulant residues according to table 1 comparison of the ec al and e hoc al processes also revealed that the addition of ozone leads to a reduction in the proportion of medium polymer al6 al10 whereas the proportion of large polymer al11 al21 and the undetected part alu increase at different initial ph in general this indicates that the addition of ozone is beneficial to the formation of higher polymerized al species al11 al21 and alu the same pattern was also observed in the ec fe and e hoc fe processes according to table 2 the addition of ozone and bipolar connection led to increases in the higher polymeric fe species and the undetected part this also further suggested that ozonation and bipolar connection are beneficial to the formation of higher polymerized fe species it was proved that hydrolyzed al species and fe species can activate ozone to generate ros jin et al 2020a thus the hydrolyzed metal coagulant species might change during the reactions between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species as a result the increased generation of polymerized hydrolyzed species with the addition of ozone such as alb feb can further enhance the coagulation efficiency of the e hoc process 3 3 ros generation in the e hoc process the degradation of ibp during the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes is compared in fig 5 to characterize differences between the various e hoc processes at initial ph 5 which is the optimal initial ph for the e hoc process according to fig 2 ibp is one of the pharmaceutical compounds which exhibited low reactivity with ozone k o3 ibp 9 1 m 1s 1 but high reactivity with oh k oh ibp 7 4 109 m 1s 1 li et al 2014 in addition chemical coagulation and ec can hardly remove ibp jin et al 2020a therefore ibp was used as a model compound for the detection of ros in addition as presented in fig 5 ibp removal followed pseudo first order kinetics for all the e hoc processes the degradation rates of different processes are summarized in table 3 it can be observed that the degradation rate of ibp was significantly enhanced in the be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes k obs 0 3666 min 1 and 0 3737 min 1 respectively compared with the me hoc al me hoc fe be hoc al and be hoc fe processes k obs 0 2281 min 1 0 2661 min 1 0 3094 min 1 and 0 3209 min 1 respectively these results were consistent with the doc removal performance for the wwtp effluent using these e hoc processes fig 2 to further verify the generation of ros trapping experiments were conducted at initial ph 5 by adding excess isopropanol ipa catalase cat and p benzoquinone bq as oh h2o2 and o2 scavengers respectively before starting the e hoc experiments jin et al 2020a xiong et al 2018 the results are shown in fig s20 the degradation of ibp was inhibited in the presence of ipa cat and bq indicating that oh h2o2 and o2 were generated in all of the e hoc processes the degradation of ibp was largely inhibited by ipa and bq indicating that oh and o2 played a key role in the degradation of ibp typically o2 can transform into oh in aqueous solution eqs 1 2 li et al 2018 to quantitatively analyze the contribution of oh the proportion of oh oxidation was calculated by oh quenching experiments e hoc ipa and oh oxidation accounted for 87 64 88 80 90 59 91 77 94 11 and 94 35 contribution for the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes respectively which further indicated that ibp was mainly eliminated by oh oxidation it can be seen that the be hoc processes can significantly improve the formation of oh compared with the me hoc processes the amount of oh formed was also greater when dual coagulants were generated relative to when only fe or al coagulant was generated 1 o2 h h2o2 o2 2 h2o2 o2 h oh o2 h2o epr experiments were performed using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent in these e hoc processes to provide direct evidence for ros generation three different signals representing dmpo oh adducts marked with the circle symbol carbon centered radical adducts marked with arrow symbol and oxidized dmpo radicals marked with rectangle symbol are shown in fig 6 the oxidation of dmpo was featured by a three line spectrum feng et al 2016 xiong et al 2018 in addition the attack of carbon containing compounds by oh results in the appearance of carbon centered radical adducts with a six peak spectrum dong et al 2014 besides strong signals of the dmpo oh adduct with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were also detected tan et al 2018 in fig 6 the signal of dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 indicated the presence of oh in all of the e hoc processes which was consistent with the results of the quenching experiments fig 6 shows that the signal intensities of dmpo oh adduct were noticeably stronger in the be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes than in the me hoc and be hoc processes in both wwtp effluent and the ultrapure water system this result further confirmed that dual coagulant generation was more efficient for decomposing ozone to generate oh compared with single fe or al coagulant generation bing et al 2015 reported that the synergism of aluminum and iron onto fe2o3 al2o3 sba 15 enhanced the formation of ros compared with fe2o3 sba 15 al2o3 sba 15 and sba 15 and led to the highest reactivity indicating that the combination of both lewis sites of iron and aluminum improved the generation of ros ozone has also been reported to act as a lewis base that can replace the surface hydroxyls decompose on lewis acid sites and convert into ohads and o2 on fe2o3 as well as surface atomic oxygen species on al2o3 bing et al 2015 according to fig 6 the signal intensities of the be hoc processes were greater than those of the me hoc processes for dmpo oh adduct indicating that more oh was generated in the be hoc processes the greater surface area associated with bipolar connection compared with monopolar connection is conducive to anodic oxidation which contributed to the increase in the current flow in solution and the electrochemical dissolution rate on the anode mavré et al 2010 meanwhile the electrode corrosion is greater for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection under the same current density ghosh et al 2008 in addition it was also observed that the ph of the solution was higher for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection fig s1 the higher oh concentration obtained with the higher ph facilitated the initiation of the chain reactions for generating oh chen et al 2016 according to fig 6 the signals of oh in the wwtp effluent system were clearly stronger than those in the ultrapure water system which can be attributed to the overlapping of the dmpo ch3 and dmpo oh adducts based on fig 3 table 1 and table 2 greater numbers of polymerized hydrolyzed al fe species can be generated with bipolar connection and in the dual coagulant generation mode fig 6 further proved that higher catalytic ability for ozonation in the hoc process can be achieved with enhanced polymerized hydrolyzed species generation 3 4 proposed mechanism within the e hoc process to elucidate the mechanism within the e hoc process the proportions of hydrolyzed al fe species in the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes were verified to reveal the active reaction sites between hydrolyzed al fe species and ozone and quantitative analysis was carried out by xps fig s21 fig s22 as shown in fig s21 two overlapping bands associated with two different al 2p transitions with binding energies of 73 1 ev and 74 2 ev were observed which represented aliv and alvi respectively duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 as can be seen in fig s22 the fe 2p xps spectra were separated into two types of peaks after fitting which can be assigned to fe 2p3 2 710 720 ev and fe 2p1 2 720 735 ev respectively leveneur et al 2011 the characteristic xps spectra peaks for the different processes varied little the ratio of hydrolyzed al and fe species can be obtained after gaussian fitting using xps peak software fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the ratios of tetrahedral al decreased in the me hoc al be hoc al be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes compared with the relative ec processes by 6 25 9 14 12 14 and 10 33 respectively in addition the ratios of tetrahedral fe were also reduced in the me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes compared with the relative ec processes by 14 33 7 77 8 63 and 8 45 respectively the results indicated that tetrahedral al fe may be the key species reacting with o3 compared with octahedral sites previous studies have shown that surface tetrahedral sites are stronger lewis acid sites which are believed to be significant active sites in catalytic ozonation compared with surface al in octahedral sites bing et al 2017 sohlberg et al 1999 therefore the presence of o3 can improve the reaction with tetrahedral al fe and accelerate the generation of oh it can be observed that dual coagulant generation in the ec or e hoc process had more tetrahedral al fe which resulted in higher catalytic reactivity and enhanced oh formation compared with single coagulant generation meanwhile the ratio of tetrahedral al fe was greater in the bipolar pattern than in the monopolar pattern which indicated that the bipolar connection could also enhance catalytic performance additionally the o1s spectra of the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes are shown in fig 8 based on fig s23 the o1 s spectra show three fitted peaks at 530 7 ev lattice oxygen oα 531 5 ev surface hydroxyl group oβ and 532 4 ev adsorbed water oγ ding et al 2016 it can be found the addition of o3 reduced the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups oβ on hydrolyzed coagulants which was attributed to the reactions between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups therefore it can be implied the surface hydroxyl groups were the main active sites reacting with o3 for the generation of oh which is consistent with the results obtained by zhao et al 2015 compared with single coagulant generation dual coagulant generation had a higher surface hydroxyl group ratio which resulted in greater ros formation based on the results described above the reaction mechanism of the e hoc process was proposed fig 9 in the e hoc process al3 and or fe3 can be electro generated thereafter hydrolyzis of the generated metal ions occurred automatically through hydration to form hydroxyl groups duan and gregory 2003 fig 7 and fig 8 indicated that the reactions between hydrolyzed species and ozone within the e hoc process occurred on the surface hydroxyl groups because of the acidic condition of the aqueous solution ph 5 in this case the primary surface groups of the hydrolyzed species are the surface protonated hydroxyl groups zhao et al 2009b suggested that ozone can interact with the surface protonated hydroxyl groups on the catalysts driven by electrostatic force and or hydrogen bonding this interaction resulted in the enhanced formation of o3h o3 and oh eq 3 6 jin et al 2020a which improved the oxidation ability of the e hoc system furthermore the formation of surface oh groups can also be enhanced during the generation of ros eq 3 5 subsequently bonds between hydrolyzed metal species can be formed between oh and protonated oh oh2 leading to the formation of o3h2 bridges that can release h2o to generate oh bridges eq 7 yu et al 2016 as a result the presence of o3 can promote the formation of polymerized al fe species and the coagulation performance can be also improved for the e hoc process the e hoc process in bipolar and or dual coagulant generation mode further enhanced the formation of polymerized al fe species and thus improved the coagulation and catalytic ability within the e hoc process fig 9 3 al fe o2h o3 al fe o2 ho3 4 ho3 oh o2 5 al fe o2 o3 oh al fe oh o3 o2 6 o3 h ho3 oh o2 7 m oh m oh2 m o3h2 m m oh m h2o 4 conclusions the e hoc processes exhibited significantly higher wwtp effluent and ibp removal efficiency compared with ec processes at different current densities with different connection configurations monopolar and bipolar and types of coagulants single coagulant and dual coagulant comparison of the e hoc process with different connection configurations and types of coagulants for the treatment of wwtp effluent and ibp revealed that organic removal efficiency was higher for the be hoc process compared with the me hoc process energy consumption was lower for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process generally in addition doc and ibp removal were significantly enhanced in the be hoc process with dual coagulant generation released from both al and fe electrodes on the one hand the better removal performance of the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode can be ascribed to the enhanced generation of polymerized al fe species which improved both the coagulation and catalytic ability of the e hoc processes on the other hand a greater number of active reaction sites of generated hydrolyzed coagulant species was observed in the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode which led to enhanced oh generation declaration of competing

16651,the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc integrates electrocoagulation ec and ozonation simultaneously in a single unit nevertheless the performance of the ec process is highly dependent on the polar connection configuration monopolar vs bipolar connection and the type of generated coagulants single coagulant vs dual coagulants in this study the removal efficiency of the e hoc process with different connection configurations and types of coagulants was assessed the e hoc process with bipolar connection be hoc exhibited higher removal efficiency for wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent organic matter and ibuprofen ibp compared with the e hoc process with monopolar connection me hoc furthermore dual coagulant generation released from both al and fe electrodes in the be hoc process greatly improved the wwtp effluent organic matter and ibp removal efficiency lower energy consumption was observed for the be hoc process compared with the me hoc process it was found that ozonation promoted the polymerization reactions during coagulant hydrolyzis in the e hoc process compared with the me hoc process the be hoc configuration and dual coagulant mode further facilitated polymeric hydrolyzed coagulant species formation thereby improving ozone catalytic and coagulation performance according to trapping experiments and epr analysis oh formation was enhanced in the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode in addition more active reaction sites of generated hydrolyzed coagulant species were observed with bipolar connection and in the dual coagulant

wastewater treatment technology that produces metal coagulant in situ by electrochemically dissolving sacrificial electrodes submerged in contaminated water ingelsson et al 2020 ec has shown promise as an alternative treatment process to conventional chemical coagulation for certain drinking water heffron et al 2019 municipal bicudo et al 2021 and industrial wastewater ghahrchi et al 2021 treatment applications however the ec process does not effectively destroy some resistant pollutants ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 therefore the use of the ec process as a sole treatment process faces serious practical limitations especially when the wastewater is highly polluted al qodah et al 2020 ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 the performance of ec can be greatly enhanced by coupling it with other treatment processes previous studies have reported that ec can be synergistically coupled with other treatment processes including electrocoagulation ozonation processes electrocoagulation adsorption processes electrocoagulation ultrasound processes and electrocoagulation pulses processes al qodah et al 2020 carlos et al 2014 among these processes the integrated ozone assisted electrocoagulation technique has shown excellent organic matter removal efficiency for the treatment of textile wastewater bilińska et al 2019 mature landfill leachate ghahrchi and rezaee 2021 steel industry wastewater das et al 2021 greywater barzegar et al 2019 and municipal wastewater jin et al 2020b additionally our previous study has suggested that synergistic reactions between ozone and coagulants soc in the electro hybrid ozonation coagulation process e hoc with al and stainless steel as anode and cathode respectively played a significant role in the removal of organic matter in addition to coagulation peroxone molecular ozone oxidation and oh oxidation from chain reactions during ozonation jin et al 2020b although the integrated ozone assisted electrocoagulation technique showed higher organic matter removal efficiency the systems applied in the previous studies were operated in monopolar connection mode ghahrchi and rezaee 2020 2021 jin et al 2020b which may limit the further improvement of the removal performance the electrode arrangement can have a substantial effect on the removal efficiency of the electrochemical processes abdessamad et al 2013 ghosh et al 2008 monopolar electrodes require an external electrical contact to the power supply and their two faces are active with the same polarity kobya et al 2011 however in the bipolar arrangement only the extreme electrodes are connected to the power source golder et al 2007 every electrode excluding the electrodes at the end acts as an anode on one side and cathode on the other side koparal and öğütveren 2002 fluoride ghosh et al 2008 and cr3 golder et al 2007 removal efficiency are higher under bipolar connections than under monopolar connections however the monopolar series electrode mode has a higher arsenic removal efficiency compared with bipolar electrodes in serial connections kobya et al 2011 abdessamad et al 2013 and asselin et al 2008 also indicated that higher organic matter removal performance can be achieved in bipolar electrode systems compared with monopolar electrode systems using either al or fe electrodes moreover bipolar arrangements show high energy saving potential ghosh et al 2008 and are easy to maintain in practical applications asselin et al 2008 nevertheless there is little comparative information available relating to the removal performance of the e hoc process with monopolar and bipolar electrodes for the treatment of wwtp effluent in addition differences in the hydrolyzed coagulant species generated in different electrode connection configurations also need to be characterized in the ec process electrochemical oxidation of a suitable anode material al and fe leads to the in situ formation of metal ions serving as coagulants heffron et al 2019 immediately after the generation of metal ions in the ec process a series of hydrolyzis reactions occur duan and gregory 2003 thereafter many hydrolyzed species including monomers oligomers and polymeric hydroxyl complexes for both al and fe coagulants can be generated from deprotonation and hydroxyl bridging duan and gregory 2003 yan et al 2008 however ozone can react with the hydrolyzed coagulant species to generate reactive oxygen species ros in the hoc process jin et al 2020a the hydrolyzis of metal coagulants in the e hoc process might be affected by the reactions between the ozone and metal coagulants nevertheless the effect of ozonation on the hydrolyzed species of electro generated coagulants needs to be further investigated furthermore previous studies have found that the use of fe and al as dual coagulants i e the combined use of different coagulants is superior for water treatment compared with the use of each coagulant alone cheng et al 2003 ma et al 2014 for the e hoc process the formation of dual coagulants can be achieved by simply using two different metal anodes fe and al at the same time generally characterizing the effects of generated dual coagulants on the removal efficiency of the e hoc process is of great practical significance the above findings indicated that the e hoc process can improve the organic matter removal efficiency compared with the ec process in addition higher removal efficiency can be obtained in ec with bipolar connection and dual coagulants mode than that with monopolar connection and single coagulant mode there is thus a need to combine the e hoc process with bipolar connection and dual coagulants mode to further enhance organic matter removal in this study the wwtp effluent organic matter and ibuprofen ibp removal efficiency for the e hoc process with different types of coagulants generated single coagulant and dual coagulants and different electrode arrangements monopolar and bipolar connections was studied ibp is a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug and an emerging contaminant frequently detected in wwtp effluent and natural waters li et al 2014 the al and fe hydrolyzed species were also analyzed using the ferron assay and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms to better characterize the significance of polar types and connection configurations in the e hoc process moreover the underlying mechanism within the e hoc process was also elucidated in this study 2 materials and methods 2 1 water samples and experimental setup wwtp effluent collected from a secondary sedimentation tank in xi an china was used as the raw water the experiments were carried out in a rectangular batch reactor with dimensions of 10 7 12 cm length width height with effective volume of 500 ml fig 1 the experiments were conducted at different initial ph initial ph 5 7 and 9 the detailed information about the raw water quality experimental setup and operation condition is provided in text s1 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 dissolved organic matter doc and ibp analysis doc was measured by a shimadzu toc vcph analyzer with infrared detection detection limit 50 μg l the doc

inorganic carbon before measurement all analyzes were performed in triplicate for doc measurements a high performance liquid chromatography hplc system was used to measure the concentration of ibp according to jin et al 2020b and detailed information is provided in text s2 2 2 2 al and fe species detection al and fe species distributions were analyzed through both the ferron colorimetric method and esi ms using a waters xevo tqd mass spectrometer detailed procedures can be seen in text s3 2 2 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy epr analysis

spectrometer germany was applied for epr experiments at room temperature specific operation parameters are provided in text s5 2 2 4 energy consumption and faradaic efficiency calculation the electrical energy per order e eo was calculated according to barazesh et al 2015 which is defined as the electrical energy in kwh required to reduce a contaminant concentration by 1 order of magnitude in 1 m3 of water the detailed calculation procedure is provided in text s6 faradaic efficiencies fe within the reaction systems was calculated according to ingelsson et al 2020 detailed information is provided in text s7 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of the e hoc process the removal performance of the ec and e hoc processes for the treatment of wwtp effluent at initial ph of 5 7 and 9 was investigated fig 2 a ph variation in the different systems at different initial ph was shown in fig s1 fig 2a shows that both the ec and e hoc processes exhibited higher doc removal efficiency at initial ph 5 compared with initial ph 7 and 9 higher ph can lead to the formation of soluble al oh 4 or fe oh 4 ions duan and gregory 2003 which reduced the neutralization capacity of the generated coagulants thereby decreasing the doc removal efficiency generally the ec and e hoc with bipolar connection and dual coagulant generation model exhibited higher doc removal efficiency compared with the ec and e hoc with monopolar connection and single coagulant generation mode in addition e eo was calculated at different initial ph the results are shown in table s1 because of the addition of ozone higher energy consumption was observed for the e hoc processes in general table s1 for both the ec and e hoc processes the bipolar connection exhibited lower energy consumption compared with monopolar connection which is consistent with the results of ghosh et al 2008 in addition the e hoc processes with dual coagulants generation had lower energy consumption compared with the e hoc with single coagulant generation the removal performance of dissolved organic matter in the wwtp effluent was comparatively investigated for the different processes at different current densities 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 at initial ph 5 fig 2b which was the optimal initial ph in fig 2a the doc removal efficiency was higher for the ec processes with 10 ma cm2 current density than with current densities of 5 and 15 ma cm2 nevertheless the highest doc removal efficiency for the ec processes was less than 25 the current density is directly related to the efficiency of reactions occurring on the anode surface lacasa et al 2012 and faradaic efficiency fe of different processes with different current densities at initial ph 5 was calculated table s2 table s2 showed that lower fe can be obtained with the increase of current density in general which indicated increased passivation effects on the surface of electrodes at a current density of 15 ma cm2 the passivation of the electrodes became serious which resulted in lower doc removal efficiency at 15 ma cm2 this was consistent with the results of chen et al 2020 and dubrawski et al 2015 the processes with fe as anode exhibited lower fe according to table s2 ingelsson et al 2020 reported that low efficiencies are more frequently observed in fe ec than in al ec previous studies indicated that once a surface layer has formed electrochemically produced fe ii was trapped within the lattice of the surface layer which hindered the dissolved fe from diffusing to the bulk solution accelerating the surface layer buildup bandaru et al 2020 müller et al 2019 in addition the lower removal efficiency at a current density of 15 ma cm2 may also be attributed to the water oxidation at the anode which inhibits the production of al3 and fe3 mouedhen et al 2008 previous studies also implied that higher current density can resulted in the charge reversal in the ec process at initial ph 5 harif et al 2012 jin et al 2020b which may also lead to the poor doc removal at higher current density the removal efficiency was higher for the ec processes with bipolar connection than with monopolar connection at different current densities and the concentrations of alt and fet in the treated water were similar for the ec processes with bipolar and monopolar connection at the same current density table s3 these results were consistent with those of hu et al 2016 showing that a larger solution electrode interface can be provided for electrochemical reactions in the bipolar ec process hu et al 2016 also suggested that al3 and oh can be generated from the bipolar electrode surface more homogeneously and can be fully arranged in bulk solution which is more favorable for al13 formation to enhance coagulation furthermore the bipolar ec processes had higher doc removal efficiency with dual coagulant generation than with single coagulant generation ma et al 2014 suggested that the positively charged hydrolyzates of fe can accelerate the cross linking and clustering of organic al complexes and al hydrolyzates in the case of ec with dual coagulants generation of the be al fe process the al and fe electrodes were placed close to the stainless steel anode and cathode respectively similarly in the be fe al process the fe and al electrodes were placed close to the stainless steel anode and cathode respectively according to fig 2b it can be seen that significantly higher doc removal efficiency was observed for the e hoc processes than for the ec processes at the same current densities furthermore as the current densities increased the doc removal efficiency improved and peaked at 31 38 35 69 43 67 46 86 53 44 and 56 89 at 10 ma cm2 in the me hoc al me hoc fe be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc al fe and be hoc fe al processes respectively compared with the e hoc process with monopolar electrodes me hoc the e hoc process with bipolar electrodes also exhibited higher removal efficiency at different densities fig 2b and the concentrations of alt and fet in treated water were similar for the me hoc and be hoc processes at the same current density table s4 with al electrodes the average doc removal efficiency was 6 03 12 29 and 3 39 higher for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process with current densities of 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 respectively moreover the results were similar when fe electrodes were used specifically the average doc removal efficiency was 5 70 11 17 and 3 70 higher for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process with current densities of 5 10 and 15 ma cm2 respectively in addition fe was higher with bipolar connection than corresponding monopolar configuration in general table s2 which was consistent with asselin et al 2008 although lower fe was obtained for me hoc and be hoc with fe electrodes table s2 the me hoc and be hoc processes achieved higher doc removal efficiency with fe electrodes than with al electrodes this can be ascribed to the higher hydrolyzis rate of generated fe species than that of generated al species wang et al 2013 in addition generated fe species possess a higher content of surface hydroxyl groups that can react with ozone compared with generated al species jin et al 2020a wang et al 2013 according to fig 2b it is the same with the ec processes that the generation of dual coagulants in the bipolar connection mode which are released from both the electrolysis of the al and fe electrodes can greatly improve the average doc removal efficiency under different densities in the be hoc process 3 2 hydrolyzed species analysis the generated hydrolyzed coagulant species can affect the removal performance of the ec processes hu et al 2016 and there are interactions between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species within the e hoc process jin et al 2020b to get more insight into the e hoc process the al fe species distributions were obtained through the al fe ferron method quantitatively in ultrapure water system without the interference of organic matter at initial ph 5 fig 3 the distributions of al fe species at 1 min at different initial ph are shown in fig s2 as shown in fig 3 as the reaction time increased the dominant al fe species transformed from monomer ala fea to medium polymers alb feb and subsequently to larger polymers or al oh s alc fec initially the monomer and medium polymer increased rapidly and reached a maximum at 1 min in all of the ec and e hoc processes at initial ph 5 and decreased as the reaction time increased the distributions of monomer and medium polymer were similar larger polymer increased throughout all the ec and e hoc processes fig 3 also revealed that the addition of ozone promoted al fe polymer formation in all of the e hoc processes furthermore compared with monopolar connection the generation of alb feb was increased in the ec and e hoc processes with bipolar electrodes fig 3 these results were consistent with those of hu et al 2016 showing that yields of alb species were higher for ec with bipolar connection than ec with monopolar connection additionally the formation of alb feb can also be enhanced in the dual coagulant generation mode according to fig 3 the content of alb has been reported to be correlated to the tridecamer al13o4 oh 24 7 often denoted as al13 duan and gregory 2003 yan et al 2008 al13 is considered a highly efficient polymeric aluminum species for coagulation not only because of its strong charge neutralization capacity lin et al 2008 but also its nucleation ability to form flocs with soluble organic matter to produce colloids and precipitates efficiently yan et al 2008 because of the advantages of al13 polycation in coagulation preformed al13 species have been applied as coagulants to enhance the removal performance of coagulation jin et al 2020b xu et al 2011 our previous study also found that preformed al13 exhibited higher catalytic ability for ozonation compared with in situ generated al species from alcl3 6h2o jin et al 2019 in this case the ec and e hoc with bipolar connections and the dual coagulant generation mode produced more alb feb therefore higher organic matter removal efficiency can be achieved according to fig 2 the generated al fe species of different processes at initial ph 7 and ph 9 through the ferron assay were also compared the results can be seen in fig s3 and fig s4 in general higher alb feb can also be obtained from bipolar connection and dual coagulant generation mode at initial ph 7 and 9 in addition the addition of ozone can also lead to the increased formation of al fe polymer in all the e hoc processes compared with alb feb generation at initial ph 7 and 9 higher alb feb can be formed at initial ph 5 which can lead to higher doc removal efficiency for the ec and e hoc process at initial ph 5 the effect of ozonation on electro generated al and fe hydrolyzis was further investigated by esi ms fig s5 s16 show the esi ms spectra of al and fe speciation according to the esi ms spectra fig s5 s10 the al species were classified into four categories small polymeric aluminum species al3 al5 median polymeric aluminum species al6 al10 large polymeric aluminum species al11 al21 and undetected part alu al oh 3 and al oh 4 zhao et al 2009a based on the esi ms spectra fig s11 s16 fe species can be divided into monomeric fe species fe1 dimeric fe species fe2 trimeric fe species fe3 tetrameric fe species fe4 and undetected part feu fe oh 3 and fe oh 4 hellman et al 2006 ma et al 2014 the distributions of al and fe species in the ec and e hoc processes at different initial ph are provided in table 1 and table 2 respectively as shown in table 1 in both the ec al and e hoc al processes the polymer al al11 al21 and the undetected part alu were greater with bipolar connection at different initial ph this may stem from the higher ph within the bipolar connection process for the same initial ph fig s1 which accelerates the hydrolyzis polymerization reaction ghosh et al 2008 also confirmed that the ph of the solution was higher for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection in the e hoc al process al3 produced by the electrolytic dissolution of the anode immediately undergoes spontaneous hydrolyzis reactions that form various monomeric species and subsequently aggregate into multiple polymeric species such as small and median polymeric al mouedhen et al 2008 al is usually present in the form of al3 and six water molecules are combined to produce al oh 6 octahedra in aqueous solution tang et al 2015 as the ph increases the six water molecules around al3 can gradually deprotonate and form a series of al oh compounds al oh compounds can then form a pair of octaeth structures by forming oh bridges baes and mesmer 1976 therefore hydrolyzis and polymerization processes were accelerated in the bipolar connection process because of the higher ph compared with monopolar connection esi ms was also applied to compare the hydrolyzis behaviors of electro generated al and fe in the be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes to provide further insight into the hydrolyzis of fe and al as dual coagulants fig s17 fig s18 and fig s19 the total ion count tic in the spectra of the be hoc al be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes at different initial ph is shown in fig 4 at the same initial ph the tic value of al and fe in all the be hoc fe al or be hoc al fe process was less than the sum of the tic values of the be hoc al and be hoc fe processes fig 4 this finding was consistent with the result of ma et al 2014 which indicates that the coexistence of al and fe hydrolyzis can improve the precipitation of coagulants compared with fe or al alone thus dual coagulant generation confers a superior coagulation ability and provides a practical approach for controlling coagulant residues according to table 1 comparison of the ec al and e hoc al processes also revealed that the addition of ozone leads to a reduction in the proportion of medium polymer al6 al10 whereas the proportion of large polymer al11 al21 and the undetected part alu increase at different initial ph in general this indicates that the addition of ozone is beneficial to the formation of higher polymerized al species al11 al21 and alu the same pattern was also observed in the ec fe and e hoc fe processes according to table 2 the addition of ozone and bipolar connection led to increases in the higher polymeric fe species and the undetected part this also further suggested that ozonation and bipolar connection are beneficial to the formation of higher polymerized fe species it was proved that hydrolyzed al species and fe species can activate ozone to generate ros jin et al 2020a thus the hydrolyzed metal coagulant species might change during the reactions between ozone and hydrolyzed coagulant species as a result the increased generation of polymerized hydrolyzed species with the addition of ozone such as alb feb can further enhance the coagulation efficiency of the e hoc process 3 3 ros generation in the e hoc process the degradation of ibp during the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes is compared in fig 5 to characterize differences between the various e hoc processes at initial ph 5 which is the optimal initial ph for the e hoc process according to fig 2 ibp is one of the pharmaceutical compounds which exhibited low reactivity with ozone k o3 ibp 9 1 m 1s 1 but high reactivity with oh k oh ibp 7 4 109 m 1s 1 li et al 2014 in addition chemical coagulation and ec can hardly remove ibp jin et al 2020a therefore ibp was used as a model compound for the detection of ros in addition as presented in fig 5 ibp removal followed pseudo first order kinetics for all the e hoc processes the degradation rates of different processes are summarized in table 3 it can be observed that the degradation rate of ibp was significantly enhanced in the be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes k obs 0 3666 min 1 and 0 3737 min 1 respectively compared with the me hoc al me hoc fe be hoc al and be hoc fe processes k obs 0 2281 min 1 0 2661 min 1 0 3094 min 1 and 0 3209 min 1 respectively these results were consistent with the doc removal performance for the wwtp effluent using these e hoc processes fig 2 to further verify the generation of ros trapping experiments were conducted at initial ph 5 by adding excess isopropanol ipa catalase cat and p benzoquinone bq as oh h2o2 and o2 scavengers respectively before starting the e hoc experiments jin et al 2020a xiong et al 2018 the results are shown in fig s20 the degradation of ibp was inhibited in the presence of ipa cat and bq indicating that oh h2o2 and o2 were generated in all of the e hoc processes the degradation of ibp was largely inhibited by ipa and bq indicating that oh and o2 played a key role in the degradation of ibp typically o2 can transform into oh in aqueous solution eqs 1 2 li et al 2018 to quantitatively analyze the contribution of oh the proportion of oh oxidation was calculated by oh quenching experiments e hoc ipa and oh oxidation accounted for 87 64 88 80 90 59 91 77 94 11 and 94 35 contribution for the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes respectively which further indicated that ibp was mainly eliminated by oh oxidation it can be seen that the be hoc processes can significantly improve the formation of oh compared with the me hoc processes the amount of oh formed was also greater when dual coagulants were generated relative to when only fe or al coagulant was generated 1 o2 h h2o2 o2 2 h2o2 o2 h oh o2 h2o epr experiments were performed using 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrrolidine n oxide dmpo as a spin trapping agent in these e hoc processes to provide direct evidence for ros generation three different signals representing dmpo oh adducts marked with the circle symbol carbon centered radical adducts marked with arrow symbol and oxidized dmpo radicals marked with rectangle symbol are shown in fig 6 the oxidation of dmpo was featured by a three line spectrum feng et al 2016 xiong et al 2018 in addition the attack of carbon containing compounds by oh results in the appearance of carbon centered radical adducts with a six peak spectrum dong et al 2014 besides strong signals of the dmpo oh adduct with a peak intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were also detected tan et al 2018 in fig 6 the signal of dmpo oh and dmpo ch3 indicated the presence of oh in all of the e hoc processes which was consistent with the results of the quenching experiments fig 6 shows that the signal intensities of dmpo oh adduct were noticeably stronger in the be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes than in the me hoc and be hoc processes in both wwtp effluent and the ultrapure water system this result further confirmed that dual coagulant generation was more efficient for decomposing ozone to generate oh compared with single fe or al coagulant generation bing et al 2015 reported that the synergism of aluminum and iron onto fe2o3 al2o3 sba 15 enhanced the formation of ros compared with fe2o3 sba 15 al2o3 sba 15 and sba 15 and led to the highest reactivity indicating that the combination of both lewis sites of iron and aluminum improved the generation of ros ozone has also been reported to act as a lewis base that can replace the surface hydroxyls decompose on lewis acid sites and convert into ohads and o2 on fe2o3 as well as surface atomic oxygen species on al2o3 bing et al 2015 according to fig 6 the signal intensities of the be hoc processes were greater than those of the me hoc processes for dmpo oh adduct indicating that more oh was generated in the be hoc processes the greater surface area associated with bipolar connection compared with monopolar connection is conducive to anodic oxidation which contributed to the increase in the current flow in solution and the electrochemical dissolution rate on the anode mavré et al 2010 meanwhile the electrode corrosion is greater for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection under the same current density ghosh et al 2008 in addition it was also observed that the ph of the solution was higher for bipolar connection than for monopolar connection fig s1 the higher oh concentration obtained with the higher ph facilitated the initiation of the chain reactions for generating oh chen et al 2016 according to fig 6 the signals of oh in the wwtp effluent system were clearly stronger than those in the ultrapure water system which can be attributed to the overlapping of the dmpo ch3 and dmpo oh adducts based on fig 3 table 1 and table 2 greater numbers of polymerized hydrolyzed al fe species can be generated with bipolar connection and in the dual coagulant generation mode fig 6 further proved that higher catalytic ability for ozonation in the hoc process can be achieved with enhanced polymerized hydrolyzed species generation 3 4 proposed mechanism within the e hoc process to elucidate the mechanism within the e hoc process the proportions of hydrolyzed al fe species in the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes were verified to reveal the active reaction sites between hydrolyzed al fe species and ozone and quantitative analysis was carried out by xps fig s21 fig s22 as shown in fig s21 two overlapping bands associated with two different al 2p transitions with binding energies of 73 1 ev and 74 2 ev were observed which represented aliv and alvi respectively duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 as can be seen in fig s22 the fe 2p xps spectra were separated into two types of peaks after fitting which can be assigned to fe 2p3 2 710 720 ev and fe 2p1 2 720 735 ev respectively leveneur et al 2011 the characteristic xps spectra peaks for the different processes varied little the ratio of hydrolyzed al and fe species can be obtained after gaussian fitting using xps peak software fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the ratios of tetrahedral al decreased in the me hoc al be hoc al be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes compared with the relative ec processes by 6 25 9 14 12 14 and 10 33 respectively in addition the ratios of tetrahedral fe were also reduced in the me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes compared with the relative ec processes by 14 33 7 77 8 63 and 8 45 respectively the results indicated that tetrahedral al fe may be the key species reacting with o3 compared with octahedral sites previous studies have shown that surface tetrahedral sites are stronger lewis acid sites which are believed to be significant active sites in catalytic ozonation compared with surface al in octahedral sites bing et al 2017 sohlberg et al 1999 therefore the presence of o3 can improve the reaction with tetrahedral al fe and accelerate the generation of oh it can be observed that dual coagulant generation in the ec or e hoc process had more tetrahedral al fe which resulted in higher catalytic reactivity and enhanced oh formation compared with single coagulant generation meanwhile the ratio of tetrahedral al fe was greater in the bipolar pattern than in the monopolar pattern which indicated that the bipolar connection could also enhance catalytic performance additionally the o1s spectra of the me hoc al be hoc al me hoc fe be hoc fe be hoc fe al and be hoc al fe processes are shown in fig 8 based on fig s23 the o1 s spectra show three fitted peaks at 530 7 ev lattice oxygen oα 531 5 ev surface hydroxyl group oβ and 532 4 ev adsorbed water oγ ding et al 2016 it can be found the addition of o3 reduced the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups oβ on hydrolyzed coagulants which was attributed to the reactions between o3 and surface hydroxyl groups therefore it can be implied the surface hydroxyl groups were the main active sites reacting with o3 for the generation of oh which is consistent with the results obtained by zhao et al 2015 compared with single coagulant generation dual coagulant generation had a higher surface hydroxyl group ratio which resulted in greater ros formation based on the results described above the reaction mechanism of the e hoc process was proposed fig 9 in the e hoc process al3 and or fe3 can be electro generated thereafter hydrolyzis of the generated metal ions occurred automatically through hydration to form hydroxyl groups duan and gregory 2003 fig 7 and fig 8 indicated that the reactions between hydrolyzed species and ozone within the e hoc process occurred on the surface hydroxyl groups because of the acidic condition of the aqueous solution ph 5 in this case the primary surface groups of the hydrolyzed species are the surface protonated hydroxyl groups zhao et al 2009b suggested that ozone can interact with the surface protonated hydroxyl groups on the catalysts driven by electrostatic force and or hydrogen bonding this interaction resulted in the enhanced formation of o3h o3 and oh eq 3 6 jin et al 2020a which improved the oxidation ability of the e hoc system furthermore the formation of surface oh groups can also be enhanced during the generation of ros eq 3 5 subsequently bonds between hydrolyzed metal species can be formed between oh and protonated oh oh2 leading to the formation of o3h2 bridges that can release h2o to generate oh bridges eq 7 yu et al 2016 as a result the presence of o3 can promote the formation of polymerized al fe species and the coagulation performance can be also improved for the e hoc process the e hoc process in bipolar and or dual coagulant generation mode further enhanced the formation of polymerized al fe species and thus improved the coagulation and catalytic ability within the e hoc process fig 9 3 al fe o2h o3 al fe o2 ho3 4 ho3 oh o2 5 al fe o2 o3 oh al fe oh o3 o2 6 o3 h ho3 oh o2 7 m oh m oh2 m o3h2 m m oh m h2o 4 conclusions the e hoc processes exhibited significantly higher wwtp effluent and ibp removal efficiency compared with ec processes at different current densities with different connection configurations monopolar and bipolar and types of coagulants single coagulant and dual coagulant comparison of the e hoc process with different connection configurations and types of coagulants for the treatment of wwtp effluent and ibp revealed that organic removal efficiency was higher for the be hoc process compared with the me hoc process energy consumption was lower for the be hoc process than for the me hoc process generally in addition doc and ibp removal were significantly enhanced in the be hoc process with dual coagulant generation released from both al and fe electrodes on the one hand the better removal performance of the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode can be ascribed to the enhanced generation of polymerized al fe species which improved both the coagulation and catalytic ability of the e hoc processes on the other hand a greater number of active reaction sites of generated hydrolyzed coagulant species was observed in the be hoc process and dual coagulant mode which led to enhanced oh generation declaration of competing

16652,fluorescence spectroscopy has become a fundamental tool for the qualitative and quantitative fingerprinting of dissolved organic matter due to the inherent sensitivity of the technique a strict sampling protocol should be followed to ensure sample integrity a literature survey conducted as part of this research determined that 27 of fluorescence sampling has been conducted in polymeric containers while 52 did not report given the potential for fluorescence leachates to arise from plastics commonly used in sampling bottles a systematic laboratory investigation was undertaken to assess the likelihood of leachate contamination and consequent interferences it was observed that characteristic fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom leachates from standard polypropylene sampling containers were produced at environmentally relevant peaks peak t λex λem 250 349 nm and b λex λem 250 306 nm commonly attributed to tryptophan like and tyrosine like molecular origins leachate fluorescence and concentration generally increased with elevated storage temperatures 4 c sample acidification container steam sterilisation and in new containers with variability across different manufactured batches for example at ambient storage temperatures the highest observed leachate intensity could contribute an error equivalent to as much as 98 peak t and 2062 peak b for highly treated water or 28 peak t and 398 peak b for surface water for leachates formed under typical conditions i e 3 day fridge storage this reduced to 9 peak t and 15 peak b or 3 peak t b for the same water samples in addition pp was found to be typically unsuitable for doc measurements except under strict conditions well aged containers in short term cold storage consequently we demonstrate the need for container material reporting refrigerated storage steam sterilisation avoidance and the importance of glass usage for low fdom samples future research should investigate the potential for polymer based pollution as a potential origin of environmentally sampled fdom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polymer leachates fluorescent dissolved organic matter parafac peak t

critical requirement of successful sampling including sampling for the acquisition of fluorescence eems is to ensure the resultant data is an accurate representation of the system tested best practice in general organic matter sample collection and storage utilises pre combusted 450 c for 4 h and or acid base washed glass containers to ensure contamination is eliminated coble and spencer 2014 wilde et al 2014 however using glass containers for collecting large sample volumes can often be impractical owing to high transportation costs and a high chance of damage resulting in sample loss polymer materials especially those that form products suitable for sampling applications such as pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc silicone and nylon are therefore frequently used the ability for polymeric materials to produce organic based chemical contaminants is documented wilde et al 2014 with further evidence suggesting these leachates are optically active for example chromophoric dissolved organic matter contamination was produced by passing laboratory grade water through nylon tubing coble and spencer 2014 leachates formed from aqueous contact of polymeric materials have previously been determined not to originate from the underlying polymer structure but rather have been identified as functional additives such as stabilisers plasticisers and curing agents capolupo et al 2020 hahladakis et al 2018 capolupo et al 2020 molecularly identified aqueous leachates as common polymer additives for example acetophenone and bisphenol a which are of particular interest due to known optical activity absorbance maxima at 245 nm sariket et al 2018 and 276 nm kobayashi et al 2019 respectively recently lee et al determined that leachates from polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps as well as polymer based additives diethylhexylphthalate dehp and bisphenol a bpa fluoresce at regions associated with protein and humic like fdom lee et al 2020 while the aforementioned study demonstrates the potential for leachable compounds to fluoresce in environmentally relevant optical regions it did not examine and quantify leachates from plastics directly utilised in sampling applications in a limited number of studies to consider polymeric sampling containers and the potential for fdom contamination no fluorescent leachates were reported in polyethylene terephthalate pet bowen et al 2020 calleja et al 2019 wilde et al 2014 or polypropylene pp bottles murphy et al 2011 however these studies only considered sampling and storage conditions unique to each study with a systematic examination of broader conditions yet to undergo investigation additionally the proportion of fdom studies that utilise polymeric containers for sample collection and storage is currently unknown and hence the extent and likelihood to which leachates may influence fdom spectral interpretation cannot be rigorously assessed consequently the aims of this study are to 1 review the prevalence of polymeric container usage across current published fdom literature 2 identify and determine the presence of fdom leachates from materials that are commonly used for sample collection and storage 3 assess the degree to which conditions associated with sample collection and storage storage temperature sample ph container age sterility and container batch may influence leachate occurrence and 4 provide recommendation and guidance to minimise leachate interferences during fdom sampling practitioners from diverse fields that utilise fluorescence eem spectroscopy will benefit from enhanced guidance on fdom leachate formation and the conditions in which this may skew analytical interpretation 2 materials and methods 2 1 container material literature survey the container type survey was conducted by using the search term excitation emission matrices in scopus limiting matches to relevant journals in the fields of water treatment environmental science limnology and oceanography water research environmental science technology nature communications science of the total environment limnology and oceanography and scientific reports matches were further limited to indexable publications from 2019 and 2020 as of october 2020 and publications were excluded only if no direct eem measurements were made within the study such as in the case of review articles relevant container and sample type information was catalogued from materials and methods sections and supplementary information under the direction of each publication 2 2 leaching experiments initial leaching trials were conducted with both neutral and acidified ph 2 type 1 ultrapure milliq water merck millipore germany in sampling containers made from amber glass 100 ml cospak australia pp centrifuge tubes 50 ml corning usa and pet bottles 100 ml cospak australia based on head space free storage volume the total exposure volume of liquid to pp and pet was of 6807 and 6231 ml m3 respectively numerous independent bottles were prepared on day 0 such that on each subsequent day of measurement independent bottles were sacrificed for analysis over the 21 day testing period samples were stored in the dark within an incubator set at 20 c to simulate room temperature sample storage in the next stage results from the initial leaching trials were analyzed to determine which sampling container displayed a propensity to leach this container was then chosen to investigate the role of storage temperature repeated container washing and container sterilisation on the levels and character of resultant leachates with neutral samples storage temperature was investigated through storing additional neutral samples in the dark both in the fridge 4 c and freezer 18 c the influence of container washing or rapid artificial ageing was investigated by performing a cleaning procedure on the containers that included an acid 0 1 m hcl 24 h and base 0 1 m naoh 24 h wash cycle repeated up to 4 times where a zero wash indicates a thoroughly rinsed yet virgin container prior to storage in an incubator set at 20 c container sterilisation was investigated by steam sterilising 121 c 15 min for two different production batches of the same container prior to storage in an incubator set at 20 c as with the first experiment numerous independent bottles were prepared on day 0 of each experimental set with triplicate bottles sacrificed on each analysis day over a 14 21 day testing period 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was determined with a doc analyzer using thermal catalytic oxidation and a nondispersive infrared ndir detector toc l csh shimadzu china doc was calculated as total carbon tc minus inorganic carbon ic with the method detection limit mdl quantified as per bird et al 2003 fluorescence eems were measured using a quartz cuvette inside a spectrofluorometer horiba aqualog usa spanning excitation wavelengths from 240 800 nm emission wavelengths 245 800 nm at a 4 nm increment with a 5 nm slit width and photomultiplier detector voltage of 800 v each eem was baseline adjusted with a daily measured type 1 ultrapure milliq water blank and normalized by the area of the daily measured water raman peak at 350 nm to produce eem data in raman units ru murphy et al 2010 with select samples of high fdom intensity corrected for relevant inner filter and spectral effects kothawala et al 2013 an eem limit of quantitation loq was computed by adapting a spectroscopic based equation presented by thomsen et al as detailed by eq s2 thomsen et al 2003 given each eem was blank subtracted experimental error was determined through error propagation using measurement error of samples and blanks the influence of leachate occurrence on typical environmental samples was calculated by taking the ratio of leachate fdom to that of each sample compared in ru table s4 three independent parallel factor analysis parafac models based on eems generated from each container type glass pp and pet were developed using the stardom package version 1 1 11 pucher et al 2019 in r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 on rstudio version 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 all parafac models were created with sample mode normalization and non negativity constraints exploratory analysis determined no signal response in excitation emission wavelengths 330 nm 400 nm with removal prior to model construction allowing a reduction in the influence of noise bro 1997 and computational time model leverage was reduced by excluding measured excitation emission wavelengths 250 nm 270 nm final models were constructed for 1 3 components using a convergence criterion of 10 12 and 100 random initialisations with respective 4 split 6 combination 3 test s4c6t3 split half analysis conducted to assess individual model validity the tucker congruence coefficient tcc was used to assess the conformity between parafac components on both excitation and emission modes with fair similarity indicated by 0 85 tcc 0 95 and components effectively equal when tcc 0 95 lorenzo seva and berge 2006 wünsch et al 2017 bacterial cell density was determined by flow cytometry where an aliquot of sample was fixed with glutaraldehyde 1 final concentration sigma aldrich and stored in the dark for at least 15 min each aliquot was then stained with sybr green i 0 01 final concentration life technologies australia and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min prior to analysis tran et al 2017 on a flow cytometer 100 µl 33 μl min 1 bd accuri c6 usa bacterial populations were discriminated according to cell forward scatter ssc a and green fluorescence fl1 a seymour et al 2007 where a forward scatter threshold of 25 000 was applied to reduce noise 3 results and discussion 3 1 container material literature survey a total of 66 publications were identified as meeting the literature search criteria with samples encompassing a wide range of water types including freshwater seawater wastewater treated water groundwater and more novel sources such as porewaters landfill leachates algal bacterial derived dom and soil and road dust extracts of the surveyed publications 24 reported the use of glass for sample collection and storage 27 reported using pp pet or low high density pe while the remaining 52 majority did not specify an exact material fig 1 table s1 given the observed substantial use of plastic sampling containers coupled with evidence that leachate occurrence may impact fdom measurements hambly et al 2010 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 especially at regions of environmental importance lee et al 2020 further systematic investigation is warranted moreover as the sensitivity of fluorescence eem spectrophotometers continues to improve the possibility of detecting leachates will likely continue to increase 3 2 identifying polymer derived fluorescent leachates initial parafac results indicated no signal response in excitation emission wavelengths 330 nm 400 nm fig s3 which were removed prior to final model construction final parafac models constructed on eems generated from glass n 62 pet n 121 and pp n 118 stored in both acidified and neutral ultrapure water at 20 c indicated the presence and significance of leachate occurrence in each material tested table s3 when searching for a single component split half similarity ranged from 0 925 for glass and 0 943 for pet but were highest for pp at 0 973 where the coefficient of determination r2 p value 0 001 increased significantly from pet r2 0 209 and glass r2 0 292 to pp r2 0 502 allowing a parafac solution to consider a second component led to an acute strengthening in split half similarity for pp to 0 991 compared with a decline in similarity for glass and pet 0 470 and 0 657 respectively ultimately this result demonstrated that two components could robustly be resolved from the pp eem dataset but not from either the glass and pet datasets verifying the presence of significant and repeatable fluorophores within ultrapure water samples stored in pp this result is supported by the literature where capolupo et al 2020 identified the highest number of unique aqueous leachate molecules from pp including acetophenone and bisphenol a and the fewest compounds from pet leachate in a range of materials investigated parafac component 1 excitation and emission maxima λex λem 250 349 nm fell broadly within the classically defined peak t region λex λem 275 340 10 nm while component 2 λex λem 250 306 nm related to the peak b region λex λem 275 305 10 nm wünsch et al 2019 hence components 1 and 2 as presented in fig 2 will be referred to as component t ct and component b cb respectively tryptophan and tyrosine like compounds associated with biologically produced amino acid and protein related materials are commonly assigned as the underlying fluorophores for fdom peak t and b respectively carstea et al 2020 determann et al 1998 kowalczuk et al 2005 these peaks have also been observed to be caused by synthetic contaminants including pharmaceuticals pesticides gasoline and diesel wasswa et al 2019 and are particularly noted to be ubiquitous within sources with strong anthropogenic influence hudson et al 2007 fdom spectra in the peak b and t region have also been previously reported from leachates of ps polyethylene and pvc lee et al 2020 wasswa et al 2019 recent assessments of the distribution of dom fluorophores indicate that the classically defined peak b and t regions are present in a respective total of 45 5 and 40 of all studies reported on the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 wünsch et al 2019 specifically ct has 48 direct matches with fair similarity tcc 0 90 with 11 matches effectively considered to have equal similarity tcc 0 95 when directly compared to existing published studies on the openfluor database cb has 19 direct matches with fair similarity and 2 with equal similarity this analysis demonstrates that ct and cb emulate the spectral fingerprint of the fluorophores behind peak b and t fluorescence which are pervasive across major environmental and anthropogenic water domains for example the breadth of equal matches for ct include sampling across fresh and blackwaters pacific atlantic arctic and southern oceans and leaf leachates spanning brazil sweden canada the usa antarctica the kattegat and the baltic and chukchi seas chen et al 2018 coble et al 2014 dainard et al 2015 kida et al 2019 lapierre and del giorgio 2014 murphy et al 2008 wheeler et al 2017 wünsch et al 2017 the equal or fair occurrence of cb includes studies spanning the pacific atlantic and artic oceans and freshwater and or wastewaters from south korea and australia chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017 murphy et al 2011 murphy et al 2008 shutova et al 2014 matches to ct and cb span the use of glass pp pet and acrylic for sample collection and storage it is important to note however that spectral identicality does not necessitate molecular similarity ct and cb have been derived under ambient storage conditions in this study which is an unlikely practice in typical environmental sampling collection and storage additional factors such as storage temperature container age sterility and production batch also influence leachate occurrence therefore further examination to assess the risk leachate occurrence poses on environmental sample collection and storage was undertaken with a focus on pp containers due to the observed higher disposition for leaching 3 3 factors effecting leachate occurrence 3 3 1 acidification and storage temperature leachate doc formed from virgin pp sampling containers swiftly increased from below the limit of quantitation loq of 0 23 mgc l to approximately 1 0 17 mgc l for acidified and neutral samples within the first day of storage at ambient temperature with a more gradual increase seen between days 3 and 21 reaching a maximum doc above 3 0 1 mgc l at 21 days fig 3 a this falls in line with previous observations of instantaneous leachate transfer with the flux of material the highest at the initial point of contact between aqueous solution and polymeric material romera castillo et al 2018 it was noted that increases in doc were observed at earlier timepoints relative to fluorescent leachates fig 3a the maximum ct intensity of approximately 0 10 0 03 ru was observed for acidified ultrapure water after 7 days while neutral and acidified ambient stored samples reached approximately 0 05 0 01 ru for ct after 21 days the cb intensity of both ambient stored acidified and neutral samples increased gradually to reach a maximum of 0 05 0 06 ru after 21 days in storage at 4 c over 3 days ct and cb increased to approximately 0 019 0 011 ru and 0 015 0 009 ru respectively fig 3a from initial day 0 values at the loq of 0 007 ru and 0 011 ru respectively for ct and cb beyond 3 days leachate fdom decreased and was below loq by day 7 possibly driven by low temperature absorption of small anthropogenic molecules onto solid surfaces rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 sleep and mcclure 2001 doc leachate concentrations for ambient and cold stored samples were similar reaching approximately 1 0 1 mgc l after 1 day before cold stored sample doc reduced to either below or slightly above the quantified loq returning to approximately 1 0 1 and 1 2 0 3 mgc l for freezer and fridge stored samples after 21 days in addition to leaching the differences between ambient and cold stored sample doc indicates that ct and cb increases in ambient conditions may also be driven by biological influences for example it has been previously shown that leachate doc can stimulate heterotrophic microbe populations romera castillo et al 2018 these results therefore align with current best practice for minimising sample degradation by maintaining sample temperature below 4 c 3 3 2 number of wash cycles increasing the number of wash cycles sequentially reduced the presence of fluorescent and doc leachates fig 3b after 21 days of ambient storage unwashed pp containers produced doc ct and cb of 3 2 0 1 mgc l 0 042 0 012 ru and 0 062 0 09 ru respectively compared with four time acid base washed pp containers which produced 1 5 0 2 mgc l 0 027 0 013 ru and 0 027 0 009 ru respectively the surface layer of pp materials has been previously observed to control solute diffusion karapanagioti and klontza 2008 and hence successive wash cycles may cumulatively remove more readily leachable components on the container surface importantly no fluorescent leachates were observed for samples stored for up to five days in pp containers that had been through two or more wash cycles and stored at ambient temperatures beyond two wash cycles additional wash cycles became less successful in further reducing 21 day leachate occurrence especially for cb and doc this may be because as leachable components are exhausted from the surface layers through successive washing diffusion of leachable components from internal layers may dominate when sufficient contact time is given through longer term sample storage o shaughnessy and vavylonis 2004 sparnacci et al 2020 after four wash cycles cb was only observed after 21 days of storage at intensities slightly above the loq indicating that whilst diminishing returns are experienced between increasing the number of wash cycles and leachate reduction it might be possible to further reduce both ct and doc with more than 4 wash cycles hence the use of aged containers for the avoidance of leachate formation is validated 3 3 3 container sterilisation and manufacturer batch steam sterilisation of pp sampling containers resulted in a general substantial increase in the occurrence of fluorescent leachates when compared to non sterilised containers of the same manufactured batch fig 4 the intensity of ct for both container batches after sterilisation was similar with an initial rapid increase to approximately 0 10 0 016 ru after 1 day and to 0 20 0 23 0 02 ru after 14 days however cb intensity of previously sterilised containers varied with batch reaching 1 27 0 05 and 2 00 0 04 ru after 14 days in storage it is expected that steam sterilisation temperatures of 121 c will cause some magnitude of polymer chain relaxation and recrystallization not encountered under typical ageing of pp materials due to physical changes in amorphous mesomorphic structures over time at room temperature or by chemical exposure fiebig et al 1999 it is likely that the recrystallisation process causes leachable compounds previously trapped within the polymer network to become more readily leachable which in this case may relate to polymer derived additives already known to fluoresce within ct and cb regions lee et al 2020 container steam sterilisation highlights the potential for the broader polymer matrix to store large amounts of fdom leachates interestingly there was significant variation in leachate formation with differing manufactured batches of the same non sterilised pp sampling containers where ct intensity between batches was 0 03 0 01 and 0 11 0 01 ru and cb 0 03 0 01 and 1 26 0 05 ru respectively after 7 days of storage leachate doc in non sterilised containers was observed at both an increased or similar level than in prior steam sterilised containers indicating sterilisation may be effective in reducing doc contamination similar to subjecting containers to wash cycles by monitoring the bacterial population change it was observed that whilst initial bacterial populations were approximately 4416 cells ml the population collapsed to an average of 534 cells ml after 7 days in both sterilised and non sterilised pp whilst there was an increase to an average of 1652 cells ml after 14 days it is noted that most of the fdom leachates form within 3 days of storage where a high level of sterility is maintained hence biologically produced ct and cb is negligible in this case and the origin of fdom is conclusively the polymer sampling container given evidence that polymer derived leachates may be available to microbial communities romera castillo et al 2018 and the strong biological origins of the fluorophores associated with ct and cb carstea et al 2020 as well as divergences between fdom leachate formation and container batch future research that quantifies the link between biological activity and the occurrence and or disappearance of fdom leachates is recommended 3 4 comparing container derived and naturally encountered fdom intensity to gauge the potential impact leachate occurrence may have on fdom spectra interpretation a theoretical comparison between fdom generated from storage in sampling containers in this study and that which was observed from a set of representative samples including surface waters wastewater effluents and highly treated waters was performed detailed in table s4 in this comparison it is assumed that leachate fdom occurs additively to fdom already contained within each sample a worst case scenario where contamination with the maximum level of leachate fdom experienced in this study steam sterilised pp container stored for 14 days at ambient temperature ct 0 20 ru cb 2 00 ru equated to a ratio of leachate to sample fdom of between 13 98 and 248 33 333 for peak t and b respectively under a realistic case scenario storage conditions were selected to align to more typically encountered circumstances for example non sterilised pp container stored for 3 days at 4 c giving ct 0 019 ru cb 0 015 ru the ratio of leachate to sample fdom for the same set of representative samples decreased to between 1 9 and 2 250 for peak t and b respectively for both scenarios highly treated water which recorded no sample based peak t has leachate contamination as the sole source of fdom in this region evidently samples that have inherently higher intensity fdom are proportionally less impacted than those of lower intensity such as highly treated waters and naturally low doc water e g recycled water and seawater with certain storage scenarios particularly steam sterilisation able to impart significant influence consequently incorrectly attributing leachate contamination as naturally occurring fdom is a higher risk for highly treated waters and action to avoid polymer based sampling containers where possible is warranted the results of this study infer that additional polymer sample interactions including polymer based filtration membranes and solid phase extraction spe sorbent housing which are typically pp should be further investigated for potential fdom leachate occurrence 4 broad implications for the environmental observation of peak b and t fluorescence persistent and prolonged manufacture and release of polymer materials has led to the ubiquitous presence of macro meso micro and nano plastic materials across the global aquatic environment capolupo et al 2020 the implication is that a potential polymer derived origin for a portion of environmentally sampled peak b and t fdom is therefore plausible furthermore prior observations indicate plastic derived doc is metabolically available to stimulate select microbial life romera castillo et al 2018 tetu et al 2020 artificially bolstering feedstocks for the biological production of peak b and t additional observations also point to the emergence of the plastisphere a microbial biosphere that develops on plastic surfaces in aquatic environments containing distinctively differing bacterial composition than surrounding waters bryant et al 2016 jacquin et al 2019 wright et al 2020 the addition of this novel biosphere to aquatic systems may increase the net biological production capacity of peak b and t fdom these hypothesised routes to the anthropogenically driven production of peak b and t fdom may hinder our ability to form and apply findings of fdom in these regions in situ based fdom measurements are increasingly important tools for rapid monitoring applications with fdom intensity often linked to parameters such as doc biological and chemical oxygen demand and e coli presence carstea et al 2020 hence in examining existing publications caution should be taken to extrapolate results based on examinations made of peak b and t as it remains plausible that unidentified or unconsidered anthropogenic sources may also be driving its fate and origin future research interests should assess the plausibility of these anthropogenic driven routes to peak b and t fdom formation 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that sample container leachates can occur within classically defined peaks b and t fdom regions

16652,fluorescence spectroscopy has become a fundamental tool for the qualitative and quantitative fingerprinting of dissolved organic matter due to the inherent sensitivity of the technique a strict sampling protocol should be followed to ensure sample integrity a literature survey conducted as part of this research determined that 27 of fluorescence sampling has been conducted in polymeric containers while 52 did not report given the potential for fluorescence leachates to arise from plastics commonly used in sampling bottles a systematic laboratory investigation was undertaken to assess the likelihood of leachate contamination and consequent interferences it was observed that characteristic fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom leachates from standard polypropylene sampling containers were produced at environmentally relevant peaks peak t λex λem 250 349 nm and b λex λem 250 306 nm commonly attributed to tryptophan like and tyrosine like molecular origins leachate fluorescence and concentration generally increased with elevated storage temperatures 4 c sample acidification container steam sterilisation and in new containers with variability across different manufactured batches for example at ambient storage temperatures the highest observed leachate intensity could contribute an error equivalent to as much as 98 peak t and 2062 peak b for highly treated water or 28 peak t and 398 peak b for surface water for leachates formed under typical conditions i e 3 day fridge storage this reduced to 9 peak t and 15 peak b or 3 peak t b for the same water samples in addition pp was found to be typically unsuitable for doc measurements except under strict conditions well aged containers in short term cold storage consequently we demonstrate the need for container material reporting refrigerated storage steam sterilisation avoidance and the importance of glass usage for low fdom samples future research should investigate the potential for

in general organic matter sample collection and storage utilises pre combusted 450 c for 4 h and or acid base washed glass containers to ensure contamination is eliminated coble and spencer 2014 wilde et al 2014 however using glass containers for collecting large sample volumes can often be impractical owing to high transportation costs and a high chance of damage resulting in sample loss polymer materials especially those that form products suitable for sampling applications such as pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc silicone and nylon are therefore frequently used the ability for polymeric materials to produce organic based chemical contaminants is documented wilde et al 2014 with further evidence suggesting these leachates are optically active for example chromophoric dissolved organic matter contamination was produced by passing laboratory grade water through nylon tubing coble and spencer 2014 leachates formed from aqueous contact of polymeric materials have previously been determined not to originate from the underlying polymer structure but rather have been identified as functional additives such as stabilisers plasticisers and curing agents capolupo et al 2020 hahladakis et al 2018 capolupo et al 2020 molecularly identified aqueous leachates as common polymer additives for example acetophenone and bisphenol a which are of particular interest due to known optical activity absorbance maxima at 245 nm sariket et al 2018 and 276 nm kobayashi et al 2019 respectively recently lee et al determined that leachates from polyvinyl chloride pvc and polystyrene ps as well as polymer based additives diethylhexylphthalate dehp and bisphenol a bpa fluoresce at regions associated with protein and humic like fdom lee et al 2020 while the aforementioned study demonstrates the potential for leachable compounds to fluoresce in environmentally relevant optical regions it did not examine and quantify leachates from plastics directly utilised in sampling applications in a limited number of studies to consider polymeric sampling containers and the potential for fdom contamination no fluorescent leachates were reported in polyethylene terephthalate pet bowen et al 2020 calleja et al 2019 wilde et al 2014 or polypropylene pp bottles murphy et al 2011 however these studies only considered sampling and storage conditions unique to each study with a systematic examination of broader conditions yet to undergo investigation additionally the proportion of fdom studies that utilise polymeric containers for sample collection and storage is currently unknown and hence the extent and likelihood to which leachates may influence fdom spectral interpretation cannot be rigorously assessed consequently the aims of this study are to 1 review the prevalence of polymeric container usage across current published fdom literature 2 identify and determine the presence of fdom leachates from materials that are commonly used for sample collection and storage 3 assess the degree to which conditions associated with sample collection and storage storage temperature sample ph container age sterility and container batch may influence leachate occurrence and 4 provide recommendation and guidance to minimise leachate interferences during fdom sampling practitioners from diverse fields that utilise fluorescence eem spectroscopy will benefit from enhanced guidance on fdom leachate formation and the conditions in which this may skew analytical interpretation 2 materials and methods 2 1 container material literature survey the container type survey was conducted by using the search term excitation emission matrices in scopus limiting matches to relevant journals in the fields of water treatment environmental science limnology and oceanography water research environmental science technology nature communications science of the total environment limnology and oceanography and scientific reports matches were further limited to indexable publications from 2019 and 2020 as of october 2020 and publications were excluded only if no direct eem measurements were made within the study such as in the case of review articles relevant container and sample type information was catalogued from materials and methods sections and supplementary information under the direction of each publication 2 2 leaching experiments initial leaching trials were conducted with both neutral and acidified ph 2 type 1 ultrapure milliq water merck millipore germany in sampling containers made from amber glass 100 ml cospak australia pp centrifuge tubes 50 ml corning usa and pet bottles 100 ml cospak australia based on head space free storage volume the total exposure volume of liquid to pp and pet was of 6807 and 6231 ml m3 respectively numerous independent bottles were prepared on day 0 such that on each subsequent day of measurement independent bottles were sacrificed for analysis over the 21 day testing period samples were stored in the dark within an incubator set at 20 c to simulate room temperature sample storage in the next stage results from the initial leaching trials were analyzed to determine which sampling container displayed a propensity to leach this container was then chosen to investigate the role of storage temperature repeated container washing and container sterilisation on the levels and character of resultant leachates with neutral samples storage temperature was investigated through storing additional neutral samples in the dark both in the fridge 4 c and freezer 18 c the influence of container washing or rapid artificial ageing was investigated by performing a cleaning procedure on the containers that included an acid 0 1 m hcl 24 h and base 0 1 m naoh 24 h wash cycle repeated up to 4 times where a zero wash indicates a thoroughly rinsed yet virgin container prior to storage in an incubator set at 20 c container sterilisation was investigated by steam sterilising 121 c 15 min for two different production batches of the same container prior to storage in an incubator set at 20 c as with the first experiment numerous independent bottles were prepared on day 0 of each experimental set with triplicate bottles sacrificed on each analysis day over a 14 21 day testing period 2 3 analytical methods dissolved organic carbon doc concentration was determined with a doc analyzer using thermal catalytic oxidation and a nondispersive infrared ndir detector toc l csh shimadzu china doc was calculated as total carbon tc minus inorganic carbon ic with the method detection limit mdl quantified as per bird et al 2003 fluorescence eems were measured using a quartz cuvette inside a spectrofluorometer horiba aqualog usa spanning excitation wavelengths from 240 800 nm emission wavelengths 245 800 nm at a 4 nm increment with a 5 nm slit width and photomultiplier detector voltage of 800 v each eem was baseline adjusted with a daily measured type 1 ultrapure milliq water blank and normalized by the area of the daily measured water raman peak at 350 nm to produce eem data in raman units ru murphy et al 2010 with select samples of high fdom intensity corrected for relevant inner filter and spectral effects kothawala et al 2013 an eem limit of quantitation loq was computed by adapting a spectroscopic based equation presented by thomsen et al as detailed by eq s2 thomsen et al 2003 given each eem was blank subtracted experimental error was determined through error propagation using measurement error of samples and blanks the influence of leachate occurrence on typical environmental samples was calculated by taking the ratio of leachate fdom to that of each sample compared in ru table s4 three independent parallel factor analysis parafac models based on eems generated from each container type glass pp and pet were developed using the stardom package version 1 1 11 pucher et al 2019 in r version 4 0 2 r core team 2020 on rstudio version 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 all parafac models were created with sample mode normalization and non negativity constraints exploratory analysis determined no signal response in excitation emission wavelengths 330 nm 400 nm with removal prior to model construction allowing a reduction in the influence of noise bro 1997 and computational time model leverage was reduced by excluding measured excitation emission wavelengths 250 nm 270 nm final models were constructed for 1 3 components using a convergence criterion of 10 12 and 100 random initialisations with respective 4 split 6 combination 3 test s4c6t3 split half analysis conducted to assess individual model validity the tucker congruence coefficient tcc was used to assess the conformity between parafac components on both excitation and emission modes with fair similarity indicated by 0 85 tcc 0 95 and components effectively equal when tcc 0 95 lorenzo seva and berge 2006 wünsch et al 2017 bacterial cell density was determined by flow cytometry where an aliquot of sample was fixed with glutaraldehyde 1 final concentration sigma aldrich and stored in the dark for at least 15 min each aliquot was then stained with sybr green i 0 01 final concentration life technologies australia and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min prior to analysis tran et al 2017 on a flow cytometer 100 µl 33 μl min 1 bd accuri c6 usa bacterial populations were discriminated according to cell forward scatter ssc a and green fluorescence fl1 a seymour et al 2007 where a forward scatter threshold of 25 000 was applied to reduce noise 3 results and discussion 3 1 container material literature survey a total of 66 publications were identified as meeting the literature search criteria with samples encompassing a wide range of water types including freshwater seawater wastewater treated water groundwater and more novel sources such as porewaters landfill leachates algal bacterial derived dom and soil and road dust extracts of the surveyed publications 24 reported the use of glass for sample collection and storage 27 reported using pp pet or low high density pe while the remaining 52 majority did not specify an exact material fig 1 table s1 given the observed substantial use of plastic sampling containers coupled with evidence that leachate occurrence may impact fdom measurements hambly et al 2010 murphy et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 especially at regions of environmental importance lee et al 2020 further systematic investigation is warranted moreover as the sensitivity of fluorescence eem spectrophotometers continues to improve the possibility of detecting leachates will likely continue to increase 3 2 identifying polymer derived fluorescent leachates initial parafac results indicated no signal response in excitation emission wavelengths 330 nm 400 nm fig s3 which were removed prior to final model construction final parafac models constructed on eems generated from glass n 62 pet n 121 and pp n 118 stored in both acidified and neutral ultrapure water at 20 c indicated the presence and significance of leachate occurrence in each material tested table s3 when searching for a single component split half similarity ranged from 0 925 for glass and 0 943 for pet but were highest for pp at 0 973 where the coefficient of determination r2 p value 0 001 increased significantly from pet r2 0 209 and glass r2 0 292 to pp r2 0 502 allowing a parafac solution to consider a second component led to an acute strengthening in split half similarity for pp to 0 991 compared with a decline in similarity for glass and pet 0 470 and 0 657 respectively ultimately this result demonstrated that two components could robustly be resolved from the pp eem dataset but not from either the glass and pet datasets verifying the presence of significant and repeatable fluorophores within ultrapure water samples stored in pp this result is supported by the literature where capolupo et al 2020 identified the highest number of unique aqueous leachate molecules from pp including acetophenone and bisphenol a and the fewest compounds from pet leachate in a range of materials investigated parafac component 1 excitation and emission maxima λex λem 250 349 nm fell broadly within the classically defined peak t region λex λem 275 340 10 nm while component 2 λex λem 250 306 nm related to the peak b region λex λem 275 305 10 nm wünsch et al 2019 hence components 1 and 2 as presented in fig 2 will be referred to as component t ct and component b cb respectively tryptophan and tyrosine like compounds associated with biologically produced amino acid and protein related materials are commonly assigned as the underlying fluorophores for fdom peak t and b respectively carstea et al 2020 determann et al 1998 kowalczuk et al 2005 these peaks have also been observed to be caused by synthetic contaminants including pharmaceuticals pesticides gasoline and diesel wasswa et al 2019 and are particularly noted to be ubiquitous within sources with strong anthropogenic influence hudson et al 2007 fdom spectra in the peak b and t region have also been previously reported from leachates of ps polyethylene and pvc lee et al 2020 wasswa et al 2019 recent assessments of the distribution of dom fluorophores indicate that the classically defined peak b and t regions are present in a respective total of 45 5 and 40 of all studies reported on the openfluor database murphy et al 2014 wünsch et al 2019 specifically ct has 48 direct matches with fair similarity tcc 0 90 with 11 matches effectively considered to have equal similarity tcc 0 95 when directly compared to existing published studies on the openfluor database cb has 19 direct matches with fair similarity and 2 with equal similarity this analysis demonstrates that ct and cb emulate the spectral fingerprint of the fluorophores behind peak b and t fluorescence which are pervasive across major environmental and anthropogenic water domains for example the breadth of equal matches for ct include sampling across fresh and blackwaters pacific atlantic arctic and southern oceans and leaf leachates spanning brazil sweden canada the usa antarctica the kattegat and the baltic and chukchi seas chen et al 2018 coble et al 2014 dainard et al 2015 kida et al 2019 lapierre and del giorgio 2014 murphy et al 2008 wheeler et al 2017 wünsch et al 2017 the equal or fair occurrence of cb includes studies spanning the pacific atlantic and artic oceans and freshwater and or wastewaters from south korea and australia chen et al 2018 chen et al 2017 murphy et al 2011 murphy et al 2008 shutova et al 2014 matches to ct and cb span the use of glass pp pet and acrylic for sample collection and storage it is important to note however that spectral identicality does not necessitate molecular similarity ct and cb have been derived under ambient storage conditions in this study which is an unlikely practice in typical environmental sampling collection and storage additional factors such as storage temperature container age sterility and production batch also influence leachate occurrence therefore further examination to assess the risk leachate occurrence poses on environmental sample collection and storage was undertaken with a focus on pp containers due to the observed higher disposition for leaching 3 3 factors effecting leachate occurrence 3 3 1 acidification and storage temperature leachate doc formed from virgin pp sampling containers swiftly increased from below the limit of quantitation loq of 0 23 mgc l to approximately 1 0 17 mgc l for acidified and neutral samples within the first day of storage at ambient temperature with a more gradual increase seen between days 3 and 21 reaching a maximum doc above 3 0 1 mgc l at 21 days fig 3 a this falls in line with previous observations of instantaneous leachate transfer with the flux of material the highest at the initial point of contact between aqueous solution and polymeric material romera castillo et al 2018 it was noted that increases in doc were observed at earlier timepoints relative to fluorescent leachates fig 3a the maximum ct intensity of approximately 0 10 0 03 ru was observed for acidified ultrapure water after 7 days while neutral and acidified ambient stored samples reached approximately 0 05 0 01 ru for ct after 21 days the cb intensity of both ambient stored acidified and neutral samples increased gradually to reach a maximum of 0 05 0 06 ru after 21 days in storage at 4 c over 3 days ct and cb increased to approximately 0 019 0 011 ru and 0 015 0 009 ru respectively fig 3a from initial day 0 values at the loq of 0 007 ru and 0 011 ru respectively for ct and cb beyond 3 days leachate fdom decreased and was below loq by day 7 possibly driven by low temperature absorption of small anthropogenic molecules onto solid surfaces rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 sleep and mcclure 2001 doc leachate concentrations for ambient and cold stored samples were similar reaching approximately 1 0 1 mgc l after 1 day before cold stored sample doc reduced to either below or slightly above the quantified loq returning to approximately 1 0 1 and 1 2 0 3 mgc l for freezer and fridge stored samples after 21 days in addition to leaching the differences between ambient and cold stored sample doc indicates that ct and cb increases in ambient conditions may also be driven by biological influences for example it has been previously shown that leachate doc can stimulate heterotrophic microbe populations romera castillo et al 2018 these results therefore align with current best practice for minimising sample degradation by maintaining sample temperature below 4 c 3 3 2 number of wash cycles increasing the number of wash cycles sequentially reduced the presence of fluorescent and doc leachates fig 3b after 21 days of ambient storage unwashed pp containers produced doc ct and cb of 3 2 0 1 mgc l 0 042 0 012 ru and 0 062 0 09 ru respectively compared with four time acid base washed pp containers which produced 1 5 0 2 mgc l 0 027 0 013 ru and 0 027 0 009 ru respectively the surface layer of pp materials has been previously observed to control solute diffusion karapanagioti and klontza 2008 and hence successive wash cycles may cumulatively remove more readily leachable components on the container surface importantly no fluorescent leachates were observed for samples stored for up to five days in pp containers that had been through two or more wash cycles and stored at ambient temperatures beyond two wash cycles additional wash cycles became less successful in further reducing 21 day leachate occurrence especially for cb and doc this may be because as leachable components are exhausted from the surface layers through successive washing diffusion of leachable components from internal layers may dominate when sufficient contact time is given through longer term sample storage o shaughnessy and vavylonis 2004 sparnacci et al 2020 after four wash cycles cb was only observed after 21 days of storage at intensities slightly above the loq indicating that whilst diminishing returns are experienced between increasing the number of wash cycles and leachate reduction it might be possible to further reduce both ct and doc with more than 4 wash cycles hence the use of aged containers for the avoidance of leachate formation is validated 3 3 3 container sterilisation and manufacturer batch steam sterilisation of pp sampling containers resulted in a general substantial increase in the occurrence of fluorescent leachates when compared to non sterilised containers of the same manufactured batch fig 4 the intensity of ct for both container batches after sterilisation was similar with an initial rapid increase to approximately 0 10 0 016 ru after 1 day and to 0 20 0 23 0 02 ru after 14 days however cb intensity of previously sterilised containers varied with batch reaching 1 27 0 05 and 2 00 0 04 ru after 14 days in storage it is expected that steam sterilisation temperatures of 121 c will cause some magnitude of polymer chain relaxation and recrystallization not encountered under typical ageing of pp materials due to physical changes in amorphous mesomorphic structures over time at room temperature or by chemical exposure fiebig et al 1999 it is likely that the recrystallisation process causes leachable compounds previously trapped within the polymer network to become more readily leachable which in this case may relate to polymer derived additives already known to fluoresce within ct and cb regions lee et al 2020 container steam sterilisation highlights the potential for the broader polymer matrix to store large amounts of fdom leachates interestingly there was significant variation in leachate formation with differing manufactured batches of the same non sterilised pp sampling containers where ct intensity between batches was 0 03 0 01 and 0 11 0 01 ru and cb 0 03 0 01 and 1 26 0 05 ru respectively after 7 days of storage leachate doc in non sterilised containers was observed at both an increased or similar level than in prior steam sterilised containers indicating sterilisation may be effective in reducing doc contamination similar to subjecting containers to wash cycles by monitoring the bacterial population change it was observed that whilst initial bacterial populations were approximately 4416 cells ml the population collapsed to an average of 534 cells ml after 7 days in both sterilised and non sterilised pp whilst there was an increase to an average of 1652 cells ml after 14 days it is noted that most of the fdom leachates form within 3 days of storage where a high level of sterility is maintained hence biologically produced ct and cb is negligible in this case and the origin of fdom is conclusively the polymer sampling container given evidence that polymer derived leachates may be available to microbial communities romera castillo et al 2018 and the strong biological origins of the fluorophores associated with ct and cb carstea et al 2020 as well as divergences between fdom leachate formation and container batch future research that quantifies the link between biological activity and the occurrence and or disappearance of fdom leachates is recommended 3 4 comparing container derived and naturally encountered fdom intensity to gauge the potential impact leachate occurrence may have on fdom spectra interpretation a theoretical comparison between fdom generated from storage in sampling containers in this study and that which was observed from a set of representative samples including surface waters wastewater effluents and highly treated waters was performed detailed in table s4 in this comparison it is assumed that leachate fdom occurs additively to fdom already contained within each sample a worst case scenario where contamination with the maximum level of leachate fdom experienced in this study steam sterilised pp container stored for 14 days at ambient temperature ct 0 20 ru cb 2 00 ru equated to a ratio of leachate to sample fdom of between 13 98 and 248 33 333 for peak t and b respectively under a realistic case scenario storage conditions were selected to align to more typically encountered circumstances for example non sterilised pp container stored for 3 days at 4 c giving ct 0 019 ru cb 0 015 ru the ratio of leachate to sample fdom for the same set of representative samples decreased to between 1 9 and 2 250 for peak t and b respectively for both scenarios highly treated water which recorded no sample based peak t has leachate contamination as the sole source of fdom in this region evidently samples that have inherently higher intensity fdom are proportionally less impacted than those of lower intensity such as highly treated waters and naturally low doc water e g recycled water and seawater with certain storage scenarios particularly steam sterilisation able to impart significant influence consequently incorrectly attributing leachate contamination as naturally occurring fdom is a higher risk for highly treated waters and action to avoid polymer based sampling containers where possible is warranted the results of this study infer that additional polymer sample interactions including polymer based filtration membranes and solid phase extraction spe sorbent housing which are typically pp should be further investigated for potential fdom leachate occurrence 4 broad implications for the environmental observation of peak b and t fluorescence persistent and prolonged manufacture and release of polymer materials has led to the ubiquitous presence of macro meso micro and nano plastic materials across the global aquatic environment capolupo et al 2020 the implication is that a potential polymer derived origin for a portion of environmentally sampled peak b and t fdom is therefore plausible furthermore prior observations indicate plastic derived doc is metabolically available to stimulate select microbial life romera castillo et al 2018 tetu et al 2020 artificially bolstering feedstocks for the biological production of peak b and t additional observations also point to the emergence of the plastisphere a microbial biosphere that develops on plastic surfaces in aquatic environments containing distinctively differing bacterial composition than surrounding waters bryant et al 2016 jacquin et al 2019 wright et al 2020 the addition of this novel biosphere to aquatic systems may increase the net biological production capacity of peak b and t fdom these hypothesised routes to the anthropogenically driven production of peak b and t fdom may hinder our ability to form and apply findings of fdom in these regions in situ based fdom measurements are increasingly important tools for rapid monitoring applications with fdom intensity often linked to parameters such as doc biological and chemical oxygen demand and e coli presence carstea et al 2020 hence in examining existing publications caution should be taken to extrapolate results based on examinations made of peak b and t as it remains plausible that unidentified or unconsidered anthropogenic sources may also be driving its fate and origin future research interests should assess the plausibility of these anthropogenic driven routes to peak b and t fdom formation 5 conclusion this study demonstrates that sample container leachates can occur within classically defined peaks b and t fdom regions providing a source of interference the following general guidelines are recommended to mitigate inadvertent reporting of artefacts introduced through leaching interferences 1 report the material used for sample collection and storage 2 maintain sample storage temperatures below 4 c with prompt cooling after collection 3 do not subject polymeric containers to steam sterilisation procedures and 4 prioritize the use of thoroughly washed glass containers for highly finished waters and other low fdom doc samples where possible where study specific constraints warrant the use of non glass containers container leachate tests on each manufacturer batch field blank collection and adequate replicate sampling should be conducted to determine container suitability under the sampling regimes

2018 katukiza et al 2013 murungi and van dijk 2014 fate and transport studies highlight the role of hydrological flows in mobilising pathogens from land to water by correlating disease outbreaks to rainfall events ferguson et al 2003 mawdsley et al 1995 schäfer et al 1998 in surface water pathogens can die off from stressors like temperature salinity sunlight presence of bacteria organic matter and sedimentation pinon and vialette 2018 therefore integrating microbial loss survival components can improve model reliability mawdsley et al 1995 moreover surface runoff and discharge data can be used to quantify microbial streamflow concentrations consequently microbial exposure risk can be predicted and the disease burden estimated when population exposure behaviours are understood future climate change is predicted to increase diarrhoeal disease burden particularly in low and middle income countries under socio economic scenarios of continued fossil fuel use ipcc 2014 levy et al 2018 however such studies mostly use historical diarrhoeal disease patterns an integrated modelling approach combining socio economic development and climate change impacts could provide new knowledge on future microbial water quality and the resulting diarrhoeal disease burden hofstra 2011 hofstra et al 2019 thus far such studies are grossly limited our study aimed to simulate spatially explicit rotavirus river concentrations accounting for onsite sanitation technologies pit latrines and septic tanks in addition to sewerage systems offsite and open defecation and to analyse the impacts of future sanitation management population urbanization and climate change on rotavirus concentrations the glowpa rota c2 model presented here simulates rotavirus concentrations in rivers with rotavirus as an exemplar waterborne pathogen the model and scenario analysis were applied to uganda as a case study with prevalent sanitation challenges pathogen sources hotspots and future impacts of population growth sanitation management and climate change on rotavirus concentrations in uganda s rivers were explored the model can be applied to other countries and used for monitoring sdg6 3 progress 2 methods we build on the glowpa rota h1 kiulia et al 2015 okaali and hofstra 2018 and glowpa crypto c1 vermeulen et al 2019 models in this paper detailed model descriptions can be found in these sources here we focused on modifications and input variable changes table s1 and figure s1 in supplementary materials s presents the models variables and literature resources applied in this paper briefly the glowpa rota h1 model simulates global human rotavirus emissions reaching surface water while the glowpa crypto c1 model simulates global human and animal cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers both models compute annual spatial outputs from human or animal populations faecal pathogen shedding sanitation coverage storage survival and wastewater treatment removal represented on 0 5 0 5 grid resolution emissions are calculated from point sewerage systems and urban open defecation and diffuse rural open defecation or animal sources for the current paper onsite sanitation technologies were added to the existing glowpa rota h1 model section 2 1 to produce human emissions for uganda s 112 districts rotavirus transported by surface runoff the environmental survival fraction and river discharge data were used to build the glowpa rota c2 model for simulating concentrations section 2 2 surface runoff and discharge are outputs from the distributed community water model cwatm for water resources assessment cropped to within uganda s geographical extent prior to our study cwatm was used to assess how water demand and availability evolve in the extended lake victoria basin using socio economic and climate change scenarios for the year 2050 burek et al 2020 2 1 the glowpa rota h2 model onsite sanitation integration and simulating rotavirus river inputs the glowpa rota h1 model simulated annual human rotavirus emissions from sewerage systems and open defecation kiulia et al 2015 okaali and hofstra 2018 summing human emissions from urban and rural populations section s2 in the current study onsite sanitation was added into the existing glowpa rota h1 framework by interpreting faecal sludge management practices in uganda unlike in kiulia et al where a constant fraction transported by surface runoff was used we computed diffuse emissions by calculating grid to grid land retention fractions using grided surface runoff data the sum of point and diffuse source emissions was thereafter referred to as river inputs although faecal sludge management data may be limited excluding onsite sanitation technologies for areas with a large coverage is unrealistic in an example of kampala uganda faecal sludge disposal events can variably include the appropriate emptying and transport to treatment illegal dumping into water or land and the flushing into stormwater channels murungi and van dijk 2014 schoebitz et al 2016 tsinda et al 2015 therefore differentiated onsite sanitation management events and pathways in figure 1 were integrated into the new glowpa rota h2 model as 1 o s u r p u r f u r a g e f u r e m v p f x f d l f d w f f w f e t 1 f r e m u r where o s u r is the urban or rural rotavirus river inputs from onsite sanitation p u r is the urban or rural district population f u r a g e is the fraction of the urban or rural age group 5 5 years f u r e m is the faecal sludge fraction emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks in urban or rural areas v p is the rotavirus shedding calculated by multiplying rotavirus excretion and incidence rates in the age group and f x is the average survival fraction during storage time the illegal faecal sludge disposal proportions are f d l for the fraction emptied and disposed on land f d w into water and f f w is flushed into waterways appropriately disposed faecal sludge f e t is emptied and transported to wastewater treatment facilities and f r e m is the fraction of rotavirus removed by the treatment type and stage section s2 occurrences for illegal faecal sludge disposal are unknown a study in kampala estimated 46 of faecal sludge as unsafely managed and 54 safely managed schoebitz et al 2016 from murungi and van dijk 2014 schoebitz et al 2016 and tsinda et al 2015 the greatest proportion is flushed out such as during rainfall events therefore we assumed the ratios f d l 5 f d w 15 and f f w 80 constitute the 46 unsafely managed waste a fraction of faecal sludge was assumed as not emptied and was excluded as a non source figure 1 remaining contained for all urban areas unsafe faecal sludge management was assumed to include illegal flushing and dumping into water or land while safe faecal sludge management included emptying followed by treatment a common practice in rural areas due to the available space is digging a new pit elsewhere therefore rural illegal disposal activities were excluded the glowpa rota h2 model assigned both offsite and post treatment onsite emissions to respective grid location of the 25 wastewater treatment plants instead of gridded averages in the glowpa rota h1 model each wastewater treatment plant was assigned an output fraction depending on its configuration activated sludge or stabilization ponds and capacity the average storage survival fraction of rotavirus was calculated from the rate order exponential decay basing on the cryptosporidium animal manure storage survival estimation in vermeulen et al 2017 rotavirus decay day 1 during storage time k p i t was obtained from a systematic literature review of pathogen survival in untreated excreta fleming 2017 in vermeulen et al 2019 surface runoff was used to calculate grid based river inputs because runoff does not mobilise all pathogens a significant fraction is retained in the soil and vegetation vermeulen et al 2019 and our literature review section s3 found no standard for modelling microbial transport from land to rivers consequently we calculated the retained fraction from diffuse sources using surface runoff data upper and lower retention values from literature were assigned naturalized global runoff ranges such that grids with high runoff received lower retention values and vice versa section s3 table s2 diffuse emissions were multiplied with the runoff fraction and added to point emissions to obtain grid based annual rotavirus river inputs 2 2 the glowpa rota c2 model simulating rotavirus concentrations in rivers like vermeulen et al 2019 grid to grid pathogen survival in rivers for a particular month was estimated from literature and the total loss rate coefficient developed by summing rate order die offs due to temperature and solar radiation before the loads were routed downstream sedimentation in water was excluded as being implausible for rotavirus 2 2 1 temperature dependent decay of rotavirus in fresh surface water literature on infectivity inactivation of rotavirus in fresh surface waters was reviewed section s4 and table s3 present the review approach and the few resources meeting our criteria recorded data k t i day 1 was used to obtain the first order decay rate in equation below 2 k t i β 0 β 1 t i with k t being the gridded temperature dependent decay rate at water temperature t c in month i β 0 0 0397 β 1 0 0089 n 20 p 001 t was obtained from cwatm 2 2 2 sunlight dependent decay of rotavirus in fresh surface water a few studies from literature reviewed on rotavirus solar inactivation in fresh surface waters or synthetic aqueous conditions are assembled in table s4 section s5 decay versus insolation values was estimated by fitting a line into the data for full spectrum irradiation in solutions containing sensitizers figure s4 solar radiation dependent decay was then modelled using the thomann mueller 1987 equation 3 k r i k l i a i k e z i 1 e k e z i where k r is the depth averaged solar radiation dependent decay day 1 k l is the proportionality coefficient m2kj 1 i a is the average daily surface insolation kjm 2day 1 k e is the solar radiation attenuation or light extinction coefficient m 1 and z is the average river depth m for month i i a and z are obtained from cwatm kirk 1981 and lee et al 2005 showed how k e can be modelled using inherent optical properties of water like absorption reflection and refraction consequently the relation between downwelling scalar irradiance e d z 0 at water depth 0 and irradiance at a certain depth z e d z 1 for photosynthetically available radiation can be described as 4 e d z 1 e d z 0 e k e z 1 z 0 in general k e increases with water depth z and can be averaged over a mixed water column as shown in equation 5 lee et al 2005 k e is the average attenuation coefficient m 1 between z 0 at the surface and at depth z 1 5 k e z 0 z 1 1 z 1 z 0 ln e d z 0 e d z 1 the euphotic depth z e u was used to represent z 1 z e u is the distance from the surface to the point where light penetration reaches just 1 of the insolent surface radiation kirk 1994 1981 at z 0 this amount is 100 e d z 0 solar radiation penetrating beyond this point may be inadequate for photosynthesis we assumed the same for virus decay therefore z 1 z e u with z 0 0 at the surface e d z 0 100 and e d z 1 1 two studies support this approach arguing that calculating depth averaged light extinction is more useful than obtaining point values in the water column lee et al 2005 mccormick and højerslev 1994 the new depth and radiation values were substituted into equation 5 making k e dependent on z e u k e 4 6052 z e u typical z e u ranges in uganda rivers were not found however 67 z e u data points were obtained from two studies on murchison bay fielding bay and napoleon gulf along the northern shores of lake victoria between 2001 and 2004 which predicted the mean monthly k e profile figure s5 finally we substituted for k r k e z and i a to obtain the coefficient k l at any value of the former parameters k l 4 71 10 5 2 2 3 routing of rotavirus concentrations in rivers prior to routing the glowpa rota c2 model used streamflow networks from cwatm s gridded flow direction and flow accumulation outputs river depth m width m and flow velocity m3s 1 were calculated from the cwatm s naturalized discharge m3s 1 with water demand for domestic agriculture livestock and industry excluded enabling the estimation of water residence time residence time per grid cell is the river length straight line river stretch between adjacent grids divided by flow velocity during residence time more water accumulated in a grid cell depending on the number of surrounding to draining cells routing of river inputs started from low accumulation cells such that the next grid cell received additional loading from the previous cell total loading for the current grid cell was calculated and adjusted for environmental survival using the loss rate coefficient as 6 l i n d i f f i p n t i l i n 1 e k i t i where l i n is the loading per month in month i in a grid with flow accumulation number n from diffuse d i f f i and point p n t i sources l i n 1 is the routed loading from the previous grid to the current grid k i is the total loss rate coefficient and t i is the residence time in days k i depends on pathogen environmental survival presented earlier total monthly concentrations were then calculated from discharge q i as 7 c i l i q i 2 3 model sensitivity mathematical nominal and exclusion tests were performed in the sensitivity analysis in the mathematical approach values were changed by increasing or decreasing variables with the same proportion for nominal sensitivity variables were given upper and lower values based on the indicated literature the glowpa rota c1 median and mean concentrations output changes were then investigated for sensitivity to changes in input variables see details in section s6 2 4 scenario analysis 2 4 1 narratives and data sources baseline and scenario glowpa rota c2 model input data were representative for approximately the years 2015 and 2050 respectively these data included urban and rural populations sanitation coverage faecal sludge management wastewater treatment proportions table s6 and climate change data surface runoff water temperature solar radiation and river discharge from cwatm scenario inputs were based on two shared socio economic pathways ssps and three representative concentration pathways rcps ssps are the five alternative narratives for future socio economic development assessing climate change impacts vulnerabilities adaptation and mitigation riahi et al 2017 the rcps are the four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories developed by the global climate modelling community with radiative forcings 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 6 wm 2 spanning up to the year 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 the cwatm outputs for ssp1 and ssp2 represented two plausible futures in 2050 for the extended lake victoria basin tramberend et al 2020 ssp1 is the sustainability narrative describing optimistic prospects on socio economic development population growth and urbanization inclusive development and environmental limit awareness lead towards achieving ssp1climate targets ssp2 is the middle of the road narrative with a near customary pattern dominated by unequal socio economic growth rcps for the extended lake victoria basin are simulations from general circulation models gcms tramberend et al 2020 four gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 flato et al 2013 are used in the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip frieler et al 2016 these gcms were bias corrected to represent the current climate and out of the four hadgem2 es and miroc5 were selected as the most feasible gcms for the east african region tramberend et al 2020 grided rcps 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 data for surface runoff water temperature solar radiation and river discharge were used as climate inputs into the glowpa rota c2 model for 2050 urban and rural populations for uganda were compiled from the ssps public database riahi et al 2017 we assumed urban and rural grids grow proportionally from the baseline such that no new densely populated grids are formed and the current urban or rural grids remain in 2050 detailed data for population and sanitation coverage assumptions and climate change analysis are provided in section s7 3 results 3 1 rotavirus sources and river inputs in uganda s surface waters in 2015 the glowpa rota h2 model simulated human rotavirus river inputs from sanitation systems for the baseline year 2015 urban open defecation contributed a total of 15 5 87 sewerage 14 5 9 onsite 14 1 3 with almost all the share of 92 coming from illegal flushing and rural open defecation 13 3 1 log10 particles per year to surface water annually hotspots were identified as the various densely populated centres across the country with outputs between 12 0 and 14 5 log10 particles per year overall population density and sanitation coverage accounted for the spatial distribution of river inputs figure 2 a districts with higher emissions also identified in okaali hofstra 2018 included kampala wakiso masaka and iganga had an average of 14 log10 particles per year however point source emissions dominated diffuse source emissions by 99 3 2 uganda river concentrations of rotavirus in 2015 monthly rotavirus river concentrations from the glowpa rota c2 model mostly fell between 5 and 5 log10 particles per litre with medians between 0 3 and 2 log10 particles per litre of surface water figure 2 b shows annual mean rotavirus concentrations in small and large rivers across the country at a spatial resolution of 0 0833 0 0833 grids most of the routed grid to grid concentrations were transported downstream attributable to the simulated monthly k t and k r and the high survival fractions figure s7 and s8 lake victoria was excluded because the model was assumed less representative for large water bodies arising from among others uncertainties in estimating retention time travel distance and the virus loss survival fraction grids with discharge values below 1 m3s 1 were also excluded because the model would predict unreasonably high concentrations monthly differences in concentrations were largely due to changes in river discharge as seen in the examples of july dry and november wet in figure 2 c and 2 d respectively for these months differences were observable in the south western parts of the country likely resulting from the seasonal wet to dry shifts relative to other parts of the country 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the glowpa rota c2 model the glowpa rota c2 median and mean concentrations outputs increased significantly by 2 and 10 orders of magnitude when rotavirus incidence and excretion rates were doubled or increased by 1 log10 respectively while the influences of changes in temperature and solar dependent decays were limited excluding k p i t alone contributed 2 76 median and 2 99 mean orders of magnitude to outputs respectively however the model mostly accommodated other given variable fluctuations for instance median and mean results were largely unchanged whether faecal sludge is emptied yearly or every 10 years registering limited to no interaction between k p i t and the faecal sludge emptying ranges varying log land retention surface runoff and maximum and minimum monthly runs for river discharge runoff water temperature and solar radiation registered limited to no output changes detailed results are discussed in section s6 3 4 rotavirus concentrations in uganda s rivers in 2050 rotavirus river concentrations were lower in ssp1 than in ssp2 across all rcps in 2050 mostly falling between 4 and 3 log10 particles per litre in ssp1 and 4 and 5 log10 particles per litre in ssp2 monthly minimum and maximum concentration medians were simulated at 0 2 and 0 1 versus 1 6 and 1 9 rotavirus particles per litre in ssp1 and ssp2 respectively figure 3 and figure s10 although the gcm and rcp patterns in figure 3 may be striking and resulting from variances in river discharge there were limited overall output differences between rcps and gcms in ssp1 or in ssp2 the slightly reduced median concentrations from rcps 2 6 to 6 0 for both gcms was likely due to overall increasing comparative river discharge producing a river dilution effect predicted increases and reductions of river discharge from the baseline in rcp 2 6 and 4 5 at the northwest and southwest of the country in hadgem2 es likely offset their influence on scenario rotavirus concentrations thereby producing limited comparative differences the spatially explicit results across the country show higher river contamination in ssp2 than in ssp1 figure 4 in comparison to the baseline for all rcps ssp2 median concentrations from hadgem2 es and miroc5 increased by between 44 and 75 and mean concentrations were between 25 and 36 higher some differences between gcms were also highlighted as more important than the differences between rcps for miroc5 stronger increases were simulated than in hadgem2 es for both median and mean rotavirus concentrations resulting from the discharge related dilution in hadgem2 es in contrast in ssp1 all gcms and rcps showed strong rotavirus concentration reductions the medians fell by between 100 and 121 and means by between 54 and 61 like in ssp1 across rcps gcm median and mean concentrations were lower in hadgem2 es than in miroc5 when compared to the baseline detailed results are presented in table s7 4 discussion 4 1 the glowpa rota c2 model sensitivity our sensitivity analysis highlighted that strongly reducing k p i t and changes in prevalence and excretion rates of rotavirus influenced the simulated rotavirus concentrations the most orner et al 2019 argued that longer storage or emptying periods contribute more to microbial die off than factors like pit storage temperature ph and moisture content the high k p i t and the consequent large rotavirus storage reductions achieved on site may explain the limited output correlation to changes in emptying frequencies however an emptying event much earlier than the baseline s 3 years likely mobilises more viable rotavirus particles we tested the influence of a much shorter storage time from the baseline s once in 3 years to monthly and obtained 3 orders of magnitude increase in mean rotavirus concentrations interestingly emptying frequencies may even be higher in densely populated areas or in non household sanitation technologies schoebitz et al 2017 2016 the uncertainty in rotavirus shedding is primarily due to limited epidemiological observations whenever present rotavirus incidence and prevalence data are constrained by spatial variability symptomatic and asymptomatic prognosis and inequities between hospitalization and health care access bwogi et al 2016 fuhrimann et al 2016 mwenda et al 2010 troeger et al 2018 for instance a study combined gastroenteritis from various pathogens including rotavirus of 10 9 adults and 8 3 children episodes per person per year for populations along an open drain water system in kampala fuhrimann et al 2016 another study compiled a national rotavirus incidence of 0 694 episodes per person per year from the global burden of disease study troeger et al 2018 likely representing populations along a polluted water system wastewater surveillance could be a better estimator of community faecal pathogen incidence and excretion levels it could be an early warning tool such as recently applied for the coronavirus disease ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 nevertheless high rotavirus incidence rates particularly in children below 5 years and the consequent excretion rates are primary drivers of rotavirus loading as observed in this and other studies ferguson et al 2007 okaali and hofstra 2018 reder 2017 vermeulen et al 2019 4 2 simulating baseline rotavirus river inputs input data and assumptions the results were influenced by model assumptions and input data uncertainties as expected illegal pit flushing in urban areas contributed the largest onsite sanitation share compared to the dumping on water on land or from treated faecal sludge ratio assumptions for illegal faecal sludge disposal were informed by literature and were considered representative for all urban areas which may be unrealistic because of the possible faecal sludge management differences the legally emptied to treatment faecal sludge loadings were largely reduced by the assumed steady state k p i t irrespective of the contemporary storage times as shown by the sensitivity analysis although our sensitivity analysis shows limited influences of changes in illegal disposal ratios fractions and emptying frequencies the glowpa model would benefit from formal and informal faecal sludge management field records however such data are not readily available because unregulated disposal activities are complex to document schoebitz et al 2017 a large section of uganda s rural population uses onsite systems where rotavirus particles were assumed to be safely contained rural open defecation inputs were dependent on surface runoff and the fraction of rotavirus land retention estimated from our literature review although the model was less sensitive to changes in land retention robust approaches and data were limited in the literature grid cells with high runoff were crudely assigned low retention values and vice versa landscape characteristics such as vegetation cover physical and chemical soil properties were assumedly captured in the retention estimates davidson et al 2016 correlated the decreasing recovery of rotavirus in surface runoff to vegetation cover which further decreased virus particle soil infiltration therefore using the data in davidson et al 2016 was our pragmatic choice 4 3 environmental survival and routing of rotavirus concentrations rotavirus river concentrations are dependent on environmental survival pancorbo et al 1987 and ward et al 1986 showed that environmental survival and infectivity variably depend on virus type and matrix conditions we focused on first order rotavirus decay due to temperature and solar radiation in natural surface or representative waters modelling both k s using best fitted log linear relationships obviously the available empirical literature requires updating although the derived k values may be uncertain the sensitivity analysis showed that changes in temperature and sunlight dependent decay were of limited influence and that rotavirus was relatively persistent in fresh surface waters additionally despite not influencing model sensitivity and therefore uncertainty it is likely that local characteristics in rivers such as euphotic water depth z e u used to determine k e and k r vary from location to location notwithstanding high river discharges such as 100 m3s 1 seen from cwatm figure s6 may translate into less residence time for reductions by k t and k r moreover virus inactivation may not always be log linear due to matrix conditions and antiviral agents producing shoulder tailing or biphasic die off kinetics abad et al 1997 pinon and vialette 2018 kraay et al 2018 positively correlated rotavirus decay to water temperature while determining waterborne transmission between communities however their regression analysis generated limited significance to decay for a combination of natural secondary effluent distilled and sterilized water types moreover die off curves of most microbes are typically non linear but can be approximated as a first order exponential decay with characteristic decay particularly under limited data such as resulting from our literature reviews for k t and k r gonzález 1995 the glowpa rota c2 routed rotavirus concentrations from low to high accumulation grids using input data within uganda thus border entry points were not specified and accounted for because neighbouring country input data was not used and river discharge was cropped within uganda s borders however extended fluvial networks are often trans border and mobilise various contaminants therefore we identified 5 most important border grids and estimated river inputs introduced into each of the cells figure s9 notably the most important border grid is the single exit of lake victoria with originally higher discharge values than the median between 800 and 1500 m3s 1 except for this grid the model simulated loads and concentrations travelling downstream but running within the borders of uganda where input data is available the need to adjust for border inflows other than at the lake victoria exit point may currently not be necessary 4 4 rotavirus concentrations in 2050 changes in model output drivers in 2050 rotavirus concentrations will be largely driven by population urbanization and sanitation changes rather than by hydrological inputs in ssp2 more rotavirus contamination was mobilised when more people were using sewerage systems while the adequately treated wastewater proportions remained largely unchanged this means that stronger and more deliberate interventions will need to be adopted to reduce surface water loadings in ssp2 to ssp1 levels in the latter scenario treatment removal was improved by 3 logs in wastewater stabilization ponds non treatment was eliminated and all collected wastewater reached tertiary treatment in conventional systems compared to historical data rcp 6 0 was the most plausible medium climate scenario for the extended lake victoria basin and ssp2 suggested to lead towards rcp 6 0 in 2040 tramberend et al 2020 however gcms may provide limited spatial variability for local regions such as below 200 km resolution at monthly or daily timesteps mendez et al 2020 averaging and exclusion of local features in gcms may explain the limited differences between the rcp outputs in our study the low detailed spatial and temporal resolutions likely aggregate the hydrologic processes dynamics consequential uncertainty may therefore accumulate in the glowpa rota c2 outputs for instance vermeulen et al 2019 found that a version of the glowpa model simulated high cryptosporidium concentrations in some larger rivers moreover the current monthly glowpa rota c2 output resolution does not include flash weather events such as floods however anticipated extremes of uganda s climate towards drier or wetter seasons such as after 2050 may not directly translate into higher or lower pathogen loading into rivers similar model outcomes may also hold for neighbouring countries with projected seasonal precipitation variabilities gebrechorkos et al 2019 where without strong improvements future regional glowpa rota c2 outputs may continue to be largely driven by population urbanization and sanitation coverage 4 5 performance and future potential of the glowpa rota c2 model among others one key approach towards building trust in models for data poor areas and therefore in the glowpa rota c2 model is to compare outputs with observational data strokal 2016 rotavirus is not regularly measured in uganda s surface waters however a recent study measured rotavirus concentrations in an open drain wastewater system in kampala o brien et al 2017 average copies per litre ranged between 1 08 102 1 25 102 in a channel before a wastewater treatment plant 4 22 102 3 77 103 in the influent 1 87 102 3 72 103 in a channel after treatment and 6 49 101 2 99 102 in the draining swamp these ranges fall within the glowpa rota c2 s baseline results particularly closest to the median and mean of 1 and 2 log10 particles per litre respectively vermeulen et al 2019 also simulated cryptosporidium concentrations within the ranges of observed data for various global locations for their version of the glowpa model our sensitivity analysis section 3 1 is another a step towards building model trust it revealed that the glowpa rota c2 model was largely less sensitive to nominal changes in most variables except for pathogen incidence and excretion in faeces this makes both the spatial and numerical outputs relatively reproduceable and dependable highlighting urban hotspot areas with predominant sanitation challenges however obtaining more spatial observation data will help to comprehensively validate the model finally besides sanitation improvement and water quality monitoring applications for sdg6 3 outputs of the glowpa rota c2 could aid estimation of exposure risks and the resultant rotavirus diarrhoeal disease burden with more detailed population sanitation and hydrological data the model could be applied to a local situation or even produce global outputs using country level input data moreover we could learn from various spatial and temporal scale influences generated from both input data types future scenarios could also examine the impacts of mass vaccinations campaigns on concentrations and the diarrhoeal disease burden the model could be applied to other bacteria protozoa virus and helminths pathogens groups like giardia salmonella cholera norovirus and hepatitis although animal sources need to be considered where applicable 5 conclusions the glowpa rota c2 model simulated spatially explicit rotavirus river inputs and concentrations at subnational levels for uganda from both onsite and offsite point and diffuse sanitation sources urban open defecation treated wastewater effluent and the unsafe faecal sludge disposal contributed the largest shares to rotavirus river loadings for the baseline year 2015 major hotspots of rotavirus contamination are the densely populated urban centres with predominant sanitation challenges typical in slum dwellings the modelling framework showed that stronger and deliberate interventions including ending open defecation safe management of faecal sludge adequate wastewater treatment and reducing untreated proportions should be adopted otherwise the rotavirus or similar pathogen loading into surface water will not be reduced for future scenarios population growth urbanization and inadequate sanitation are stronger contamination drivers than climate change to our knowledge rotavirus rivers concentrations have been modelled for the first time applied to uganda but replicable elsewhere besides informing sdg6 3 progress monitoring aiding sanitation service level and microbial water quality management simulated rotavirus concentrations can be inputs for quantitative microbial risk

16653,faecal pathogens can be introduced into surface water through open defecation illegal disposal and inadequate treatment of faecal sludge and wastewater despite sanitation improvements poor countries are progressing slowly towards the united nation s sustainable development goal 6 by 2030 sanitation associated pathogenic contamination of surface waters impacted by future population

decisions in data poor areas hofstra et al 2019 van vliet et al 2019 the models can study pollutant sources identify hotspots and assess the impacts of environmental change our study used the process based global water pathogens glowpa model which simulates global regional and national scale outputs hofstra et al 2013 kiulia et al 2015 vermeulen et al 2019 generally the model explores sanitation service chain pathways for pathogen sources and then conceptualizes operational sink to source processes point source emissions are estimated from sewerage systems and urban open defecation while diffuse source emissions are from rural open defecation onsite sanitation technologies are treated as non sources however not all faeces from onsite sanitation can be safely contained schoebitz et al 2016 williams and overbo 2015 unsafely managed onsite technologies in unplanned densely populated settlements have also been linked to microbial surface and groundwater contamination berendes et al 2018 katukiza et al 2013 murungi and van dijk 2014 fate and transport studies highlight the role of hydrological flows in mobilising pathogens from land to water by correlating disease outbreaks to rainfall events ferguson et al 2003 mawdsley et al 1995 schäfer et al 1998 in surface water pathogens can die off from stressors like temperature salinity sunlight presence of bacteria organic matter and sedimentation pinon and vialette 2018 therefore integrating microbial loss survival components can improve model reliability mawdsley et al 1995 moreover surface runoff and discharge data can be used to quantify microbial streamflow concentrations consequently microbial exposure risk can be predicted and the disease burden estimated when population exposure behaviours are understood future climate change is predicted to increase diarrhoeal disease burden particularly in low and middle income countries under socio economic scenarios of continued fossil fuel use ipcc 2014 levy et al 2018 however such studies mostly use historical diarrhoeal disease patterns an integrated modelling approach combining socio economic development and climate change impacts could provide new knowledge on future microbial water quality and the resulting diarrhoeal disease burden hofstra 2011 hofstra et al 2019 thus far such studies are grossly limited our study aimed to simulate spatially explicit rotavirus river concentrations accounting for onsite sanitation technologies pit latrines and septic tanks in addition to sewerage systems offsite and open defecation and to analyse the impacts of future sanitation management population urbanization and climate change on rotavirus concentrations the glowpa rota c2 model presented here simulates rotavirus concentrations in rivers with rotavirus as an exemplar waterborne pathogen the model and scenario analysis were applied to uganda as a case study with prevalent sanitation challenges pathogen sources hotspots and future impacts of population growth sanitation management and climate change on rotavirus concentrations in uganda s rivers were explored the model can be applied to other countries and used for monitoring sdg6 3 progress 2 methods we build on the glowpa rota h1 kiulia et al 2015 okaali and hofstra 2018 and glowpa crypto c1 vermeulen et al 2019 models in this paper detailed model descriptions can be found in these sources here we focused on modifications and input variable changes table s1 and figure s1 in supplementary materials s presents the models variables and literature resources applied in this paper briefly the glowpa rota h1 model simulates global human rotavirus emissions reaching surface water while the glowpa crypto c1 model simulates global human and animal cryptosporidium concentrations in rivers both models compute annual spatial outputs from human or animal populations faecal pathogen shedding sanitation coverage storage survival and wastewater treatment removal represented on 0 5 0 5 grid resolution emissions are calculated from point sewerage systems and urban open defecation and diffuse rural open defecation or animal sources for the current paper onsite sanitation technologies were added to the existing glowpa rota h1 model section 2 1 to produce human emissions for uganda s 112 districts rotavirus transported by surface runoff the environmental survival fraction and river discharge data were used to build the glowpa rota c2 model for simulating concentrations section 2 2 surface runoff and discharge are outputs from the distributed community water model cwatm for water resources assessment cropped to within uganda s geographical extent prior to our study cwatm was used to assess how water demand and availability evolve in the extended lake victoria basin using socio economic and climate change scenarios for the year 2050 burek et al 2020 2 1 the glowpa rota h2 model onsite sanitation integration and simulating rotavirus river inputs the glowpa rota h1 model simulated annual human rotavirus emissions from sewerage systems and open defecation kiulia et al 2015 okaali and hofstra 2018 summing human emissions from urban and rural populations section s2 in the current study onsite sanitation was added into the existing glowpa rota h1 framework by interpreting faecal sludge management practices in uganda unlike in kiulia et al where a constant fraction transported by surface runoff was used we computed diffuse emissions by calculating grid to grid land retention fractions using grided surface runoff data the sum of point and diffuse source emissions was thereafter referred to as river inputs although faecal sludge management data may be limited excluding onsite sanitation technologies for areas with a large coverage is unrealistic in an example of kampala uganda faecal sludge disposal events can variably include the appropriate emptying and transport to treatment illegal dumping into water or land and the flushing into stormwater channels murungi and van dijk 2014 schoebitz et al 2016 tsinda et al 2015 therefore differentiated onsite sanitation management events and pathways in figure 1 were integrated into the new glowpa rota h2 model as 1 o s u r p u r f u r a g e f u r e m v p f x f d l f d w f f w f e t 1 f r e m u r where o s u r is the urban or rural rotavirus river inputs from onsite sanitation p u r is the urban or rural district population f u r a g e is the fraction of the urban or rural age group 5 5 years f u r e m is the faecal sludge fraction emptied from pit latrines and septic tanks in urban or rural areas v p is the rotavirus shedding calculated by multiplying rotavirus excretion and incidence rates in the age group and f x is the average survival fraction during storage time the illegal faecal sludge disposal proportions are f d l for the fraction emptied and disposed on land f d w into water and f f w is flushed into waterways appropriately disposed faecal sludge f e t is emptied and transported to wastewater treatment facilities and f r e m is the fraction of rotavirus removed by the treatment type and stage section s2 occurrences for illegal faecal sludge disposal are unknown a study in kampala estimated 46 of faecal sludge as unsafely managed and 54 safely managed schoebitz et al 2016 from murungi and van dijk 2014 schoebitz et al 2016 and tsinda et al 2015 the greatest proportion is flushed out such as during rainfall events therefore we assumed the ratios f d l 5 f d w 15 and f f w 80 constitute the 46 unsafely managed waste a fraction of faecal sludge was assumed as not emptied and was excluded as a non source figure 1 remaining contained for all urban areas unsafe faecal sludge management was assumed to include illegal flushing and dumping into water or land while safe faecal sludge management included emptying followed by treatment a common practice in rural areas due to the available space is digging a new pit elsewhere therefore rural illegal disposal activities were excluded the glowpa rota h2 model assigned both offsite and post treatment onsite emissions to respective grid location of the 25 wastewater treatment plants instead of gridded averages in the glowpa rota h1 model each wastewater treatment plant was assigned an output fraction depending on its configuration activated sludge or stabilization ponds and capacity the average storage survival fraction of rotavirus was calculated from the rate order exponential decay basing on the cryptosporidium animal manure storage survival estimation in vermeulen et al 2017 rotavirus decay day 1 during storage time k p i t was obtained from a systematic literature review of pathogen survival in untreated excreta fleming 2017 in vermeulen et al 2019 surface runoff was used to calculate grid based river inputs because runoff does not mobilise all pathogens a significant fraction is retained in the soil and vegetation vermeulen et al 2019 and our literature review section s3 found no standard for modelling microbial transport from land to rivers consequently we calculated the retained fraction from diffuse sources using surface runoff data upper and lower retention values from literature were assigned naturalized global runoff ranges such that grids with high runoff received lower retention values and vice versa section s3 table s2 diffuse emissions were multiplied with the runoff fraction and added to point emissions to obtain grid based annual rotavirus river inputs 2 2 the glowpa rota c2 model simulating rotavirus concentrations in rivers like vermeulen et al 2019 grid to grid pathogen survival in rivers for a particular month was estimated from literature and the total loss rate coefficient developed by summing rate order die offs due to temperature and solar radiation before the loads were routed downstream sedimentation in water was excluded as being implausible for rotavirus 2 2 1 temperature dependent decay of rotavirus in fresh surface water literature on infectivity inactivation of rotavirus in fresh surface waters was reviewed section s4 and table s3 present the review approach and the few resources meeting our criteria recorded data k t i day 1 was used to obtain the first order decay rate in equation below 2 k t i β 0 β 1 t i with k t being the gridded temperature dependent decay rate at water temperature t c in month i β 0 0 0397 β 1 0 0089 n 20 p 001 t was obtained from cwatm 2 2 2 sunlight dependent decay of rotavirus in fresh surface water a few studies from literature reviewed on rotavirus solar inactivation in fresh surface waters or synthetic aqueous conditions are assembled in table s4 section s5 decay versus insolation values was estimated by fitting a line into the data for full spectrum irradiation in solutions containing sensitizers figure s4 solar radiation dependent decay was then modelled using the thomann mueller 1987 equation 3 k r i k l i a i k e z i 1 e k e z i where k r is the depth averaged solar radiation dependent decay day 1 k l is the proportionality coefficient m2kj 1 i a is the average daily surface insolation kjm 2day 1 k e is the solar radiation attenuation or light extinction coefficient m 1 and z is the average river depth m for month i i a and z are obtained from cwatm kirk 1981 and lee et al 2005 showed how k e can be modelled using inherent optical properties of water like absorption reflection and refraction consequently the relation between downwelling scalar irradiance e d z 0 at water depth 0 and irradiance at a certain depth z e d z 1 for photosynthetically available radiation can be described as 4 e d z 1 e d z 0 e k e z 1 z 0 in general k e increases with water depth z and can be averaged over a mixed water column as shown in equation 5 lee et al 2005 k e is the average attenuation coefficient m 1 between z 0 at the surface and at depth z 1 5 k e z 0 z 1 1 z 1 z 0 ln e d z 0 e d z 1 the euphotic depth z e u was used to represent z 1 z e u is the distance from the surface to the point where light penetration reaches just 1 of the insolent surface radiation kirk 1994 1981 at z 0 this amount is 100 e d z 0 solar radiation penetrating beyond this point may be inadequate for photosynthesis we assumed the same for virus decay therefore z 1 z e u with z 0 0 at the surface e d z 0 100 and e d z 1 1 two studies support this approach arguing that calculating depth averaged light extinction is more useful than obtaining point values in the water column lee et al 2005 mccormick and højerslev 1994 the new depth and radiation values were substituted into equation 5 making k e dependent on z e u k e 4 6052 z e u typical z e u ranges in uganda rivers were not found however 67 z e u data points were obtained from two studies on murchison bay fielding bay and napoleon gulf along the northern shores of lake victoria between 2001 and 2004 which predicted the mean monthly k e profile figure s5 finally we substituted for k r k e z and i a to obtain the coefficient k l at any value of the former parameters k l 4 71 10 5 2 2 3 routing of rotavirus concentrations in rivers prior to routing the glowpa rota c2 model used streamflow networks from cwatm s gridded flow direction and flow accumulation outputs river depth m width m and flow velocity m3s 1 were calculated from the cwatm s naturalized discharge m3s 1 with water demand for domestic agriculture livestock and industry excluded enabling the estimation of water residence time residence time per grid cell is the river length straight line river stretch between adjacent grids divided by flow velocity during residence time more water accumulated in a grid cell depending on the number of surrounding to draining cells routing of river inputs started from low accumulation cells such that the next grid cell received additional loading from the previous cell total loading for the current grid cell was calculated and adjusted for environmental survival using the loss rate coefficient as 6 l i n d i f f i p n t i l i n 1 e k i t i where l i n is the loading per month in month i in a grid with flow accumulation number n from diffuse d i f f i and point p n t i sources l i n 1 is the routed loading from the previous grid to the current grid k i is the total loss rate coefficient and t i is the residence time in days k i depends on pathogen environmental survival presented earlier total monthly concentrations were then calculated from discharge q i as 7 c i l i q i 2 3 model sensitivity mathematical nominal and exclusion tests were performed in the sensitivity analysis in the mathematical approach values were changed by increasing or decreasing variables with the same proportion for nominal sensitivity variables were given upper and lower values based on the indicated literature the glowpa rota c1 median and mean concentrations output changes were then investigated for sensitivity to changes in input variables see details in section s6 2 4 scenario analysis 2 4 1 narratives and data sources baseline and scenario glowpa rota c2 model input data were representative for approximately the years 2015 and 2050 respectively these data included urban and rural populations sanitation coverage faecal sludge management wastewater treatment proportions table s6 and climate change data surface runoff water temperature solar radiation and river discharge from cwatm scenario inputs were based on two shared socio economic pathways ssps and three representative concentration pathways rcps ssps are the five alternative narratives for future socio economic development assessing climate change impacts vulnerabilities adaptation and mitigation riahi et al 2017 the rcps are the four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories developed by the global climate modelling community with radiative forcings 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 6 wm 2 spanning up to the year 2100 van vuuren et al 2011 the cwatm outputs for ssp1 and ssp2 represented two plausible futures in 2050 for the extended lake victoria basin tramberend et al 2020 ssp1 is the sustainability narrative describing optimistic prospects on socio economic development population growth and urbanization inclusive development and environmental limit awareness lead towards achieving ssp1climate targets ssp2 is the middle of the road narrative with a near customary pattern dominated by unequal socio economic growth rcps for the extended lake victoria basin are simulations from general circulation models gcms tramberend et al 2020 four gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 flato et al 2013 are used in the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip frieler et al 2016 these gcms were bias corrected to represent the current climate and out of the four hadgem2 es and miroc5 were selected as the most feasible gcms for the east african region tramberend et al 2020 grided rcps 2 6 4 5 and 6 0 data for surface runoff water temperature solar radiation and river discharge were used as climate inputs into the glowpa rota c2 model for 2050 urban and rural populations for uganda were compiled from the ssps public database riahi et al 2017 we assumed urban and rural grids grow proportionally from the baseline such that no new densely populated grids are formed and the current urban or rural grids remain in 2050 detailed data for population and sanitation coverage assumptions and climate change analysis are provided in section s7 3 results 3 1 rotavirus sources and river inputs in uganda s surface waters in 2015 the glowpa rota h2 model simulated human rotavirus river inputs from sanitation systems for the baseline year 2015 urban open defecation contributed a total of 15 5 87 sewerage 14 5 9 onsite 14 1 3 with almost all the share of 92 coming from illegal flushing and rural open defecation 13 3 1 log10 particles per year to surface water annually hotspots were identified as the various densely populated centres across the country with outputs between 12 0 and 14 5 log10 particles per year overall population density and sanitation coverage accounted for the spatial distribution of river inputs figure 2 a districts with higher emissions also identified in okaali hofstra 2018 included kampala wakiso masaka and iganga had an average of 14 log10 particles per year however point source emissions dominated diffuse source emissions by 99 3 2 uganda river concentrations of rotavirus in 2015 monthly rotavirus river concentrations from the glowpa rota c2 model mostly fell between 5 and 5 log10 particles per litre with medians between 0 3 and 2 log10 particles per litre of surface water figure 2 b shows annual mean rotavirus concentrations in small and large rivers across the country at a spatial resolution of 0 0833 0 0833 grids most of the routed grid to grid concentrations were transported downstream attributable to the simulated monthly k t and k r and the high survival fractions figure s7 and s8 lake victoria was excluded because the model was assumed less representative for large water bodies arising from among others uncertainties in estimating retention time travel distance and the virus loss survival fraction grids with discharge values below 1 m3s 1 were also excluded because the model would predict unreasonably high concentrations monthly differences in concentrations were largely due to changes in river discharge as seen in the examples of july dry and november wet in figure 2 c and 2 d respectively for these months differences were observable in the south western parts of the country likely resulting from the seasonal wet to dry shifts relative to other parts of the country 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the glowpa rota c2 model the glowpa rota c2 median and mean concentrations outputs increased significantly by 2 and 10 orders of magnitude when rotavirus incidence and excretion rates were doubled or increased by 1 log10 respectively while the influences of changes in temperature and solar dependent decays were limited excluding k p i t alone contributed 2 76 median and 2 99 mean orders of magnitude to outputs respectively however the model mostly accommodated other given variable fluctuations for instance median and mean results were largely unchanged whether faecal sludge is emptied yearly or every 10 years registering limited to no interaction between k p i t and the faecal sludge emptying ranges varying log land retention surface runoff and maximum and minimum monthly runs for river discharge runoff water temperature and solar radiation registered limited to no output changes detailed results are discussed in section s6 3 4 rotavirus concentrations in uganda s rivers in 2050 rotavirus river concentrations were lower in ssp1 than in ssp2 across all rcps in 2050 mostly falling between 4 and 3 log10 particles per litre in ssp1 and 4 and 5 log10 particles per litre in ssp2 monthly minimum and maximum concentration medians were simulated at 0 2 and 0 1 versus 1 6 and 1 9 rotavirus particles per litre in ssp1 and ssp2 respectively figure 3 and figure s10 although the gcm and rcp patterns in figure 3 may be striking and resulting from variances in river discharge there were limited overall output differences between rcps and gcms in ssp1 or in ssp2 the slightly reduced median concentrations from rcps 2 6 to 6 0 for both gcms was likely due to overall increasing comparative river discharge producing a river dilution effect predicted increases and reductions of river discharge from the baseline in rcp 2 6 and 4 5 at the northwest and southwest of the country in hadgem2 es likely offset their influence on scenario rotavirus concentrations thereby producing limited comparative differences the spatially explicit results across the country show higher river contamination in ssp2 than in ssp1 figure 4 in comparison to the baseline for all rcps ssp2 median concentrations from hadgem2 es and miroc5 increased by between 44 and 75 and mean concentrations were between 25 and 36 higher some differences between gcms were also highlighted as more important than the differences between rcps for miroc5 stronger increases were simulated than in hadgem2 es for both median and mean rotavirus concentrations resulting from the discharge related dilution in hadgem2 es in contrast in ssp1 all gcms and rcps showed strong rotavirus concentration reductions the medians fell by between 100 and 121 and means by between 54 and 61 like in ssp1 across rcps gcm median and mean concentrations were lower in hadgem2 es than in miroc5 when compared to the baseline detailed results are presented in table s7 4 discussion 4 1 the glowpa rota c2 model sensitivity our sensitivity analysis highlighted that strongly reducing k p i t and changes in prevalence and excretion rates of rotavirus influenced the simulated rotavirus concentrations the most orner et al 2019 argued that longer storage or emptying periods contribute more to microbial die off than factors like pit storage temperature ph and moisture content the high k p i t and the consequent large rotavirus storage reductions achieved on site may explain the limited output correlation to changes in emptying frequencies however an emptying event much earlier than the baseline s 3 years likely mobilises more viable rotavirus particles we tested the influence of a much shorter storage time from the baseline s once in 3 years to monthly and obtained 3 orders of magnitude increase in mean rotavirus concentrations interestingly emptying frequencies may even be higher in densely populated areas or in non household sanitation technologies schoebitz et al 2017 2016 the uncertainty in rotavirus shedding is primarily due to limited epidemiological observations whenever present rotavirus incidence and prevalence data are constrained by spatial variability symptomatic and asymptomatic prognosis and inequities between hospitalization and health care access bwogi et al 2016 fuhrimann et al 2016 mwenda et al 2010 troeger et al 2018 for instance a study combined gastroenteritis from various pathogens including rotavirus of 10 9 adults and 8 3 children episodes per person per year for populations along an open drain water system in kampala fuhrimann et al 2016 another study compiled a national rotavirus incidence of 0 694 episodes per person per year from the global burden of disease study troeger et al 2018 likely representing populations along a polluted water system wastewater surveillance could be a better estimator of community faecal pathogen incidence and excretion levels it could be an early warning tool such as recently applied for the coronavirus disease ahmed et al 2020 medema et al 2020 nevertheless high rotavirus incidence rates particularly in children below 5 years and the consequent excretion rates are primary drivers of rotavirus loading as observed in this and other studies ferguson et al 2007 okaali and hofstra 2018 reder 2017 vermeulen et al 2019 4 2 simulating baseline rotavirus river inputs input data and assumptions the results were influenced by model assumptions and input data uncertainties as expected illegal pit flushing in urban areas contributed the largest onsite sanitation share compared to the dumping on water on land or from treated faecal sludge ratio assumptions for illegal faecal sludge disposal were informed by literature and were considered representative for all urban areas which may be unrealistic because of the possible faecal sludge management differences the legally emptied to treatment faecal sludge loadings were largely reduced by the assumed steady state k p i t irrespective of the contemporary storage times as shown by the sensitivity analysis although our sensitivity analysis shows limited influences of changes in illegal disposal ratios fractions and emptying frequencies the glowpa model would benefit from formal and informal faecal sludge management field records however such data are not readily available because unregulated disposal activities are complex to document schoebitz et al 2017 a large section of uganda s rural population uses onsite systems where rotavirus particles were assumed to be safely contained rural open defecation inputs were dependent on surface runoff and the fraction of rotavirus land retention estimated from our literature review although the model was less sensitive to changes in land retention robust approaches and data were limited in the literature grid cells with high runoff were crudely assigned low retention values and vice versa landscape characteristics such as vegetation cover physical and chemical soil properties were assumedly captured in the retention estimates davidson et al 2016 correlated the decreasing recovery of rotavirus in surface runoff to vegetation cover which further decreased virus particle soil infiltration therefore using the data in davidson et al 2016 was our pragmatic choice 4 3 environmental survival and routing of rotavirus concentrations rotavirus river concentrations are dependent on environmental survival pancorbo et al 1987 and ward et al 1986 showed that environmental survival and infectivity variably depend on virus type and matrix conditions we focused on first order rotavirus decay due to temperature and solar radiation in natural surface or representative waters modelling both k s using best fitted log linear relationships obviously the available empirical literature requires updating although the derived k values may be uncertain the sensitivity analysis showed that changes in temperature and sunlight dependent decay were of limited influence and that rotavirus was relatively persistent in fresh surface waters additionally despite not influencing model sensitivity and therefore uncertainty it is likely that local characteristics in rivers such as euphotic water depth z e u used to determine k e and k r vary from location to location notwithstanding high river discharges such as 100 m3s 1 seen from cwatm figure s6 may translate into less residence time for reductions by k t and k r moreover virus inactivation may not always be log linear due to matrix conditions and antiviral agents producing shoulder tailing or biphasic die off kinetics abad et al 1997 pinon and vialette 2018 kraay et al 2018 positively correlated rotavirus decay to water temperature while determining waterborne transmission between communities however their regression analysis generated limited significance to decay for a combination of natural secondary effluent distilled and sterilized water types moreover die off curves of most microbes are typically non linear but can be approximated as a first order exponential decay with characteristic decay particularly under limited data such as resulting from our literature reviews for k t and k r gonzález 1995 the glowpa rota c2 routed rotavirus concentrations from low to high accumulation grids using input data within uganda thus border entry points were not specified and accounted for because neighbouring country input data was not used and river discharge was cropped within uganda s borders however extended fluvial networks are often trans border and mobilise various contaminants therefore we identified 5 most important border grids and estimated river inputs introduced into each of the cells figure s9 notably the most important border grid is the single exit of lake victoria with originally higher discharge values than the median between 800 and 1500 m3s 1 except for this grid the model simulated loads and concentrations travelling downstream but running within the borders of uganda where input data is available the need to adjust for border inflows other than at the lake victoria exit point may currently not be necessary 4 4 rotavirus concentrations in 2050 changes in model output drivers in 2050 rotavirus concentrations will be largely driven by population urbanization and sanitation changes rather than by hydrological inputs in ssp2 more rotavirus contamination was mobilised when more people were using sewerage systems while the adequately treated wastewater proportions remained largely unchanged this means that stronger and more deliberate interventions will need to be adopted to reduce surface water loadings in ssp2 to ssp1 levels in the latter scenario treatment removal was improved by 3 logs in wastewater stabilization ponds non treatment was eliminated and all collected wastewater reached tertiary treatment in conventional systems compared to historical data rcp 6 0 was the most plausible medium climate scenario for the extended lake victoria basin and ssp2 suggested to lead towards rcp 6 0 in 2040 tramberend et al 2020 however gcms may provide limited spatial variability for local regions such as below 200 km resolution at monthly or daily timesteps mendez et al 2020 averaging and exclusion of local features in gcms may explain the limited differences between the rcp outputs in our study the low detailed spatial and temporal resolutions likely aggregate the hydrologic processes dynamics consequential uncertainty may therefore accumulate in the glowpa rota c2 outputs for instance vermeulen et al 2019 found that a version of the glowpa model simulated high cryptosporidium concentrations in some larger rivers moreover the current monthly glowpa rota c2 output resolution does not include flash weather events such as floods however anticipated extremes of uganda s climate towards drier or wetter seasons such as after 2050 may not directly translate into higher or lower pathogen loading into rivers similar model outcomes may also hold for neighbouring countries with projected seasonal precipitation variabilities gebrechorkos et al 2019 where without strong improvements future regional glowpa rota c2 outputs may continue to be largely driven by population urbanization and sanitation coverage 4 5 performance and future potential of the glowpa rota c2 model among others one key approach towards building trust in models for data poor areas and therefore in the glowpa rota c2 model is to compare outputs with observational data strokal 2016 rotavirus is not regularly measured in uganda s surface waters however a recent study measured rotavirus concentrations in an open drain wastewater system in kampala o brien et al 2017 average copies per litre ranged between 1 08 102 1 25 102 in a channel before a wastewater treatment plant 4 22 102 3 77 103 in the influent 1 87 102 3 72 103 in a channel after treatment and 6 49 101 2 99 102 in the draining swamp these ranges fall within the glowpa rota c2 s baseline results particularly closest to the median and mean of 1 and 2 log10 particles per litre respectively vermeulen et al 2019 also simulated cryptosporidium concentrations within the ranges of observed data for various global locations for their version of the glowpa model our sensitivity analysis section 3 1 is another a step towards building model trust it revealed that the glowpa rota c2 model was largely less sensitive to nominal changes in most variables except for pathogen incidence and excretion in faeces this makes both the spatial and numerical outputs relatively reproduceable and dependable highlighting urban hotspot areas with predominant sanitation challenges however obtaining more spatial observation data will help to comprehensively validate the model finally besides sanitation improvement and water quality monitoring applications for sdg6 3 outputs of the glowpa rota c2 could aid estimation of exposure risks and the resultant rotavirus diarrhoeal disease burden with more detailed population sanitation and hydrological data the model could be applied to a local situation or even produce global outputs using country level input data moreover we could learn from various spatial and temporal scale influences generated from both input data types future scenarios could also examine the impacts of mass vaccinations campaigns on concentrations and the diarrhoeal disease burden the model could be applied to other bacteria protozoa virus and helminths pathogens groups like giardia salmonella cholera norovirus and hepatitis although animal sources need to be considered where applicable 5 conclusions the glowpa rota c2 model simulated spatially explicit rotavirus river inputs and concentrations at subnational levels for uganda from both onsite and offsite point and diffuse sanitation sources urban open defecation treated wastewater effluent and the unsafe faecal sludge disposal contributed the largest shares to rotavirus river loadings for the baseline year 2015 major hotspots of rotavirus contamination are the densely populated urban centres with predominant sanitation challenges typical in slum dwellings the modelling framework showed that stronger and deliberate interventions including ending open defecation safe management of faecal sludge adequate wastewater treatment and reducing untreated proportions should be adopted otherwise the rotavirus or similar pathogen loading into surface water will not be reduced for future scenarios population growth urbanization and inadequate sanitation are stronger contamination drivers than climate change to our knowledge rotavirus rivers concentrations have been modelled for the first time applied to uganda but replicable elsewhere besides informing sdg6 3 progress monitoring aiding sanitation service level and microbial water quality management simulated rotavirus concentrations can be inputs for quantitative microbial risk

we investigated dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration and ch4 diffusive fluxes in 27 river segments of two 4th order and three 3rd order tributary rivers to the yangtze river in china which drained land

concentration of this greenhouse gas has increased by 150 since the beginning of the industrial era ipcc 2014 rivers have been documented as an important natural source of atmospheric ch4 bastviken et al 2011 borges et al 2015 kirschke et al 2013 and the recent estimate of ch4 emission from global river networks is approximately 26 8 tg ch4 y 1 stanley et al 2016 which is about 5 of the global annual methane emissions estimated by saunois et al 2016 i e 558 tg ch4 y 1 a growing number of studies have demonstrated that rivers play a pivotal role in regional and global ch4 budget bastviken et al 2011 crawford and stanley 2016 stanley et al 2016 upstill goddard et al 2017 especially from aquatic ecosystems however considerable uncertainties exist in the estimation of riverine methane emission as its contribution has been presented in a range of 15 to 40 from world s wetlands and lakes stanley et al 2016 the low solubility of ch4 contributes to ch4 outgassing in a short distance as water moves downstream billett and harvey 2013 the spatial heterogeneity and relatively limited measurements of ch4 compared with riverine pco2 in river systems contribute to the large uncertainty of ch4 budgets from inland freshwaters stanley et al 2016 therefore field observations of ch4 emission from rivers in different climatic regions and land use land cover types are needed to refine riverine carbon budgets from regional to global scales the source transformation and evasion of ch4 in river systems are reported to be strongly affected by anthropogenic activities e g land use land cover changes borges et al 2018a crawford and stanley 2016 looman et al 2019 and river damming abril et al 2005 jin et al 2018 human activities such as urban development and agricultural practices generally increase point and diffusive source pollutants into waterways via surface runoff and wastewater blann et al 2009 bowen and valiela 2001 walsh et al 2005 changes in forest ecosystems can affect ch4 uptake rates of soils borken et al 2003 which may have influence on organic carbon fluxes from soils to streams inputs of organic matter and nutrients from surface runoff and point source discharges would enhance biological metabolism and dissolved oxygen consumption which benefit the anaerobic production of ch4 blaszczak et al 2019 grinham et al 2018 impoundments and other river engineering e g levee construction cutoff and channel dredging could change sediment transport and water residence time further modifying in stream ch4 production angela et al 2007 bai et al 2021 guerin et al 2006 inland water eutrophication due to excess nutrients could fuel primary production leading to increasing ch4 production including oxic and anaerobic ch4 production bizic et al 2020 crawford et al 2016 mei et al 2021 concentration and emission of dissolved ch4 from rivers and streams can be influenced by oxygen conditions alternative electron acceptors e g nitrate sulfate and ferric iron zengler et al 1999 channel geomorphology and stream network jones and mulholland 1998 for example borges and others 2019 found that headwater streams strahler s stream orders of 1 4 accounted for 90 of the total ch4 degassing 91 9 in the congo river network as urbanization accelerates and human population continues growing loads of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus have been found in increasing magnitude in many world s rivers qin et al 2014 tang et al 2019 several recent studies have reported that rivers draining urbanized areas enhanced ch4 outgassing crawford and stanley 2016 jin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however in general there exists a knowledge gap on how ch4 transport and transformation in low order streams are affected by land use nutrient and organic carbon loads such information can be crucial for quantifying and predicting the impact of urbanization and increased nutrients on emission and changing characters of riverine ch4 in rapidly developing watersheds in this study we conducted field measurements on dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration and estimated ch4 diffusive emission for the surface water of five low order rivers that drain land areas with varied urbanization intensities in the chongqing municipality china since the chinese central government promotes a west development strategy that intends to modernize the region the chongqing municipality region is experiencing rapid urbanization the five study rivers are tributaries of the upper yangtze river located within the three gorges reservoir tgr area our objectives in this study are to 1 comparatively examine the relationship between fluvial dch4 and the intense human land uses i e urban land use and farmland use 2 explore the dch4 and ch4 diffusive fluxes dynamics in the rivers in relation to urban land use intensities 3 underscore controlling factors and couplings between dch4 and physicochemical factors in these rivers we aim to test the hypothesis that urban land use increases riverine dch4 and alters the relationships of dch4 with physicochemical factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design

method of dissolved co2 dco2 concentration was described by tang et al 2021 2 3 estimation of ch4 diffusive fluxes dch4 was calculated using henry s law johnson et al 1990 weiss 1974 as follows 1 d c

preferably recommended for streams and small rivers raymond et al 2012 and was widely adopted in studies on headwater streams looman et al 2021 schade et al 2016 polluted urban river wang et al 2020 congo river network borges et al 2019 and especially in global riverine greenhouse gas efflux estimation lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 in order to assess the impact of the model on k600 the ray01 model k600 vs 0 89 d0 54 20988 d is average depth in m raymond et al 2012 and alin03 model k600 13 82 35v alin et al 2011 that are also suitable for low order and small rivers were used for comparison table s2 several models used here are expected to obtain more reliable and reasonable k values bracketing the likely magnitude of the ch4 areal flux the ray05 model was used here because that 1 the areal flux from the model was comparable to the alin03 model and 2 we specifically used the model that has been widely used for streams and small rivers allowing direct comparison with previous studies ray05 model listed in the supporting material 2 4 data quality and uncertainty the ph do and ec probe was separately calibrated prior to measurement the relative error of replicated measuring of tn tp nh4 n and no3 n was less than 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate with coefficient of variance 2 the inherent natures of mountainous small rivers consisting of repetitive reaches of riffles rapids and pools contributed to the high coefficient of variation cv of riverine dch4 and the gas transfer velocity kokic et al 2018 lilley et al 1996 for example site specific effects may overwhelm the role of sewage treatment infrastructure on dch4 in urban stream and the k600 value would span over two orders of magnitude in small rivers raymond et al 2012 smith et al 2017 in this study we sampled running waters and avoided the location of sewage discharge outlet the estimated k600 ranged largely from 8 4 cm h 1 to 51 1 cm h 1 with an average of 15 5 9 1 cm h 1 median of 13 3 cm h 1 the average is lower than value from the ray01 model 28 4 30 8 cm h 1 median of 16 3 cm h 1 while comparable to the value from the alin03 model 18 8 6 8 cm h 1 median of 17 3 cm h 1 our estimated k600 fell in the lower ranges reported for streams and rivers table s2 and much lower than the values reported for many other rivers such as small rivers to the three gorges reservoir 48 4 53 2 cm h 1 measured by chambers li et al 2019 urban streams in usa 10 510 8 cm h 1 median 55 2 cm h 1 measured by tracer gas smith et al 2017 and the values used for global rivers 23 3 25 9 cm h 1 lauerwald et al 2015 our k600 are comparable to those reported by raymond et al 2012 for streams and small rivers in usa mean 19 6 cm h 1 measured with tracer gas this suggests that dch4 may have greater control on the estimation of fch4 yu et al 2017 here we only reported the diffusion which was considered conservative in respect to riverine total ch4 emission for example ebullition could contribute 20 80 of methane emissions in streams with high organic matter in sediment according to the previous studies by baulch et al 2011 grinham et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020 although the mountainous rivers here with higher streamflow velocity may constrain the ebullition formation baulch et al 2011 direct measurements of k and total flux measurement are recommended to obtain more credible estimations 2 5 statistical analyses land use land cover types within each of the 27 river segments were analyzed using the remote sensing data in 2017 gong et al 2019 digital elevation model dem data in 10 m resolution were obtained from china s geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn these satellite images and dem data were processed with arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca before statistical analysis all data was tested for normality and homogeneity using shapiro wilk and levene s test and non normal data were logarithmically transformed when necessary simple linear regressions and stepwise multiple linear regression were employed to explore the relationship between dch4 land use land cover types and physical and chemical parameters statistically significant differences in dch4 and water physical and chemical indicators among three groups based on urban land use were determined using analysis of variance anova and mann whitney test a significance level of p at 0 05 was used all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 24 and originpro 8 0 ibm corp new york usa all figures were prepared using originpro 8 0 3 result 3 1 variability

table 1 these concentrations exceeded by far the water atmosphere equilibrium values 43 20220 nmol l 1 above the saturation concentration indicating significant oversaturation of ch4 in the headwater rivers simple linear regression showed that dch4 had a significantly positive relationship with urban land cover r2 0 32 p 0 01 and a negative relationship with forest land cover r2 0 23 p 0 05 the poor fitting result between dch4 and farmland use was observed r2 0 01 p 0 58 fig 2 dch4 showed an obvious increasing trend along the urban land use gradient p 0 05 fig 3 the mean dch4 3546 6770 nmol

highest urban land use proportion tn and tp concentrations and higher doc and lower do if this extreme dch4 value was excluded averaged dch4 in u3 was still the highest fig s2a the higher cv 1 9 in u3 suggests highly variable dch4 in urban areas the estimated fch4 showed an average of 3 06 6 03 mmol m 2 d 1 median 1 87 mmol m 2 d 1 ranging from 0 16 to 44 16 mmol m 2 d 1 table 1 the mean ch4 flux from the urban group u3 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 was approximately 4 and 5 times that of the mixed land group u2 2 13 2 04 mmol m 2 d 1 and the rural group u1 1 91 1 42 mmol m 2 d 1 respectively 3 2 variability of environmental parameters the riverine environmental parameters were closely reflective to land use land cover types with increasing percentage of urban land use nutrients including tp tn no3 n and nh4 n showed an increasing trend p 0 01 conversely do showed a decreasing trend p 0 001 fig 3 in the river segments with the highest urban land coverage i e group u3 tn and tp concentrations reached at 3 61 and 0 41 mg l 1 3 times higher than those of the river segments with the lowest urban land coverage i e group u1 and 2 times higher than those in the mixed group u2 no3 n was the dominant nitrogen form accounting for 52 to 95 of tn the percentage of nh4 n in tn displayed an increasing trend in the river waters draining increasing urban land area accounting for 2 4 and 6 in u1 u2 and u3 respectively no consistent changing trend was found in other environmental parameters while the river water in group u3 had the highest mean values of doc chl a and tss but the lowest mean values of v and ph table s3 3 3 relationships between dch4 and physio chemical factors dch4 concentrations showed a significantly negative correlation with streamflow velocities r2 0 14 p

concentrations tn nh4 n no3 n and tp could explain a large amount of the variation in dch4 concentration r2 0 59 p 0 001 table 2 the explanatory power and predictors of riverine dch4 among three urbanization intensity groups were different in group u3 urban areas tn and no3 n were a strong predictor for dch4 r2 0 96 p 0 001 in group u2 mixed land use areas dch4 concentration could be best explained by a combination of tn tp do and chl a r2 0 75 p 0 001 in group u1 rural areas however dch4 concentration could not be explained by nutrient conditions but could only weakly explained by river water ph r2 0 27 p 0 05 river bed sediment seemed to have had a strong impact on riverine dch4 level mean dch4 concentrations in the 27 river segments increased with the decreasing particle size p 0 001 fig 5 a the dch4 concentrations were significantly lower in the segments with boulder beds than with silty sandy and cobble beds p 0 001 significant difference in dch4 concentration was also found between cobble and fine grained sediments such as sand and silt p 0 05 grouping the samples based on the sediment type the mean dch4 concentrations had a very close correlation with the doc

land use and its potential control this study shows a clear association of fluvial dch4 concentration with the urbanization intensity in the drainage area r2 0 32 p 0 01 the general trend is apparent as urban land coverage proportion increases dch4 concentration increases similar results were found in other rivers that drain largely urbanized areas in china for instance in the chaohu lake basin zhang et al 2021 the metropolitan area of shanghai yu et al 2017 and streams draining the metropolitan area of chongqing wang et al 2018 the mean dch4 concentration found in this study 615 627 nmol l 1 in the rural group u1 with an urban land coverage of 2 was comparable to that reported for the tributaries of the hudson river 633 93 nmol l 1 in suburban rural area brigham et al 2019 and streams mean of 630 nmol l 1 within the great bay watershed herreid et al 2020 but slightly higher than the han river mean of 529 nmol l 1 affected by agriculture jin et al 2018 the range of dch4 concentration in the mixed land group u2 73 3291 nmol l 1 was similar to those reported from the rivers in northwest canada 4 3333 nmol l 1 hutchins et al 2020 and the mean dch4 concentration in this group 764 708 nmol l 1 was comparable to those reported for the rivers in tropic forested land and farmland in india selvam et al 2014 700 600 nmol l 1 in comparison the mean dch4 concentration 3546 6770 nmol l 1 in the highly developed group u3 with an urban land coverage ranging from 20 to 46 was substantially higher than those found in many other rivers draining urban and agricultural areas table s4 the overall mean dch4 concentration 1121 2758 nmol l 1 found in our study is close to the average value of global rivers 1350 5160 nmol l 1 stanley et al 2016 the global data highlights the urbanization influence on riverine dch4 concentration urban expansion and development can lead to enrichment of nutrients and organic carbon in adjacent streams and rivers thus elevating fluvial ecosystem carbon metabolism and carbon loss chang 2008 rosemond et al 2015 shi et al 2017 comparing with the chinese state standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 tn in the rural group u1 mixed land group u2 and urbanized group u3 all exceeded the maximum permissible levels of grades iii iv and v respectively and tp in u3 also exceeded the maximum permissible levels of grade v the more deteriorated the water quality is the higher the roman numeral is doc concentration found in the u3 group segments was higher than those in the u1 and u2 group segments table s3 this is consistent with the fact that more urbanized area caused export higher organic carbon and nutrients loadings including tn nh4 n no3 n and phosphorus in adjacent aquatic ecosystem pereda et al 2021 shields et al 2008 the urban impacted rivers are also influenced by municipal infrastructure for example wastewater leakage from municipal sewers can contributed more than 50 of n in urban stream smith et al 2017 at the same time rivers draining urban area can receive waste water treatment plant wwtp effluent thereby increasing riverine ch4 concentration alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 for instance dch4 and doc from effluents of wwtp in germany have been reported to be approximately 40 and 2 times higher than those in their upstream waters 6 5 5 μmol l 1 vs 0 16 0 07 μmol l 1 for dch4 13 2 mg l 1 vs 5 8 1 7 mg l 1 for doc alshboul et al 2016 in this study the second highest value of dch4 concentration 3291 nmol l 1 was found at site thr 3 during the dry season likely due to the effluent of a wwtp that was located 500 m upstream of the sampling location therefore the higher dch4 in u2 and u3 with higher urban land percent fig 3a suggests that anthropogenic inputs are an important ch4 source this is shown by the positive relationship between dch4 and nutrients tn and tp figs 4d and 4e because higher nutrient loadings are closely linked to the lateral inputs of untreated sewage and wastewater pipe networks this explanation was also supported by the strong relationship between dch4 and doc fig 5b based on sediment type because doc is usually a good indicator of terrestrial input this should not be surprising since small rivers have higher edge to water volume ratios and thus show strong links with terrestrial system and are more affected by fast urbanization process liu and raymond 2018 qin et al 2014 fluvial ch4 is controlled by oxic and anoxic conditions in river water and riverbed sediment under reduction conditions ch4 is formed through the microbial turnover of organic matter under oxic conditions ch4 can be oxidized to co2 the oxidation process can be favored by turbulence and wind stanley et al 2016 with rapid urbanization there has been a conversion of forests to urban areas at the reach scale as indicated by their negative relationship fig s3a increase of both impervious land surface construction activities and concentrated domestic sewage discharge is common characteristics of urbanization resulting in increasing surface runoff surface soil erosion paul and meyer 2001 and contaminant transport pereda et al 2021 yoon et al 2017 previous studies indicated that low dissolved oxygen and concentrations of sediment contaminants were positively correlated with percent of urban land use dauer et al 2000 this is consistent with our observation that the average do decreased with increasing urban land percentage fig 3b for instance the mean do in the u3 decreased to 64 3 correspond to 6 0 mg l prior studies showed that particle size of sediment decreased with increasing organic matter content and nutrients e g phosphorus evans et al 1990 palmer felgate et al 2009 these factors could explain our observation that the grain size was inversely related to urban land proportion fig s4 except the sand type moreover fine riverbed sediments are known to create anoxic conditions through blocking the gravel interstices limiting oxygen exchange enabling methanogen growth and favoring ch4 production trimmer et al 2012 large coarse gravels contain much less organic matter resulting in lower ch4 and doc concentrations in interstitial water comer warner et al 2019 trimmer et al 2010 in addition better oxygen exchange in gravel riverbed helps oxidize dch4 to co2 presenting a sink of ch4 and doc comer warner et al 2019 shelley et al 2015 trimmer et al 2010 compared with gravels sand sediments have higher microbial activity comer warner et al 2019 methanogen abundance interstitial water doc and ch4 concentrations buriankova et al 2012 thus urban land use likely results in riverine sediments that are more conducive to methanogenesis through delivery of nutrient and organic matter rich fine grained sediments agricultural land use has been found to be a key driver for riverine ch4 production kaushal et al 2014 since nutrient runoff from both surface erosion and leaching can lead to enhanced in stream metabolism borges et al 2018a qin et al 2020 however we found no relationship between farmland and fluvial dch4 this was possibly due to statistical analysis of land use at different scales similar to studies in relation to land use and water quality for instance urban land had a larger effect on river water quality at small scales e g reach or riparian scale than at large scales e g catchment scale whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects shi et al 2017 moreover hydrological seasonality could shift the coupling between farmland and fluvial dch4 figs s3b and c the negative relationships between riverine dch4 and farmland in the dry season similar to the observed result in the great bay watershed of usa were potentially due to the presence of excess terminal electron acceptor that can suppress ch4 production such as fe3 no3 and so4 2 herreid et al 2020 this explanation was supported by the higher ec 413 142 μs cm 1 in the dry seasons than in the wet seasons 325 89 μs cm 1 which generally reflects ion concentration the peak value and general higher dch4 in the dry season average of twater was 13 c than wet season average of twater was 25 c figs s1a s3b and c imply that the surface runoff accompanied by leaching from agricultural soils was not the dominant control on riverine dch4 although a weak positive correlation exists between farmland and fluvial dch4 in the wet season fig s3c urban land is unarguably the most important and persistent driver of high fluvial dch4 carpenter et al 1998 wu et al 2019 4 2 the roles of riverine physicochemical factors ch4 dynamics in a river system is highly complex first biogenic methanogenesis generally occurs under strictly anoxic conditions by methanogenic archaea liu and whitman 2008 second methane is readily oxidized by aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria to produce co2 in oxygen rich rivers shelley et al 2015 stanley et al 2016 for example deangelis and scranton 1993 found that methanotrophs could oxidize up to 70 of the ch4 produced in the hudson river during summer times matousu et al 2017 also reported that methanotrophs oxidized 41 12 and 5 3 of ch4 during summer autumn and winter spring respectively in the elbe estuary this is consistent with our findings that show the decreasing trend of dch4 with the increase of streamflow velocity and do figs 4a and c small rivers in mountainous regions usually have rapid flow and thus short retention time that help aeration as well as the high abundance of methanotrophs up to 26 3 of the total microbial community unpublished data suggest the transformation from ch4 to co2 a co variation of dch4 and dco2 has been previously reported for the amazon river richey et al 1988 boreal rivers in québec canada campeau and del giorgio 2014 the urban rivers in baltimore united states smith et al 2017 and the meuse river in belgium borges et al 2018a these studies speculated that either most of co2 was derived directly from methanogenesis or dissolved co2 and ch4 had a same source in this study we found a negative relationship between the dch4 and ph fig 4b and table 2 as well as a distinctly higher molar ratio of ch4 co2 0 0151 0 0106 ranging from 0 0010 to 0 0538 when compared to those reported for tropical rivers 0 0097 marine waters 0 0005 and atmosphere 0 005 borges et al 2019 the higher methane concentrations should have favored oxidation resulting in more co2 production thereby decreasing ph hence the findings from this study seem to support the above speculation excessive loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen generally result in river eutrophication carpenter et al 1998 according to the trophic classification by dodds dodds et al 1998 dodds and welch 2000 river waters in this study at 27 sites can be classified mesotrophic or eutrophic for tn and tp the growth of algae can have different effects on dch4 the increasing amount of oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis can account for the negative coefficients of both chl a and do in the dch4 stepwise multiple regression model for the mixed land group u2 with the lowest chl a concentration 2 18 1 79 μg l 1 tables 2 and s3 on the other hand the increasing algal c would enhance methanogenesis through decaying and settling onto riverbed sediments borges et al 2018b gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 in addition mounting evidence demonstrates that freshwater phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria can produce ch4 in oxic conditions though the ch4 production rates of cyanobacteria are three to four orders of magnitude lower than the ch4 production rates noted for typical methanogenic archaea bizic et al 2020 gunthel et al 2020 this may also partially explain the positive power relationship between chl a and dch4 is found for all data in this study fig 4f we found that tn acted as the most important factor influencing dch4 especially in river reaches with urban percentage 2 table 2 high n loading can alleviate c limitation to microbes liu and greaver 2009 however a negative correlation between ch4 and tn was also observed in human influenced streams in baltimore smith et al 2017 and wisconsin crawford and stanley 2016 in the united states this could be attributed to the fact that n input can stimulate activities of both methanogenic archaea and methanotropic bacteria thereby affecting the balance of the two processes depending on n forms bodelier and laanbroek 2004 ammonium can inhibit ch4 oxidation through competing for methane monooxygenase or enhancing nitrification which can oxidize methane bodelier and laanbroek 2004 nitrate has been also found to decrease ch4 production through suppressing the activities of methanogen through elevating redox potentials le mer and roger 2001 in addition no3 n can be reduced to ammonium in aquatic systems giblin et al 2013 and therefore this microbial process can potentially alter the relationship between nitrogen and ch4 schade et al 2016 reported both positive and negative relations of ch4 with no3 n in some streams in new hampshire mccrackin and elser 2011 attributed increased no3 n to reduced ch4 concentration in some lake systems so did dodla et al 2009 in some wetlands however there was no significant relationship between ch4 and no3 n or nh4 n found in streams within the great bay watershed herreid et al 2020 and seine marescaux et al 2018 these findings indicate that drivers and inhibitors of ch4 production or oxidation may not be universal across different systems herreid et al 2020 and the ch4 concentration is a balance of production oxidation lateral inputs and emission liu and greaver 2009 stanley et al 2016 this may be the reason for the variable relationships between tn nh4 n no3 n and dch4 found in our study table 2 on the other hand the relationship between ch4 and nitrogen species varied when attendant transformations of no3 n or nh4 n are spatially segregated from ch4 production crawford and stanley 2016 nonetheless the three n species showed a consistent trend with dch4 based on the urbanization gradient groups fig 3 this also implies that terrestrial input with higher pollution load can be a crucial factor affecting riverine dch4 4 3 importance of riverine ch4 diffusive flux our estimates of fch4 0 16 to 44 16 mmol m 2 d 1 fall in the range of the reported values for many rivers in the world table s4 the mean fch4 3 06 6 03 mmol m 2 d 1 was comparable to the flux rates found in a 1st order stream in new hampshire 3 6 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 k600 estimated with the ray05 model schade et al 2016 the estimated fch4 in the urban group u3 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 in our study is higher than those found in most rivers listed in table s4 but it is comparable to the average of global rivers 8 22 25 50 mmol m 2 d 1 stanley et al 2016 and is lower than those reported by borges et al 2019 for the tropical congo river 12 55 2 25 mmol m 2 d 1 ray05 model the local diffusive flux patterns are contributable to a combination of concentration and gas transfer velocity sawakuchi et al 2014 there is a significantly increasing trend of fch4 from the rural group u1 1 91 1 42 mmol m 2 d 1 and the mixed land group u2 2 13 2 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to the urban group u3 whilst the k values were comparable p 0 05 in three groups table 1 suggesting that dch4 was the determinant in fch4 estimation schade et al 2016 also found that fch4 in a stream 3 6 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 with higher no3 n and doc concentrations was almost 6 times the flux in a stream 0 62 0 46 mmol m 2 d 1 with lower no3 n and doc here k600 was 17 5 1 7 cm h 1 and 14 2 2 1 cm h 1 respectively gas transfer velocity can be affected by a number of physical factors such as stream channel morphology channel slope streamflow velocity and wind speed alin et al 2011 kokic et al 2018 raymond and cole 2001 raymond et al 2012 direct measurement of gas exchange velocity is limited in small lotic freshwater systems alin et al 2011 and many studies use models of gas exchange velocity with ambient variables that are easier to measure e g wind speed borges et al 2004 raymond and cole 2001 tobias et al 2009 wanninkhof 1992 streamflow velocity alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 or a combination of the two variables alin et al 2011 the empirical equations of gas exchange velocity for streams and small rivers from floating chambers or tracer gas method showed that streamflow velocity rather than wind speed was the dominant control of k600 in these systems alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 due to the inherent uncertainty in assessing gas transfer velocity we used three models to provide the likely range fig s5 and found that the fch4 estimated from ray05 model is comparable to the value estimated from alin03 model 3 97 8 45 mmol m 2 d 1 but is lower than the value obtained from ray01 model by on average 60 the largest range of fch4 estimates from ray01 model fig s5 is likely because this model is more sensitive to streamflow velocity raymond et al 2012 but there were no significant differences among the three estimated fch4 fig s5a therefore fch4 estimated using ray05 model is relatively conservative while it is meaningful for the comparison of the ch4 fluxes in our study with other studies using similar k600 models listed in table s4 all river reaches in this study can be regarded as a source of ch4 to the atmosphere as their contribution is modified by land use land cover types and urbanization intensity a win win strategy of reducing nutrient loadings and ch4 emission should be taken under the frame of international sustainable development goal sdg and china s national carbon neutral given that urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future more attention should be paid to assessing local and regional ch4 diffusive fluxes from rivers that drain rapid urbanization areas 5 conclusion in this study we found that dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration in headwaters and low order rivers in the upper yangtze river basin are more related to urban land use than farmland use on the reach scale urbanization clearly increases riverine loadings of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and decreases dissolved oxygen do contributing to elevated riverine dch4 and ch4 diffusive emissions to the atmosphere streamflow velocity and bottom sediment types also affect the reach scale distribution of dch4 as they can influence river oxic and anoxic conditions riverine dch4 shows a strong relationship with water quality indicators including tn tp do ph and chl a p 0 01 tn is the key parameter for predicting dch4 in river waters that drain urbanized land areas based on these findings we conclude that rapid urbanization in headwater catchments will substantially increase

16654,rivers and streams play a central role in global carbon budget but our knowledge is limited on the magnitude and extent of urbanization influence on riverine methane ch4 dynamics in this study we investigated dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration and ch4 diffusive fluxes in 27 river segments of two 4th order and three 3rd order tributary rivers to the yangtze river in china which drained land areas with varied urbanization intensities we found that urban development was the key factor responsible for high fluvial dch4 concentration and diffusive flux exceeding the influence of agricultural farming and these headwater rivers were over saturated in ch4 with respect to atmospheric equilibrium dch4 concentration 3546 6770 nmol l 1 in the river segments draining higher urban area 20 urban land proportion 46 was 5 6 times higher than those 615 627 nmol l 1 and 764 708 nmol l 1 in the river segments draining less urban area 0 1 urban land proportion 2 and 2 urban land proportion 20 river segments draining higher urban area also acted as important sources of ch4 to the atmosphere 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 total nitrogen tn concentration in river water showed the best prediction capacity when compared to other water parameters based on urban land use grouping nutrient elements could predict dch4 well in rivers draining higher urban areas urban 2 which also reflected the lateral input of pollutants tn ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus river bottom sediment fraction contributed to trapping organic matter and nutrients as well as to oxic and anoxic conditions thereby determining reach scale spatial patterns of dch4 concentration these findings highlight that combining distal geomorphic and hydrologic drivers can be effective in determining the relationship between riverine ch4 and the proximal controls e g nutrients dissolved oxygen dissolved organic carbon as well as in identifying their key drivers being rapid urbanization a common feature of catchments worldwide our

three gorges reservoir tgr catchment 1 introduction as a powerful greenhouse gas atmospheric methane ch4 has 34 fold global warming potential in comparison to co2 over 100 years the atmospheric concentration of this greenhouse gas has increased by 150 since the beginning of the industrial era ipcc 2014 rivers have been documented as an important natural source of atmospheric ch4 bastviken et al 2011 borges et al 2015 kirschke et al 2013 and the recent estimate of ch4 emission from global river networks is approximately 26 8 tg ch4 y 1 stanley et al 2016 which is about 5 of the global annual methane emissions estimated by saunois et al 2016 i e 558 tg ch4 y 1 a growing number of studies have demonstrated that rivers play a pivotal role in regional and global ch4 budget bastviken et al 2011 crawford and stanley 2016 stanley et al 2016 upstill goddard et al 2017 especially from aquatic ecosystems however considerable uncertainties exist in the estimation of riverine methane emission as its contribution has been presented in a range of 15 to 40 from world s wetlands and lakes stanley et al 2016 the low solubility of ch4 contributes to ch4 outgassing in a short distance as water moves downstream billett and harvey 2013 the spatial heterogeneity and relatively limited measurements of ch4 compared with riverine pco2 in river systems contribute to the large uncertainty of ch4 budgets from inland freshwaters stanley et al 2016 therefore field observations of ch4 emission from rivers in different climatic regions and land use land cover types are needed to refine riverine carbon budgets from regional to global scales the source transformation and evasion of ch4 in river systems are reported to be strongly affected by anthropogenic activities e g land use land cover changes borges et al 2018a crawford and stanley 2016 looman et al 2019 and river damming abril et al 2005 jin et al 2018 human activities such as urban development and agricultural practices generally increase point and diffusive source pollutants into waterways via surface runoff and wastewater blann et al 2009 bowen and valiela 2001 walsh et al 2005 changes in forest ecosystems can affect ch4 uptake rates of soils borken et al 2003 which may have influence on organic carbon fluxes from soils to streams inputs of organic matter and nutrients from surface runoff and point source discharges would enhance biological metabolism and dissolved oxygen consumption which benefit the anaerobic production of ch4 blaszczak et al 2019 grinham et al 2018 impoundments and other river engineering e g levee construction cutoff and channel dredging could change sediment transport and water residence time further modifying in stream ch4 production angela et al 2007 bai et al 2021 guerin et al 2006 inland water eutrophication due to excess nutrients could fuel primary production leading to increasing ch4 production including oxic and anaerobic ch4 production bizic et al 2020 crawford et al 2016 mei et al 2021 concentration and emission of dissolved ch4 from rivers and streams can be influenced by oxygen conditions alternative electron acceptors e g nitrate sulfate and ferric iron zengler et al 1999 channel geomorphology and stream network jones and mulholland 1998 for example borges and others 2019 found that headwater streams strahler s stream orders of 1 4

2016 jin et al 2018 wang et al 2021 wang et al 2018 yu et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 however in general there exists a knowledge gap on how ch4 transport and transformation in low order streams are affected by land use nutrient and organic carbon loads such information can be crucial for quantifying and predicting the impact of urbanization and increased nutrients on emission and changing characters of riverine ch4 in rapidly developing watersheds in this study we conducted field measurements on dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration and estimated ch4 diffusive emission for the surface water of five low order rivers that drain land areas with varied urbanization intensities in the chongqing municipality china since the chinese central government promotes a west development strategy that intends to modernize the region the chongqing municipality region is experiencing rapid urbanization the five study rivers are tributaries of the upper yangtze river located within the three gorges

dch4 and ch4 diffusive fluxes dynamics in the rivers in relation to urban land use intensities 3 underscore controlling factors and couplings between dch4 and physicochemical factors in these rivers we aim to test the hypothesis that urban land use increases riverine dch4 and alters the relationships of dch4 with physicochemical factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design

preferably recommended for streams and small rivers raymond et al 2012 and was widely adopted in studies on headwater streams looman et al 2021 schade et al 2016 polluted urban river wang et al 2020 congo river network borges et al 2019 and especially in global riverine greenhouse gas efflux estimation lauerwald et al 2015 raymond et al 2013 in order to assess the impact of the model on k600 the ray01 model k600 vs 0 89 d0 54 20988 d is average depth in m raymond et al 2012 and alin03 model k600 13 82 35v alin et al 2011 that are also suitable for low order and small rivers were used for comparison table s2 several models used here are expected to obtain more reliable and reasonable k values bracketing the likely magnitude of the ch4 areal flux the ray05 model was used here because that 1 the areal flux from the model was comparable to the alin03 model and 2 we specifically used the model that has been widely used for streams and small rivers allowing direct comparison with previous studies ray05 model listed in the supporting material 2 4 data quality and uncertainty the ph do and ec probe was separately calibrated prior to measurement the relative error of replicated measuring of tn tp nh4 n and no3 n was less than 5 doc concentrations were determined in triplicate with coefficient of variance 2 the inherent natures of mountainous small rivers consisting of repetitive reaches of riffles rapids and pools contributed to the high coefficient of variation cv of riverine dch4 and the gas transfer velocity kokic et al 2018 lilley et al 1996 for example site specific effects may overwhelm the role of sewage treatment infrastructure on dch4 in urban stream and the k600 value would span over two orders of magnitude in small rivers raymond et al 2012 smith et al 2017 in this study we sampled running waters and avoided the location of sewage discharge outlet the estimated k600 ranged largely from 8 4 cm h 1 to 51 1 cm h 1 with an average of 15 5 9 1 cm h 1 median of 13 3 cm h 1 the average is lower than value from the ray01 model 28 4 30 8 cm h 1 median of 16 3 cm h 1 while comparable to the value from the alin03 model 18 8 6 8 cm h 1 median of 17 3 cm h 1 our estimated k600 fell in the lower ranges reported for streams and rivers table s2 and much lower than the values reported for many other rivers such as small rivers to the three gorges reservoir 48 4 53 2 cm h 1 measured by chambers li et al 2019 urban streams in usa 10 510 8 cm h 1 median 55 2 cm h 1 measured by tracer gas smith et al 2017 and the values used for global rivers 23 3 25 9 cm h 1 lauerwald et al 2015 our k600 are comparable to those reported by raymond et al 2012 for streams and small rivers in usa mean 19 6 cm h 1 measured with tracer gas this suggests that dch4 may have greater control on the estimation of fch4 yu et al 2017 here we only reported the diffusion which was considered conservative in respect to riverine total ch4 emission for example ebullition could contribute 20 80 of methane emissions in streams with high organic matter in sediment according to the previous studies by baulch et al 2011 grinham et al 2018 wang et al 2021 and zhang et al 2020 although the mountainous rivers here with higher streamflow velocity may constrain the ebullition formation baulch et al 2011 direct measurements of k and total flux measurement are recommended to obtain more credible estimations 2 5 statistical analyses land use land cover types within each of the 27 river segments were analyzed using the remote sensing data in 2017 gong et al 2019 digital elevation model dem data in 10 m resolution were obtained from china s geospatial data cloud www gscloud cn these satellite images and dem data were processed with arcgis 10 2 esri redlands ca before statistical analysis all data was tested for normality and homogeneity using shapiro wilk and levene s test and non normal data were logarithmically transformed when necessary simple linear regressions and stepwise multiple linear regression were employed to explore the relationship between dch4 land use land cover types and physical and chemical parameters statistically significant differences in dch4 and water physical and chemical indicators among three groups based on urban land use were determined using analysis of variance anova and mann whitney test a significance level of

highest urban land use proportion tn and tp concentrations and higher doc and lower do if this extreme dch4 value was excluded averaged dch4 in u3 was still the highest fig s2a the higher cv 1 9 in u3

variability of environmental parameters the riverine environmental parameters were closely reflective to land use land cover types with increasing percentage of urban land use nutrients including tp

as urban land coverage proportion increases dch4 concentration increases similar results were found in other rivers that drain largely urbanized areas in china for instance in the chaohu lake basin zhang et al 2021 the metropolitan area of shanghai yu et al 2017 and streams draining the metropolitan area of chongqing wang et al 2018 the mean dch4 concentration found in this study 615 627 nmol l 1 in the rural group u1 with an urban land coverage of 2 was comparable to that reported for the tributaries of the hudson river 633 93 nmol l 1 in suburban rural area brigham et al 2019 and streams mean of 630 nmol l 1 within the great bay watershed herreid et al 2020 but slightly higher than the han river mean of 529 nmol l 1 affected by agriculture jin et al 2018 the range of dch4 concentration in the mixed land group u2 73 3291 nmol l 1 was similar to those reported from the rivers in northwest canada 4 3333 nmol l 1 hutchins et al 2020 and the mean dch4 concentration in this group 764 708 nmol l 1 was comparable to those reported for the rivers in tropic forested land and farmland in india selvam et al 2014 700 600 nmol l 1 in comparison the mean dch4 concentration 3546 6770 nmol l 1 in the highly developed group u3 with an urban land coverage ranging from 20 to 46 was substantially higher than those found in many other rivers draining urban and agricultural areas table s4 the overall mean dch4 concentration 1121 2758 nmol l 1 found in our study is close to the average value of global rivers 1350 5160 nmol l 1 stanley et al 2016 the global data highlights the urbanization influence on riverine dch4 concentration urban expansion and development can lead to enrichment of nutrients and organic carbon in adjacent streams and rivers thus elevating fluvial ecosystem carbon metabolism and carbon loss chang 2008 rosemond et al 2015 shi et al 2017 comparing with the chinese state standards for surface water gb 3838 2002 tn in the rural group u1 mixed land group u2 and urbanized group u3 all exceeded the maximum permissible levels of grades iii iv and v respectively and tp in u3 also exceeded the maximum permissible levels of grade v the more deteriorated the water quality is the higher the roman numeral is doc concentration found in the u3 group segments was higher than those in the u1 and u2 group segments table s3 this is consistent with the fact that more urbanized area caused export higher organic carbon and nutrients loadings including tn nh4 n no3 n and phosphorus in adjacent aquatic ecosystem pereda et al 2021 shields et al 2008 the urban impacted rivers are also influenced by municipal infrastructure for example wastewater leakage from municipal sewers can contributed more than 50 of n in urban stream smith et al 2017 at the same time rivers draining urban area can receive waste water treatment plant wwtp effluent thereby increasing riverine ch4 concentration alshboul et al 2016 jin et al 2018 yoon et al 2017 for instance dch4 and doc from effluents of wwtp in germany have been reported to be approximately 40 and 2 times higher than those in their upstream waters 6 5 5 μmol l 1 vs 0 16 0 07 μmol l 1 for dch4 13 2 mg l 1 vs 5 8 1 7 mg l 1 for doc alshboul et al 2016 in this study the second highest value of dch4 concentration 3291 nmol l 1 was found at site thr 3 during the dry season likely due to the effluent of a wwtp that was located 500 m upstream of the sampling location therefore the higher dch4 in u2 and u3 with higher urban land percent fig 3a suggests that anthropogenic inputs are an important ch4 source this is shown by the positive relationship between dch4 and nutrients tn and tp figs 4d and 4e because higher nutrient loadings are closely linked to the lateral inputs of untreated sewage and wastewater pipe networks this explanation was also supported by the strong relationship between dch4 and doc fig 5b based on sediment type because doc is usually a good indicator of terrestrial input this should not be surprising since small rivers have higher edge to water volume ratios and thus show strong links with terrestrial system and are more affected by fast urbanization process liu and raymond 2018 qin et al 2014 fluvial ch4 is controlled by oxic and anoxic conditions in river water and riverbed sediment under reduction conditions ch4 is formed through the microbial turnover of organic matter under oxic conditions ch4 can be oxidized to co2 the oxidation process can be favored by turbulence and wind stanley et al 2016 with rapid urbanization there has been a conversion of forests to urban areas at the reach scale as indicated by their negative relationship fig s3a increase of both impervious land surface construction activities and concentrated domestic sewage discharge is common characteristics of urbanization resulting in increasing surface runoff surface soil erosion paul and meyer 2001 and contaminant transport pereda et al 2021 yoon et al 2017 previous studies indicated that low dissolved oxygen and concentrations of sediment contaminants were positively correlated with percent of urban land use dauer et al 2000 this is consistent with our observation that the average do decreased with increasing urban land percentage fig 3b for instance the mean do in the u3 decreased to 64 3 correspond to 6 0 mg l prior studies showed that particle size of sediment decreased with increasing organic matter content and nutrients e g phosphorus evans et al 1990 palmer felgate et al 2009 these factors could explain our observation that the grain size was inversely related to urban land proportion fig s4 except the sand type moreover fine riverbed sediments are known to create anoxic conditions through blocking the gravel interstices limiting oxygen exchange enabling methanogen growth and favoring ch4 production trimmer et al 2012 large coarse gravels contain much less organic matter resulting in lower ch4 and doc concentrations in interstitial water comer warner et al 2019 trimmer et al 2010 in addition better oxygen exchange in gravel riverbed helps oxidize dch4 to co2 presenting a sink of ch4 and doc comer warner et al 2019 shelley et al 2015 trimmer et al 2010 compared with gravels sand sediments have higher microbial activity comer warner et al 2019 methanogen abundance interstitial water doc and ch4 concentrations buriankova et al 2012 thus urban land use likely results in riverine sediments that are more conducive to methanogenesis through delivery of nutrient and organic matter rich fine grained sediments agricultural land use has been found to be a key driver for riverine ch4 production kaushal et al 2014 since nutrient runoff from both surface erosion and leaching can lead to enhanced in stream metabolism borges et al 2018a qin et al 2020 however we found no relationship between farmland and fluvial dch4 this was possibly due to statistical analysis of land use at different scales similar to studies in relation to land use and water quality for instance urban land had a larger effect on river water quality at small scales e g reach or riparian scale than at large scales e g catchment scale whereas agricultural land displayed the opposite scale effects shi et al 2017 moreover hydrological seasonality could shift the coupling between farmland and fluvial dch4 figs s3b and c the negative relationships between riverine dch4 and farmland in the dry season similar to the observed result in the great bay watershed of usa were potentially due to the presence of excess terminal electron acceptor that can suppress ch4 production such as fe3 no3 and so4 2 herreid et al 2020 this explanation was supported by the higher ec 413 142 μs cm 1 in the dry seasons than in the wet seasons 325 89 μs cm 1 which generally reflects ion concentration the peak value and general higher dch4 in the dry season average of twater was 13 c than wet season average of twater was 25 c figs s1a s3b and c imply that the surface runoff accompanied by leaching from agricultural soils was not the dominant control on riverine dch4 although a weak positive correlation exists between farmland and fluvial dch4 in the wet season fig s3c urban land is unarguably the most important and persistent driver of high fluvial dch4 carpenter et al 1998 wu et al 2019 4 2 the roles of riverine physicochemical factors ch4 dynamics in a river system is highly complex first biogenic methanogenesis generally occurs under strictly anoxic conditions by methanogenic archaea liu and whitman 2008 second methane is readily oxidized by aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria to produce co2 in oxygen rich rivers shelley et al 2015 stanley et al 2016 for example deangelis and scranton 1993 found that methanotrophs could oxidize up to 70 of the ch4 produced in the hudson river during summer times matousu et al 2017 also reported that methanotrophs oxidized 41 12 and 5 3 of ch4 during summer autumn and winter spring respectively in the elbe estuary this is consistent with our findings that show the decreasing trend of dch4 with the increase of streamflow velocity and do figs 4a and c small rivers in mountainous regions usually have rapid flow and thus short retention time that help aeration as well as the high abundance of methanotrophs up to 26 3 of the total microbial community unpublished data suggest the transformation from ch4 to co2 a co variation of dch4 and dco2 has been previously reported for the amazon river richey et al 1988 boreal rivers in québec canada campeau and del giorgio 2014 the urban rivers in baltimore united states smith et al 2017 and the meuse river in belgium borges et al 2018a these studies speculated that either most of co2 was derived directly from methanogenesis or dissolved co2 and ch4 had a same source in this study we found a negative relationship between the dch4 and ph fig 4b and table 2 as well as a distinctly higher molar ratio of ch4 co2 0 0151 0 0106 ranging from 0 0010 to 0 0538 when compared to those reported for tropical rivers 0 0097 marine waters 0 0005 and atmosphere 0 005 borges et al 2019 the higher methane concentrations should have favored oxidation resulting in more co2 production thereby decreasing ph hence the findings from this study seem to support the above speculation excessive loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen generally result in river eutrophication carpenter et al 1998 according to the trophic classification by dodds dodds et al 1998 dodds and welch 2000 river waters in this study at 27 sites can be classified mesotrophic or eutrophic for tn and tp the growth of algae can have different effects on dch4 the increasing amount of oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis can account for the negative coefficients of both chl a and do in the dch4 stepwise multiple regression model for the mixed land group u2 with the lowest chl a concentration 2 18 1 79 μg l 1 tables 2 and s3 on the other hand the increasing algal c would enhance methanogenesis through decaying and settling onto riverbed sediments borges et al 2018b gruca rokosz and tomaszek 2015 in addition mounting evidence demonstrates that freshwater phytoplankton especially cyanobacteria can produce ch4 in oxic conditions though the ch4 production rates of cyanobacteria are three to four orders of magnitude lower than the ch4 production rates noted for typical methanogenic archaea bizic et al 2020 gunthel et al 2020 this may also partially explain the positive power relationship between chl a and dch4 is found for all data in this study fig 4f we found that tn acted as the most important factor influencing dch4 especially in river reaches with urban percentage 2 table 2 high n loading can alleviate c limitation to microbes liu and greaver 2009 however a negative correlation between ch4 and tn was also observed in human influenced streams in baltimore smith et al 2017 and wisconsin crawford and stanley 2016 in the united states this could be attributed to the fact that n input can stimulate activities of both methanogenic archaea and methanotropic bacteria thereby affecting the balance of the two processes depending on n forms bodelier and laanbroek 2004 ammonium can inhibit ch4 oxidation through competing for methane monooxygenase or enhancing nitrification which can oxidize methane bodelier and laanbroek 2004 nitrate has been also found to decrease ch4 production through suppressing the activities of methanogen through elevating redox potentials le mer and roger 2001 in addition no3 n can be reduced to ammonium in aquatic systems giblin et al 2013 and therefore this microbial process can potentially alter the relationship between nitrogen and ch4 schade et al 2016 reported both positive and negative relations of ch4 with no3 n in some streams in new hampshire mccrackin and elser 2011 attributed increased no3 n to reduced ch4 concentration in some lake systems so did dodla et al 2009 in some wetlands however there was no significant relationship between ch4 and no3 n or nh4 n found in streams within the great bay watershed herreid et al 2020 and seine marescaux et al 2018 these findings indicate that drivers and inhibitors of ch4 production or oxidation may not be universal across different systems herreid et al 2020 and the ch4 concentration is a balance of production oxidation lateral inputs and emission liu and greaver 2009 stanley et al 2016 this may be the reason for the variable relationships between tn nh4 n no3 n and dch4 found in our study table 2 on the other hand the relationship between ch4 and nitrogen species varied when attendant transformations of no3 n or nh4 n are spatially segregated from ch4 production crawford and stanley 2016 nonetheless the three n species showed a consistent trend with dch4 based on the urbanization gradient groups fig 3 this also implies that terrestrial input with higher pollution load can be a crucial factor affecting riverine dch4 4 3 importance of riverine ch4 diffusive flux our estimates of fch4 0 16 to 44 16 mmol m 2 d 1 fall in the range of the reported values for many rivers in the world table s4 the mean fch4 3 06 6 03 mmol m 2 d 1 was comparable to the flux rates found in a 1st order stream in new hampshire 3 6 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 k600 estimated with the ray05 model schade et al 2016 the estimated fch4 in the urban group u3 8 93 14 29 mmol m 2 d 1 in our study is higher than those found in most rivers listed in table s4 but it is comparable to the average of global rivers 8 22 25 50 mmol m 2 d 1 stanley et al 2016 and is lower than those reported by borges et al 2019 for the tropical congo river 12 55 2 25 mmol m 2 d 1 ray05 model the local diffusive flux patterns are contributable to a combination of concentration and gas transfer velocity sawakuchi et al 2014 there is a significantly increasing trend of fch4 from the rural group u1 1 91 1 42 mmol m 2 d 1 and the mixed land group u2 2 13 2 04 mmol m 2 d 1 to the urban group u3 whilst the k values were comparable p 0 05 in three groups table 1 suggesting that dch4 was the determinant in fch4 estimation schade et al 2016 also found that fch4 in a stream 3 6 0 5 mmol m 2 d 1 with higher no3 n and doc concentrations was almost 6 times the flux in a stream 0 62 0 46 mmol m 2 d 1 with lower no3 n and doc here k600 was 17 5 1 7 cm h 1 and 14 2 2 1 cm h 1 respectively gas transfer velocity can be affected by a number of physical factors such as stream channel morphology channel slope streamflow velocity and wind speed alin et al 2011 kokic et al 2018 raymond and cole 2001 raymond et al 2012 direct measurement of gas exchange velocity is limited in small lotic freshwater systems alin et al 2011 and many studies use models of gas exchange velocity with ambient variables that are easier to measure e g wind speed borges et al 2004 raymond and cole 2001 tobias et al 2009 wanninkhof 1992 streamflow velocity alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 or a combination of the two variables alin et al 2011 the empirical equations of gas exchange velocity for streams and small rivers from floating chambers or tracer gas method showed that streamflow velocity rather than wind speed was the dominant control of k600 in these systems alin et al 2011 raymond et al 2012 due to the inherent uncertainty in assessing gas transfer velocity we used three models to provide the likely range fig s5 and found that the fch4 estimated from ray05 model is comparable to the value estimated from alin03 model 3 97 8 45 mmol m 2 d 1 but is lower than the value obtained from ray01 model by on average 60 the largest range of fch4 estimates from ray01 model fig s5 is likely because this model is more sensitive to streamflow velocity raymond et al 2012 but there were no significant differences among the three estimated fch4 fig s5a therefore fch4 estimated using ray05 model is relatively conservative while it is meaningful for the comparison of the ch4 fluxes in our study with other studies using similar k600 models listed in table s4 all river reaches in this study can be regarded as a source of ch4 to the atmosphere as their contribution is modified by land use land cover types and urbanization intensity a win win strategy of reducing nutrient loadings and ch4 emission should be taken under the frame of international sustainable development goal sdg and china s national carbon neutral given that urban land cover and populations will continue to expand in the future more attention should be paid to assessing local and regional ch4 diffusive fluxes from rivers that drain rapid urbanization areas 5 conclusion in this study we found that dissolved ch4 dch4 concentration in headwaters and low order rivers in the upper yangtze river basin are more related to urban land use than farmland use on the reach scale urbanization clearly increases riverine loadings of total nitrogen and total phosphorus and decreases dissolved oxygen do contributing to elevated riverine dch4 and ch4 diffusive emissions to the atmosphere streamflow velocity and bottom sediment types also affect the reach scale distribution of dch4 as they can influence river oxic and anoxic conditions riverine dch4 shows a strong relationship with water quality indicators including tn tp do ph and chl a p 0 01 tn is the key parameter for predicting dch4 in river waters that drain urbanized land areas based on these findings we conclude that rapid urbanization in headwater catchments will substantially increase nutrient loading and dch4 level in waterways and climate change is likely to intensify the magnitude of the hydro biogeochemical processes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
