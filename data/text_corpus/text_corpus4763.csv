23815,understanding the water circulation in oceans and coastal seas is among the key topics of oceanographic and climate research hydrodynamic studies form the basis for many oceanographic subjects whether sediment transport morphology water quality ecological and climate changes are being investigated hydrodynamic modelling of oceans and coastal seas has become a fundamental tool for describing the dynamics of marine environments revealing the human impact on the sea and promoting sustainable development of marine resources by complementing through data assimilation more and more diffuse and integrated global and regional observing systems composed of coastal gauges moorings buoys satellites drifters hydrodynamic models provide a deterministic 4d view of the ocean state in this context the semi enclosed adriatic sea represents a natural long standing laboratory for hydrodynamic modelling the peculiar historical morphological and oceanographic characteristics of this basin and its complex coastline stimulated over decades the development and application of several ocean and coastal models in this work we review different aspects of hydrodynamic modelling covered by the literature highlighting the wide variety of model applications carried out in the adriatic sea which could serve as examples for semi enclosed marginal and coastal seas worldwide within the scope of the review we find that although significant progress has been made over the last few decades most of the modelling studies underrate the importance of a detailed representation of the land coastal sea fluxes we list a set of recommendations that can be used as guidelines for model implementation to broaden the applicability of hydrodynamic models in future studies finally we discuss the remaining questions that still need to be further explored keywords hydrodynamic modelling marginal seas coastal dynamics adriatic sea data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction hydrodynamic modelling in the coastal zone or marginal seas poses specific challenges as compared to that in the global oceans as more efforts are generally needed to accurately represent the effects of the bottom topography and lateral boundaries which exert shear stress on the water movement and act as a fixed wall where water cannot pass through the lateral boundaries also serve as sources of mass and momentum to the basin e g in the form of rivers which influence the physical and chemical characteristics of the basin finally the problem of wetting and drying has to be tackled by the coastal numerical models due to tides and surges a problem that global ocean models normally do not have to deal with most of the ocean models solve the hydrostatic or non hydrostatic primitive equations based on the boussinesq approximation variations of density are neglected excepted where multiplied by the gravitational acceleration in which the effects of subgridscale processes are represented by parameterizations of mixing and momentum pedlosky 1987 in modelling marginal and coastal seas the primitive equations must be solved numerically on a sufficiently refined horizontal grid to properly resolve the interaction between the open sea and the coastal areas from this point of view the use of unstructured grids allows one to have high resolution in coastal areas while maintaining computational efficiency compared to the use of regular grids even in the case of a nested approach pain et al 2005 moreover extra care should be taken in the numerical treatment of specific terms processes bottom friction turbulent closure monotone advection schemes and wetting drying are among the most important klingbeil et al 2018 in the context of hydrodynamic modelling the adriatic sea represents a challenge as this regional sea is strongly affected by air sea land sea and coastal offshore interactions the adriatic sea is an 800 km long 150 km wide elongated semi closed basin separating the italian peninsula from the balkans and communicating with the mediterranean sea only through the otranto strait 75 km wide in the southern part fig 1 the basin could be formally subdivided based on its bathymetry into three regions a relatively shallow northern adriatic depths are in the order of a few tens of metres the mid adriatic pit depths up to about 200 m and the deep southern adriatic pit with depths exceeding 1000 m artegiani et al 1997 the adriatic contains over 1300 islands mostly located along the croatian part of its eastern coast and several transitional water coastal systems lagoons bays estuaries fjords the main forcings of the basin circulation are the wind the strong buoyancy resulting from the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers and the tidal waves generated in the mediterranean sea orlić et al 1992 the weather in the adriatic area is strongly influenced by local orography and small scale processes pasarić et al 2009 two main wind regimes characterize the basin the south easterly moist and warm sirocco and the north easterly cold bora winds blowing along the major and minor axis of the basin respectively the northern adriatic sea is frequently affected by storm surge events mainly triggered by strong sirocco winds tidal dynamics are particularly evident in the northern adriatic sea where the most energetic tidal constituents the semi diurnal m 2 and the diurnal k 1 reach amplitudes of 27 and 18 cm respectively ferrarin et al 2017 many of the model applications performed in the adriatic sea are linked to the high historical cultural geopolitical and economic relevance of the settlements located along its coast indeed the adriatic sea has been defined a globe in miniature kaplan 2022 for example there is a vast literature on model applications aimed at investigating the water circulation in the venice lagoon and the adjacent northern adriatic sea umgiesser et al 2014 and references therein or at defending the historical city from hazardous sea conditions umgiesser et al 2021 and references there in several adriatic coastal areas and cultural world heritage sites like the venice lagoon and the town of dubrovnik are at risk from coastal flooding reimann et al 2018 about 3 5 millions inhabitants live along the coast of the adriatic sea with several millions of tourism arrivals per year https www medtrends org reports medtrends ad report pdf consequently the adriatic sea is subjected to many intensive anthropogenic pressures in its coastal and offshore areas including shipping traffic coastal and maritime tourism oil and gas extraction aquaculture trawling and small scale fishery depellegrin et al 2017 obviously all numerical models need a vast coverage of suitable observations to be correctly implemented calibrated and validated in natural environments in the adriatic sea the quantity and very high quality of bathymetric meteorological hydrological and oceanographic either from fixed monitoring network or field surveys data ravaioli et al 2016 sparnocchia et al 2016 ferrarin et al 2020 favoured the accurate and robust applications of hydrodynamic modelling techniques moreover the adriatic sea is a study area for several pan european research infrastructures focused on the oceanographic variables danubius ri jerico emso eric icos marine in particular within danubius ri the international centre for advanced studies on river sea systems the thematic node on modelling will provide several open source tools tailored for transitional and coastal environments such as the po delta and north adriatic lagoons bradley et al 2018 the large volume of scientific literature on the adriatic sea oceanography based on several investigation methodologies spacing from in situ and remote observations to analytical and numerical approaches has already been collected in dedicated books and reviews in particular cushman roisin et al 2001a provide a complete overview of the physical processes and their variability determining the circulation of this marginal sea on the other side a comprehensive review of all aspects of adriatic sea level research covered by the literature is provided in vilibić et al 2017 recently a set of three reviews lionello et al 2021 umgiesser et al 2021 zanchettin et al 2021 has been published on the past evolution present issues and future projections of sea levels and flooding in venice which are strongly linked to the adriatic sea dynamics despite the completeness of previous works a dedicated review on the state of the art hydrodynamic modelling is still missing it is worth mentioning that numerical models represent more and more fundamental tools for investigating and managing marine environments therefore this review paper aims to synthesize knowledge about hydrodynamic modelling using contributions from a broad representation of research works designed to investigate the adriatic sea a long standing laboratory for hydrodynamic model development and testing in this paper we focus our attention on the numerical models and modules developed or improved specifically in the adriatic sea and thereafter exported to other environments for most of the presented arguments we provide examples of hydrodynamic modelling of processes and coastal systems in the adriatic sea the authors of this review gained their knowledge about the adriatic sea developing one of the modelling tools broadly applied in the area the shyfem model umgiesser et al 2004 shyfem is an open source 3d baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic finite element model which solves the primitive equations vertically integrated over each layer considering tidal atmospheric and density driven forces https github com shyfem model shyfem however several other hydrodynamic models were implemented in the area such as pom beg paklar et al 2001 nemo clementi et al 2017 roms carniel et al 2009 coawst bonaldo et al 2016 adcirc orlić et al 2010 coherens marinov et al 2006 ncom martin et al 2009 diecast cushman roisin et al 2007 mitgcm querin et al 2006 delft3d vousdoukas et al 2016 fesom c androsov et al 2019 schism međugorac et al 2018 the review paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hydrodynamic modelling works with the aim of describing the circulation subdivided by forcing mechanism over the whole adriatic sea section 3 describes the modelling developments and applications for coastal studies subdivided by type of environment in section 4 we briefly present additional numerical applications devoted to investigating the transport and dispersion of different substances in the adriatic sea section 5 provides an overview of the hydrodynamic models adopted in operational oceanography knowledge gaps recommendations and perspectives are presented in section 6 2 basin scale hydrodynamics water circulation in the adriatic sea has been extensively investigated through the use of numerical models hydrodynamic studies often focus only on the adriatic sea forced at the otranto strait but many model applications consider the whole mediterranean sea this section provides an overview of the hydrodynamic model studies performed in the adriatic sea to investigate the principal forcing mechanisms driving the circulation 2 1 tide in the micro tidal mediterranean sea tides are generated by the sum of the direct action of the equilibrium tide and the incoming atlantic tidal waves the resulting tidal waves interact with the sea bottom producing significant tidal oscillations only in certain areas namely the north adriatic sea the gulf of gabes and the north aegean sea tsimplis et al 1995 only seven tidal constituents four semidiurnal m 2 s 2 n 2 and k 2 and three diurnal k 1 o 1 and p 1 contribute significantly to the evolution of sea surface elevation in the adriatic sea polli 1960 a peculiar characteristic of the adriatic tidal regime is that it has been interpreted as a co oscillation with the mediterranean sea forced through the strait of otranto and amplified by resonance phenomena along with its longitudinal direction from south to north cushman roisin et al 2001b and references therein according to medvedev et al 2020 diurnal and semidiurnal tidal harmonics are resonantly amplified due to the proximity of tidal periods to the periods of the fundamental 21 5 h and first 10 9 h adriatic eigen modes respectively see section 2 2 tides in the adriatic sea have been deeply investigated experimentally theoretically and numerically regarding deterministic modelling there has been considerable effort in simulating tides in the adriatic sea malačič et al 2000 cushman roisin and naimie 2002 janeković et al 2003 janeković and kuzmić 2005 chavanne et al 2007 book et al 2009 guarnieri et al 2013 most of the hydrodynamic model applications were based on a 2d purely barotropic approach however 3d approaches with homogeneous stratification improved significantly the tidal model performance thanks to a more correct reproduction of the vertical shear induced by bottom friction and the subsequent energy dissipation cushman roisin and naimie 2002 ferrarin et al 2013b fig 2 illustrates the cotidal corange chart of the principal semi diurnal m 2 and diurnal k 1 tidal waves in the adriatic sea as shown in fig 2a m 2 amplitude increases from south to north up to 26 cm in the gulf of trieste enhanced by resonance phenomena along the longitudinal direction cushman roisin et al 2001b the superposition of the incident and reflected kelvin waves results in an amphidromic point where all cotidal lines gather into a single point located in the middle adriatic sea south of ancona the amplitude of k 1 constituent fig 2b increases progressively northwards over decreasing depth from the forced open boundary to the gulf of trieste where it reaches about 17 cm k 1 cotidal lines tend to be parallel to the adriatic sea major axis without the presence of amphidromic points according to defant 1960 the k 1 component should have an amphidromic point centred near the strait of otranto but since the channel s open end is too close the amphidromy is very weak tidal currents tend to be aligned along the adriatic major axis and there is generally an increase of current intensity from south to north recently ferrarin et al 2017 showed that the inclusion of the coastal lagoons in the computational domain improved the capability of the model in reproducing tidal currents in the whole northern adriatic sea these effects originate from the active exchange of water between the tidal embayments and the open sea through the inlets which lead to different scattered waves propagating back into the open sea such radiation damping effect enhances tidal amplitude and tidal currents in the northern adriatic sea it is worth mentioning that anthropogenic induced morphological changes that occurred in the lagoons altered the tidal propagation in the lagoons ferrarin et al 2015 with a consequent effect on tidal characteristics in the adjacent sea these results highlight the need for including coastal environments in the computational domain to correctly reproduce hydrodynamics in regional seas 2 2 storm surge and seiches sea storms represent one of the main threat in coastal areas causing a range of potential hazards such as coastal erosion and inundation as well as damage to infrastructure and to the important cultural heritage chaumillon et al 2017 the problem of sea storms is particularly relevant for the adriatic sea where extreme sea levels are higher than in other parts of the mediterranean basin marcos et al 2009 although several coastal settlements can be impacted and even flooded reimann et al 2018 the main concern in the adriatic sea is for venice due to its artistic heritage and historical importance therefore sea level prediction is of the utmost importance in venice since storm events often cause the flooding of the city especially when associated with spring tides bajo et al 2017 the situation has worsened in the last few decades due to the effect of sea level rise lionello et al 2021 storm surge events in the northern adriatic sea are mainly induced by strong south easterly moist and warm wind called sirocco lionello et al 2012 therefore a critical aspect in modelling storm surges in the adriatic is the atmospheric forcings used on the surface to simulate the storm surge one needs wind usually at 10 m and mean sea level pressure or surface pressure in the case of surface pressure attention must be paid to possible interpolation problems near the coasts in order not to consider values on the ground which can vary a lot due to the presence of hills the use of high resolution meteorological forcing is essential to capture the temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of winds over the adriatic sea which are strongly influenced by the complex local orography and small scale processes dorman et al 2006 davolio et al 2015 the need of predicting coastal flooding in venice and in the northern adriatic sea triggered a continuous development of numerical tools and forecasting systems see among others robinson et al 1973 lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2007 bajo and umgiesser 2010 ferrarin et al 2013b cavaleri et al 2019 ferrarin et al 2020 storm surges have been generally simulated in the adriatic sea using hydrodynamic models that solve the shallow water equations in two dimensions to increase the calculation speed and without simulating the astronomical tide although it is shown that different components of the sea level such as the astronomical tide and the storm surge can only be considered independent in a first approximation since both depend on and influence the total depth horsburgh and wilson 2007 in the adriatic their interaction is negligible ferrarin et al 2013b similarly the wave effect set up on the sea level is generally not considered in storm surge modelling in the adriatic sea ferrarin et al 2013b reported that storm surge statistics of the coupled and uncoupled surge wave models do not differ significantly such results are however influenced by the horizontal resolution of the model often not sufficient to resolve the surf zone and the location of the tide gauge stations roland et al 2009 demonstrated that with an adequate horizontal resolution a fully coupled current wave model could provide a detailed representation of the wave set up in the shallow northern adriatic sea during extreme storm events benetazzo et al 2013 applied the roms swan coupled models over the adriatic sea and demonstrated that the wave current interaction on wave action is not negligible as an example fig 3 shows the storm surge distribution during the november 12th 2019 flooding event in the northern adriatic sea when the sea level came to mark the second highest value since the beginning of the records in 1872 the storm surge was simulated with the shyfem model applied to the mediterranean basin and forced with high resolution atmospheric fields south easterly winds and a secondary local fast moving cyclone travelling in the north westward direction produced a well defined along basin sea level gradient with large surges on its northern border and in particular in front of venice cavaleri et al 2020 ferrarin et al 2021a in the adriatic sea most of the strong storm surge events trigger free sea level oscillations with periods determined by the normal modes of the basin seiches that start when the atmospheric forcing vanishes and may last for several days vilibić 2000 the two main modes have periods of about 21 and 11 h each and the decay time of the oscillation at 21 h is about three days cerovečki et al 1997 in december 2019 very strong seiche oscillations up to 0 4 m in amplitude occurred in the northern adriatic sea fig 4 determining a sequence of severe flooding episodes in venice lionello et al 2021 ferrarin et al 2022 therefore the correct reproduction of these oscillations which is strictly linked to selected bottom shear stress formulation adopted in the modelling system is crucial in forecasting high water events in the northern adriatic sea because their contribution often adds to that of new storm surges bajo et al 2019 moreover their decay time which depends in part on the bottom stress can be influenced by currents due to the astronomical tide or other long term components of the sea level bajo et al 2019 since these oscillations have nodal points near the strait of otranto it is recommended to consider a computational domain larger than the adriatic sea the entire mediterranean basin is therefore often considered in storm surge modelling bajo et al 2007 according to several climate studies storm surges in the northern adriatic sea are likely to decrease in their intensity in the future vousdoukas et al 2016 denamiel et al 2020a lionello et al 2021 2 3 baroclinic circulation the baroclinic circulation is the result of different dynamical interactions and can be strengthened or weakened by the concurrent action of other forcings like tide and wind ocean models should solve the navier stokes equations along with a nonlinear equation of state that couples water temperature and salinity to the fluid velocity in order to reproduce the vertical mixing and lateral advective processes driven by surface heat and mass fluxes lateral freshwater fluxes and tidal mixing surface momentum exchange and heat dynamics should also be solved internally in the model freshwater is discharged into the adriatic sea mostly from rivers along the northern and northwestern coasts due to the abundant freshwater inputs the adriatic sea is considered a dilution basin exporting relatively fresh water to the adjacent ionian sea ludwig et al 2009 as a consequence the circulation is strongly influenced by the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers fig 5 reports the adriatic sea general circulation structures during calm and stratified summer july 2019 and energetic autumn november 2019 conditions the presented circulation fields have been obtained averaging over a month the results of the tiresias forecasting system ferrarin et al 2019 given the general cyclonic circulation of the adriatic sea the effect of localized wind forcings like bora wind episodes flowing along the eastern north eastern border of the basin induces transient but frequent double gyre configurations the one located more nw is cyclonic the southern one in front of rovinj is anti cyclonic that interacts with the major freshwater source of the northern adriatic sea modulating the extrusion of coastal water in the full northern basin kuzmić et al 2006 ličer et al 2016 the wind is also strongly influencing the southward water transport along the italian coast induced by the po river outflow producing instabilities that can grow to form mesoscale eddies cushman roisin et al 2007 magaldi et al 2010 guarnieri et al 2013 identified how the major effect of tides on baroclinic circulation is detected where high baroclinic pressure gradients occur and the tidal signal is significant as is the case for several coastal zones in the northern adriatic sea and particularly in the po rofi region of freshwater influence the introduction of tides allows a better characterization of the extension and variability of rofi moreover as identified by bellafiore et al 2019 in coastal stratified waters the tide modulates upwelling and downwelling processes tidal straining more generally tides affect the baroclinic circulation in several areas of the mediterranean sea palma et al 2020 2 4 dense water formation and cascading another process of interest for the adriatic sea is the formation and propagation of the dense water dw generally dw forms in the shallow continental shelf in the north adriatic sea when periods of prolonged cold north easterly bora winds lead to a cooling of surface waters thus becoming denser and sinking the amount of dw formed in the northern adriatic is dependent on the conditions occurring in the lead up to the event so called preconditioning factors such as a reduction in freshwater inputs from rivers leading to saltier waters which can then sink and move southwards along the western coast and the advection of saltier water masses from the southern parts of the adriatic sea more recently studies from mihanović et al 2021 and vilibić et al 2020 identified the general thermohaline condition of the whole adriatic sea as a preconditioning factor for dwf they showed that the inflow of saltier and warmer water masses from the southern border of the adriatic sea coming from the eastern mediterranean and the interaction with the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios can play a role in leading to an overall saltier surface layer and a deepening of levantine intermediate water liw dunić et al 2018 mihanović et al 2021 the dense water vein then propagates in weeks months to the central and southern adriatic sea interacting with the coastal varying bottom dw can partially fill in the middle adriatic depression and south adriatic pit through turbulent flows mixing with the adriatic deep waters being an important contributor to the general circulation of the basin and driving the overall baroclinic circulation of the basin mihanović et al 2018 pranić et al 2021 models have been used to investigate how different preconditions lead to dw formation in colder or milder winters benetazzo et al 2014 vilibić et al 2016a 2018 and have determined projections on possible variations due to future climate change querin et al 2013 denamiel et al 2020b model implementations allowed to disentangle the main forcings triggering dw formation recognizing heat loss as massively more effective than the increase in salinity for the generation of the process mihanović et al 2018 moreover the importance of appropriate resolution for meteorological forcing became evident for dw generation as well as for the other relevant coastal processes driven by wind and atmospheric pressure kuzmić et al 2006 mihanović et al 2018 pranić et al 2021 janeković et al 2014 found that moving from 8 km to 2 km resolution of the surface wind forcing can significantly reduce errors the dw southward flow is mainly controlled by the general circulation and therefore the correct reproduction of the different water masses is needed for this high vertical resolution is important gunduz et al 2013 found that having significant resolution can impact the characteristics of the liw in the mediterranean model affecting the dense water formed in the southern adriatic and the accuracy of the model simulation moreover the dw flow follows the bathymetric control both at regional and small scales a highly resolved bathymetry is necessary to properly reproduce dw and to correctly modulate downslope dw flow vilibić et al 2008 a hydrodynamic wave coupled model evidenced also how dw propagation plays a role in modulating bedforms dynamics entraining sediments and modifying erosion deposition paths particularly in the south western adriatic coast bari canyon wang et al 2006 bonaldo et al 2016 a hydrostatic model has been shown to be adequate for reproducing the dw formation and initial propagation in the northern adriatic mckiver et al 2016 however once dw interacts with sudden bottom changes as in submarine canyons the bari canyon non hydrostatic processes play a role non hydrostatic models are needed to capture the stronger bottom flow and the frequency and intensity of the dw pulses flowing into the canyons and breaking the isotropic balance bellafiore et al 2018 2 5 tsunami and meteotsunami several destructive high frequency sea level oscillations in the tsunami frequency band have been reported along the coast of the adriatic sea pasarić et al 2012 and reference therein tsunami waves could be generated by submarine earthquakes inland earthquakes landslides or air pressure disturbances associated with fast moving weather events the latter phenomenon is known as meteotsunami monserrat et al 2006 and may determine floodings and breakages in several coastal locations along the east coast of the adriatic sea orlić 2015 the general approach to model tsunami like waves is based on solving the hydrodynamic equations with proper boundary conditions at the sea floor in the case of seismic tsunamis and at the sea surface in the case of meteotsunamis the origin of the perturbation is the displacement caused by the earthquake source in the first case assuming the ocean and solid earth to be coupled paulatto et al 2007 and resonance with tsunamigenic atmospheric processes in the latter requiring ocean atmosphere coupling vilibić et al 2016b modelling of tsunamis either seismic or meteorological requires properly resolving the morphological and bathymetric features of the studied area this is crucial in the shallow areas of the adriatic sea since it can strongly influence wave amplification and travel time and in harbours and bays where resonance plays an important role in the local amplification of tsunami waves vilibić and šepić 2009 the adriatic sea is also a laboratory for meteotsunami forecasting recently an operational modelling system consisting of different ocean and atmospheric modules has been developed denamiel et al 2019b a in order to deterministically reproduce meteotsunami the ocean model requires very high resolution along the coast while the atmospheric model must capture tsunamigenic atmospheric disturbances and therefore requires high horizontal spatial resolution in the order of 1 km high vertical resolution and a reduced time step 1 min denamiel et al 2019b 3 coastal modelling a wide variety of coastal environments are present along the coastline of the adriatic sea the eastern and western sides of the adriatic sea greatly differ in appearance the western coast is largely sedimentary with mild sloping and sandy beaches while the eastern coast is composed of many islands and headlands and is generally rugged and rocky therefore lagoons and deltas are mainly located along the italian peninsula and also the albanian coast while bays coves and fjords characterize the eastern coast simulation of water circulation and of the principal physical processes affecting coastal areas requires the use of numerical models at high spatial resolution capable of representing complex morphological and bathymetric features as well as several anthropogenic constructions piers harbours breakwaters jetties present along the coast moreover downscaling techniques are needed in order to reproduce the mass exchange between the open sea and the coastal area this goal can be achieved through the implementation of numerical models based on a unique unstructured grid able to describe processes at different spatial scales cucco et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a ferrarin et al 2016 stanev et al 2017 federico et al 2017 denamiel et al 2018 ferrarin et al 2018 or through the nesting of models structured and unstructured at different resolution kourafalou et al 2015 trotta et al 2017 fortunato et al 2017 the use of an unstructured grid as we will see in the next subsections gives the advantage of using higher resolution at the coast while applying more modest resolution towards the open sea an approach that has proved to be accurate for many coastal systems in the adriatic sea in this section we provide examples of hydrodynamic modelling of the different types of coastal systems found along the adriatic sea coastline for each case some specific aspects and requirements of the hydrodynamic model implementation are highlighted 3 1 lagoons several shallow coastal transitional water bodies are present along the italian coastline they cover the whole spectrum of geographic and hydrodynamic characteristics presented by kjerfve 1986 ranging from leaky marano grado lagoon ferrarin et al 2010b to restricted lagoon of venice po delta lagoons umgiesser et al 2014 maicu et al 2018 2021 and choked lesina and varano lagoons ferrarin et al 2014b types fig 6 several chocked lagoons are also present along the albanian coastline viluni patok karavasta narte and pasha liman numerical modelling of such systems needs high resolution to reproduce in detail the complex channel network departing from the inlets in tidal environments e g venice and marano grado lagoons fig 6a and b as well as the very narrow 5 10 m wide connections with the open sea of choked basins e g lesina lagoon fig 6c the unstructured approach is desirable for investigating hydrodynamics in these environments since it adequately reproduces the complex geometry and bathymetry using polygons of variable form and size the narrow inlets that connect a lagoon with the sea ensure an active water and transported substances exchange driven by barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradients resulting from the tidal meteorological and oceanographic conditions in order to correctly reproduce the sea lagoon exchange the numerical mesh should consider the inner basin and part of the nearby shelf sea fig 6 in the case of the northern adriatic lagoons some numerical applications were designed to comprise the whole adriatic sea in the computational domains bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 lovato et al 2010 ferrarin et al 2016 the currents in shallow lagoons are mostly caused by tides and wind main winds and tidal rectification over complex bathymetry consisting of a non linear momentum transfer from the oscillating tidal currents to the mean flow robinson 1981 generates a residual circulation structure residual currents have been recognized as fundamental indicators of the net water movement and long term sediment transport de swart and zimmerman 2009 in this context hydrodynamic models constitute a useful tool for investigating the residual circulation umgiesser 2000 and tidal asymmetry ferrarin et al 2015 in coastal environments in such shallow environments average depth in the order of 1 m bottom friction is a major force kjerfve 1994 therefore the most important parameter to be set for the hydrodynamic model is the value of the bottom friction coefficient even if different parameterizations of the bottom friction exist e g chézy gauckler manning strickler a site specific optimization of the frictional parameters by reducing the root mean square error between model results and observations calibration process is always mandatory since bottom friction depends on the seabed roughness which in turn is determined by the sediment type waves currents aquatic vegetation and organisms e g corals and sponges a spatially and temporally varying friction parameter is required in many coastal systems see among others umgiesser et al 2004 d alpaos and defina 2007 araújo et al 2008 the bottom friction coefficient can be very large in shallow areas and lead to a stability criterion where the time step is severely restricted coastal models based on a semi implicit discretization can handle this term implicitly allowing much larger time steps e g shyfem umgiesser et al 2004 in models that use mode splitting blumberg and mellor 1987 bleck and smith 1990 killworth et al 1991 higdon and bennett 1996 an implicit treatment of bottom friction interferes with the barotropic mode adding an adjustment of the bottom drag term into the barotropic mode can nevertheless increase stability androsov et al 2019 even if currents are mainly barotropic several studies demonstrated that 3d approaches either with homogeneous stratification or baroclinic fully stratified models reproduce the bottom boundary properties more accurately than the vertically integrated formulation in the deepest part of the basin see among others ferrarin et al 2010a this is due to the fact that the bottom stress differs in the two cases in 2d barotropic models it is based on depth averaged velocity whereas in the 3d applications it depends on the near bottom velocity tidal lagoons as well as other coastal water basins are characterized by the presence of sheltered environments in the upper coastal intertidal zone marshes which are periodically flooded during the tidal cycle similarly wetting and drying occur also in rivers deltas and lakes floodplains thus an accurate representation of wetting drying processes in tidal marshes coastal areas and floodplains is a crucial issue for hydrodynamic models which has been the subject of many studies d alpaos and defina 2007 medeiros and hagen 2013 and references therein and still represents a numerical challenge le et al 2020 in short wetting drying involve a delicate balance of computational efficiency both processing demand and memory allocation numerical stability convergence spurious oscillations and scientific accuracy medeiros and hagen 2013 3 2 deltas and estuaries the amount of water injected into the adriatic sea is highly variable during the year the po river represents the major buoyancy input with a mean discharge rate of 1500 m 3 s 1 accounting for about one third of the total riverine freshwater input into the adriatic sea ludwig et al 2009 other surface sources of freshwater are concentrated along the northern italian side and the central and southern east coasts another significant contributor of freshwater to the adriatic is the submarine groundwater discharge through submarine springs from a modelling point of view the river s conjunction with the sea represents a challenge because open ocean models applied in oceanography cannot fully reproduce the small scale hydrodynamic processes occurring in these areas even if several estuarine box models have been developed for representing the freshwater flux at river mouths in structured ocean modelling see among others verri et al 2020 the unstructured approach provides the advantage of adequately resolving the river sea continuum by considering the lower part of the rivers in the computational domain zhang et al 2016b stanev et al 2019 ferrarin et al 2019 this is especially true for complex multiple mouth deltas or meandering estuaries apart from the horizontal model resolution deltas and estuaries are considered challenging for ocean models for the parameterization of the turbulent mixing because of morphological complexity strong density stratification and intense current fields burchard et al 2008 smagorinsky s formulation smagorinsky 1963 is often used to parameterize the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity in ocean models as a function of the grid size vertical mixing transports between the sea surface and the deeper layers are generally parameterized using a statistical turbulence closure scheme among others the general ocean turbulence model gotm umlauf and burchard 2005 represents a state of the art turbulence closure module that has been included with success in many reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models such as shyfem roms fvcom tuflow fv selfe fesom getm and nemo in order to parameterize turbulent exchange alternatively the more complex large eddy simulation les models which compute the largest scales of turbulence using a filtered version of the navier stokes equation provide a powerful tool for examining the formation of turbulence and other small scale processes in coastal systems roman et al 2010 however with respect to the rans approach les requires elevated computing resources because of grid size requirements and time step limitations for reproducing small scale turbulence dynamics we also mention that extra care is needed when large gradients build up in correspondence to the river inputs for higher than first order methods non linear stability can be enforced to avoid the uncontrolled growth of oscillations among the different stability bounds the majority of coastal ocean models impose a total variation diminishing tvd property in both finite volume and finite element ocean models this is obtained by means of slope flux limiters following the general framework of non oscillatory high order schemes shu 1987 kuzmin and turek 2002 an example of a complex river outflow is represented by the po river which develops in a delta consisting of five main branches some secondary creeks and a system of seven coastal lagoons caleri marinetta basson barbamarco canarin scardovari and goro fig 7 the dynamics of the po river discharge and its influence on the adriatic sea circulation have been studied for a long time not only from a hydrodynamic but also from a sedimentological point of view umgiesser and bergamasco 1998 presented a preliminary modelling study of the po plume dynamics and its response to different forcing the main plume forming from po outflow is at the central mouth pila and is characterized by an anticyclonic bulge seaward of the river mouth with a coastal southward current contained within a narrow strip along the coast kourafalou 2001 plume shape and extent are mainly influenced by the strength of the discharge and the meteorological forcings falcieri et al 2014 the unstructured shyfem model has been recently applied to the po delta for investigating hydrodynamics in the whole river sea system maicu et al 2018 to study coastal mixing of the multiple river mouths bellafiore et al 2019 and to analyse saltwater intrusion under a changing climate bellafiore et al 2021 the use of triangles of different shapes and sizes is therefore necessary to represent in detail all river branches with the floodplain and the seven shallow lagoons fig 7 as illustrated in the right panel of fig 7 the high resolution of the model allowed to reproduce the horizontal mixing and coastal upwelling processes occurring at the river mouths that originate and drive the dynamics of plumes and coastal small saltwater bulges bellafiore et al 2019 another important input of freshwater into the adriatic basin is the neretva river which flows near the port town of ploc e in croatia fig 8 shows the unstructured grid of the shyfem application which considers the neretva estuary up to 20 km upstream from the mouth nearby wetlands and part of the coastal sea ferrarin et al 2021b the right panel in fig 8 shows the average simulated along channel salinity and velocity distribution for summer 2020 which is the result of advection shear dispersion and tidal oscillation an estuarine dynamic characterizes the circulation in the system with the outflow of riverine waters at the surface and the inflow of marine water in the bottom layers as with many other coastal systems worldwide the neretva estuary is subjected to the upstream extension of the mixing zone with the consequent increase of the salt content in aquifers surface waters and nearby soils krvavica and ruz ić 2020 lovrinović et al 2021 baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic modelling in this context represents a powerful tool for exploring saltwater intrusion also under climate change scenarios bellafiore et al 2021 3 3 bays bays like other coastal transitional environments actively interact with the main basin influencing it and being influenced by it in terms of circulation patterns and freshwater supply bays have been deeply investigated through the use of numerical modelling see among others ye et al 2018 in the adriatic sea several examples of bays can be found along its eastern border characterized by fragmented coastlines and many islands one of the most intriguing features along the entire adriatic coast is the bay of boka kotorska where the sea enters inland for over 20 km the bay located along the montenegro coastline can be divided by its geographic hydrographic properties into three major basins connected by two narrow straits kumbor and verige fig 9 two rivers and many submerged springs flow into the bay triangles in fig 9 which can therefore be considered one of the main freshwater inputs into the southern adriatic sea mandić et al 2016 boka kotorska bay has a complex bathymetric setting with several morphological features shaping the seafloor bortoluzzi et al 2016 the characteristic of all internal bays is that depths increase towards the central zone depths ranging from 35 to 45 m while steep slopes are found close to the shoreline and in the narrow passages at the straits see the yellow panel in fig 9 even if many signs of progress have been made in the bathymetric survey in the last decade a high resolution multibeam dataset covering a whole coastal system requires a significant effort e g madricardo et al 2017 which is often not achievable however we have to keep in mind that detailed bathymetry is crucial for implementing a reliable hydrodynamic model in complex coastal systems ye et al 2018 freshwater input from the numerous sources in the bays strongly modifies temperature salinity and current patterns with the formation of density driven flows bellafiore et al 2011 major physical processes affecting bay circulation and vertical mixing have been simulated with the 3d baroclinic fully stratified shyfem model forced by high resolution open sea ferrarin et al 2019 and meteorological fields davolio et al 2017 and average freshwater discharges bellafiore et al 2011 circulation maps of summer 2019 conditions are presented in the bottom panels of fig 9 an estuarine dynamic characterizes the circulation in the bay with the outflow of less saline water at the surface and the inflow of marine water at the intermediate and bottom layers in both layers the strongest currents are found nearby the river outflow and in the straits the intrusion of sea waters is limited by a sill near the bay mouth as a result of its confinement some sectors of the bay could suffer from poor water renewal or high water retention especially the deeper layers during low freshwater discharges hydrodynamic modelling complemented by a transport and diffusion model could represent a precious tool for investigating the exchange and flushing capacity in so complex coastal systems see section 4 1 3 4 fjords fjords are narrow and deep inlets carved by glacial processes generally strongly stratified and often with three clearly distinguishable water masses stigebrandt 2012 hydrodynamic modelling of fjords requires as for the other coastal system high spatial resolution in order to correctly represent the complex coastline often composed of many headlands coves and straits moreover these deep coastal systems need to be well discretized in the vertical dimension to adequately resolve the different water masses and mixing processes valle levinson et al 2014 among the different vertical coordinate systems developed for ocean modelling geo potential zeta terrain following sigma isopycnal hybrid layers offer a mixture between sigma layers close to the surface and zeta layers in the deeper parts of the basin burchard and petersen 1997 if strong bathymetry gradients are present it avoids possible instabilities due to the sigma layers in the deeper parts while maintaining high resolution near the surface several other vertical coordinate systems have been developed for cross scale river estuary shelf ocean applications it is worth mentioning the localized sigma coordinates with shaved cell lsc 2 method developed by zhang et al 2015 which combines sigma and zeta layers avoiding artificial staircases near the bottom and reducing pressure gradient errors in the adriatic sea two fjord like systems are present along the istria peninsula the lim canal and raša river canal due to their morphological characteristics these coastal systems are often called fjords although they are a ria because the are not carved by glacial processes but by river erosion as an example of numerical modelling of a fjord we present here the application of the shyfem model to the raša river canal fig 10 ferrarin et al 2021b this is a 14 km long and 700 m wide canal with a depth ranging from 1 m at the river mouth to 50 m at the sea boundary the model application required a detailed bathymetric dataset interpolated on a numerical mesh with horizontal resolution up to 50 m however the high horizontal resolution is not enough to identify the most suitable tool for this kind of hydrodynamic investigation the vertical resolution and discretization become important when passing from really shallow and meandering zones like the inner river to the shelf and finally to the open sea in this model application we used a hybrid vertical coordinate system with 10 sigma layers in the upper 10 m and the remaining 1 m thick zeta layers the choice of the hybrid system was driven by the need of resolving stratification even in the northern shallow part of the system where the river flows as well as of ensuring an adequate vertical resolution in the deeper part results of the model application are presented in terms of water temperature and velocity patterns over the along fjord transect during stratified summer and flood tidal conditions right panel in fig 10 in accordance with the dynamics found in many other fjords the circulation in the raša river canal is characterized by a two three layer structures consisting of a surface layer of water with reduced salinity due to the freshwater supply moving towards the sea a bottom layer of salty and cold basin water and an intermediary layer stigebrandt 2012 the density driven circulation is modified by the tidal action which during the flood phase pushes warm seawater into the lower part of the fjord at the surface vertical mixing mainly occurs at approximately 5 km from the sea in correspondence to a bathymetric jump the described dynamic however just represents a snapshot of the circulation in the fjord different vertical circulation structures can arise from the action of wind tide ocean and freshwater pulses valle levinson et al 2014 4 transport and dispersion modelling hydrodynamic modelling is devoted to the description of the water circulation under the influence of different forcing but many substances are transported within the water the concurrence of intense atmospheric forcing the highest tidal amplitudes of the whole mediterranean sea and the intense freshwater inflows led the adriatic sea to be characterized by a wide range of different transport phenomena moreover the heavily anthropized adriatic sea is subjected to several stressors which alter the natural characteristics of the sea and its coast determining many environmental problems these peculiar aspects are at the basis of the development and application of several numerical transport models which rely on the use of a hydrodynamic engine simulations of larger numbers of substances either passive or reactive have been undertaken using both eulerian and lagrangian approaches cucco et al 2009 in an eulerian framework the evolution of a tracer concentration can be described at each fixed point in space by the advection diffusion equation on the other hand a lagrangian approach consists of following a water parcel as it moves with the flow in this section we briefly report the modelling developments undertaken in the adriatic sea for describing the transport and dispersion of different substances highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different applications the reader may refer to van sebille et al 2018 and reference therein for a more comprehensive review on the topic 4 1 transport time scale multiple concepts of hydrodynamic transport time parameters flushing time residence time water age export time confinement have been used in coastal sea research and their comparison has been intensively discussed cucco et al 2009 melaku canu et al 2012 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 and references therein noting that the parameters are different in their definition and application most of these transport time scales tts hereafter can be averaged over the whole basin or can be computed locally to provide information on the spatial variability of the water renewal capacity in many coastal systems of the adriatic sea the estimate of the locally variable tts has been widely used as a support for the analysis of physical sedimentary and ecological processes molinaroli et al 2007 ferrarin et al 2010b melaku canu et al 2012 umgiesser et al 2014 maicu et al 2018 or to evaluate the effects of the human interventions and climate change on the water circulation and flushing features ghezzo et al 2010 ferrarin et al 2013a 2014a among the many transport time scales the most commonly used are the turnover time or flushing time the residence time or renewal time the water age and the transit time or exposure time the turnover time is a bulk estimate of the basin renewal capacity that is expressed by means of simple analytical methods and assuming a fully mixed hydrodynamic condition of the basin monsen et al 2002 the water residence time the transit time and the age are spatially defined and can be computed following several numerical approaches all based on the use of hydrodynamic and transport models cucco and umgiesser 2015 the adriatic sea and its coastal systems constitute the ideal study case for developing and testing different methods for computing the tts the turnover time of the adriatic sea has been estimated by several authors to range between 0 7 to 5 years depending on the adopted methodology in most cases the estimate was derived by direct measurements of the water fluxes through the otranto strait orlić et al 1992 or by the analysis of radionuclides fallout sanchez cabeza et al 2002 franic 2005 in all the studies the computation of the turnover time was performed without considering the spatial variability of the basin water circulation and its direct effects on the basin renewal capacity in recent years locally variable tts were computed for the adriatic sea by combining drifter measurements and numerical models to obtain estimates of the surface water transit time poulain and hariri 2013 integrated drifter data with a statistical advection dispersion model of the adriatic surface circulation obtaining particles transit time through the otranto channel ranging between 260 days for the northern sub basin to 185 days for the southern one in a recent study hariri 2020 followed a similar approach using a particle tracking model ptm integrating the surface mean flow field obtained by the mitgcm ocean model implemented for the adriatic sea numerical results were compared with drifters data to estimate the basin average transit time that varied between 182 and 187 days in the adriatic sea similar numerical applications were carried out to analyse the connectivity between different marine habitats e g carlson et al 2016 bandelj et al 2020 or between spawning and nursery areas of commercial fish species bray et al 2017 these types of applications constitute indirect sources of information about the tts analysing in high details the water transit time between specific and ecologically valuable areas of the basin since the early 2000s bulk estimates of the flushing features were made for several lagoons along the adriatic coasts following the loicz method giordani et al 2005 a simplified box modelling approach based on the budgeting of salt and water mass fluxes the results obtained generally overestimated the real flushing capacity of the investigated basins and did not represent the complexity of the lagoon s water transport processes the necessity to estimate the tts with higher precision led to the application of hydrodynamic models based on unstructured mesh the venice lagoon was set as an ideal test site for discovering the peculiarities of the different model developments in cucco and umgiesser 2006 the locally variable water residence times or renewal times were firstly computed following an eulerian approach and considering different forcing scenarios including tides only and tides combined with wind in later works cucco et al 2009 cucco and umgiesser 2015 viero and defina 2016 the turnover time the water renewal times the water age and the transit time were estimated and the behaviour of the different tts compared among each other in relation to the main meteo marine forcing the results obtained highlighted the inverse correlation between the eulerian and lagrangian tts in relation to the local hydrodynamic features these numerical applications established the turnover time of the lagoon waters obtained by averaging the different locally variable tts to vary between 4 to around 50 days in depending on the forcing conditions in fig 11 the vertically integrated water renewal time is reported for the venice lagoon evidencing the spatial variability of the tts with lower values in correspondence to the lagoon inlets and higher values in the inner lagoon 4 2 biogeochemistry the river input of freshwater rich in nutrients drives the tropic state of the adriatic sea determining phytoplankton blooms and the condition of upper chain nets lotze et al 2011 moreover in the shallow area of the adriatic sea the vertical gradients induced by the interaction between pelagic and benthic components represent a relevant factor mussap and zavatarelli 2017 the development of biogeochemical models of the adriatic sea started in the 1990s with simplified one dimensional models of the main biogeochemical variables in the water column in front of the po delta vichi et al 1998 2003 umgiesser et al 2003 zavatarelli et al 2000 developed a biomass based ecological model of a geometrically idealized adriatic sea basin forced by the nutrient river input under a perpetual year seasonal cycle condition see also zavatarelli et al 2002 his results indicated the dependence of the seasonal phytoplankton cycle on the nutrient river inputs and on their horizontal and vertical distribution induced by the water circulation this study included a sediment biogeochemical model interacting with the water column through organic matter and nutrient and gas exchanges polimene et al 2006 proposed the first three dimensional ecosystem simulation of the adriatic sea ecosystem using realistic basin geometry and forcing the authors indicated the coupling between the water column and first benthic layer and the river nutrients inputs as the most relevant improvement to be done in future applications and used this numerical tool to investigate the dissolved organic carbon accumulation polimene et al 2007 in the adriatic sea according to fennel et al 2019 and kurahashi nakamura et al 2020 the crucial aspects for developing reliable biogeochemical models are the inclusion of the water column bottom interactions and of several functional groups there has been considerable effort in understanding the po river s influence on nutrients and circulation spillman et al 2007 lazzari et al 2012 fiori et al 2016 and in general on the effect of physical characteristics on biogeochemical variables boldrin et al 2009 also special focus was given to the occurrence of anoxia conditions russo et al 2009 macias et al 2018 and the pelagic benthic interaction brigolin et al 2011 2018 mussap and zavatarelli 2017 actually the copernicus ocean product offers a forecast and hindcast data service including biogeochemical simulation in the mediterranean area the operational nemo system is coupled offline with an assimilative biogeochemical system the simulated variables cover the water column with no or simple interaction with the sediment and the biogeochemical data assimilation was introduced to improve the results overall along the coast teruzzi et al 2018 cossarini et al 2019 salon et al 2019 such a biogeochemical model allowed for the estimation of trends and anomalies in nutrients and air sea co 2 fluxes in the mediterranean sea von schuckmann et al 2019 these products however lack the adequate resolution to correctly represent coastal lagoons river mouths and the jagged morphology of the eastern coastline the biogeochemical and ecological characteristics of the adriatic sea as with many other environments worldwide changed in time also due to human activity having direct or indirect impacts on the marine ecosystems i e lotze et al 2011 in this context the results of coupled biogeochemical and food web models i e akoglu et al 2015 represent a source of information for assessing cumulative impacts ecosystem services and planning of efficient location for protected areas i e furlan et al 2019 4 3 oil spills and marine litter significant pollution in the adriatic sea derives from both coastal commercial port activities mass tourism resorts aquaculture riverine inputs and offshore oil and gas extraction maritime traffic fishery sources more generally in the mediterranean sea the upgrade of refineries and ports required to handle increased ship tonnage and volumes of hydrocarbons are identified as the main risk sources zodiatis et al 2018 the adriatic sea is definitely a hot spot due to its semi enclosed shape it was estimated that 0 1 thousand tons of oil were spilt in this basin between 2000 and 2009 unep map 2012 in this framework numerical models are crucial to assess the possible consequences of an oil spill accident in real time or in scenarios several oil models are described in the literature such as simap french mccay 2004 gnome beegle krause 2001 blosom duran et al 2018 medslick de dominicis et al 2013b oscar reed et al 1999 and others see barker et al 2020 nelson and grubesic 2020 for an overview of the oil spill models the majority of the oil spill models are based on the lagrangian approach for the slick trajectories simulation the oil slick is discretized into particles moving along trajectories driven by currents winds and waves beg paklar et al 2008 carniel et al 2009 in the last decade the main weathering processes such as slick spreading emulsification evaporation dispersion dissolution oxidation biodegradation beaching sinking and sedimentation were introduced in the oil spill model codes these processes modify the oil slick properties and consequently their behaviour and response to the environmental conditions in relation to the oil typology a new development frontier consists of including more interaction processes with environmental components e g oil sediments or oil ice interaction nelson and grubesic 2020 lončar et al 2012 evaluated hypothetical cases of oil spills caused by ship failure in the northern adriatic sea to assess the oil slick transport and dispersion through a particle tracking model developed for this purpose the oil model included also emulsification dissolution evaporation processes and heat balance between the oil sea and atmosphere liubartseva et al 2015 calculate monthly and climatological oil distribution with the consequent hazard maps and the identification of hot spots in the southern adriatic and northern ionian seas applying medslick ii model de dominicis et al 2013b a coupled to the mediterranean forecasting system mfs interestingly this application used the ship traffic data 2009 2013 to define the positions starting dates and the number of hypothetical oil spills in order to run the simulations and obtain the hazard maps medslick ii was also coupled to msf olita et al 2019 and the unstructured shyfem model ribotti et al 2019 for simulating oil dispersion transport and weathering processes from oil extraction platform in the adriatic sea fig 12 gps equipped surface drifters were used for model validations in recent decades a dangerous pervasive and globally recognized pollutant became the marine plastic litter unep 2016 which represents a threat to human health and consequently a priority for the scientific community barboza et al 2018 the source of marine litter is connected mostly with the inland human activities but also the marine based sources introduce a significant quantity of plastic litter into the ocean hardesty et al 2017 the processes acting to change the fate of marine litter are complex and numerous mechanical fragmentation photo chemical modification sinking biofouling and ingestion critchell and lambrechts 2016 andrady 2017 van sebille et al 2020 the mediterranean and locally in the adriatic sea represent a hot spot for marine litter everaert et al 2020 due to the specific thermohaline circulation of the basin there is a need for regional models resolving the mesoscale features to represent the dispersal of marine litter with sufficient accuracy the numerical models are here employed to study mainly the convergence of the floating litter due to currents wind and waves liubartseva et al 2016 carlson et al 2017 liubartseva et al 2018 macias et al 2019 politikos et al 2020 with the aim of estimating connectivity and potential retention areas prone to have floating micro litter less 0 5 mm rivers cities and main traffic routes are considered as main sources of marine litter liubartseva et al 2016 2018 and some authors studied the possible sink of the floating objects identified by field data carlson et al 2017 in the adriatic sea the po river represents the main riverine source of litter atwood et al 2019 the sinking behaviour of marine litter was considered in liubartseva et al 2016 as a statistical process taking into account the age of particles while neglecting particle change of buoyancy and subsurface transport by a 3d current field liubartseva et al 2018 used this coupled deterministic statistic approach to estimate the partitioning of the marine litter in the water column on the shoreline and on the seafloor soto navarro et al 2020 studied the temporal variability of 3d dispersal of marine litter considering three different types of vertical behaviour of the particles floating neutral and sinking and analysed the distribution of marine litter released by the rivers cities and shipping routes this study approaches the marine litter dispersal also considering the dynamics in the photic layer which represents the first step introducing the effect on the biological community an inverse modelling approach was recently proposed by kaandorp et al 2020 to close the mass balance of marine litter in the mediterranean sea and to estimate the amount of marine litter in the water column seafloor and beaches martins et al 2019 concluded the 2018 model plastic workshop underlying three main gaps in the marine litter modelling 1 the water sediment plastic interaction process 2 the quantification of point and diffuse sources of plastic and 3 the identification of hot spots of plastic accumulation in this context an advantage of the lagrangian approach is that back propagation simulations advection of particles backwards in time can be used to investigate where the marine litter at a certain location come from liubartseva et al 2016 and ličer et al 2020 4 4 water quality and bathing waters many beaches and bathing sites in the adriatic sea are influenced by agricultural urban touristic and industrial activities which strongly affect the quality of bathing waters and consequently human health ferrarin et al 2021b the major sources of microbial escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci contamination of coastal waters are sewage discharges including coastal and submarine outfall stormwater discharges river mouths and runoff from agricultural and urban areas therefore the deterministic modelling of microbial dispersion in coastal waters has received special attention in recent years for quantifying the health hazard of bathing waters scroccaro et al 2010 ostoich et al 2018 numerical models can be used to simulate the microbial plume spatial and temporal evolution in bathing waters simulation of nearshore water quality during and after sewer overflows requires a high resolution model and detailed water discharges and microbial concentration inputs locatelli et al 2020 the concentration of microbial bacteria in marine coastal systems follows a decaying relationship mancini 1978 it is therefore necessary to implement a microbial decay module coupled to the hydrodynamic and dispersion models which defines the evolution of the concentration considering various environmental conditions the decay rate could have a daily pattern that needs to be locally calibrated locatelli et al 2020 or computed as a function of water temperature salinity uv radiation and the light extinction over the water column ostoich et al 2018 in the latter approach a 3d baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic model is required not only to reproduce the nearshore circulation but also to provide the spatially varying water temperature and salinity fields for computing the microbial decay rate as an example we report in fig 13 the numerical application of the shyfem hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport and diffusion module and microbial decay module for describing the microbial pollution at fano bathing site italy the unstructured numerical grid reaches resolution up to a few metres to resolve in detail the shallow shore in front of the beach the breakwaters and the mouth of the arzilla river which collects the polluted waters of the urban drainage system ferrarin et al 2021b once discharged into the sea the waters contaminated by e coli are partially blocked by the coastal breakwaters with a resulting deterioration of the quality of the bathing waters in front of the most populated beaches the e coli concentration exceeds in this case the value of 500 cfu 100 ml 1 which is the standard threshold in europe for prohibiting bathing and closing the beaches due to microbial contamination therefore the numerical models could be used in combination with the monitoring activities for describing forecasting and managing the quality of water in bathing sites penna et al 2021 4 5 sediments sediment dynamics and coastal morphology in the adriatic sea are strongly influenced by the elevated fluvial inputs mostly concentrated along the albanian coast and in the northern adriatic the wave action and the longshore transport therefore the hydrodynamic model needs to be coupled to a wave model aimed at estimating the combined current wave bottom shear stress turbulence and wave current interactions and to an advection and diffusion model aimed at simulating the transport of the sediment particles relatively few studies investigated the general basin wide dynamics of sediments with coupled models wang and pinardi 2002 sherwood et al 2004 wang et al 2007 harris et al 2008 while most of the research activity in the adriatic sea focused on specific hotspots northern adriatic lagoons the po delta and submarine canyons there has been considerable effort in developing numerical models for simulating sediments in coastal lagoons rolinski and umgiesser 2005 neumeier et al 2008 umgiesser et al 2006 carniello et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2008 2010a 2016 most of the numerical models have been initially developed for investigating sediment transport in the lagoon of venice which has been subjected to many natural and anthropogenic morphological changes the investigation of the sediment dynamics in such coastal environments requires coupled wave current sediment models able to deal with multiple sediment grain size classes both cohesive and non cohesive and both suspended and bedload transport to properly resolve the lagoon sea granulometry gradient hence a spatially varying initial sediment distribution from observations is mandatory for a realistic representation of the sediment characteristics the most advanced numerical tools also allow for the simulation of a mobile bottom thus considering the morphological evolution of the system at tidal seasonal and inter annual scales and feedback to the hydrodynamics ferrarin et al 2008 carniello et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2016 the fate of fluvial sediments discharged into the adriatic sea by the po river was numerically investigated by many researchers friedrichs and scully 2007 traykovski et al 2007 bever et al 2009 bonaldo et al 2015 nones et al 2020 the simulations allowed the authors to describe the deposition areas in front of the delta and the along shore sediment transport under idealized realistic and future conditions however even if the studies of friedrichs and scully 2007 and traykovski et al 2007 considered gravity flows deposition a 3d baroclinic fully stratified coupled hydrodynamic and fluid mud model to account for the properties and transport of high concentrated suspended matter e g van maren et al 2015 is still missing for the po delta in recent years the transport of sediments by dense water downflows in the deep submarine canyons within the southern adriatic margin received special attention bonaldo et al 2016 and carniel et al 2016 applied the coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport system to simulate the formation and spreading mechanisms of dense water in the adriatic sea for investigating the transport of sediment and bottom feature evolution in the deep canyons 5 operational oceanography most of the oceanographic model development in the adriatic sea as well as for other regional seas was stimulated by the need of predicting the sea conditions in operational mode pinardi et al 2017 essentially two were and still are the main topics in operational oceanography development in the adriatic sea storm surge in the northern part of the basin and general sea circulation storm surge forecasting started in the 1970s robinson et al 1973 and is still under development for a review of storm surge modelling see umgiesser et al 2021 many forecast models adopted a 2d barotropic approach for simulating the response of the ocean to the wind and pressure forcing which is reducing computational costs lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2007 zampato et al 2016 however a 3d representation of the system either with homogeneous stratification or baroclinic fully stratified models allows for better reproduction of the vertical shear induced by bottom friction which is crucial in the shallow northern adriatic sea ferrarin et al 2013b moreover even if extreme sea level events are mostly driven by the storm surge component lionello et al 2021 and therefore most of the forecasting systems are based on a hydrodynamic model forced by a meteorological model the modelling development is moving towards two way current atmospheric pullen et al 2007 current wave dutour sikirić et al 2013 ferrarin et al 2013b clementi et al 2017 fernández montblanc et al 2019 and current wave atmospheric coupled forecasting systems ricchi et al 2016 varlas et al 2018 storm surge forecasting improvements in recent years concentrated on the development of methods for assimilating altimeter bajo et al 2017 and tide gauge data lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2019 besides data assimilation into hydrodynamic models a special effort was devoted also to the development of post processing approaches e g neural networks and kalman filters to correct short term forecasts produced by storm surge models bajo and umgiesser 2010 bajo 2020 the use of baroclinic fully stratified models in ocean forecasting started with the implementation of the modular ocean model over the mediterranean sea mediterranean forecasting system mfs pinardi et al 2003 mfs has been continuously improved tonani et al 2008 and actually assimilates satellites sea level anomaly and in situ water temperature and salinity profiles clementi et al 2019 subsequently several ocean forecasting systems have been developed specifically for the adriatic basin oddo et al 2006 chiggiato and oddo 2008 russo et al 2013 bressan et al 2017 ferrarin et al 2019 all receiving boundary conditions at the otranto strait from mfs available via the copernicus marine environmental monitoring service http marine copernicus eu other local forecasting systems were also developed using multi nesting techniques federico et al 2017 trotta et al 2017 actually all operational ocean models in the adriatic sea have the limitation of imposing climatological or constant freshwater discharge boundary conditions considering that freshwater strongly influences the adriatic sea circulation coupling with hydrological forecasting models is desirable in the future for providing realistic forecasts the awareness of the prediction uncertainties and errors has led many ocean forecasting systems in the adriatic sea as in other areas around the world to move toward numerical forecasts based on a probabilistic concept the ensemble technique this approach was introduced in the adriatic sea almost exclusively for assessing the uncertainty of storm surge forecasts most of the developed system involves using an ensemble of meteorological prediction systems eps as input to a hydrodynamic model mel and lionello 2016 bajo et al 2019 žust et al 2020 to produce sea level predictions the large number of ocean forecasting systems existing over the adriatic sea allowed the development of a multi model ensemble system for providing probabilistic sea level and waves forecasts ferrarin et al 2020 the outcomes of existing ocean models are in the multi model ensemble system interpolated on a common grid and combined to produce results in terms of the ensemble mean and standard deviation accounting for a measure of the forecast uncertainty an example of the sea level height extracted in the northern adriatic sea in front of the lagoon of venice during the october 29th 2018 sea storm is shown in fig 14 6 knowledge gaps recommendations and perspectives in this review we have discussed the state of the art of present hydrodynamic modelling in marginal and coastal seas we itemize here the main knowledge gaps we must be aware of when modelling hydrodynamics in coastal and enclosed seas strategic recommendations for future developments and perspectives the basic physical processes in coastal seas are generally considered well established and it would be natural to think that improvements in the near future will mostly be focused on model numerics however a proper understanding and quantification of the processes at the air sea interface especially under extreme conditions are still a long way from being reached indeed there is a large tendency towards fully coupled meteo wave current modelling systems e g olabarrieta et al 2012 lewis et al 2018 to reproduce the complex interactions occurring at the sea surface with respect to the global ocean in marginal and coastal seas the exchange of energy and mass at the land sea and bottom sea boundaries requires special attention too to improve the representation of the land sea interactions near the coast especially near river deltas estuaries lagoons and bays the model applications should consider i a mesh with seamless and variable resolution horizontal for representing the morphology of the coast sea transition ii an adequate vertical coordinate system for describing the vertical processes and gradients at the river sea and air sea interfaces iii the coupling with watershed and groundwater models for considering correctly the often underestimated flux of freshwater into the sea in this context the modelling of the river sea continuum will give new insight into the interaction between waters coming from the river mixing in the coastal zone and influencing the characteristics of the marine waters even far from the river mouth these interactions can be modelled only by explicitly taking into account mixing processes inside the area where the river and the sea meet the eu has acknowledged the importance of this fact by promoting danubius ri a distributed research infrastructure dealing with river sea interaction onto the esfri roadmap bradley et al 2018 a further physical frontier we will need to deal with is a more detailed description of what is going on at the bottom sea interface in this context hydrodynamic models should be coupled with adaptive morphodynamic modules e g bertin et al 2009 and adopt higher vertical and horizontal resolution for reproducing the fluxes and sediment variability of the sea bottom data assimilation remains a valid tool for improving the accuracy of models even in coastal areas although traditionally it is more used in the global ocean where the initial state is modified more slowly by boundary conditions data assimilation can still be effective bajo et al 2019 janeković et al 2020 variables such as temperature and salinity benefit most because of their slower variation over time variables such as the sea level and wave quantities are more instantaneous but can equally be corrected in the short forecast sanchez arcilla et al 2021 and in analysis especially in the case of these variables it is advisable to use advanced methods with a temporal assimilation window both for the estimation of the initial state and in the parameter estimation mode in the context of climate modelling if all different phenomena and relative model requirements mentioned in the manuscript would be taken into account this would require a massive computational time therefore a rough assessment of the contribution of a phenomenon to an overall adriatic state is desirable while astronomical tides in the open sea are not expected to change significantly in the near future lionello et al 2005 modifications in storminess and related air sea heat transfers denamiel et al 2020a b will impact northern adriatic dwf with consequences on the overall thermohaline properties and circulation of the entire adriatic sea and wider moreover it is extremely important to adequately account for the future changes in the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers ideally with a coupled atmosphere hydrology marine sub regional climate downscaling which strongly influences the basin wide adriatic sea circulation hydrodynamic models may provide crucial insight into circulation features in marginal seas and coastal areas which often have strong relevance from a socio economic point of view the future development of marine activity in accordance with the blue growth perspective eikeset et al 2018 and connected to the climate change emergency push the scientific community to imagine plan and organize the future of the sea today and in the future the relationship between the marine ecosystem and human use of the sea is going to be stronger

23815,understanding the water circulation in oceans and coastal seas is among the key topics of oceanographic and climate research hydrodynamic studies form the basis for many oceanographic subjects whether sediment transport morphology water quality ecological and climate changes are being investigated hydrodynamic modelling of oceans and coastal seas has become a fundamental tool for describing the dynamics of marine environments revealing the human impact on the sea and promoting sustainable development of marine resources by complementing through data assimilation more and more diffuse and integrated global and regional observing systems composed of coastal gauges moorings buoys satellites drifters hydrodynamic models provide a deterministic 4d view of the ocean state in this context the semi enclosed adriatic sea represents a natural long standing laboratory for hydrodynamic modelling the peculiar historical morphological and oceanographic characteristics of this basin and its complex coastline stimulated over decades the development and application of several ocean and coastal models in this work we review different aspects of hydrodynamic modelling covered by the literature highlighting the wide variety of model applications carried out in the adriatic sea which could serve as examples for semi enclosed marginal and coastal seas worldwide within the scope of the review we find that although significant progress has been made over the last few decades most of the modelling studies underrate the importance of a detailed representation of the land coastal sea fluxes we list a set of recommendations that can be used as guidelines for model implementation to broaden the applicability of hydrodynamic models in future studies finally we discuss the remaining questions that still need to be further explored keywords hydrodynamic modelling marginal seas coastal dynamics adriatic sea data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction hydrodynamic modelling in the coastal zone or marginal seas poses specific challenges as compared to that in the global oceans as more efforts are generally needed to accurately represent the effects of the bottom topography and lateral boundaries which exert shear stress on the water movement and act as a fixed wall where water cannot pass through the lateral boundaries also serve as sources of mass and momentum to the basin e g in the form of rivers which influence the physical and chemical characteristics of the basin finally the problem of wetting and drying has to be tackled by the coastal numerical models due to tides and surges a problem that global ocean models normally do not have to deal with most of the ocean models solve the hydrostatic or non hydrostatic primitive equations based on the boussinesq approximation variations of density are neglected excepted where multiplied by the gravitational acceleration in which the effects of subgridscale processes are represented by parameterizations of mixing and momentum pedlosky 1987 in modelling marginal and coastal seas the primitive equations must be solved numerically on a sufficiently refined horizontal grid to properly resolve the interaction between the open sea and the coastal areas from this point of view the use of unstructured grids allows one to have high resolution in coastal areas while maintaining computational efficiency compared to the use of regular grids even in the case of a nested approach pain et al 2005 moreover extra care should be taken in the numerical treatment of specific terms processes bottom friction turbulent closure monotone advection schemes and wetting drying are among the most important klingbeil et al 2018 in the context of hydrodynamic modelling the adriatic sea represents a challenge as this regional sea is strongly affected by air sea land sea and coastal offshore interactions the adriatic sea is an 800 km long 150 km wide elongated semi closed basin separating the italian peninsula from the balkans and communicating with the mediterranean sea only through the otranto strait 75 km wide in the southern part fig 1 the basin could be formally subdivided based on its bathymetry into three regions a relatively shallow northern adriatic depths are in the order of a few tens of metres the mid adriatic pit depths up to about 200 m and the deep southern adriatic pit with depths exceeding 1000 m artegiani et al 1997 the adriatic contains over 1300 islands mostly located along the croatian part of its eastern coast and several transitional water coastal systems lagoons bays estuaries fjords the main forcings of the basin circulation are the wind the strong buoyancy resulting from the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers and the tidal waves generated in the mediterranean sea orlić et al 1992 the weather in the adriatic area is strongly influenced by local orography and small scale processes pasarić et al 2009 two main wind regimes characterize the basin the south easterly moist and warm sirocco and the north easterly cold bora winds blowing along the major and minor axis of the basin respectively the northern adriatic sea is frequently affected by storm surge events mainly triggered by strong sirocco winds tidal dynamics are particularly evident in the northern adriatic sea where the most energetic tidal constituents the semi diurnal m 2 and the diurnal k 1 reach amplitudes of 27 and 18 cm respectively ferrarin et al 2017 many of the model applications performed in the adriatic sea are linked to the high historical cultural geopolitical and economic relevance of the settlements located along its coast indeed the adriatic sea has been defined a globe in miniature kaplan 2022 for example there is a vast literature on model applications aimed at investigating the water circulation in the venice lagoon and the adjacent northern adriatic sea umgiesser et al 2014 and references therein or at defending the historical city from hazardous sea conditions umgiesser et al 2021 and references there in several adriatic coastal areas and cultural world heritage sites like the venice lagoon and the town of dubrovnik are at risk from coastal flooding reimann et al 2018 about 3 5 millions inhabitants live along the coast of the adriatic sea with several millions of tourism arrivals per year https www medtrends org reports medtrends ad report pdf consequently the adriatic sea is subjected to many intensive anthropogenic pressures in its coastal and offshore areas including shipping traffic coastal and maritime tourism oil and gas extraction aquaculture trawling and small scale fishery depellegrin et al 2017 obviously all numerical models need a vast coverage of suitable observations to be correctly implemented calibrated and validated in natural environments in the adriatic sea the quantity and very high quality of bathymetric meteorological hydrological and oceanographic either from fixed monitoring network or field surveys data ravaioli et al 2016 sparnocchia et al 2016 ferrarin et al 2020 favoured the accurate and robust applications of hydrodynamic modelling techniques moreover the adriatic sea is a study area for several pan european research infrastructures focused on the oceanographic variables danubius ri jerico emso eric icos marine in particular within danubius ri the international centre for advanced studies on river sea systems the thematic node on modelling will provide several open source tools tailored for transitional and coastal environments such as the po delta and north adriatic lagoons bradley et al 2018 the large volume of scientific literature on the adriatic sea oceanography based on several investigation methodologies spacing from in situ and remote observations to analytical and numerical approaches has already been collected in dedicated books and reviews in particular cushman roisin et al 2001a provide a complete overview of the physical processes and their variability determining the circulation of this marginal sea on the other side a comprehensive review of all aspects of adriatic sea level research covered by the literature is provided in vilibić et al 2017 recently a set of three reviews lionello et al 2021 umgiesser et al 2021 zanchettin et al 2021 has been published on the past evolution present issues and future projections of sea levels and flooding in venice which are strongly linked to the adriatic sea dynamics despite the completeness of previous works a dedicated review on the state of the art hydrodynamic modelling is still missing it is worth mentioning that numerical models represent more and more fundamental tools for investigating and managing marine environments therefore this review paper aims to synthesize knowledge about hydrodynamic modelling using contributions from a broad representation of research works designed to investigate the adriatic sea a long standing laboratory for hydrodynamic model development and testing in this paper we focus our attention on the numerical models and modules developed or improved specifically in the adriatic sea and thereafter exported to other environments for most of the presented arguments we provide examples of hydrodynamic modelling of processes and coastal systems in the adriatic sea the authors of this review gained their knowledge about the adriatic sea developing one of the modelling tools broadly applied in the area the shyfem model umgiesser et al 2004 shyfem is an open source 3d baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic finite element model which solves the primitive equations vertically integrated over each layer considering tidal atmospheric and density driven forces https github com shyfem model shyfem however several other hydrodynamic models were implemented in the area such as pom beg paklar et al 2001 nemo clementi et al 2017 roms carniel et al 2009 coawst bonaldo et al 2016 adcirc orlić et al 2010 coherens marinov et al 2006 ncom martin et al 2009 diecast cushman roisin et al 2007 mitgcm querin et al 2006 delft3d vousdoukas et al 2016 fesom c androsov et al 2019 schism međugorac et al 2018 the review paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the hydrodynamic modelling works with the aim of describing the circulation subdivided by forcing mechanism over the whole adriatic sea section 3 describes the modelling developments and applications for coastal studies subdivided by type of environment in section 4 we briefly present additional numerical applications devoted to investigating the transport and dispersion of different substances in the adriatic sea section 5 provides an overview of the hydrodynamic models adopted in operational oceanography knowledge gaps recommendations and perspectives are presented in section 6 2 basin scale hydrodynamics water circulation in the adriatic sea has been extensively investigated through the use of numerical models hydrodynamic studies often focus only on the adriatic sea forced at the otranto strait but many model applications consider the whole mediterranean sea this section provides an overview of the hydrodynamic model studies performed in the adriatic sea to investigate the principal forcing mechanisms driving the circulation 2 1 tide in the micro tidal mediterranean sea tides are generated by the sum of the direct action of the equilibrium tide and the incoming atlantic tidal waves the resulting tidal waves interact with the sea bottom producing significant tidal oscillations only in certain areas namely the north adriatic sea the gulf of gabes and the north aegean sea tsimplis et al 1995 only seven tidal constituents four semidiurnal m 2 s 2 n 2 and k 2 and three diurnal k 1 o 1 and p 1 contribute significantly to the evolution of sea surface elevation in the adriatic sea polli 1960 a peculiar characteristic of the adriatic tidal regime is that it has been interpreted as a co oscillation with the mediterranean sea forced through the strait of otranto and amplified by resonance phenomena along with its longitudinal direction from south to north cushman roisin et al 2001b and references therein according to medvedev et al 2020 diurnal and semidiurnal tidal harmonics are resonantly amplified due to the proximity of tidal periods to the periods of the fundamental 21 5 h and first 10 9 h adriatic eigen modes respectively see section 2 2 tides in the adriatic sea have been deeply investigated experimentally theoretically and numerically regarding deterministic modelling there has been considerable effort in simulating tides in the adriatic sea malačič et al 2000 cushman roisin and naimie 2002 janeković et al 2003 janeković and kuzmić 2005 chavanne et al 2007 book et al 2009 guarnieri et al 2013 most of the hydrodynamic model applications were based on a 2d purely barotropic approach however 3d approaches with homogeneous stratification improved significantly the tidal model performance thanks to a more correct reproduction of the vertical shear induced by bottom friction and the subsequent energy dissipation cushman roisin and naimie 2002 ferrarin et al 2013b fig 2 illustrates the cotidal corange chart of the principal semi diurnal m 2 and diurnal k 1 tidal waves in the adriatic sea as shown in fig 2a m 2 amplitude increases from south to north up to 26 cm in the gulf of trieste enhanced by resonance phenomena along the longitudinal direction cushman roisin et al 2001b the superposition of the incident and reflected kelvin waves results in an amphidromic point where all cotidal lines gather into a single point located in the middle adriatic sea south of ancona the amplitude of k 1 constituent fig 2b increases progressively northwards over decreasing depth from the forced open boundary to the gulf of trieste where it reaches about 17 cm k 1 cotidal lines tend to be parallel to the adriatic sea major axis without the presence of amphidromic points according to defant 1960 the k 1 component should have an amphidromic point centred near the strait of otranto but since the channel s open end is too close the amphidromy is very weak tidal currents tend to be aligned along the adriatic major axis and there is generally an increase of current intensity from south to north recently ferrarin et al 2017 showed that the inclusion of the coastal lagoons in the computational domain improved the capability of the model in reproducing tidal currents in the whole northern adriatic sea these effects originate from the active exchange of water between the tidal embayments and the open sea through the inlets which lead to different scattered waves propagating back into the open sea such radiation damping effect enhances tidal amplitude and tidal currents in the northern adriatic sea it is worth mentioning that anthropogenic induced morphological changes that occurred in the lagoons altered the tidal propagation in the lagoons ferrarin et al 2015 with a consequent effect on tidal characteristics in the adjacent sea these results highlight the need for including coastal environments in the computational domain to correctly reproduce hydrodynamics in regional seas 2 2 storm surge and seiches sea storms represent one of the main threat in coastal areas causing a range of potential hazards such as coastal erosion and inundation as well as damage to infrastructure and to the important cultural heritage chaumillon et al 2017 the problem of sea storms is particularly relevant for the adriatic sea where extreme sea levels are higher than in other parts of the mediterranean basin marcos et al 2009 although several coastal settlements can be impacted and even flooded reimann et al 2018 the main concern in the adriatic sea is for venice due to its artistic heritage and historical importance therefore sea level prediction is of the utmost importance in venice since storm events often cause the flooding of the city especially when associated with spring tides bajo et al 2017 the situation has worsened in the last few decades due to the effect of sea level rise lionello et al 2021 storm surge events in the northern adriatic sea are mainly induced by strong south easterly moist and warm wind called sirocco lionello et al 2012 therefore a critical aspect in modelling storm surges in the adriatic is the atmospheric forcings used on the surface to simulate the storm surge one needs wind usually at 10 m and mean sea level pressure or surface pressure in the case of surface pressure attention must be paid to possible interpolation problems near the coasts in order not to consider values on the ground which can vary a lot due to the presence of hills the use of high resolution meteorological forcing is essential to capture the temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of winds over the adriatic sea which are strongly influenced by the complex local orography and small scale processes dorman et al 2006 davolio et al 2015 the need of predicting coastal flooding in venice and in the northern adriatic sea triggered a continuous development of numerical tools and forecasting systems see among others robinson et al 1973 lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2007 bajo and umgiesser 2010 ferrarin et al 2013b cavaleri et al 2019 ferrarin et al 2020 storm surges have been generally simulated in the adriatic sea using hydrodynamic models that solve the shallow water equations in two dimensions to increase the calculation speed and without simulating the astronomical tide although it is shown that different components of the sea level such as the astronomical tide and the storm surge can only be considered independent in a first approximation since both depend on and influence the total depth horsburgh and wilson 2007 in the adriatic their interaction is negligible ferrarin et al 2013b similarly the wave effect set up on the sea level is generally not considered in storm surge modelling in the adriatic sea ferrarin et al 2013b reported that storm surge statistics of the coupled and uncoupled surge wave models do not differ significantly such results are however influenced by the horizontal resolution of the model often not sufficient to resolve the surf zone and the location of the tide gauge stations roland et al 2009 demonstrated that with an adequate horizontal resolution a fully coupled current wave model could provide a detailed representation of the wave set up in the shallow northern adriatic sea during extreme storm events benetazzo et al 2013 applied the roms swan coupled models over the adriatic sea and demonstrated that the wave current interaction on wave action is not negligible as an example fig 3 shows the storm surge distribution during the november 12th 2019 flooding event in the northern adriatic sea when the sea level came to mark the second highest value since the beginning of the records in 1872 the storm surge was simulated with the shyfem model applied to the mediterranean basin and forced with high resolution atmospheric fields south easterly winds and a secondary local fast moving cyclone travelling in the north westward direction produced a well defined along basin sea level gradient with large surges on its northern border and in particular in front of venice cavaleri et al 2020 ferrarin et al 2021a in the adriatic sea most of the strong storm surge events trigger free sea level oscillations with periods determined by the normal modes of the basin seiches that start when the atmospheric forcing vanishes and may last for several days vilibić 2000 the two main modes have periods of about 21 and 11 h each and the decay time of the oscillation at 21 h is about three days cerovečki et al 1997 in december 2019 very strong seiche oscillations up to 0 4 m in amplitude occurred in the northern adriatic sea fig 4 determining a sequence of severe flooding episodes in venice lionello et al 2021 ferrarin et al 2022 therefore the correct reproduction of these oscillations which is strictly linked to selected bottom shear stress formulation adopted in the modelling system is crucial in forecasting high water events in the northern adriatic sea because their contribution often adds to that of new storm surges bajo et al 2019 moreover their decay time which depends in part on the bottom stress can be influenced by currents due to the astronomical tide or other long term components of the sea level bajo et al 2019 since these oscillations have nodal points near the strait of otranto it is recommended to consider a computational domain larger than the adriatic sea the entire mediterranean basin is therefore often considered in storm surge modelling bajo et al 2007 according to several climate studies storm surges in the northern adriatic sea are likely to decrease in their intensity in the future vousdoukas et al 2016 denamiel et al 2020a lionello et al 2021 2 3 baroclinic circulation the baroclinic circulation is the result of different dynamical interactions and can be strengthened or weakened by the concurrent action of other forcings like tide and wind ocean models should solve the navier stokes equations along with a nonlinear equation of state that couples water temperature and salinity to the fluid velocity in order to reproduce the vertical mixing and lateral advective processes driven by surface heat and mass fluxes lateral freshwater fluxes and tidal mixing surface momentum exchange and heat dynamics should also be solved internally in the model freshwater is discharged into the adriatic sea mostly from rivers along the northern and northwestern coasts due to the abundant freshwater inputs the adriatic sea is considered a dilution basin exporting relatively fresh water to the adjacent ionian sea ludwig et al 2009 as a consequence the circulation is strongly influenced by the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers fig 5 reports the adriatic sea general circulation structures during calm and stratified summer july 2019 and energetic autumn november 2019 conditions the presented circulation fields have been obtained averaging over a month the results of the tiresias forecasting system ferrarin et al 2019 given the general cyclonic circulation of the adriatic sea the effect of localized wind forcings like bora wind episodes flowing along the eastern north eastern border of the basin induces transient but frequent double gyre configurations the one located more nw is cyclonic the southern one in front of rovinj is anti cyclonic that interacts with the major freshwater source of the northern adriatic sea modulating the extrusion of coastal water in the full northern basin kuzmić et al 2006 ličer et al 2016 the wind is also strongly influencing the southward water transport along the italian coast induced by the po river outflow producing instabilities that can grow to form mesoscale eddies cushman roisin et al 2007 magaldi et al 2010 guarnieri et al 2013 identified how the major effect of tides on baroclinic circulation is detected where high baroclinic pressure gradients occur and the tidal signal is significant as is the case for several coastal zones in the northern adriatic sea and particularly in the po rofi region of freshwater influence the introduction of tides allows a better characterization of the extension and variability of rofi moreover as identified by bellafiore et al 2019 in coastal stratified waters the tide modulates upwelling and downwelling processes tidal straining more generally tides affect the baroclinic circulation in several areas of the mediterranean sea palma et al 2020 2 4 dense water formation and cascading another process of interest for the adriatic sea is the formation and propagation of the dense water dw generally dw forms in the shallow continental shelf in the north adriatic sea when periods of prolonged cold north easterly bora winds lead to a cooling of surface waters thus becoming denser and sinking the amount of dw formed in the northern adriatic is dependent on the conditions occurring in the lead up to the event so called preconditioning factors such as a reduction in freshwater inputs from rivers leading to saltier waters which can then sink and move southwards along the western coast and the advection of saltier water masses from the southern parts of the adriatic sea more recently studies from mihanović et al 2021 and vilibić et al 2020 identified the general thermohaline condition of the whole adriatic sea as a preconditioning factor for dwf they showed that the inflow of saltier and warmer water masses from the southern border of the adriatic sea coming from the eastern mediterranean and the interaction with the adriatic ionian bimodal oscillating system bios can play a role in leading to an overall saltier surface layer and a deepening of levantine intermediate water liw dunić et al 2018 mihanović et al 2021 the dense water vein then propagates in weeks months to the central and southern adriatic sea interacting with the coastal varying bottom dw can partially fill in the middle adriatic depression and south adriatic pit through turbulent flows mixing with the adriatic deep waters being an important contributor to the general circulation of the basin and driving the overall baroclinic circulation of the basin mihanović et al 2018 pranić et al 2021 models have been used to investigate how different preconditions lead to dw formation in colder or milder winters benetazzo et al 2014 vilibić et al 2016a 2018 and have determined projections on possible variations due to future climate change querin et al 2013 denamiel et al 2020b model implementations allowed to disentangle the main forcings triggering dw formation recognizing heat loss as massively more effective than the increase in salinity for the generation of the process mihanović et al 2018 moreover the importance of appropriate resolution for meteorological forcing became evident for dw generation as well as for the other relevant coastal processes driven by wind and atmospheric pressure kuzmić et al 2006 mihanović et al 2018 pranić et al 2021 janeković et al 2014 found that moving from 8 km to 2 km resolution of the surface wind forcing can significantly reduce errors the dw southward flow is mainly controlled by the general circulation and therefore the correct reproduction of the different water masses is needed for this high vertical resolution is important gunduz et al 2013 found that having significant resolution can impact the characteristics of the liw in the mediterranean model affecting the dense water formed in the southern adriatic and the accuracy of the model simulation moreover the dw flow follows the bathymetric control both at regional and small scales a highly resolved bathymetry is necessary to properly reproduce dw and to correctly modulate downslope dw flow vilibić et al 2008 a hydrodynamic wave coupled model evidenced also how dw propagation plays a role in modulating bedforms dynamics entraining sediments and modifying erosion deposition paths particularly in the south western adriatic coast bari canyon wang et al 2006 bonaldo et al 2016 a hydrostatic model has been shown to be adequate for reproducing the dw formation and initial propagation in the northern adriatic mckiver et al 2016 however once dw interacts with sudden bottom changes as in submarine canyons the bari canyon non hydrostatic processes play a role non hydrostatic models are needed to capture the stronger bottom flow and the frequency and intensity of the dw pulses flowing into the canyons and breaking the isotropic balance bellafiore et al 2018 2 5 tsunami and meteotsunami several destructive high frequency sea level oscillations in the tsunami frequency band have been reported along the coast of the adriatic sea pasarić et al 2012 and reference therein tsunami waves could be generated by submarine earthquakes inland earthquakes landslides or air pressure disturbances associated with fast moving weather events the latter phenomenon is known as meteotsunami monserrat et al 2006 and may determine floodings and breakages in several coastal locations along the east coast of the adriatic sea orlić 2015 the general approach to model tsunami like waves is based on solving the hydrodynamic equations with proper boundary conditions at the sea floor in the case of seismic tsunamis and at the sea surface in the case of meteotsunamis the origin of the perturbation is the displacement caused by the earthquake source in the first case assuming the ocean and solid earth to be coupled paulatto et al 2007 and resonance with tsunamigenic atmospheric processes in the latter requiring ocean atmosphere coupling vilibić et al 2016b modelling of tsunamis either seismic or meteorological requires properly resolving the morphological and bathymetric features of the studied area this is crucial in the shallow areas of the adriatic sea since it can strongly influence wave amplification and travel time and in harbours and bays where resonance plays an important role in the local amplification of tsunami waves vilibić and šepić 2009 the adriatic sea is also a laboratory for meteotsunami forecasting recently an operational modelling system consisting of different ocean and atmospheric modules has been developed denamiel et al 2019b a in order to deterministically reproduce meteotsunami the ocean model requires very high resolution along the coast while the atmospheric model must capture tsunamigenic atmospheric disturbances and therefore requires high horizontal spatial resolution in the order of 1 km high vertical resolution and a reduced time step 1 min denamiel et al 2019b 3 coastal modelling a wide variety of coastal environments are present along the coastline of the adriatic sea the eastern and western sides of the adriatic sea greatly differ in appearance the western coast is largely sedimentary with mild sloping and sandy beaches while the eastern coast is composed of many islands and headlands and is generally rugged and rocky therefore lagoons and deltas are mainly located along the italian peninsula and also the albanian coast while bays coves and fjords characterize the eastern coast simulation of water circulation and of the principal physical processes affecting coastal areas requires the use of numerical models at high spatial resolution capable of representing complex morphological and bathymetric features as well as several anthropogenic constructions piers harbours breakwaters jetties present along the coast moreover downscaling techniques are needed in order to reproduce the mass exchange between the open sea and the coastal area this goal can be achieved through the implementation of numerical models based on a unique unstructured grid able to describe processes at different spatial scales cucco et al 2012 zhang et al 2016a ferrarin et al 2016 stanev et al 2017 federico et al 2017 denamiel et al 2018 ferrarin et al 2018 or through the nesting of models structured and unstructured at different resolution kourafalou et al 2015 trotta et al 2017 fortunato et al 2017 the use of an unstructured grid as we will see in the next subsections gives the advantage of using higher resolution at the coast while applying more modest resolution towards the open sea an approach that has proved to be accurate for many coastal systems in the adriatic sea in this section we provide examples of hydrodynamic modelling of the different types of coastal systems found along the adriatic sea coastline for each case some specific aspects and requirements of the hydrodynamic model implementation are highlighted 3 1 lagoons several shallow coastal transitional water bodies are present along the italian coastline they cover the whole spectrum of geographic and hydrodynamic characteristics presented by kjerfve 1986 ranging from leaky marano grado lagoon ferrarin et al 2010b to restricted lagoon of venice po delta lagoons umgiesser et al 2014 maicu et al 2018 2021 and choked lesina and varano lagoons ferrarin et al 2014b types fig 6 several chocked lagoons are also present along the albanian coastline viluni patok karavasta narte and pasha liman numerical modelling of such systems needs high resolution to reproduce in detail the complex channel network departing from the inlets in tidal environments e g venice and marano grado lagoons fig 6a and b as well as the very narrow 5 10 m wide connections with the open sea of choked basins e g lesina lagoon fig 6c the unstructured approach is desirable for investigating hydrodynamics in these environments since it adequately reproduces the complex geometry and bathymetry using polygons of variable form and size the narrow inlets that connect a lagoon with the sea ensure an active water and transported substances exchange driven by barotropic and baroclinic pressure gradients resulting from the tidal meteorological and oceanographic conditions in order to correctly reproduce the sea lagoon exchange the numerical mesh should consider the inner basin and part of the nearby shelf sea fig 6 in the case of the northern adriatic lagoons some numerical applications were designed to comprise the whole adriatic sea in the computational domains bellafiore and umgiesser 2010 lovato et al 2010 ferrarin et al 2016 the currents in shallow lagoons are mostly caused by tides and wind main winds and tidal rectification over complex bathymetry consisting of a non linear momentum transfer from the oscillating tidal currents to the mean flow robinson 1981 generates a residual circulation structure residual currents have been recognized as fundamental indicators of the net water movement and long term sediment transport de swart and zimmerman 2009 in this context hydrodynamic models constitute a useful tool for investigating the residual circulation umgiesser 2000 and tidal asymmetry ferrarin et al 2015 in coastal environments in such shallow environments average depth in the order of 1 m bottom friction is a major force kjerfve 1994 therefore the most important parameter to be set for the hydrodynamic model is the value of the bottom friction coefficient even if different parameterizations of the bottom friction exist e g chézy gauckler manning strickler a site specific optimization of the frictional parameters by reducing the root mean square error between model results and observations calibration process is always mandatory since bottom friction depends on the seabed roughness which in turn is determined by the sediment type waves currents aquatic vegetation and organisms e g corals and sponges a spatially and temporally varying friction parameter is required in many coastal systems see among others umgiesser et al 2004 d alpaos and defina 2007 araújo et al 2008 the bottom friction coefficient can be very large in shallow areas and lead to a stability criterion where the time step is severely restricted coastal models based on a semi implicit discretization can handle this term implicitly allowing much larger time steps e g shyfem umgiesser et al 2004 in models that use mode splitting blumberg and mellor 1987 bleck and smith 1990 killworth et al 1991 higdon and bennett 1996 an implicit treatment of bottom friction interferes with the barotropic mode adding an adjustment of the bottom drag term into the barotropic mode can nevertheless increase stability androsov et al 2019 even if currents are mainly barotropic several studies demonstrated that 3d approaches either with homogeneous stratification or baroclinic fully stratified models reproduce the bottom boundary properties more accurately than the vertically integrated formulation in the deepest part of the basin see among others ferrarin et al 2010a this is due to the fact that the bottom stress differs in the two cases in 2d barotropic models it is based on depth averaged velocity whereas in the 3d applications it depends on the near bottom velocity tidal lagoons as well as other coastal water basins are characterized by the presence of sheltered environments in the upper coastal intertidal zone marshes which are periodically flooded during the tidal cycle similarly wetting and drying occur also in rivers deltas and lakes floodplains thus an accurate representation of wetting drying processes in tidal marshes coastal areas and floodplains is a crucial issue for hydrodynamic models which has been the subject of many studies d alpaos and defina 2007 medeiros and hagen 2013 and references therein and still represents a numerical challenge le et al 2020 in short wetting drying involve a delicate balance of computational efficiency both processing demand and memory allocation numerical stability convergence spurious oscillations and scientific accuracy medeiros and hagen 2013 3 2 deltas and estuaries the amount of water injected into the adriatic sea is highly variable during the year the po river represents the major buoyancy input with a mean discharge rate of 1500 m 3 s 1 accounting for about one third of the total riverine freshwater input into the adriatic sea ludwig et al 2009 other surface sources of freshwater are concentrated along the northern italian side and the central and southern east coasts another significant contributor of freshwater to the adriatic is the submarine groundwater discharge through submarine springs from a modelling point of view the river s conjunction with the sea represents a challenge because open ocean models applied in oceanography cannot fully reproduce the small scale hydrodynamic processes occurring in these areas even if several estuarine box models have been developed for representing the freshwater flux at river mouths in structured ocean modelling see among others verri et al 2020 the unstructured approach provides the advantage of adequately resolving the river sea continuum by considering the lower part of the rivers in the computational domain zhang et al 2016b stanev et al 2019 ferrarin et al 2019 this is especially true for complex multiple mouth deltas or meandering estuaries apart from the horizontal model resolution deltas and estuaries are considered challenging for ocean models for the parameterization of the turbulent mixing because of morphological complexity strong density stratification and intense current fields burchard et al 2008 smagorinsky s formulation smagorinsky 1963 is often used to parameterize the horizontal eddy viscosity and diffusivity in ocean models as a function of the grid size vertical mixing transports between the sea surface and the deeper layers are generally parameterized using a statistical turbulence closure scheme among others the general ocean turbulence model gotm umlauf and burchard 2005 represents a state of the art turbulence closure module that has been included with success in many reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models such as shyfem roms fvcom tuflow fv selfe fesom getm and nemo in order to parameterize turbulent exchange alternatively the more complex large eddy simulation les models which compute the largest scales of turbulence using a filtered version of the navier stokes equation provide a powerful tool for examining the formation of turbulence and other small scale processes in coastal systems roman et al 2010 however with respect to the rans approach les requires elevated computing resources because of grid size requirements and time step limitations for reproducing small scale turbulence dynamics we also mention that extra care is needed when large gradients build up in correspondence to the river inputs for higher than first order methods non linear stability can be enforced to avoid the uncontrolled growth of oscillations among the different stability bounds the majority of coastal ocean models impose a total variation diminishing tvd property in both finite volume and finite element ocean models this is obtained by means of slope flux limiters following the general framework of non oscillatory high order schemes shu 1987 kuzmin and turek 2002 an example of a complex river outflow is represented by the po river which develops in a delta consisting of five main branches some secondary creeks and a system of seven coastal lagoons caleri marinetta basson barbamarco canarin scardovari and goro fig 7 the dynamics of the po river discharge and its influence on the adriatic sea circulation have been studied for a long time not only from a hydrodynamic but also from a sedimentological point of view umgiesser and bergamasco 1998 presented a preliminary modelling study of the po plume dynamics and its response to different forcing the main plume forming from po outflow is at the central mouth pila and is characterized by an anticyclonic bulge seaward of the river mouth with a coastal southward current contained within a narrow strip along the coast kourafalou 2001 plume shape and extent are mainly influenced by the strength of the discharge and the meteorological forcings falcieri et al 2014 the unstructured shyfem model has been recently applied to the po delta for investigating hydrodynamics in the whole river sea system maicu et al 2018 to study coastal mixing of the multiple river mouths bellafiore et al 2019 and to analyse saltwater intrusion under a changing climate bellafiore et al 2021 the use of triangles of different shapes and sizes is therefore necessary to represent in detail all river branches with the floodplain and the seven shallow lagoons fig 7 as illustrated in the right panel of fig 7 the high resolution of the model allowed to reproduce the horizontal mixing and coastal upwelling processes occurring at the river mouths that originate and drive the dynamics of plumes and coastal small saltwater bulges bellafiore et al 2019 another important input of freshwater into the adriatic basin is the neretva river which flows near the port town of ploc e in croatia fig 8 shows the unstructured grid of the shyfem application which considers the neretva estuary up to 20 km upstream from the mouth nearby wetlands and part of the coastal sea ferrarin et al 2021b the right panel in fig 8 shows the average simulated along channel salinity and velocity distribution for summer 2020 which is the result of advection shear dispersion and tidal oscillation an estuarine dynamic characterizes the circulation in the system with the outflow of riverine waters at the surface and the inflow of marine water in the bottom layers as with many other coastal systems worldwide the neretva estuary is subjected to the upstream extension of the mixing zone with the consequent increase of the salt content in aquifers surface waters and nearby soils krvavica and ruz ić 2020 lovrinović et al 2021 baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic modelling in this context represents a powerful tool for exploring saltwater intrusion also under climate change scenarios bellafiore et al 2021 3 3 bays bays like other coastal transitional environments actively interact with the main basin influencing it and being influenced by it in terms of circulation patterns and freshwater supply bays have been deeply investigated through the use of numerical modelling see among others ye et al 2018 in the adriatic sea several examples of bays can be found along its eastern border characterized by fragmented coastlines and many islands one of the most intriguing features along the entire adriatic coast is the bay of boka kotorska where the sea enters inland for over 20 km the bay located along the montenegro coastline can be divided by its geographic hydrographic properties into three major basins connected by two narrow straits kumbor and verige fig 9 two rivers and many submerged springs flow into the bay triangles in fig 9 which can therefore be considered one of the main freshwater inputs into the southern adriatic sea mandić et al 2016 boka kotorska bay has a complex bathymetric setting with several morphological features shaping the seafloor bortoluzzi et al 2016 the characteristic of all internal bays is that depths increase towards the central zone depths ranging from 35 to 45 m while steep slopes are found close to the shoreline and in the narrow passages at the straits see the yellow panel in fig 9 even if many signs of progress have been made in the bathymetric survey in the last decade a high resolution multibeam dataset covering a whole coastal system requires a significant effort e g madricardo et al 2017 which is often not achievable however we have to keep in mind that detailed bathymetry is crucial for implementing a reliable hydrodynamic model in complex coastal systems ye et al 2018 freshwater input from the numerous sources in the bays strongly modifies temperature salinity and current patterns with the formation of density driven flows bellafiore et al 2011 major physical processes affecting bay circulation and vertical mixing have been simulated with the 3d baroclinic fully stratified shyfem model forced by high resolution open sea ferrarin et al 2019 and meteorological fields davolio et al 2017 and average freshwater discharges bellafiore et al 2011 circulation maps of summer 2019 conditions are presented in the bottom panels of fig 9 an estuarine dynamic characterizes the circulation in the bay with the outflow of less saline water at the surface and the inflow of marine water at the intermediate and bottom layers in both layers the strongest currents are found nearby the river outflow and in the straits the intrusion of sea waters is limited by a sill near the bay mouth as a result of its confinement some sectors of the bay could suffer from poor water renewal or high water retention especially the deeper layers during low freshwater discharges hydrodynamic modelling complemented by a transport and diffusion model could represent a precious tool for investigating the exchange and flushing capacity in so complex coastal systems see section 4 1 3 4 fjords fjords are narrow and deep inlets carved by glacial processes generally strongly stratified and often with three clearly distinguishable water masses stigebrandt 2012 hydrodynamic modelling of fjords requires as for the other coastal system high spatial resolution in order to correctly represent the complex coastline often composed of many headlands coves and straits moreover these deep coastal systems need to be well discretized in the vertical dimension to adequately resolve the different water masses and mixing processes valle levinson et al 2014 among the different vertical coordinate systems developed for ocean modelling geo potential zeta terrain following sigma isopycnal hybrid layers offer a mixture between sigma layers close to the surface and zeta layers in the deeper parts of the basin burchard and petersen 1997 if strong bathymetry gradients are present it avoids possible instabilities due to the sigma layers in the deeper parts while maintaining high resolution near the surface several other vertical coordinate systems have been developed for cross scale river estuary shelf ocean applications it is worth mentioning the localized sigma coordinates with shaved cell lsc 2 method developed by zhang et al 2015 which combines sigma and zeta layers avoiding artificial staircases near the bottom and reducing pressure gradient errors in the adriatic sea two fjord like systems are present along the istria peninsula the lim canal and raša river canal due to their morphological characteristics these coastal systems are often called fjords although they are a ria because the are not carved by glacial processes but by river erosion as an example of numerical modelling of a fjord we present here the application of the shyfem model to the raša river canal fig 10 ferrarin et al 2021b this is a 14 km long and 700 m wide canal with a depth ranging from 1 m at the river mouth to 50 m at the sea boundary the model application required a detailed bathymetric dataset interpolated on a numerical mesh with horizontal resolution up to 50 m however the high horizontal resolution is not enough to identify the most suitable tool for this kind of hydrodynamic investigation the vertical resolution and discretization become important when passing from really shallow and meandering zones like the inner river to the shelf and finally to the open sea in this model application we used a hybrid vertical coordinate system with 10 sigma layers in the upper 10 m and the remaining 1 m thick zeta layers the choice of the hybrid system was driven by the need of resolving stratification even in the northern shallow part of the system where the river flows as well as of ensuring an adequate vertical resolution in the deeper part results of the model application are presented in terms of water temperature and velocity patterns over the along fjord transect during stratified summer and flood tidal conditions right panel in fig 10 in accordance with the dynamics found in many other fjords the circulation in the raša river canal is characterized by a two three layer structures consisting of a surface layer of water with reduced salinity due to the freshwater supply moving towards the sea a bottom layer of salty and cold basin water and an intermediary layer stigebrandt 2012 the density driven circulation is modified by the tidal action which during the flood phase pushes warm seawater into the lower part of the fjord at the surface vertical mixing mainly occurs at approximately 5 km from the sea in correspondence to a bathymetric jump the described dynamic however just represents a snapshot of the circulation in the fjord different vertical circulation structures can arise from the action of wind tide ocean and freshwater pulses valle levinson et al 2014 4 transport and dispersion modelling hydrodynamic modelling is devoted to the description of the water circulation under the influence of different forcing but many substances are transported within the water the concurrence of intense atmospheric forcing the highest tidal amplitudes of the whole mediterranean sea and the intense freshwater inflows led the adriatic sea to be characterized by a wide range of different transport phenomena moreover the heavily anthropized adriatic sea is subjected to several stressors which alter the natural characteristics of the sea and its coast determining many environmental problems these peculiar aspects are at the basis of the development and application of several numerical transport models which rely on the use of a hydrodynamic engine simulations of larger numbers of substances either passive or reactive have been undertaken using both eulerian and lagrangian approaches cucco et al 2009 in an eulerian framework the evolution of a tracer concentration can be described at each fixed point in space by the advection diffusion equation on the other hand a lagrangian approach consists of following a water parcel as it moves with the flow in this section we briefly report the modelling developments undertaken in the adriatic sea for describing the transport and dispersion of different substances highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of the different applications the reader may refer to van sebille et al 2018 and reference therein for a more comprehensive review on the topic 4 1 transport time scale multiple concepts of hydrodynamic transport time parameters flushing time residence time water age export time confinement have been used in coastal sea research and their comparison has been intensively discussed cucco et al 2009 melaku canu et al 2012 lucas and deleersnijder 2020 and references therein noting that the parameters are different in their definition and application most of these transport time scales tts hereafter can be averaged over the whole basin or can be computed locally to provide information on the spatial variability of the water renewal capacity in many coastal systems of the adriatic sea the estimate of the locally variable tts has been widely used as a support for the analysis of physical sedimentary and ecological processes molinaroli et al 2007 ferrarin et al 2010b melaku canu et al 2012 umgiesser et al 2014 maicu et al 2018 or to evaluate the effects of the human interventions and climate change on the water circulation and flushing features ghezzo et al 2010 ferrarin et al 2013a 2014a among the many transport time scales the most commonly used are the turnover time or flushing time the residence time or renewal time the water age and the transit time or exposure time the turnover time is a bulk estimate of the basin renewal capacity that is expressed by means of simple analytical methods and assuming a fully mixed hydrodynamic condition of the basin monsen et al 2002 the water residence time the transit time and the age are spatially defined and can be computed following several numerical approaches all based on the use of hydrodynamic and transport models cucco and umgiesser 2015 the adriatic sea and its coastal systems constitute the ideal study case for developing and testing different methods for computing the tts the turnover time of the adriatic sea has been estimated by several authors to range between 0 7 to 5 years depending on the adopted methodology in most cases the estimate was derived by direct measurements of the water fluxes through the otranto strait orlić et al 1992 or by the analysis of radionuclides fallout sanchez cabeza et al 2002 franic 2005 in all the studies the computation of the turnover time was performed without considering the spatial variability of the basin water circulation and its direct effects on the basin renewal capacity in recent years locally variable tts were computed for the adriatic sea by combining drifter measurements and numerical models to obtain estimates of the surface water transit time poulain and hariri 2013 integrated drifter data with a statistical advection dispersion model of the adriatic surface circulation obtaining particles transit time through the otranto channel ranging between 260 days for the northern sub basin to 185 days for the southern one in a recent study hariri 2020 followed a similar approach using a particle tracking model ptm integrating the surface mean flow field obtained by the mitgcm ocean model implemented for the adriatic sea numerical results were compared with drifters data to estimate the basin average transit time that varied between 182 and 187 days in the adriatic sea similar numerical applications were carried out to analyse the connectivity between different marine habitats e g carlson et al 2016 bandelj et al 2020 or between spawning and nursery areas of commercial fish species bray et al 2017 these types of applications constitute indirect sources of information about the tts analysing in high details the water transit time between specific and ecologically valuable areas of the basin since the early 2000s bulk estimates of the flushing features were made for several lagoons along the adriatic coasts following the loicz method giordani et al 2005 a simplified box modelling approach based on the budgeting of salt and water mass fluxes the results obtained generally overestimated the real flushing capacity of the investigated basins and did not represent the complexity of the lagoon s water transport processes the necessity to estimate the tts with higher precision led to the application of hydrodynamic models based on unstructured mesh the venice lagoon was set as an ideal test site for discovering the peculiarities of the different model developments in cucco and umgiesser 2006 the locally variable water residence times or renewal times were firstly computed following an eulerian approach and considering different forcing scenarios including tides only and tides combined with wind in later works cucco et al 2009 cucco and umgiesser 2015 viero and defina 2016 the turnover time the water renewal times the water age and the transit time were estimated and the behaviour of the different tts compared among each other in relation to the main meteo marine forcing the results obtained highlighted the inverse correlation between the eulerian and lagrangian tts in relation to the local hydrodynamic features these numerical applications established the turnover time of the lagoon waters obtained by averaging the different locally variable tts to vary between 4 to around 50 days in depending on the forcing conditions in fig 11 the vertically integrated water renewal time is reported for the venice lagoon evidencing the spatial variability of the tts with lower values in correspondence to the lagoon inlets and higher values in the inner lagoon 4 2 biogeochemistry the river input of freshwater rich in nutrients drives the tropic state of the adriatic sea determining phytoplankton blooms and the condition of upper chain nets lotze et al 2011 moreover in the shallow area of the adriatic sea the vertical gradients induced by the interaction between pelagic and benthic components represent a relevant factor mussap and zavatarelli 2017 the development of biogeochemical models of the adriatic sea started in the 1990s with simplified one dimensional models of the main biogeochemical variables in the water column in front of the po delta vichi et al 1998 2003 umgiesser et al 2003 zavatarelli et al 2000 developed a biomass based ecological model of a geometrically idealized adriatic sea basin forced by the nutrient river input under a perpetual year seasonal cycle condition see also zavatarelli et al 2002 his results indicated the dependence of the seasonal phytoplankton cycle on the nutrient river inputs and on their horizontal and vertical distribution induced by the water circulation this study included a sediment biogeochemical model interacting with the water column through organic matter and nutrient and gas exchanges polimene et al 2006 proposed the first three dimensional ecosystem simulation of the adriatic sea ecosystem using realistic basin geometry and forcing the authors indicated the coupling between the water column and first benthic layer and the river nutrients inputs as the most relevant improvement to be done in future applications and used this numerical tool to investigate the dissolved organic carbon accumulation polimene et al 2007 in the adriatic sea according to fennel et al 2019 and kurahashi nakamura et al 2020 the crucial aspects for developing reliable biogeochemical models are the inclusion of the water column bottom interactions and of several functional groups there has been considerable effort in understanding the po river s influence on nutrients and circulation spillman et al 2007 lazzari et al 2012 fiori et al 2016 and in general on the effect of physical characteristics on biogeochemical variables boldrin et al 2009 also special focus was given to the occurrence of anoxia conditions russo et al 2009 macias et al 2018 and the pelagic benthic interaction brigolin et al 2011 2018 mussap and zavatarelli 2017 actually the copernicus ocean product offers a forecast and hindcast data service including biogeochemical simulation in the mediterranean area the operational nemo system is coupled offline with an assimilative biogeochemical system the simulated variables cover the water column with no or simple interaction with the sediment and the biogeochemical data assimilation was introduced to improve the results overall along the coast teruzzi et al 2018 cossarini et al 2019 salon et al 2019 such a biogeochemical model allowed for the estimation of trends and anomalies in nutrients and air sea co 2 fluxes in the mediterranean sea von schuckmann et al 2019 these products however lack the adequate resolution to correctly represent coastal lagoons river mouths and the jagged morphology of the eastern coastline the biogeochemical and ecological characteristics of the adriatic sea as with many other environments worldwide changed in time also due to human activity having direct or indirect impacts on the marine ecosystems i e lotze et al 2011 in this context the results of coupled biogeochemical and food web models i e akoglu et al 2015 represent a source of information for assessing cumulative impacts ecosystem services and planning of efficient location for protected areas i e furlan et al 2019 4 3 oil spills and marine litter significant pollution in the adriatic sea derives from both coastal commercial port activities mass tourism resorts aquaculture riverine inputs and offshore oil and gas extraction maritime traffic fishery sources more generally in the mediterranean sea the upgrade of refineries and ports required to handle increased ship tonnage and volumes of hydrocarbons are identified as the main risk sources zodiatis et al 2018 the adriatic sea is definitely a hot spot due to its semi enclosed shape it was estimated that 0 1 thousand tons of oil were spilt in this basin between 2000 and 2009 unep map 2012 in this framework numerical models are crucial to assess the possible consequences of an oil spill accident in real time or in scenarios several oil models are described in the literature such as simap french mccay 2004 gnome beegle krause 2001 blosom duran et al 2018 medslick de dominicis et al 2013b oscar reed et al 1999 and others see barker et al 2020 nelson and grubesic 2020 for an overview of the oil spill models the majority of the oil spill models are based on the lagrangian approach for the slick trajectories simulation the oil slick is discretized into particles moving along trajectories driven by currents winds and waves beg paklar et al 2008 carniel et al 2009 in the last decade the main weathering processes such as slick spreading emulsification evaporation dispersion dissolution oxidation biodegradation beaching sinking and sedimentation were introduced in the oil spill model codes these processes modify the oil slick properties and consequently their behaviour and response to the environmental conditions in relation to the oil typology a new development frontier consists of including more interaction processes with environmental components e g oil sediments or oil ice interaction nelson and grubesic 2020 lončar et al 2012 evaluated hypothetical cases of oil spills caused by ship failure in the northern adriatic sea to assess the oil slick transport and dispersion through a particle tracking model developed for this purpose the oil model included also emulsification dissolution evaporation processes and heat balance between the oil sea and atmosphere liubartseva et al 2015 calculate monthly and climatological oil distribution with the consequent hazard maps and the identification of hot spots in the southern adriatic and northern ionian seas applying medslick ii model de dominicis et al 2013b a coupled to the mediterranean forecasting system mfs interestingly this application used the ship traffic data 2009 2013 to define the positions starting dates and the number of hypothetical oil spills in order to run the simulations and obtain the hazard maps medslick ii was also coupled to msf olita et al 2019 and the unstructured shyfem model ribotti et al 2019 for simulating oil dispersion transport and weathering processes from oil extraction platform in the adriatic sea fig 12 gps equipped surface drifters were used for model validations in recent decades a dangerous pervasive and globally recognized pollutant became the marine plastic litter unep 2016 which represents a threat to human health and consequently a priority for the scientific community barboza et al 2018 the source of marine litter is connected mostly with the inland human activities but also the marine based sources introduce a significant quantity of plastic litter into the ocean hardesty et al 2017 the processes acting to change the fate of marine litter are complex and numerous mechanical fragmentation photo chemical modification sinking biofouling and ingestion critchell and lambrechts 2016 andrady 2017 van sebille et al 2020 the mediterranean and locally in the adriatic sea represent a hot spot for marine litter everaert et al 2020 due to the specific thermohaline circulation of the basin there is a need for regional models resolving the mesoscale features to represent the dispersal of marine litter with sufficient accuracy the numerical models are here employed to study mainly the convergence of the floating litter due to currents wind and waves liubartseva et al 2016 carlson et al 2017 liubartseva et al 2018 macias et al 2019 politikos et al 2020 with the aim of estimating connectivity and potential retention areas prone to have floating micro litter less 0 5 mm rivers cities and main traffic routes are considered as main sources of marine litter liubartseva et al 2016 2018 and some authors studied the possible sink of the floating objects identified by field data carlson et al 2017 in the adriatic sea the po river represents the main riverine source of litter atwood et al 2019 the sinking behaviour of marine litter was considered in liubartseva et al 2016 as a statistical process taking into account the age of particles while neglecting particle change of buoyancy and subsurface transport by a 3d current field liubartseva et al 2018 used this coupled deterministic statistic approach to estimate the partitioning of the marine litter in the water column on the shoreline and on the seafloor soto navarro et al 2020 studied the temporal variability of 3d dispersal of marine litter considering three different types of vertical behaviour of the particles floating neutral and sinking and analysed the distribution of marine litter released by the rivers cities and shipping routes this study approaches the marine litter dispersal also considering the dynamics in the photic layer which represents the first step introducing the effect on the biological community an inverse modelling approach was recently proposed by kaandorp et al 2020 to close the mass balance of marine litter in the mediterranean sea and to estimate the amount of marine litter in the water column seafloor and beaches martins et al 2019 concluded the 2018 model plastic workshop underlying three main gaps in the marine litter modelling 1 the water sediment plastic interaction process 2 the quantification of point and diffuse sources of plastic and 3 the identification of hot spots of plastic accumulation in this context an advantage of the lagrangian approach is that back propagation simulations advection of particles backwards in time can be used to investigate where the marine litter at a certain location come from liubartseva et al 2016 and ličer et al 2020 4 4 water quality and bathing waters many beaches and bathing sites in the adriatic sea are influenced by agricultural urban touristic and industrial activities which strongly affect the quality of bathing waters and consequently human health ferrarin et al 2021b the major sources of microbial escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci contamination of coastal waters are sewage discharges including coastal and submarine outfall stormwater discharges river mouths and runoff from agricultural and urban areas therefore the deterministic modelling of microbial dispersion in coastal waters has received special attention in recent years for quantifying the health hazard of bathing waters scroccaro et al 2010 ostoich et al 2018 numerical models can be used to simulate the microbial plume spatial and temporal evolution in bathing waters simulation of nearshore water quality during and after sewer overflows requires a high resolution model and detailed water discharges and microbial concentration inputs locatelli et al 2020 the concentration of microbial bacteria in marine coastal systems follows a decaying relationship mancini 1978 it is therefore necessary to implement a microbial decay module coupled to the hydrodynamic and dispersion models which defines the evolution of the concentration considering various environmental conditions the decay rate could have a daily pattern that needs to be locally calibrated locatelli et al 2020 or computed as a function of water temperature salinity uv radiation and the light extinction over the water column ostoich et al 2018 in the latter approach a 3d baroclinic fully stratified hydrodynamic model is required not only to reproduce the nearshore circulation but also to provide the spatially varying water temperature and salinity fields for computing the microbial decay rate as an example we report in fig 13 the numerical application of the shyfem hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport and diffusion module and microbial decay module for describing the microbial pollution at fano bathing site italy the unstructured numerical grid reaches resolution up to a few metres to resolve in detail the shallow shore in front of the beach the breakwaters and the mouth of the arzilla river which collects the polluted waters of the urban drainage system ferrarin et al 2021b once discharged into the sea the waters contaminated by e coli are partially blocked by the coastal breakwaters with a resulting deterioration of the quality of the bathing waters in front of the most populated beaches the e coli concentration exceeds in this case the value of 500 cfu 100 ml 1 which is the standard threshold in europe for prohibiting bathing and closing the beaches due to microbial contamination therefore the numerical models could be used in combination with the monitoring activities for describing forecasting and managing the quality of water in bathing sites penna et al 2021 4 5 sediments sediment dynamics and coastal morphology in the adriatic sea are strongly influenced by the elevated fluvial inputs mostly concentrated along the albanian coast and in the northern adriatic the wave action and the longshore transport therefore the hydrodynamic model needs to be coupled to a wave model aimed at estimating the combined current wave bottom shear stress turbulence and wave current interactions and to an advection and diffusion model aimed at simulating the transport of the sediment particles relatively few studies investigated the general basin wide dynamics of sediments with coupled models wang and pinardi 2002 sherwood et al 2004 wang et al 2007 harris et al 2008 while most of the research activity in the adriatic sea focused on specific hotspots northern adriatic lagoons the po delta and submarine canyons there has been considerable effort in developing numerical models for simulating sediments in coastal lagoons rolinski and umgiesser 2005 neumeier et al 2008 umgiesser et al 2006 carniello et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2008 2010a 2016 most of the numerical models have been initially developed for investigating sediment transport in the lagoon of venice which has been subjected to many natural and anthropogenic morphological changes the investigation of the sediment dynamics in such coastal environments requires coupled wave current sediment models able to deal with multiple sediment grain size classes both cohesive and non cohesive and both suspended and bedload transport to properly resolve the lagoon sea granulometry gradient hence a spatially varying initial sediment distribution from observations is mandatory for a realistic representation of the sediment characteristics the most advanced numerical tools also allow for the simulation of a mobile bottom thus considering the morphological evolution of the system at tidal seasonal and inter annual scales and feedback to the hydrodynamics ferrarin et al 2008 carniello et al 2009 ferrarin et al 2016 the fate of fluvial sediments discharged into the adriatic sea by the po river was numerically investigated by many researchers friedrichs and scully 2007 traykovski et al 2007 bever et al 2009 bonaldo et al 2015 nones et al 2020 the simulations allowed the authors to describe the deposition areas in front of the delta and the along shore sediment transport under idealized realistic and future conditions however even if the studies of friedrichs and scully 2007 and traykovski et al 2007 considered gravity flows deposition a 3d baroclinic fully stratified coupled hydrodynamic and fluid mud model to account for the properties and transport of high concentrated suspended matter e g van maren et al 2015 is still missing for the po delta in recent years the transport of sediments by dense water downflows in the deep submarine canyons within the southern adriatic margin received special attention bonaldo et al 2016 and carniel et al 2016 applied the coawst coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport system to simulate the formation and spreading mechanisms of dense water in the adriatic sea for investigating the transport of sediment and bottom feature evolution in the deep canyons 5 operational oceanography most of the oceanographic model development in the adriatic sea as well as for other regional seas was stimulated by the need of predicting the sea conditions in operational mode pinardi et al 2017 essentially two were and still are the main topics in operational oceanography development in the adriatic sea storm surge in the northern part of the basin and general sea circulation storm surge forecasting started in the 1970s robinson et al 1973 and is still under development for a review of storm surge modelling see umgiesser et al 2021 many forecast models adopted a 2d barotropic approach for simulating the response of the ocean to the wind and pressure forcing which is reducing computational costs lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2007 zampato et al 2016 however a 3d representation of the system either with homogeneous stratification or baroclinic fully stratified models allows for better reproduction of the vertical shear induced by bottom friction which is crucial in the shallow northern adriatic sea ferrarin et al 2013b moreover even if extreme sea level events are mostly driven by the storm surge component lionello et al 2021 and therefore most of the forecasting systems are based on a hydrodynamic model forced by a meteorological model the modelling development is moving towards two way current atmospheric pullen et al 2007 current wave dutour sikirić et al 2013 ferrarin et al 2013b clementi et al 2017 fernández montblanc et al 2019 and current wave atmospheric coupled forecasting systems ricchi et al 2016 varlas et al 2018 storm surge forecasting improvements in recent years concentrated on the development of methods for assimilating altimeter bajo et al 2017 and tide gauge data lionello et al 2006 bajo et al 2019 besides data assimilation into hydrodynamic models a special effort was devoted also to the development of post processing approaches e g neural networks and kalman filters to correct short term forecasts produced by storm surge models bajo and umgiesser 2010 bajo 2020 the use of baroclinic fully stratified models in ocean forecasting started with the implementation of the modular ocean model over the mediterranean sea mediterranean forecasting system mfs pinardi et al 2003 mfs has been continuously improved tonani et al 2008 and actually assimilates satellites sea level anomaly and in situ water temperature and salinity profiles clementi et al 2019 subsequently several ocean forecasting systems have been developed specifically for the adriatic basin oddo et al 2006 chiggiato and oddo 2008 russo et al 2013 bressan et al 2017 ferrarin et al 2019 all receiving boundary conditions at the otranto strait from mfs available via the copernicus marine environmental monitoring service http marine copernicus eu other local forecasting systems were also developed using multi nesting techniques federico et al 2017 trotta et al 2017 actually all operational ocean models in the adriatic sea have the limitation of imposing climatological or constant freshwater discharge boundary conditions considering that freshwater strongly influences the adriatic sea circulation coupling with hydrological forecasting models is desirable in the future for providing realistic forecasts the awareness of the prediction uncertainties and errors has led many ocean forecasting systems in the adriatic sea as in other areas around the world to move toward numerical forecasts based on a probabilistic concept the ensemble technique this approach was introduced in the adriatic sea almost exclusively for assessing the uncertainty of storm surge forecasts most of the developed system involves using an ensemble of meteorological prediction systems eps as input to a hydrodynamic model mel and lionello 2016 bajo et al 2019 žust et al 2020 to produce sea level predictions the large number of ocean forecasting systems existing over the adriatic sea allowed the development of a multi model ensemble system for providing probabilistic sea level and waves forecasts ferrarin et al 2020 the outcomes of existing ocean models are in the multi model ensemble system interpolated on a common grid and combined to produce results in terms of the ensemble mean and standard deviation accounting for a measure of the forecast uncertainty an example of the sea level height extracted in the northern adriatic sea in front of the lagoon of venice during the october 29th 2018 sea storm is shown in fig 14 6 knowledge gaps recommendations and perspectives in this review we have discussed the state of the art of present hydrodynamic modelling in marginal and coastal seas we itemize here the main knowledge gaps we must be aware of when modelling hydrodynamics in coastal and enclosed seas strategic recommendations for future developments and perspectives the basic physical processes in coastal seas are generally considered well established and it would be natural to think that improvements in the near future will mostly be focused on model numerics however a proper understanding and quantification of the processes at the air sea interface especially under extreme conditions are still a long way from being reached indeed there is a large tendency towards fully coupled meteo wave current modelling systems e g olabarrieta et al 2012 lewis et al 2018 to reproduce the complex interactions occurring at the sea surface with respect to the global ocean in marginal and coastal seas the exchange of energy and mass at the land sea and bottom sea boundaries requires special attention too to improve the representation of the land sea interactions near the coast especially near river deltas estuaries lagoons and bays the model applications should consider i a mesh with seamless and variable resolution horizontal for representing the morphology of the coast sea transition ii an adequate vertical coordinate system for describing the vertical processes and gradients at the river sea and air sea interfaces iii the coupling with watershed and groundwater models for considering correctly the often underestimated flux of freshwater into the sea in this context the modelling of the river sea continuum will give new insight into the interaction between waters coming from the river mixing in the coastal zone and influencing the characteristics of the marine waters even far from the river mouth these interactions can be modelled only by explicitly taking into account mixing processes inside the area where the river and the sea meet the eu has acknowledged the importance of this fact by promoting danubius ri a distributed research infrastructure dealing with river sea interaction onto the esfri roadmap bradley et al 2018 a further physical frontier we will need to deal with is a more detailed description of what is going on at the bottom sea interface in this context hydrodynamic models should be coupled with adaptive morphodynamic modules e g bertin et al 2009 and adopt higher vertical and horizontal resolution for reproducing the fluxes and sediment variability of the sea bottom data assimilation remains a valid tool for improving the accuracy of models even in coastal areas although traditionally it is more used in the global ocean where the initial state is modified more slowly by boundary conditions data assimilation can still be effective bajo et al 2019 janeković et al 2020 variables such as temperature and salinity benefit most because of their slower variation over time variables such as the sea level and wave quantities are more instantaneous but can equally be corrected in the short forecast sanchez arcilla et al 2021 and in analysis especially in the case of these variables it is advisable to use advanced methods with a temporal assimilation window both for the estimation of the initial state and in the parameter estimation mode in the context of climate modelling if all different phenomena and relative model requirements mentioned in the manuscript would be taken into account this would require a massive computational time therefore a rough assessment of the contribution of a phenomenon to an overall adriatic state is desirable while astronomical tides in the open sea are not expected to change significantly in the near future lionello et al 2005 modifications in storminess and related air sea heat transfers denamiel et al 2020a b will impact northern adriatic dwf with consequences on the overall thermohaline properties and circulation of the entire adriatic sea and wider moreover it is extremely important to adequately account for the future changes in the freshwater inputs injected by the rivers ideally with a coupled atmosphere hydrology marine sub regional climate downscaling which strongly influences the basin wide adriatic sea circulation hydrodynamic models may provide crucial insight into circulation features in marginal seas and coastal areas which often have strong relevance from a socio economic point of view the future development of marine activity in accordance with the blue growth perspective eikeset et al 2018 and connected to the climate change emergency push the scientific community to imagine plan and organize the future of the sea today and in the future the relationship between the marine ecosystem and human use of the sea is going to be stronger and faster and this opens the way to the development of new applications integrating numerical models into wider management and planning frameworks e g bonaldo et al 2019 menegon et al submitted for

23816,the participation of the taiwan multi scale community ocean model timcom in the ocean model intercomparison project omip experiments is introduced here as part of phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 two ocean sea ice model experiments are compared a omip1 forced by the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii data 1948 2009 and b omip2 forced by jra55 do data 1958 2018 the observed annual means and the interannual variability of physical states are reasonably captured in both experiments but improved mean temperatures and salinities are found in omip2 the weaker winds and stronger freshwater discharge in the omip2 forcing contribute to some simulated differences between omip1 and omip2 many patterns and biases are similar to those found in other modeling efforts confirming the common systematic biases however a few unique features are found in this study including the recent increase of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc that has been observed in the last decade and a generally higher drake passage transport the enhanced amoc can be explained by the recent cooling event over the north atlantic which thermally increased the surface density flux the higher drake passage transport compared to observations is possibly linked to a stronger bottom cell of meridional circulation and a smaller antarctic sea ice extent keywords ocean sea ice model cmip6 omip timcom amoc increase 1 introduction the ocean is an important component within the earth system the large water mass of the global ocean makes it a major reservoir for heat and carbon storage ocean general circulation models ogcms have greatly advanced in the last few decades they can simulate long term global ocean changes this has improved our understanding of the global ocean s mean status and its related climate variability ogcms also make it possible to predict the future ocean state under assumed future scenarios e g hemer et al 2013 nevertheless large inter model spreads in simulation results exist across different time scales in the recent phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 eyring et al 2016 the ocean model intercomparison project omip was proposed to trace the systematic biases within the coupled model that might originate from the ocean sea ice model griffies et al 2016 the omip provides a standardized experimental protocol for ocean sea ice simulations forced with common atmospheric datasets two different atmospheric datasets are used in the omip protocol phase 1 of omip omip1 is forced by the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments ii core ii griffies et al 2009 dataset large and yeager 2009 which is mainly derived from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar atmospheric reanalysis kistler et al 2001 and covers a period of 62 years 1948 2009 the core ii framework has served as a common platform for many comprehensive assessments of ocean sea ice models e g danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 griffies et al 2014 farneti et al 2015 tseng et al 2016b recently to update the forcing dataset and improve the infrastructural design of experiments phase 2 of omip omip2 was designed in this phase the ocean model is forced by the jra55 do dataset tsujino et al 2018 this dataset is based on the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 dataset kobayashi et al 2015 which covers a period from 1958 2018 and receives incremental updates with time compared with core ii the jra55 do forcing has an increased temporal frequency from 6 to 3 h and a refined horizontal resolution from 1 875 to 0 5625 it also has the advantage of self consistency compared to the previous core ii effort because it incorporates various atmosphere fields and river runoff into a single reanalysis dataset a recent comparison study compiled results from 11 international modeling groups involved in the omip1 and omip2 experiments tsujino et al 2020 some improvements resulting from the use of the omip2 forcing data have been clearly identified such as the reduction in warm biases off the eastern coast of the pacific ocean and better sea surface temperature sst changes e g warming hiatus pattern after 2000 however there are also common biases across each individual model when they are compared to observations suggesting systematic errors within the model representations or unresolved key dynamical processes the reduction of the biases of the multi model mean represents a current ocean modeling challenge these biases may be caused by the limitations of the horizontal resolution e g poorly resolved coastal upwelling eddy rich regions and narrow straits and in other cases by errors in the atmospheric forcing some key improvements have been shown by the high horizontal resolution 0 1 models chassignet et al 2020 however the inconsistency of the improvements across different model families suggests that resolution refinement does not necessarily improve the biases in all regions for all high resolution models the sources of model biases across different model configurations have not yet been explored recently based on a single model framework cas licom li et al 2020 suggested that a finer eddy resolving resolution can greatly enhance the robustness of large scale sst patterns lin et al 2020 dong et al 2021 they found that this enhancement occurs due to the improved eddy transfer process however systematic biases persisted in sea surface salinity sss possibly due to biases in the surface water flux these findings allow us to further assess the origin of coupled model biases which may or may not be dependent on the resolution a computationally limited factor here we present results from the newly revised taiwan multi scale community ocean model timcom to make a contribution to the omip protocol many of the model biases are comparable to other modeling results described in tsujino et al 2020 while others are unique providing possible insights for inter model comparisons a baseline evaluation of timcom using omip1 and omip2 experiments is performed to assess the model quality systematic and model dependent errors can be better clarified through this evaluation we structure this paper in the following way section 2 describes the model and experiment design section 3 presents our model validation for the omip1 and omip2 experiments and section 4 addresses the recent increase of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc starting in 2010 finally a discussion and summary are provided in section 5 2 model and experiments 2 1 model details timcom is an easy to use community ocean model that has been used in many regional and global applications tseng and chien 2011 tseng et al 2012 young et al 2012 tseng et al 2016b the global ocean sea ice coupled timcom configuration is built within the taiwan earth system model framework lee et al 2020 the ocean sea ice global timcom domain extends from 86 s to 86 n a symmetric boundary condition is imposed at the northern boundary rather than using the common displaced pole grid approach e g exchanging the lateral boundary condition between 90 e and 90 w therefore the north pole is treated as an infinitely small circle that can freely exchange the northern boundary condition across the pole timcom applies a fourth order accurate spatial discretization to the combined arakawa a and c grids the grid resolution is 320 288 a fixed 1 125 resolution is used zonally and a varying resolution is used meridionally it linearly varies from approximately 0 3 at the equator to about 0 9 at high latitudes the vertical grid is based on a z level coordinate it is a linear exponentially stretched grid of 55 levels with a thickness ranging from roughly 10 m at the top to 500 m in the abyssal ocean the vertical mixing is based on the k profile parameterization large et al 1994 with a critical richardson number of 0 3 and it has a latitudinally varying background internal wave diffusivity that is calculated according to danabasoglu et al 2006 the gent mcwilliams gm parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 replacing the horizontal diffusion of tracers with advective plus isopycnal diffusion resolves tracer mixing by mesoscale eddies on isopycnal surfaces in coarse resolution ocean models this gm parameterization is included in the latest global timcom here we set the maximum slopes for the redi 1982 isopycnal diffusion terms to 0 3 the background diffusivity is based on the vertical location with respect to the diabatic transition and adiabatic regions in the surface diabatic layer the horizontal diffusivity coefficient is set to 3000 m 2 s 1 the diffusivity decreases with depth and vanishes at the seafloor in addition abyssal tidal mixing parameterization is used to represent the deep vertical mixing arising from the breaking of tidally generated internal waves over rough topography st laurent and garrett 2002 jayne 2009 the viscous and quadratic bottom drag is also included the model is integrated using a modified robert asselin williams filtered leapfrog scheme with a time step of 8 min williams 2009 young et al 2014 the small time step is mainly due to the required courant friedrichs lewy condition in the arctic finally for the sea ice component timcom uses the los alamos sea ice model version 4 cice4 hunke et al 2008 which is fully thermodynamical and operates on the same horizontal grid as the ocean with a time step of 1 h 2 2 omip experiments as part of our participation in the cmip6 omip to assess the quality of our global ocean sea ice coupled model we conduct two experiments following the omip1 and omip2 protocols see tsujino et al 2020 for more interannual forcing details omip1 is integrated from 1948 2009 62 years based on core ii forcing large and yeager 2009 while omip2 is integrated from 1958 2018 61 years based on jra55 do forcing tsujino et al 2018 both experiments have been run for six cycles the temperature and salinity are initialized from the polar science center hydrographic climatology version 2 phc2 observations steele et al 2001 the sea surface salinity in both experiments is restored to the monthly phc2 with a salinity restoring time of 90 days for 10 m to ensure a fair comparison between omip1 and omip2 common observations are used for model validation annual means of the sst and sea ice concentration sic are acquired from hadisst hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset https www metoffice gov uk hadobs hadisst rayner et al 2003 the observed sea surface height ssh is taken from aviso archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data http www aviso altimetry fr the annual mean ocean temperature and salinity based on the world ocean atlas 13 woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 are used for further comparison the observed vertical profiles of the time averaged amoc at 26 5 n are taken from the data of rapid rapid climate change program smeed et al 2018 3 general features 3 1 global mean time series the global annual mean temperature and salinity at the surface sst sss and for the whole ocean volume mean t mean s over the completed six cycles are shown in fig 1 to evaluate the impacts of model spin up there are 372 and 366 years of data for the omip1 1948 2009 and omip2 1958 2018 experiments respectively the cyclic features and interannual variation are relatively clear in the global mean sst and sss which periodically repeat throughout each cycle ranging roughly from 18 0 18 4 c and 34 6 34 7 psu respectively the global mean sst and sss during the last cycle are 18 4 c and 34 7 psu respectively the global volume averaged ocean temperature mean t and salinity mean s become relatively stationary after the fourth cycle suggesting that the model has reached a quasi equilibrium state over all six cycles the global sst and sss show slightly increasing trends of 0 03 c per century and 0 01 psu per century respectively while the volume averaged mean t and s are relatively stable especially after the fourth cycle fig 2 presents the drifts of the globally averaged horizontal temperature and salinity in terms of the deviation from the initial year our model shows an increasing temperature drift with time for the whole water column with the largest drift near the upper 500 m in addition to the upper ocean warming drift the other strong warming trend occurs at a water depth of around 2 km this is consistent with the inter model comparison study of tsujino et al 2020 see figs 2 and 3 in their paper all models agree on the increasing temperature drift in the upper ocean but the models disagree at deep to bottom sub surface depths a large spread with a decreasing multi model mean exists in the deep ocean the drifts in our omip1 and omip2 experiments show a very similar trend with more evident changes after the fifth cycle fig 2a c suggesting very similar model drift characteristics with different atmospheric forcing responses after long term integration in terms of the salinity fig 2b d the upper ocean saltening and deep ocean freshening appear in both the omip1 and omip2 experiments with similar behaviors this feature is consistent with the multi model mean in tsujino et al 2020 the drifted changes of temperature and salinity in deep water 1000 to 4000 m reflect the control of long term thermohaline adjustment which requires a much longer integration time to reach a quasi steady state fig 3a shows the time series of the global annual mean sst for the last cycle in the omip1 red and omip2 blue experiments both time series show similar variations from the observations black capturing a few el niño la niña events e g 1968 1983 1997 1998 2016 at the same time a slowly increasing trend in the mean sst can be found in both experiments which is consistent with the observations as a result of the temperature increase a decline in arctic sea ice coverage sic is also evident in both experiments and the observations fig 3b while antarctic sea ice coverage shows a relatively steady state until 2014 fig 3c note that in both the arctic and antarctic our simulated results slightly underestimated the sic compared to the observational mean but the interannual variability looks similar significant at a 99 confidence level particularly the time series correlation between the arctic sic in omip2 and the observations is higher than 0 9 this similarity suggests that the interannual variability of arctic and antarctic sic is mostly controlled by the surface forcing overall both the omip 1 and omip 2 experiments capture most of the observed temporal features we also use the amoc at 26 5 n as an interannual indicator of the amoc strength fig 3d compares the simulated amoc transport in both the omip1 and omip2 experiments particularly the amoc transport time series in omip2 agrees reasonably well with the observations since 2004 which is when observational data is available we successfully reproduce the increasing amoc trend observed in recent years as shown by the rapid observations however tsujino et al 2020 found that all of the participating models except fsu hycom showed a declining amoc trend in recent years raising discussions and concerns about possible issues with omip2 forcing in the north atlantic fig 4 suggests that the increased amoc after 2010 is a robust feature within our omip2 experiments regardless of cycles the uniqueness of this result compared to the majority of the other models may possibly provide helpful information concerning the multi model diversity addressed in tsujino et al 2020 further discussed in section 4 3 2 spatial patterns fig 5 compares the spatial patterns of the sst biases with the woa13 climatology boyer et al 2014 the last 30 years 1980 2009 of omip1 are used for a fair comparison both the omip1 and omip2 experiments can reasonably reproduce the general observational pattern the global root mean square error rmse biases of the sst are 0 79 c and 0 71 c in omip1 and omip2 respectively common sst biases across the omip1 and omip2 experiments show patterns similar to those suggested in many climate models dong et al 2021 golaz et al 2019 held et al 2019 there tend to be cold biases in the arctic ocean and there are generally warmer biases in the southern ocean warmer biases are located in many coastal upwelling regions while slightly colder biases are found in the subtropical open ocean large biases in the western boundary currents the antarctic circumpolar current and agulhas current are common in global models tsujino et al 2020 likely due to the limitations of the horizontal resolution chassignet et al 2020 showed improvements in these eddy rich regions in higher resolution ocean models by comparison our rmse is reduced from 0 79 in omip1 to 0 71 in omip2 similar to the results of tsujino et al 2020 who found that omip2 shows reduced warm biases near the eastern boundary region of the pacific ocean these conclusions also apply when the phc2 climatology is used for comparison fig 6 as for the sss the rmse of the biases is 0 43 in both experiments there is a mixture of slightly fresher and saltier biases located at high latitudes while some saltier biases are found in the tropical regions near the coast these large scale bias patterns are generally similar except in the arctic regardless of the observational data used fig 6 however all simulated salinities are closer to phc2 than woa13 as expected given that our model is weakly restored to the phc2 data better rmses 0 31 0 30 for omip1 omip2 can be found for the phc2 climatology particularly in the high latitudes and certain coastal regions with large river runoffs we note that the salinity fields of woa13 and phc2 differ significantly in the arctic and many coastal regions e g contours in figs 1 and 2 of tseng et al 2016a the lowest salinity in phc2 at the amazon river mouth is below 20 psu while the lowest salinity in woa13 is above 32 psu see table 2 in tseng et al 2016a more coastal grid points are excluded in woa13 than in phc2 possibly due to its quality control procedures phc2 is also much saltier in the arctic as shown in fig 7 of tsujino et al 2020 the differences between different climatologies are beyond the scope of this study but must be considered in model comparison and validation procedures furthermore our results show a spatial difference between omip2 and omip1 similar to that described in lin et al 2020 and tsujino et al 2020 with omip2 having higher and lower salinities in the southern and northern hemispheres respectively omip2 also has a lower salinity in the arctic near greenland which reduces the salty bias in omip1 in the antarctic the lower salinity in omip2 exacerbates its bias we note that our omip1 and omip2 experiments are both restored to phc2 steele et al 2001 so the differences between them are not as obvious as those mentioned in tsujino et al 2020 where some omip2 experiments are restored to woa13 the observed and simulated mean mixed layer depths mlds which determine the ocean interior ventilation are compared in fig 7 we show that the model successfully captures the main spatial features of deep mlds in the northern atlantic and southern ocean shown by the observations the spatial pattern correlations with the observations are 0 58 and 0 53 for omip1 and omip2 respectively however we can see slightly deeper mld biases in the subtropical oceans and shallower mld biases primarily in the subarctic pacific additionally the very deep mlds located in the weddell sea are not found in the observations these findings are similar to some of the model results in tsujino et al 2020 which suggest a large model spread in the regions of deep water formation compared with omip1 omip2 generally produces similar mld results but it shows shallower mlds near greenland this may be caused by the larger freshwater discharge in the jra55 do data the other deeper mlds in omip2 near the weddell sea region are possibly due to unreasonable deep water formation the observed and simulated mean sea surface heights sshs which represent the dynamical properties of the ocean are compared in fig 8 the model can reasonably capture the key features of observational sshs with significant pattern correlation coefficients of 0 98 and 0 97 for omip1 and omip2 respectively this indicates a reasonable simulation of upper ocean circulation higher sshs are commonly located near the western boundaries in both the atlantic and pacific while lower sshs are found mainly in the eastern regions as expected omip2 shows higher sshs in most of the pacific region but lower sshs in the western pacific in the regime of the north and south equatorial current compared to omip1 fig 8d as discussed in tsujino et al 2020 and hsu et al 2021 this may be likely due to the decreased wind stress in omip2 and significant wind stress curl differences near the intertropical convergence zone itcz sun et al 2021 also suggested the weakened wind stress in the omip2 forcing thus results in weaker westward north and south equatorial currents these results suggest that the differences shown here may not be easily explained by the wind stress strength we also find distinct ssh differences between omip2 and omip1 along the antarctic circumpolar current these differences are presumably related to the weaker winds in omip2 higher sshs near the arctic in omip2 may be connected with the lower upper ocean salinity discussed later which produces less dense water the barotropic stream function defined as the depth integrated ocean volume transport provides important information about the mean current and gyre circulation fig 9 shows the simulated barotropic stream function reflecting the position of the equatorial current basin subtropical gyres and a distinct strong eastward transport in the antarctic circumpolar current the spatial patterns are similar to those found in observations colin de verdière and ollitrault 2016 and other models sidorenko et al 2015 stammer et al 2018 compared with omip1 omip2 shows a weaker eastward transport along kuroshio extension and gulf stream and most notably the antarctic circumpolar current which are shown in blue fig 9 these differences are highly consistent with the ssh difference caused by the weaker winds in omip2 fig 8 the transport in the antarctic circumpolar current can be quantitatively assessed through the drake passage transport fig 10 as the drake passage is the major passage in the southern ocean both the omip1 and omip2 drake passage transports are within or close to the range of observational estimates donohue et al 2016 with a slightly higher bias they show an increasing trend in the antarctic circumpolar current after 1980 possibly related to ocean warming shi et al 2021 however our estimated transports ranging from 165 to 200 sv belong to the higher transport group compared to other model studies tsujino et al 2020 this could be related to the higher density of the simulated antarctic bottom water along with a strong abyssal overturning circulation cell over 16 sv in the global meridional overturning circulation gmoc which will be further discussed later finally the sea ice distribution is also very important for the ocean sea ice coupled simulations fig 11 in the northern hemisphere the sea ice extent in omip2 is very close to the observations in march but it is slightly underestimated by the model in september fig 11a in the southern hemisphere the simulation results show a smaller sea ice extent compared to observations in both march and september our sic differences between omip2 and omip1 are consistent with those shown in tsujino et al 2020 in the northern hemisphere both omip1 and omip2 reproduce similar sics during march while the arctic sic in omip1 is further underestimated during september fig 11b in the southern hemisphere omip2 also has a larger sea ice extent than omip1 in march omip2 provides a sea ice extent that is closer to the observations however omip2 generates a smaller sea ice extent than omip1 in september and due to the common smaller sea ice extent bias in our model omip2 deviates slightly more from the observations as shown previously in fig 3 3 3 zonal means we further evaluate the zonal mean ocean temperature and salinity biases of omip2 across each basin over the last 30 years of the omip1 experiment in fig 12a b we divide the global ocean into three basins the southern ocean 86 s 35 s the indian pacific ocean 35 s 65 n and the arctic and atlantic oceans 35 s 90 n both temperature and salinity biases show similar patterns due to the compensating effect of density in the southern ocean the zonal mean temperature bias exhibits a quasi cold south warm north pattern similar to the ensemble bias shown in tsujino et al 2020 in the indian pacific basin a similar pattern can be found there is a warm and salty bias in the upper ocean from the surface to depths of 400 m in the tropics and down to 1 km in the high latitudes and a slightly cold and fresh bias is located deeper in the ocean interior the arctic and atlantic oceans also show overall warm and salty biases in the upper ocean from the surface to approximately 3 km depth most significantly around 60 n which is near the region of deep water formation cold and fresh biases are shown around 30 n at 1 km depth and in the deep to bottom ocean in the north atlantic this may be related to the insufficient mediterranean overflow water migrating downward to the observed equilibrium depth in the north atlantic dietrich et al 2008 since no specific overflow parameterization e g danabasoglu et al 2012 is imposed here except an artificial broadening of the narrow strait of gibraltar it is roughly 3 times wider in the simulation than it is in reality the representation of the density overflow current is still unrealistic in terms of the downward propagation the broadening attempts to ensure a reasonable mediterranean outflow transport 1 sv but the relatively coarse resolution both horizontally and vertically still cannot fully resolve the downward penetration of the density overflow current tseng and dietrich 2006 leading to the saline fresh biases above below 0 8 km some of these patterns are very similar to the biases shown in tsujino et al 2020 suggesting that there are common biases due to the omip2 forcing and the lack of proper parameterization compared with omip1 omip2 produces colder and fresher water in the higher latitudes and warmer and saltier water in the lower latitudes of the southern ocean in the indian pacific omip2 in particular reduces the warm bias shown in omip1 it shows distinctively colder temperatures in the upper ocean near the equator fig 12c both of these differences between omip2 and omip1 are similar to the findings of tsujino et al 2020 a particular feature of timcom is the following notable difference in the atlantic omip2 has colder and fresher water than omip1 around 40 50 n but it also has warmer and saltier water in the arctic region both differences extend to the deep ocean 4 km and thus they may be related to slight differences in the location for atlantic deep water formation which likely leads to the weaker meridional ocean circulation in omip2 fig 13c the zonal averaged salinity and its distribution across each basin are also controlled by the meridional ocean circulation fig 13a b shows the amoc and gmoc both omip1 and omip2 can reasonably reproduce the strong atlantic northward transport around 35 40 n from the surface to a depth of 1 km the north atlantic deep water between depths of 1 km and 2 5 km and antarctic bottom water at depths below 2 5 km the maximum amoc transport at 26 5 n from 2005 2009 in omip1 and omip2 is slightly less than the transport according to the rapid observations fig 13e when they are integrated down to around 1 km depth 17 18 sv moreover as shown earlier in fig 4 our omip2 successfully reproduces the increase of the amoc seen in the observations after 2010 thus from 2010 2018 the maximum amoc closely matches the observational value however we note that our simulated amoc is largely restricted to the upper 3 km which is shallower than the rapid observations and past literature estimates mccarthy et al 2015 of around 4 km we also simulate a relatively strong deep to bottom cell 16 sv in the deep water overturning circulation compared to other modeling results fig 13b compared with omip1 omip2 shows a weaker overturning circulation including a counterclockwise cell in the atlantic fig 13c and the overturning circulation is also globally weaker in the southern ocean and northern subtropical cell fig 13d the weaker overturning circulation can relate to the weaker wind stress in omip2 our result shows a slightly stronger counterclockwise deep to bottom cell at depths below 3 km in omip2 which is also similar with the findings of other model results in tsujino et al 2020 suggesting a stronger deep water formation and possibly explaining the cooling in the bottom water in fig 2c closely linked with the overturning circulation the zonally averaged atlantic and global heat transports for the period from 1958 2004 are assessed in fig 14 the atlantic northward heat transport reaches its maximum between 20 and 30 n while the global heat transport shows a maximum northward transport around 20 n and a maximum southward transport around 10 s similar to other results in tsujino et al 2020 the northward transport is slightly lower than the transport according to the observations but it is very close to the recently reported value of the peak heat transport in the north atlantic of 1 0 0 1 pw compared with omip1 omip2 shows slightly lower heat transports for the atlantic and globally presumably caused by the weaker meridional overturning circulation both in the amoc and gmoc as shown earlier and also the lower wind speed in omip2 taboada et al 2019 4 recent increase of amoc starting in 2010 although many studies have associated a decline in the amoc with temperature warming since the 1980s and projected a possible decrease until the end of the century weijer et al 2020 our model shows a recent recovery and increase of the amoc starting in 2010 that is also present in observations moat et al 2020 nevertheless this feature has not been captured in many other omip2 experiments tsujino et al 2020 some studies express concerns that the bias may come from the jra55 do dataset tsujino et al 2018 we thus further explore potential mechanisms in our model that drive the recent increase of the amoc that seen in the observations the amoc variability is directly controlled by the density anomalies in the north atlantic where deep water forms danabasoglu et al 2012 and the recent increase of the amoc has been shown to follow a rise in the density flux driven by fast cooling enhancing the water mass transformation desbruyères et al 2019 we estimate the surface density flux in our simulation based on marsh 2000 using eq 1 below it combines the net effects of the heat flux and freshwater change on the density schmitt et al 1989 1 d α t s c p q ρ 0 β t s s 1 s e p the first term represents the density changes due to the net heat flux q positive is upward units w m 2 and α is the thermal expansion coefficient the second term represents the changes due to evaporation and precipitation e p units kg m 2 s 1 and β is the haline contraction coefficient marsh 2000 calculated from t c and s psu according to the equation of state friedrich and levitus 1972 c p is the specific heat of seawater 4000 j kg 1 k 1 and ρ 0 is the reference density for seawater 1025 kg m 3 fig 15 further shows that the time series of the surface density flux over the north atlantic 45 65 n in our simulation resembles the modeled amoc variability over the last few decades particularly we can find a similar recovery and increasing trend in the twenty first century the peak of the surface density flux in the 1990s seems to lead or roughly match the peak of the amoc a few years earlier our results confirm the findings of desbruyères et al 2019 who showed that the surface density change may be a leading and driving predictor of amoc variability the variability of the surface density flux is mainly driven thermally by changes in the surface heat flux represented by the green line in fig 15 thus we conclude that the recent increase of the amoc is likely controlled by surface cooling in the high latitudes of the north atlantic that is possibly associated with the extreme low air temperature events over the north atlantic caused by atmospheric variability josey et al 2018 as surface water cools faster density fluxes increase and then sink potentially strengthening the amoc we also found that the vertical mixing coefficient for salinity vdc particularly the top 0 30 m for the latitude higher than 45 n may be a critical key to successfully simulate the recent thermally driven amoc increase a sensitivity experiment with a 10 times larger vdc for the top 0 30 m salinity significantly reduces the increasing trend fig 16 both experiments low vdc and high vdc are initialized from the same initial condition at the end of 2013 and run for 5 years 2014 2018 the low vdc simulation shows an increase of amoc while the high vdc simulation shows a non trivial trend of amoc resembling to the common results from the omip2 ocean model comparison tsujino et al 2020 as shown in fig 16b the smaller turbulent eddy diffusivity in the salinity low vdc lowers the vertical mixing of arctic freshwater near the surface leading to a salinity maximum around 40 m depth red dashed line on fig 16d which may separate the subsurface water from the surface the temperature profiles are compensated accordingly owing to the salinity changes fig 16c d thus in the low vdc simulation the density near the level of salinity maximum is higher with lower density can be found above red solid line on fig 16e as a result stronger stratification are formed between surface and subsurface layers fig 16e the stronger stratification in the upper ocean can react with more sensitivity to temperature variability in the atmosphere by keeping the anomaly signals within the stratified upper ocean and thus allowing the cold event in the recent five years to create the stronger density flux reproducing the observational amoc increase our analysis provides mechanistic insights to community and also presents a possible model design reference for other ocean models to follow in addressing the recent amoc bias in omip2 experiments next here we find the near surface vertical mixing for salinity in the arctic and north of 45 n in the north atlantic seems to effectively determine the amoc intensity at some critical levels while the amoc strength is not so sensitive to the change of vdc in the temperature and deeper ocean further study is required in the future to investigate the fundamental mechanism which may relate to the sea ice distribution and mld biases north of 45 n we also want to note that all models have different levels of surface restoring which may complicate the vertical mixing adjustment related to the recent amoc change 5 discussion and summary this study presents the design and a detailed description of timcom for cmip6 participation as well as the evaluation of the model s performance in the omip1 omip2 experiments the general features compare well with observations temporally and spatially some model biases are similar to those described for many other models in tsujino et al 2020 including the temperature and salinity biases in the eddy rich western boundary currents and southern ocean and the deep mld bias in the weddell sea particularly many differences across spatial and zonal average fields between omip2 and omip1 can be primarily attributed to the weaker tropical subtropical winds and fresher salinity in the arctic caused by the omip2 forcing the drake passage transport seems to be high in this model compared to many other model studies however the overall antarctic circumpolar current shows an increasing trend similar to the observations and many other studies e g shi et al 2021 fig 17 shows the time series of the zonal mean velocity it resembles fig 3a in shi et al 2021 which suggests that ocean warming is likely to continue to accelerate the southern ocean zonal flow nevertheless other existing biases still require further attention 1 the polar sea ice extent in our model is less than that of the observations 2 the warmer zonal average bias in the atlantic arctic ocean amoc circulation cell is shallower than the observations indicate resulting in a stronger deep to bottom meridional cell these biases could likely be interlinked with the higher drake passage transport through different mechanisms such as the negative feedbacks between the sea ice extent and antarctic circumpolar current van westen and dijkstra 2021 and also the links between a strong antarctic circumpolar current and the bottom meridional cell as discussed earlier the uncertainty of the freshwater input in the arctic antarctic may also be another possible factor tseng et al 2016a further studies are required to investigate the possible linkages and sources of these model biases 6

23816,the participation of the taiwan multi scale community ocean model timcom in the ocean model intercomparison project omip experiments is introduced here as part of phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 two ocean sea ice model experiments are compared a omip1 forced by the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii data 1948 2009 and b omip2 forced by jra55 do data 1958 2018 the observed annual means and the interannual variability of physical states are reasonably captured in both experiments but improved mean temperatures and salinities are found in omip2 the weaker winds and stronger freshwater discharge in the omip2 forcing contribute to some simulated differences between omip1 and omip2 many patterns and biases are similar to those found in other modeling efforts confirming the common systematic biases however a few unique features are found in this study including the recent increase of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc that has been observed in the last decade and a generally higher drake passage transport the enhanced amoc can be explained by the recent cooling event over the north atlantic which thermally increased the surface density flux the higher drake passage transport compared to observations is possibly linked to a stronger bottom cell of meridional circulation and a smaller antarctic sea ice extent keywords ocean sea ice model cmip6 omip timcom amoc increase 1 introduction the ocean is an important component within the earth system the large water mass of the global ocean makes it a major reservoir for heat and carbon storage ocean general circulation models ogcms have greatly advanced in the last few decades they can simulate long term global ocean changes this has improved our understanding of the global ocean s mean status and its related climate variability ogcms also make it possible to predict the future ocean state under assumed future scenarios e g hemer et al 2013 nevertheless large inter model spreads in simulation results exist across different time scales in the recent phase 6 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 eyring et al 2016 the ocean model intercomparison project omip was proposed to trace the systematic biases within the coupled model that might originate from the ocean sea ice model griffies et al 2016 the omip provides a standardized experimental protocol for ocean sea ice simulations forced with common atmospheric datasets two different atmospheric datasets are used in the omip protocol phase 1 of omip omip1 is forced by the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments ii core ii griffies et al 2009 dataset large and yeager 2009 which is mainly derived from the national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar atmospheric reanalysis kistler et al 2001 and covers a period of 62 years 1948 2009 the core ii framework has served as a common platform for many comprehensive assessments of ocean sea ice models e g danabasoglu et al 2014 2016 griffies et al 2014 farneti et al 2015 tseng et al 2016b recently to update the forcing dataset and improve the infrastructural design of experiments phase 2 of omip omip2 was designed in this phase the ocean model is forced by the jra55 do dataset tsujino et al 2018 this dataset is based on the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 dataset kobayashi et al 2015 which covers a period from 1958 2018 and receives incremental updates with time compared with core ii the jra55 do forcing has an increased temporal frequency from 6 to 3 h and a refined horizontal resolution from 1 875 to 0 5625 it also has the advantage of self consistency compared to the previous core ii effort because it incorporates various atmosphere fields and river runoff into a single reanalysis dataset a recent comparison study compiled results from 11 international modeling groups involved in the omip1 and omip2 experiments tsujino et al 2020 some improvements resulting from the use of the omip2 forcing data have been clearly identified such as the reduction in warm biases off the eastern coast of the pacific ocean and better sea surface temperature sst changes e g warming hiatus pattern after 2000 however there are also common biases across each individual model when they are compared to observations suggesting systematic errors within the model representations or unresolved key dynamical processes the reduction of the biases of the multi model mean represents a current ocean modeling challenge these biases may be caused by the limitations of the horizontal resolution e g poorly resolved coastal upwelling eddy rich regions and narrow straits and in other cases by errors in the atmospheric forcing some key improvements have been shown by the high horizontal resolution 0 1 models chassignet et al 2020 however the inconsistency of the improvements across different model families suggests that resolution refinement does not necessarily improve the biases in all regions for all high resolution models the sources of model biases across different model configurations have not yet been explored recently based on a single model framework cas licom li et al 2020 suggested that a finer eddy resolving resolution can greatly enhance the robustness of large scale sst patterns lin et al 2020 dong et al 2021 they found that this enhancement occurs due to the improved eddy transfer process however systematic biases persisted in sea surface salinity sss possibly due to biases in the surface water flux these findings allow us to further assess the origin of coupled model biases which may or may not be dependent on the resolution a computationally limited factor here we present results from the newly revised taiwan multi scale community ocean model timcom to make a contribution to the omip protocol many of the model biases are comparable to other modeling results described in tsujino et al 2020 while others are unique providing possible insights for inter model comparisons a baseline evaluation of timcom using omip1 and omip2 experiments is performed to assess the model quality systematic and model dependent errors can be better clarified through this evaluation we structure this paper in the following way section 2 describes the model and experiment design section 3 presents our model validation for the omip1 and omip2 experiments and section 4 addresses the recent increase of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc starting in 2010 finally a discussion and summary are provided in section 5 2 model and experiments 2 1 model details timcom is an easy to use community ocean model that has been used in many regional and global applications tseng and chien 2011 tseng et al 2012 young et al 2012 tseng et al 2016b the global ocean sea ice coupled timcom configuration is built within the taiwan earth system model framework lee et al 2020 the ocean sea ice global timcom domain extends from 86 s to 86 n a symmetric boundary condition is imposed at the northern boundary rather than using the common displaced pole grid approach e g exchanging the lateral boundary condition between 90 e and 90 w therefore the north pole is treated as an infinitely small circle that can freely exchange the northern boundary condition across the pole timcom applies a fourth order accurate spatial discretization to the combined arakawa a and c grids the grid resolution is 320 288 a fixed 1 125 resolution is used zonally and a varying resolution is used meridionally it linearly varies from approximately 0 3 at the equator to about 0 9 at high latitudes the vertical grid is based on a z level coordinate it is a linear exponentially stretched grid of 55 levels with a thickness ranging from roughly 10 m at the top to 500 m in the abyssal ocean the vertical mixing is based on the k profile parameterization large et al 1994 with a critical richardson number of 0 3 and it has a latitudinally varying background internal wave diffusivity that is calculated according to danabasoglu et al 2006 the gent mcwilliams gm parameterization gent and mcwilliams 1990 replacing the horizontal diffusion of tracers with advective plus isopycnal diffusion resolves tracer mixing by mesoscale eddies on isopycnal surfaces in coarse resolution ocean models this gm parameterization is included in the latest global timcom here we set the maximum slopes for the redi 1982 isopycnal diffusion terms to 0 3 the background diffusivity is based on the vertical location with respect to the diabatic transition and adiabatic regions in the surface diabatic layer the horizontal diffusivity coefficient is set to 3000 m 2 s 1 the diffusivity decreases with depth and vanishes at the seafloor in addition abyssal tidal mixing parameterization is used to represent the deep vertical mixing arising from the breaking of tidally generated internal waves over rough topography st laurent and garrett 2002 jayne 2009 the viscous and quadratic bottom drag is also included the model is integrated using a modified robert asselin williams filtered leapfrog scheme with a time step of 8 min williams 2009 young et al 2014 the small time step is mainly due to the required courant friedrichs lewy condition in the arctic finally for the sea ice component timcom uses the los alamos sea ice model version 4 cice4 hunke et al 2008 which is fully thermodynamical and operates on the same horizontal grid as the ocean with a time step of 1 h 2 2 omip experiments as part of our participation in the cmip6 omip to assess the quality of our global ocean sea ice coupled model we conduct two experiments following the omip1 and omip2 protocols see tsujino et al 2020 for more interannual forcing details omip1 is integrated from 1948 2009 62 years based on core ii forcing large and yeager 2009 while omip2 is integrated from 1958 2018 61 years based on jra55 do forcing tsujino et al 2018 both experiments have been run for six cycles the temperature and salinity are initialized from the polar science center hydrographic climatology version 2 phc2 observations steele et al 2001 the sea surface salinity in both experiments is restored to the monthly phc2 with a salinity restoring time of 90 days for 10 m to ensure a fair comparison between omip1 and omip2 common observations are used for model validation annual means of the sst and sea ice concentration sic are acquired from hadisst hadley centre sea ice and sea surface temperature dataset https www metoffice gov uk hadobs hadisst rayner et al 2003 the observed sea surface height ssh is taken from aviso archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data http www aviso altimetry fr the annual mean ocean temperature and salinity based on the world ocean atlas 13 woa13 locarnini et al 2013 zweng et al 2013 are used for further comparison the observed vertical profiles of the time averaged amoc at 26 5 n are taken from the data of rapid rapid climate change program smeed et al 2018 3 general features 3 1 global mean time series the global annual mean temperature and salinity at the surface sst sss and for the whole ocean volume mean t mean s over the completed six cycles are shown in fig 1 to evaluate the impacts of model spin up there are 372 and 366 years of data for the omip1 1948 2009 and omip2 1958 2018 experiments respectively the cyclic features and interannual variation are relatively clear in the global mean sst and sss which periodically repeat throughout each cycle ranging roughly from 18 0 18 4 c and 34 6 34 7 psu respectively the global mean sst and sss during the last cycle are 18 4 c and 34 7 psu respectively the global volume averaged ocean temperature mean t and salinity mean s become relatively stationary after the fourth cycle suggesting that the model has reached a quasi equilibrium state over all six cycles the global sst and sss show slightly increasing trends of 0 03 c per century and 0 01 psu per century respectively while the volume averaged mean t and s are relatively stable especially after the fourth cycle fig 2 presents the drifts of the globally averaged horizontal temperature and salinity in terms of the deviation from the initial year our model shows an increasing temperature drift with time for the whole water column with the largest drift near the upper 500 m in addition to the upper ocean warming drift the other strong warming trend occurs at a water depth of around 2 km this is consistent with the inter model comparison study of tsujino et al 2020 see figs 2 and 3 in their paper all models agree on the increasing temperature drift in the upper ocean but the models disagree at deep to bottom sub surface depths a large spread with a decreasing multi model mean exists in the deep ocean the drifts in our omip1 and omip2 experiments show a very similar trend with more evident changes after the fifth cycle fig 2a c suggesting very similar model drift characteristics with different atmospheric forcing responses after long term integration in terms of the salinity fig 2b d the upper ocean saltening and deep ocean freshening appear in both the omip1 and omip2 experiments with similar behaviors this feature is consistent with the multi model mean in tsujino et al 2020 the drifted changes of temperature and salinity in deep water 1000 to 4000 m reflect the control of long term thermohaline adjustment which requires a much longer integration time to reach a quasi steady state fig 3a shows the time series of the global annual mean sst for the last cycle in the omip1 red and omip2 blue experiments both time series show similar variations from the observations black capturing a few el niño la niña events e g 1968 1983 1997 1998 2016 at the same time a slowly increasing trend in the mean sst can be found in both experiments which is consistent with the observations as a result of the temperature increase a decline in arctic sea ice coverage sic is also evident in both experiments and the observations fig 3b while antarctic sea ice coverage shows a relatively steady state until 2014 fig 3c note that in both the arctic and antarctic our simulated results slightly underestimated the sic compared to the observational mean but the interannual variability looks similar significant at a 99 confidence level particularly the time series correlation between the arctic sic in omip2 and the observations is higher than 0 9 this similarity suggests that the interannual variability of arctic and antarctic sic is mostly controlled by the surface forcing overall both the omip 1 and omip 2 experiments capture most of the observed temporal features we also use the amoc at 26 5 n as an interannual indicator of the amoc strength fig 3d compares the simulated amoc transport in both the omip1 and omip2 experiments particularly the amoc transport time series in omip2 agrees reasonably well with the observations since 2004 which is when observational data is available we successfully reproduce the increasing amoc trend observed in recent years as shown by the rapid observations however tsujino et al 2020 found that all of the participating models except fsu hycom showed a declining amoc trend in recent years raising discussions and concerns about possible issues with omip2 forcing in the north atlantic fig 4 suggests that the increased amoc after 2010 is a robust feature within our omip2 experiments regardless of cycles the uniqueness of this result compared to the majority of the other models may possibly provide helpful information concerning the multi model diversity addressed in tsujino et al 2020 further discussed in section 4 3 2 spatial patterns fig 5 compares the spatial patterns of the sst biases with the woa13 climatology boyer et al 2014 the last 30 years 1980 2009 of omip1 are used for a fair comparison both the omip1 and omip2 experiments can reasonably reproduce the general observational pattern the global root mean square error rmse biases of the sst are 0 79 c and 0 71 c in omip1 and omip2 respectively common sst biases across the omip1 and omip2 experiments show patterns similar to those suggested in many climate models dong et al 2021 golaz et al 2019 held et al 2019 there tend to be cold biases in the arctic ocean and there are generally warmer biases in the southern ocean warmer biases are located in many coastal upwelling regions while slightly colder biases are found in the subtropical open ocean large biases in the western boundary currents the antarctic circumpolar current and agulhas current are common in global models tsujino et al 2020 likely due to the limitations of the horizontal resolution chassignet et al 2020 showed improvements in these eddy rich regions in higher resolution ocean models by comparison our rmse is reduced from 0 79 in omip1 to 0 71 in omip2 similar to the results of tsujino et al 2020 who found that omip2 shows reduced warm biases near the eastern boundary region of the pacific ocean these conclusions also apply when the phc2 climatology is used for comparison fig 6 as for the sss the rmse of the biases is 0 43 in both experiments there is a mixture of slightly fresher and saltier biases located at high latitudes while some saltier biases are found in the tropical regions near the coast these large scale bias patterns are generally similar except in the arctic regardless of the observational data used fig 6 however all simulated salinities are closer to phc2 than woa13 as expected given that our model is weakly restored to the phc2 data better rmses 0 31 0 30 for omip1 omip2 can be found for the phc2 climatology particularly in the high latitudes and certain coastal regions with large river runoffs we note that the salinity fields of woa13 and phc2 differ significantly in the arctic and many coastal regions e g contours in figs 1 and 2 of tseng et al 2016a the lowest salinity in phc2 at the amazon river mouth is below 20 psu while the lowest salinity in woa13 is above 32 psu see table 2 in tseng et al 2016a more coastal grid points are excluded in woa13 than in phc2 possibly due to its quality control procedures phc2 is also much saltier in the arctic as shown in fig 7 of tsujino et al 2020 the differences between different climatologies are beyond the scope of this study but must be considered in model comparison and validation procedures furthermore our results show a spatial difference between omip2 and omip1 similar to that described in lin et al 2020 and tsujino et al 2020 with omip2 having higher and lower salinities in the southern and northern hemispheres respectively omip2 also has a lower salinity in the arctic near greenland which reduces the salty bias in omip1 in the antarctic the lower salinity in omip2 exacerbates its bias we note that our omip1 and omip2 experiments are both restored to phc2 steele et al 2001 so the differences between them are not as obvious as those mentioned in tsujino et al 2020 where some omip2 experiments are restored to woa13 the observed and simulated mean mixed layer depths mlds which determine the ocean interior ventilation are compared in fig 7 we show that the model successfully captures the main spatial features of deep mlds in the northern atlantic and southern ocean shown by the observations the spatial pattern correlations with the observations are 0 58 and 0 53 for omip1 and omip2 respectively however we can see slightly deeper mld biases in the subtropical oceans and shallower mld biases primarily in the subarctic pacific additionally the very deep mlds located in the weddell sea are not found in the observations these findings are similar to some of the model results in tsujino et al 2020 which suggest a large model spread in the regions of deep water formation compared with omip1 omip2 generally produces similar mld results but it shows shallower mlds near greenland this may be caused by the larger freshwater discharge in the jra55 do data the other deeper mlds in omip2 near the weddell sea region are possibly due to unreasonable deep water formation the observed and simulated mean sea surface heights sshs which represent the dynamical properties of the ocean are compared in fig 8 the model can reasonably capture the key features of observational sshs with significant pattern correlation coefficients of 0 98 and 0 97 for omip1 and omip2 respectively this indicates a reasonable simulation of upper ocean circulation higher sshs are commonly located near the western boundaries in both the atlantic and pacific while lower sshs are found mainly in the eastern regions as expected omip2 shows higher sshs in most of the pacific region but lower sshs in the western pacific in the regime of the north and south equatorial current compared to omip1 fig 8d as discussed in tsujino et al 2020 and hsu et al 2021 this may be likely due to the decreased wind stress in omip2 and significant wind stress curl differences near the intertropical convergence zone itcz sun et al 2021 also suggested the weakened wind stress in the omip2 forcing thus results in weaker westward north and south equatorial currents these results suggest that the differences shown here may not be easily explained by the wind stress strength we also find distinct ssh differences between omip2 and omip1 along the antarctic circumpolar current these differences are presumably related to the weaker winds in omip2 higher sshs near the arctic in omip2 may be connected with the lower upper ocean salinity discussed later which produces less dense water the barotropic stream function defined as the depth integrated ocean volume transport provides important information about the mean current and gyre circulation fig 9 shows the simulated barotropic stream function reflecting the position of the equatorial current basin subtropical gyres and a distinct strong eastward transport in the antarctic circumpolar current the spatial patterns are similar to those found in observations colin de verdière and ollitrault 2016 and other models sidorenko et al 2015 stammer et al 2018 compared with omip1 omip2 shows a weaker eastward transport along kuroshio extension and gulf stream and most notably the antarctic circumpolar current which are shown in blue fig 9 these differences are highly consistent with the ssh difference caused by the weaker winds in omip2 fig 8 the transport in the antarctic circumpolar current can be quantitatively assessed through the drake passage transport fig 10 as the drake passage is the major passage in the southern ocean both the omip1 and omip2 drake passage transports are within or close to the range of observational estimates donohue et al 2016 with a slightly higher bias they show an increasing trend in the antarctic circumpolar current after 1980 possibly related to ocean warming shi et al 2021 however our estimated transports ranging from 165 to 200 sv belong to the higher transport group compared to other model studies tsujino et al 2020 this could be related to the higher density of the simulated antarctic bottom water along with a strong abyssal overturning circulation cell over 16 sv in the global meridional overturning circulation gmoc which will be further discussed later finally the sea ice distribution is also very important for the ocean sea ice coupled simulations fig 11 in the northern hemisphere the sea ice extent in omip2 is very close to the observations in march but it is slightly underestimated by the model in september fig 11a in the southern hemisphere the simulation results show a smaller sea ice extent compared to observations in both march and september our sic differences between omip2 and omip1 are consistent with those shown in tsujino et al 2020 in the northern hemisphere both omip1 and omip2 reproduce similar sics during march while the arctic sic in omip1 is further underestimated during september fig 11b in the southern hemisphere omip2 also has a larger sea ice extent than omip1 in march omip2 provides a sea ice extent that is closer to the observations however omip2 generates a smaller sea ice extent than omip1 in september and due to the common smaller sea ice extent bias in our model omip2 deviates slightly more from the observations as shown previously in fig 3 3 3 zonal means we further evaluate the zonal mean ocean temperature and salinity biases of omip2 across each basin over the last 30 years of the omip1 experiment in fig 12a b we divide the global ocean into three basins the southern ocean 86 s 35 s the indian pacific ocean 35 s 65 n and the arctic and atlantic oceans 35 s 90 n both temperature and salinity biases show similar patterns due to the compensating effect of density in the southern ocean the zonal mean temperature bias exhibits a quasi cold south warm north pattern similar to the ensemble bias shown in tsujino et al 2020 in the indian pacific basin a similar pattern can be found there is a warm and salty bias in the upper ocean from the surface to depths of 400 m in the tropics and down to 1 km in the high latitudes and a slightly cold and fresh bias is located deeper in the ocean interior the arctic and atlantic oceans also show overall warm and salty biases in the upper ocean from the surface to approximately 3 km depth most significantly around 60 n which is near the region of deep water formation cold and fresh biases are shown around 30 n at 1 km depth and in the deep to bottom ocean in the north atlantic this may be related to the insufficient mediterranean overflow water migrating downward to the observed equilibrium depth in the north atlantic dietrich et al 2008 since no specific overflow parameterization e g danabasoglu et al 2012 is imposed here except an artificial broadening of the narrow strait of gibraltar it is roughly 3 times wider in the simulation than it is in reality the representation of the density overflow current is still unrealistic in terms of the downward propagation the broadening attempts to ensure a reasonable mediterranean outflow transport 1 sv but the relatively coarse resolution both horizontally and vertically still cannot fully resolve the downward penetration of the density overflow current tseng and dietrich 2006 leading to the saline fresh biases above below 0 8 km some of these patterns are very similar to the biases shown in tsujino et al 2020 suggesting that there are common biases due to the omip2 forcing and the lack of proper parameterization compared with omip1 omip2 produces colder and fresher water in the higher latitudes and warmer and saltier water in the lower latitudes of the southern ocean in the indian pacific omip2 in particular reduces the warm bias shown in omip1 it shows distinctively colder temperatures in the upper ocean near the equator fig 12c both of these differences between omip2 and omip1 are similar to the findings of tsujino et al 2020 a particular feature of timcom is the following notable difference in the atlantic omip2 has colder and fresher water than omip1 around 40 50 n but it also has warmer and saltier water in the arctic region both differences extend to the deep ocean 4 km and thus they may be related to slight differences in the location for atlantic deep water formation which likely leads to the weaker meridional ocean circulation in omip2 fig 13c the zonal averaged salinity and its distribution across each basin are also controlled by the meridional ocean circulation fig 13a b shows the amoc and gmoc both omip1 and omip2 can reasonably reproduce the strong atlantic northward transport around 35 40 n from the surface to a depth of 1 km the north atlantic deep water between depths of 1 km and 2 5 km and antarctic bottom water at depths below 2 5 km the maximum amoc transport at 26 5 n from 2005 2009 in omip1 and omip2 is slightly less than the transport according to the rapid observations fig 13e when they are integrated down to around 1 km depth 17 18 sv moreover as shown earlier in fig 4 our omip2 successfully reproduces the increase of the amoc seen in the observations after 2010 thus from 2010 2018 the maximum amoc closely matches the observational value however we note that our simulated amoc is largely restricted to the upper 3 km which is shallower than the rapid observations and past literature estimates mccarthy et al 2015 of around 4 km we also simulate a relatively strong deep to bottom cell 16 sv in the deep water overturning circulation compared to other modeling results fig 13b compared with omip1 omip2 shows a weaker overturning circulation including a counterclockwise cell in the atlantic fig 13c and the overturning circulation is also globally weaker in the southern ocean and northern subtropical cell fig 13d the weaker overturning circulation can relate to the weaker wind stress in omip2 our result shows a slightly stronger counterclockwise deep to bottom cell at depths below 3 km in omip2 which is also similar with the findings of other model results in tsujino et al 2020 suggesting a stronger deep water formation and possibly explaining the cooling in the bottom water in fig 2c closely linked with the overturning circulation the zonally averaged atlantic and global heat transports for the period from 1958 2004 are assessed in fig 14 the atlantic northward heat transport reaches its maximum between 20 and 30 n while the global heat transport shows a maximum northward transport around 20 n and a maximum southward transport around 10 s similar to other results in tsujino et al 2020 the northward transport is slightly lower than the transport according to the observations but it is very close to the recently reported value of the peak heat transport in the north atlantic of 1 0 0 1 pw compared with omip1 omip2 shows slightly lower heat transports for the atlantic and globally presumably caused by the weaker meridional overturning circulation both in the amoc and gmoc as shown earlier and also the lower wind speed in omip2 taboada et al 2019 4 recent increase of amoc starting in 2010 although many studies have associated a decline in the amoc with temperature warming since the 1980s and projected a possible decrease until the end of the century weijer et al 2020 our model shows a recent recovery and increase of the amoc starting in 2010 that is also present in observations moat et al 2020 nevertheless this feature has not been captured in many other omip2 experiments tsujino et al 2020 some studies express concerns that the bias may come from the jra55 do dataset tsujino et al 2018 we thus further explore potential mechanisms in our model that drive the recent increase of the amoc that seen in the observations the amoc variability is directly controlled by the density anomalies in the north atlantic where deep water forms danabasoglu et al 2012 and the recent increase of the amoc has been shown to follow a rise in the density flux driven by fast cooling enhancing the water mass transformation desbruyères et al 2019 we estimate the surface density flux in our simulation based on marsh 2000 using eq 1 below it combines the net effects of the heat flux and freshwater change on the density schmitt et al 1989 1 d α t s c p q ρ 0 β t s s 1 s e p the first term represents the density changes due to the net heat flux q positive is upward units w m 2 and α is the thermal expansion coefficient the second term represents the changes due to evaporation and precipitation e p units kg m 2 s 1 and β is the haline contraction coefficient marsh 2000 calculated from t c and s psu according to the equation of state friedrich and levitus 1972 c p is the specific heat of seawater 4000 j kg 1 k 1 and ρ 0 is the reference density for seawater 1025 kg m 3 fig 15 further shows that the time series of the surface density flux over the north atlantic 45 65 n in our simulation resembles the modeled amoc variability over the last few decades particularly we can find a similar recovery and increasing trend in the twenty first century the peak of the surface density flux in the 1990s seems to lead or roughly match the peak of the amoc a few years earlier our results confirm the findings of desbruyères et al 2019 who showed that the surface density change may be a leading and driving predictor of amoc variability the variability of the surface density flux is mainly driven thermally by changes in the surface heat flux represented by the green line in fig 15 thus we conclude that the recent increase of the amoc is likely controlled by surface cooling in the high latitudes of the north atlantic that is possibly associated with the extreme low air temperature events over the north atlantic caused by atmospheric variability josey et al 2018 as surface water cools faster density fluxes increase and then sink potentially strengthening the amoc we also found that the vertical mixing coefficient for salinity vdc particularly the top 0 30 m for the latitude higher than 45 n may be a critical key to successfully simulate the recent thermally driven amoc increase a sensitivity experiment with a 10 times larger vdc for the top 0 30 m salinity significantly reduces the increasing trend fig 16 both experiments low vdc and high vdc are initialized from the same initial condition at the end of 2013 and run for 5 years 2014 2018 the low vdc simulation shows an increase of amoc while the high vdc simulation shows a non trivial trend of amoc resembling to the common results from the omip2 ocean model comparison tsujino et al 2020 as shown in fig 16b the smaller turbulent eddy diffusivity in the salinity low vdc lowers the vertical mixing of arctic freshwater near the surface leading to a salinity maximum around 40 m depth red dashed line on fig 16d which may separate the subsurface water from the surface the temperature profiles are compensated accordingly owing to the salinity changes fig 16c d thus in the low vdc simulation the density near the level of salinity maximum is higher with lower density can be found above red solid line on fig 16e as a result stronger stratification are formed between surface and subsurface layers fig 16e the stronger stratification in the upper ocean can react with more sensitivity to temperature variability in the atmosphere by keeping the anomaly signals within the stratified upper ocean and thus allowing the cold event in the recent five years to create the stronger density flux reproducing the observational amoc increase our analysis provides mechanistic insights to community and also presents a possible model design reference for other ocean models to follow in addressing the recent amoc bias in omip2 experiments next here we find the near surface vertical mixing for salinity in the arctic and north of 45 n in the north atlantic seems to effectively determine the amoc intensity at some critical levels while the amoc strength is not so sensitive to the change of vdc in the temperature and deeper ocean further study is required in the future to investigate the fundamental mechanism which may relate to the sea ice distribution and mld biases north of 45 n we also want to note that all models have different levels of surface restoring which may complicate the vertical mixing adjustment related to the recent amoc change 5 discussion and summary this study presents the design and a detailed description of timcom for cmip6 participation as well as the evaluation of the model s performance in the omip1 omip2 experiments the general features compare well with observations temporally and spatially some model biases are similar to those described for many other models in tsujino et al 2020 including the temperature and salinity biases in the eddy rich western boundary currents and southern ocean and the deep mld bias in the weddell sea particularly many differences across spatial and zonal average fields between omip2 and omip1 can be primarily attributed to the weaker tropical subtropical winds and fresher salinity in the arctic caused by the omip2 forcing the drake passage transport seems to be high in this model compared to many other model studies however the overall antarctic circumpolar current shows an increasing trend similar to the observations and many other studies e g shi et al 2021 fig 17 shows the time series of the zonal mean velocity it resembles fig 3a in shi et al 2021 which suggests that ocean warming is likely to continue to accelerate the southern ocean zonal flow nevertheless other existing biases still require further attention 1 the polar sea ice extent in our model is less than that of the observations 2 the warmer zonal average bias in the atlantic arctic ocean amoc circulation cell is shallower than the observations indicate resulting in a stronger deep to bottom meridional cell these biases could likely be interlinked with the higher drake passage transport through different mechanisms such as the negative feedbacks between the sea ice extent and antarctic circumpolar current van westen and dijkstra 2021 and also the links between a strong antarctic circumpolar current and the bottom meridional cell as discussed earlier the uncertainty of the freshwater input in the arctic antarctic may also be another possible factor tseng et al 2016a further studies are required to investigate the possible linkages and sources of these model biases 6

23817,the profile of fluid field and wave geometry kinematic and dynamic characteristics of focused breaking waves in finite water depth with different wave steepness are studied with a constant wave steepness wave focusing method in this paper the flow field is solved by the two phase flow model in reef3d based on the incompressible navier stokes equation and the large eddy simulation les model to simulate the complex breaking process the numerical model is validated by comparing wave elevation of both focused non breaking and breaking case with the experimental results and satisfactory agreements are achieved a series of simulation cases with different global steepness are carried out to analyze the focused waves of different breaking types the difference between the preset focused condition and the real ones and the area of air cavity rolled by the wave jets are both indicates that the process of wave focusing and breaking show a strong nonlinear profile the maximum values of the horizontal velocity occur after the impingement moment and can reach 2 5 c p for extreme steep waves three typical wave breaking criteria in finite water depth are calculated and discussed successively for the geometric criterion analysis the global wave steepness and local steepness have a good performance both for predicting wave breaking and presenting the breaking intensity the kinematic breaking criterion ratio shows that the previous threshold 1 at the breaking incipient scenario is not sufficient to predict the wave breaking besides it is found that the time interval when the kinematic breaking criterion ratio big than 1 may related to the wave breaking type the energy changing rate for both the focusing and dissipation processes increase linearly with the global wave steepness and show a good ability as a dynamic breaking criterion and also prove the asymmetric profile of breaking waves keywords breaking waves local wave steepness splash up air entrainment energy dissipation turbulence intensity 1 introduction wave breaking as an important ocean phenomenon of the surface gravity waves plays a significant role in momentum and energy transformation around the air water interface the generation of the surface current turbulence mixing both in air and water phase and wave offshore structure interaction rapp et al 1990 bonmarin 1989 melville 1996 wave breaking in different intensities will produce different breaking profiles and have different wave loads and damages on offshore structures the accurate estimation of the strong nonlinear wave geometry and kinematic field parameters plays an important role in the prediction of the breaking wave loads on offshore structures however less attention has been paid to the understanding of the detailed wave breaking process and hydrodynamic profiles thus it is critical and meaningful to carry out fundamental research on the breaking waves especially for the prediction onset of the breaking geometry profile enhanced kinematics description and energy dissipation many significant research works have been made to give a primary introduction of the wave breaking process and provide a more detailed fundamental physical understanding of wave breaking under different water depths a remarkable laboratory of focused wave breaking performed by rapp et al 1990 presented the process of the air water mixing evolution and showed that spilling breakers experience 10 energy flux changing to as much as 25 for plunging breakers based on the air water gas transfer lamarre 1993 reported a series of experiments on air entrainment measurements by wave breaking lamarre and melville 1991 banner and peregrine 1993 provided fundamental research of velocity field and local geometry profile of plunging breakers in deep water duncan 2001 reviewed spilling breakers and studied the surface tension influence on wave breaking a systematic review of the overall process of wave breaking was given by perlin et al 2013 for an understanding of the breaking physical process in deep and intermediate water depth although wave steepness is a crucial and controllable geometry parameter for focused breaking waves few studies took it as control and consecutive variables to analyze different wave breaking criteria and other wave profiles under different wave breaking intensities the essential aim of this paper is to explore the applicability of three typical breaking criteria wave geometry profile kinematics and energy dissipations under different wave breaking intensities even for extreme steep breaking waves a analysis of breaking wave characteristics numerous studies have been performed to provide credible and accurate fundamental reviews on geometry profiles of wave breaking duncan et al 1999 summarized the crest profile evolution of the gentle spilling breakers with dispersive focusing mechanics tian et al 2010 conducted several experiments of unsteady plunging breakers and defined a local wave steepness to predict breaking onset on this basis tian et al 2012 adopted an eddy viscosity model for wave breaking simulations and got reasonable results with their measurements alagan chella et al 2015 analyzed the asymmetry profiles of breaking waves and found that the water depth has a significant influence on breaking type and other geometry properties the above studies include research of wave surface elevation and geometry profiles under different breaking types however the discussions of the geometry profile variation versus different breaking types and wave steepness are seldom mentioned the estimation of the velocity and kinematic field is crucial for the analysis of wave loads on structures grue et al 2003 defined a new reference fluid velocity profile by a third order monochromatic stokes wave beneath the wave surface for steep wave events in deep water lim et al 2015 gave a detailed description of the kinematic field and the variation of the velocity during plunging breaker occurring alberello and iafrati 2019 used the piv particle image velocimetry to capture the kinematic field during breaking na et al 2020 found that the maximum horizontal velocity reached 1 5 times wave phase speed after the onset of spilling breaking waves the comparison of velocity field under different breaking types and the further discussion of the velocity field evolution under extreme steep waves are still worth the time and efforts since the process of wave breaking is chaotic and has large energy transformation the turbulent profile and vorticity field were only mentioned on several lubin and glockner 2015 based on these previous studies the further and detailed analysis of wave characteristics and an quantical description of the breaking process versus different breaking intensity is a successively and orderly investigated b breaking criterion some researchers mentioned some parameters for prediction of wave breaking onsets banner and peregrine 1993 perlin et al 2013 and intensity tian et al 2010 song and banner 2002 the research carried out by bonmarin 1989 duncan and longuet higgins 1981 and ramberg and griffin 1987 were compared with the stokes theory geometry breaking limitation and found that the experimental limiting wave steepness at breaking incipient section is less than theoretical ones rapp et al 1990 proposed the definition of global wave steepness firstly tian et al 2010 used the spectrally weighted wavenumber k s instead of the wavenumber associated with the center frequency of wave group in rapp and melville s analysis and they found the breaking onset predictions using the global wave steepness based on their results stansell and macfarlane 2002 presented the influence of the estimation method of phase speed on predicting wave breaking onset and concluded that the ratio of the horizontal particle velocity and local wave phase speed exceed 1 u c p 1 at the incipient scenario is not a necessary condition for breaking in wu and nepf 2002 paper they summarized previous studies baldock et al 1996 stansell and macfarlane 2002 about the estimation method of the wave phase speed and pointed out that the propagation direction and bandwidth have an influence on the results when choosing different wave phase speed estimation method wu and nepf 2002 adopted the linear wave assumption with an error of 5 20 melville 1994 estimated the energy dissipation rate during breaking and found that the energy dissipation rate increases with the wave steepness in tian et al 2010 paper they found that the normalized energy dissipation closely correlates with global steepness and the wave group of large global steepness might result in larger energy dissipation lim et al 2015 carried out experiments in three dimensions and found that the wave direction had apparent effects on the geometric breaking criterion and had little effect on the kinematic criterion but they did not drawn conclusions on the dynamic criterion due to its dependency on the wave gauge locations wu and nepf 2002 used the proportion of the higher harmonic frequency energy band of the entire spectrum as the breaking dynamic criterion and found that the energy of the higher frequency band is sensitive to the choice of the reference location so the breaking criterion based on the estimation of the energy proportion of the higher frequency is not appropriate and credible to predict wave breaking compared with the geometry and kinematic criterion as summarized from the above literature a systematic analysis of the breaking parameter and breaking criteria including geometry kinematic and dynamics sections is necessary and complex work to achieve a systematic analysis we carried out a series of simulations of focused breaking waves with the constant steepness method to investigate wave characteristics as the variation of global wave steepness the numerical model and wave generation method are proposed in section 2 in section 3 we compare our results with the experimental data and validate the numerical model the analysis of the wave parameters and breaking criteria represent a clear framework of this study the discussion focuses on two subsection one is the wave characteristic analysis including geometry kinematic field and quantical description of breaking process another is the three typical breaking criteria finally in the conclusion section a summary of the wave profile versus the continued increase wave steepness is depicted 2 numerical method and wave tank setup 2 1 governing equations the two phase flow numerical wave tank is built based on the open source model reef3d cfd bihs et al 2016 the flow field for both air and water phase are governed by mass conservation and

eddy viscosity the details about the two phase flow model and numerical method used in this study are presented in appendix a part 2 2 numerical wave tank setup the numerical model is validated by simulating the experiments by tian and choi 2013 at kaist korea the experiments of two dimensional plunging breaking waves were carried out in a narrow wave tank which is 15 m long 1 5 m wide and has a water depth of 0 54 m the same setup conditions are adopted in a numerical two dimensional wave tank to reproduce the breaking waves in the experiment fig 1 depicts the wave tank setting according to the experimental physical setup the computational domain is 15 m long with a constant water depth of 0 54 m the total numerical wave tank height is 1 m including both air and water phases a relaxation zone of 2 m is located at the inlet boundary for wave generation and a numerical wave beach is located at the end of the bank with the length of 3 m to absorb wave and prevent wave reflection correspondingly to replicate the results the wave gauges are set at the same position as the experiments the wave gauges locates at x 2 84 m x 5 13 m x 7 04 m and x 9 07 m recorded as g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 in sequence two reference cases are set and reproduced as the same wave conditions as the experiments and wave groups df1 for the focused non breaking waves condition with global wave steepness as 0 25 and 0 57 for df2 the focused breaking wave case the predetermined focused time and location for these two cases are set based on tian s experiment tian and choi 2013 there are 128 sinusoidal wave components in the dispersive focusing wave groups with uniform frequency bands ranging from 1 0 hz to 2 4 hz spectral peak frequency and center frequency as f p 1 1 and f c 1 7 separately the global wave steepness is 0 25 for the non breaking wave group df1 and 0 57 for the breaking wave group df2 respectively the details of the wave parameters associated with the wave groups are list in table 3 in this study the global wave steepness is adjusted for each of the wave groups ranging from 0 25 to 0 75 with an interval of 0 05 that lead to both non breaking and breaking waves with different breaking types and strengths besides the reference case df2 the predetermined focused location and time are kept the same to analyze the effect of nonlinear amplitude on the focused mechanics the frequency bandwidth ratio f r a n g e f c was kept the same for all cases in this study previous research show that the global steepness is highly related to the breaking strength as for the above summaries we change the value of the global steepness to investigate the breaking strength local geometries of breaking waves kinetic characteristics momentum flux dissipation and turbulence profile under different global wave steepness and wave breaking types x f and t f are the predicted focused focal point and focusing time determined by linear theory in eq 7 the instant focused position and time for validation case df2 are 6 25 m and 23 55 s besides this case the focused position and time are set the same for other cases as 7 m and 25 s separately in this study in this study the classification of breaking type changing from non breaking wave incipient breaking condition spilling and plunging are defined according to a previous study of rapp et al 1990 the numerical domain is discretized using a 6345 443 rectangular mesh considered for the simulations the mesh domain is composed of the stretching zone and the uniform grid zone the base mesh is refined three times to obtain a finer grid size of 0 001 m near the free surface a constant cell size of 0 001 m is generated in the stretching zone of the length 2 0 m around the wave focused area in the x direction from 5 3 m to 7 3 m so that it can cover both non breaking spiller and plunger focusing location and propagation details to reduce the effect of aspect ratio the stretching grid around the wave focused area is kept as a square mesh with an aspect ratio of 1 the grid size in the uniform zone is 0 003 m the stretching zone in the vertical direction is the same for all cases with uniform grid size 0 001 m from 0 465 m to 0 615 m there is a short cross zone between the stretching zone and the outside uniform grid zone the distribution of the stretched grid near the free surface is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 focused wave generation there are several physical mechanisms inducing wave breaking in experiment and simulation studies energy dispersion focusing wind fetch wave current coupling and modulational instability may all introduce wave breaking in the simulation the pre determined energy focused wave is generated based on the constant wave steepness method in this paper linear superposition wave theory is adopted to generate focused waves in the spirit of this method the target focused wave are composed by individual sinusoidal harmonic waves with same wave steepness the first order focused wave theory is employed for the free surface defined as 5 η 1 i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t ψ i where a i is the amplitude of i th wave component k i is the wavenumber ω i 2 π f i is the radian frequency and ψ i is the phase ω i and k i follow the dispersive relation as follows 6 ω i 2 g k i tanh k i d where d is water depth the phase angle ψ i is determined by setting cos k i

absorption of the wave at the end of tank and very little reflection mayer et al 1998 and jacobsen et al 2012 the analytical values of the velocities free surface and pressure based on first order wave theory are expressed by the relaxation function in the relaxation zone for wave generation at the outlet boundary the numerical beach another relaxation zone is set to absorb the incident waves

point x of the relaxation zone and x is scaled to the length of the relaxation zone the length of the relaxation zone is usually taken with one wavelength for the numerical beach the relaxation method is employed in all cases with around two wavelengths the relaxation function in the relaxation zone and numerical beach used is expressed as follows 12 γ x 1 e x 3 5 1 e 1 f o r x 0 1 the top and two side boundaries of the computational domain are treated as symmetry plane where the free slip mixed boundary condition is applied the bottom of the nwt is regarded as a rigid wall and the law of the wall is applied at t 0 s the wave tank is initialized with u i 0 for both the air and water phases and the free surface keeps z 0 the pressure distribution in the whole domain is hydrostatic the level set function is reinitialized after each time step to maintain its signed distance property and to ensure mass conservation 2 5 breaking criteria three typical breaking criteria are introduced in this section including a geometric criterion b kinematic criterion and c dynamic criterion these three criteria are estimated based on the simulated wave profile and their performance in predicting wave breaking are described by the variation tendency between the corresponding predictional parameter and the increasing wave steepness the breaking criteria studied in this paper are specified and adopted in finite water depth the classification and definition of water depth over which the oscillation propagates have been summarized in table 1 2 5 1 geometric criterion 1 theoretical wave breaking criterion based on the connection between wave height h and wave period related parameter g t 2 ramberg and griffin 1987 presents that the ratio between these two parameters can be a breaking criterion this ratio usually was compared with theoretical limiting wave height h 0 027 g t 2 which is calculated based on the stokes limiting wavelength and second order relation between wavelength and period l 1 2 g t 2 fig 3 gives a concise definition of wave geometry parameters used in this paper 2 global wave steepness in this study we adopt the global wave steepness ɛ for the sake of consistency with our focused wave generation method the linear superimposed of the steepness of all the components is expressed as ɛ n a i k i and each wave component has the same wave steepness here n is the total wave components number k i is the wavenumber of i th component given by the linear dispersion relation and a i is the wave amplitude of each wave component 3 local wave geometric steepness and asymmetry there are many geometry parameters to describe the wave geometric steepness in the experiment of rapp et al 1990 they used two parameters the wave crest steepness α h c l and the measured local steepness h l to investigate the effect of bandwidth on wave breaking with low carrier steepness from their results it is insufficient to use the wave geometric parameters during the focusing onset process to estimate the type of breakers however the derivation of steepness can be a good predictable criterion wu and nepf 2002 introduced local steepness and asymmetry using four typical geometric parameters a the crest front steepness α h c l similar with the wave crest steepness in rapp s paper rapp et al 1990 b the crest near steepness δ h f l c the vertical asymmetry ψ l l d the horizontal asymmetry μ h c h tian et al 2010 adopted an another definition of local wave steepness ɛ b k b a n they pointed out that the local wave steepness is strongly related to the energy dissipation rate from the above studies we conclude that it is essential to compare and find a better indicator to predict the onset of wave breaking finally the local geometry parameters are taken into consideration and their sensitiveness with regard to characterizing breaking onset is analysis these geometry parameters are measured at the incipient time section just before the wave breaking as to the instability of the breaking process the incipient scenario is chosen when the wave crest front almost become vertical as shown in fig 4 2 5 2 kinematic breaking criterion the ratio of the maximum horizontal particle velocity u and the local phase speed of the crest propagation is the kinematic breaking indicator the breaking wave was predicted when u c p 1 longuet higgins 1969 the kinematic criterion analysis includes the determination of two parameters maximum horizontal water particle velocity and the local wave phase speed 13 u u 2 v 2 1 2 where u is the particle velocity component along in the x direction and v is the component transverse in the y direction a linear dispersion assumption is used for an acceptable estimation of the wave phase speed from the above studies we adopt the local wave speed definition as follows in eq 14 to calculate local phase speed c p 14 c p ω b k b the local angular frequency is calculated by ω b 2 π t t t where t t t is the time between two troughs around the crest of the wave gauge at the real focused position for the local wavenumber k b is computed from the local wave crest length defined in fig 3 k b π l c the incipient moment when the front crest is vertical to the free surface is selected to calculate the local wave number k b 2 5 3 dynamics breaking criterion as for the analysis above we adopt the energy dissipation rate as the dynamic breaking criterion parameter following the energy analysis of tian et al 2010 the total energy is estimated based on the wave elevation measurements at fixed spatial locations the linear theory energy flux is used to estimate the total energy as follows 15 e x t 1 n ρ g c g s η 2 x t where η x t is the surface elevation recorded by wave gauges and c g s is the spectrally weighted group velocity estimated from the wave elevation defined by drazen et al 2008 as 16 c g s c g n a n 2 δ f n a n 2 δ f n a n and c g n are the wave amplitude and linear group velocity of each wave component of the wave group respectively the group velocity c g n was measured by tracking the wave group maximum several wave gauges are probed to measure the surface elevation to evaluate the group envelope and the maxima δ f is the constant frequency difference between wave components based on the previous studies a parameter to describe the wave energy variation rate is proposed to investigate the energy dissipation and the relations between wave breaking the energy changing rates of focus and dissipation process are both estimated within a local wavelength l b 2 l c l c is the distance between two adjacent zero crossing points defined in fig 3 the energy variation rate is calculated as follows 17 r δ e l b c p where δ e is the energy variation values within a local wavelength l c this parameter can be assigned as δ e f and δ e d corresponding to the focusing and dissipation process separately the local wave phase speed c p calculated using eq 14 3 results and discussion in this section we present the comparison of the wave elevation both for non breaking and breaking cases between the numerical and experimental results to verify and validate the present numerical wave tank model based on the validation research the wave characteristics and three typical breaking criteria have been studied and analyzed 3 1 verification study in this part we provide verification of both focused non breaking and breaking wave cases with experimental results the validation of the numerical model is proved by comparing the numerical free surface elevation and the experimental results of the focused nonbreaking case df1 and breaking case df2 at four wave gauges four wave gauges are located at the computational domain in fig 1 the computational results are compared with the experimental data captured by the high speed imaging technology from the experiments carried out by tian and choi 2013 wave gauge recorded 35 s surface elevations for two cases df1 focused nonbreaking wave and df2 focused plunging breaking wave case are shown in figs 5 and 6 separately for the case of the nonbreaking waves the wave elevation of the simulation results agree with the experimental data almost perfectly in fig 5 the numerical wave elevation for plunging breaking waves also has a good agreement with the experimental data in fig 6 the numerical results can replicate the wave elevation the same as the experimental results for both before and after breaking scenarios since the focused wave is a strong nonlinear phenomenon and very sensitive to the prescribed focused position and time the good agreement of the wave elevation at different wave gauges along the wave tank indicates successful simulations of the focused breaking processes using the numerical model 3 2 wave characteristics analysis in the above section the numerical wave elevations agree with experimental results in different wave gauge for both non breaking and breaking wave cases the wave elevation has a abruptly rogue increasing around the focused position and shows irregular and nonlinear wave generation and propagation progress therefore it is significant to further study and analyze the wave characteristics of the focused breaking waves the purpose of this section is to analyze wave strong nonlinear profile kinematic field and the process of energy focusing and dissipation during the progress of wave focusing and breaking with different wave steepness 3 2 1 strong nonlinear characteristics of breaking waves the strong nonlinear profiles of the focused breaking waves were not only performed by local geometric parameters but also indicated by the difference between the setting focused position x f and time section t f and real focused position x f and time instant t f the differences between the presetting focused position as well as time and real results are defined as x r f and t r f the variation of x r f and t r f versus the increase of global wave steepness is shown in fig 7 the variation of focused positions can be roughly approximated as a piecewise function having a linear monotonic profile of each segmentation the abruptly shifted variation values of the second demarcation point with ɛ ranging 0 6 0 65 is larger than that of the first shift with ɛ changing 0 3 to 0 35 for the first segmentation the focused position moved downstream as a linear trend from the setting position and shifted upstream abruptly at 0 35 global steepness the second and third demarcations follow this changing trend and the focused position moved downstream relative to the shifted demarcation point it is proved that the position of wave energy focusing varies nonlinearly when the input focused position keeps as a fixed value rapp rapp et al 1990 also analyzed the changing of the focused position in their study and had similar results with our study compared with the changing of the focused position the real focused time in fig 7 b almost follows the changing trend of the focused position in fig 7 a different from the linear changing after abrupt shifts of the focused position the focused time almost keeps constant after the demarcation point the abrupt shift of time and position is related to the energy changing during the focused process and it is revealed by the wave surface elevation of the focused waves in fig 8 the color curves in fig 8 are the wave surface elevation with different time sections the time interval for the wave surface capture is 0 02 s wave surface elevations are plotted by connecting surface points recorded with a constant distance interval as 0 003 m in x direction the black dotted lines in each figure respect the wave surface elevation at the focused section the wave surface elevations of the all time section are composed of the wave envelope which has a fair external contour the existence of the wave packet also suggests the quantities and position of energy and amplitude focused in fig 8 the wave focused with the swell wave packet several swell wave packets with relative lower amplitude near the focused wave packet where have the maximum wave amplitude from figs 8 a to 8 b the focused position moved from the middle wave packet to the position of the first wave packet which also corresponds to the first demarcation where the focused position shifted abruptly the focused wave keeps at first wave packet even for global steepness as 0 4 and 0 45 in figs 8 c and 8 d corresponding to spilling and plunging breaker separately as the increase of the global wave steepness the amplitude increases not only for the focused wave packet but also wave packets near it in fig 8 e the difference of the amplitude between the neighbor wave packet and the focused packet is very smaller with the global steepness of 0 6 it also proves the energy and amplitude increase of the wave packet near the focused wave packet the focused wave packet in fig 8 e and the upstream wave packet combine with each other and form a new wave packet with higher amplitude when the global steepness rises to 0 7 this suggests that the energy and amplitude of the focused wave packet and the neighbor packet rise at the same time with the increase of global wave steepness when the amplitude of the neighbor packet is near the value of the focused wave packet the focused position will have an abrupt shift as the increase of steepness and input energy so it can be summarized that the changing of the focused position is due to the energy focusing and distribution mechanism the energy focusing process also has a strong nonlinear profile the overturning process is another typical strong nonlinear phenomenon for the plunging breaking wave the overturning jet brings an entrained air cavity during the process of first curling and splash up new 1983 proposed an applied mathematical model to describe the front crest overturning phenomenon a certain region of the front surface beneath the overturning crest can be well approximated by an ellipse based on this indication the more wave develops the more accuracy the underside cavity of the breaking crest becomes to a 3 aspect ratio ellipses bonmarin 1989 did a comparison between their experimental results and new 1983 mathematical solution and got a good agreement to analyze the variation of air cavity beneath the first splash up overturning jet the scenario shown in fig 9 when the first overturning jet penetrates into the free surface is selected to calculate the area of the best fitted ellipses on these observed profiles the selected ellipse satisfied the requirement of along the largest portion underneath the overturning jet a successive approximation determines an accuracy fitness so the axes ratio of the fitness ellipse in fig 9 is around 3 in the theory of new 1983 the area of the air cavity denoted as a e beneath the overturning jet versus the global steepness is shown in fig 10 the area of the air cavity is roughly a linear function of global steepness ɛ for our wave groups it is found that a e 5 35 ɛ this indicates that wave groups of relatively large wave steepness increase in the area of the air cavity beneath the overturning front jet more area of air cavity means more strong mixing of the air and water after breaking of large wave steepness an increase of the front cavity reflects the wave falling crest height of breaking waves rises the area of the air cavity can also be a rough indicator to calculate and analyze the air entrainment and air water mixing intensity after wave breaking 3 2 2 velocity field analysis the vertical velocity fields beneath the crest surface at the incipient scenario are shown in fig 11 the velocity rises exponentially in the vertical direction and has maximum values at the wave crest the curvature of velocity distributions for different global wave steepness is different from each other waves with larger steepness correspond to having a more curving velocity distribution from this distribution the maximum velocity exists around the wave crest so the maximum horizontal velocity is picked up near the crest for kinematic criterion analysis fig 12 shows the evolution of the horizontal velocity field of the spilling breaking process the velocity is an oriented arrow to the direction of particle velocity and is scaled by the values of horizontal velocity four typical breaking scenario is selected and shown in fig 12 the green dots in each figure is the location of the maximum velocity of the present time section the position of the green dot is always located at the top of the crest or the front of the ejecting jet which indicates that the location of the maximum velocity occurs the incipient scenario when the crest front surface is vertical relative to the water level is shown in fig 12 a local maximum velocity is u m a x 0 86 c p at the incipient section in fig 12 a the particle velocity at the crest exceeds the front wave surface and backward wave face which will compress the front wave face and stretch the backward wave face resulting in a breaking jet in fig 12 b compared with the plunging breaking wave with a large plunging tongue at the front crest jet the spilling breakers show a smaller ejecting jet at the top of the crest in fig 12 b the maximum velocity occurs at the splash up section in fig 12 c of the entire spilling breaker process with a magnitude of 1 2 c p after a weak splash up the crest jet falls to the front surface mixing with entrainment air and swells forward in fig 12 d after splash up the values of maximum velocity decrease apparently and the water surface pushed upward velocity fields of the plunging breaking wave are depicted in fig 13 the maximum velocity at the incipient section in fig 13 a is u m 0 936 c p which is larger than that for spilling breakers a large air cavity is generated by the first rolling continuing to curl and moving forward the maximum velocity particle is located at the plunging tongue for the entire overturning process such as the scenario in fig 13 b after the fully rolling and development the overturning water jet falls and impinges on the front wave trough surface in fig 13 c the scenario in fig 13 c is defined as impingement and has maximum local velocity along this plunging breaking process as u m a x 1 31 c p a splash up is generated by the strong impingement of the falling jets in fig 13 d and the maximum velocity at this moment is smaller than that in the impingement scenario in fig 13 c the maximum of the horizontal particle velocity increases when the splash up developed as second clockwise rolling in fig 13 e the maximum particle velocity arrived u m a x 1 18 c p just below the values of impingement moment a backward counterclockwise rolling is generated and develops as a negative impingement between the first clockwise impingement and the second rolling in fig 13 f this phenomenon is also captured by lim et al 2015 and defined as backward impingement in their research an air cavity generated by first penetrating rolling exists under the free surface two clockwise and one backward impingement formed an irregular triangular packet which was called as surface zone and ascending crest of the breaking waves in lim et al 2015 and nadaoka et al 1989 after these overturning and mixing of the plunging breakers the focused wave energy dissipates and the maximum velocity decreases apparently at this moment the variation of the maximum horizontal velocity for different global wave steepness is introduced in fig 20 it will have more detail and direct understanding of the umax changing during the entire breaking process 3 2 3 qualitative description of breaking process and turbulence structure the profile of the vorticity distribution is very similar to the turbulence intensity lim et al 2015 fig 14 shows the evolution of vorticity and turbulence structures distributions during strong plunging breakers for global steepness 0 7 with the free surface as boundaries the turbulent structures on both air and water are displayed contoured by the magnitude of the vorticity field the motion of the free surface generates chaotic turbulent structures around the free surface in both air and water phases concentrate negative vorticities existed above the breaking crest in the air phase at each breaking moment selected in fig 14 at the incipient moment in fig 14 a two pairs of vorticities locate at the front trough and stretch backward surface separately in the air phase as the forward motion of the breaking crest the vorticities existing in pairs at the backward of the breaking crest have a negative rolling over around the surface from the incipient moment 22 4 s to 23 04 s in fig 14 h the vorticities existing in pair at the front trough in fig 14 a always keep a distance of the wave surface and move from the front of the breaking crest to the back as the breaking wave propagates before the incipient moment in fig 14 a the vorticity field is almost irrotational beneath the wave surface which is similar to the laboratory results of perlin et al 1996 as the development of the breaking crest overturning and plunging forward in fig 14 b a relatively larger positive vorticity field is generated below the rolling crest and has a maximum value at the turning point of the splash up cycle after the first overturning crest penetrating into the wavefront surface the potential energy has been transformed into kinematic and turbulent energy this energy transformation not only gets an increase of the horizontal particle velocity but also leads to the formation of large vortices under the wave surface in fig 14 c the energy dissipation due to wave breaking is the source of the energy for turbulent mixing around the wave surface and air entrainment these energy transformations adjust the air water energy exchanging and enhance the vortex propagation underwater air is entrapped into wave surface and the air entrainment phenomenon has been generated another splash up is also generated and has maximum vorticities after the energy transformation as the effect of inertial force the first plunging impingement continues to roll forward and downward arousing a rising water volume between the entrapped air and second plunging jet in fig 14 e the negative rolling generated between the first air water mixing clouds and second rolling in fig 14 e is defined as first negative rolling this negative vorticity has been developed when the second plunging jet penetrated into the front surface and generated another air entrapped in fig 14 f after the negative rolling impinging into backward and combining with the first air entrapped collapsed bubble clouds and chaotic mixing vortex fields are generated in fig 14 g the second negative vorticity develops between the third positive rolling and second air entrainment in fig 14 g the third splash up rolling and spilling forward dissipates the last energy of the breaking waves in fig 14 h the turbulence intensity of this mixing air water clouds flow decreases with the development of the breaking process and the wave surface tend to smooth after these breaking processes in fig 14 at the same time the vorticity field has a more chaotic and complex profile the complex clockwise and counterclockwise vorticities generated during the breaking process are the main sources of turbulent kinematic energy dissipation 3 3 breaking criteria the above analysis of wave characteristics give an insight view of focused breaking waves besides the prediction of the onset of wave breaking is another crucial point for the understanding of wave breaking in the present section we adopted three typical breaking criteria to predict the focused wave breaking onset under infinite water depth 3 3 1 geometric breaking criterion a stokes breaking limitation the stokes theoretical breaking limiting as the typical breaking criterion is analyzed in this section the relations between wave height h and the period parameter g t 2 of the present results are shown in fig 15 the present limiting wave steepness at breaking inception is less than the stokes limitation h 0 027 g t 2 which is consistent with the previous studies conducted by duncan and longuet higgins 1981 and bonmarin 1989 in fig 15 as for the analysis of breaking criterion it should be noted here that despite the different generation methods of the breaking waves plunger and spilling breakers appear to have qualitatively similar properties bonmarin also pointed out that the breaking coefficient σ h g t 2 depends on the breaker type although the highest values may be typically associated with plunging breakers the author does not think the correlation is sufficient to mark the coefficient as a breaker classification parameter as for the assumption and foundation the relations between the breaking coefficient and global steepness are shown in fig 16 the present results show clearly a linear function trend between breaking coefficient σ and global steepness ɛ as for the simulation results in this study it is spilling breakers when global wave steepness is 0 4 and plungers for 0 45 global steepness so in fig 16 the value of σ as 0 015 could be a classification threshold of the breaking type in this study with the increase of the global steepness the breaking coefficient will have a linear increase with the slope value of 0 0246 it is also consistent with bonmarin s bonmarin 1989 conclusion that higher values of breaking coefficient σ are the rougher breaking waves are b global wave steepness for focused waves wave crest height as the typical wave geometric parameter reflects the amplitude focusing and the energy collection mechanism for focused waves when the wave crest reached a threshold value and arrived at the breaking criterion a steep wave crest exists and breaking takes place the maximum amplitude of the focused wave a m a x along the increased global wave steepness is shown in fig 17 the primary wave parameters and breaking classification information are summarized in table 3 spilling breakers s occur when global wave steepness reached 0 4 and plunging breakers p happen with 0 45 steepness n respects the nonbreaking profile and i corresponds to the incipient section in table 3 the corresponding focused and breaking profiles of each case have been marked in fig 17 for better understanding for the analysis of the geometric criterion parameter global wave steepness as the global steepness increases the maximum wave amplitude shows a curve increasing rate after the focused wave arrived at the plunging profile the increasing rate of the maximum amplitude show a linear trend the focused waves generate different wave focus and breaking intensity as the increase of global steepness it also indicates that the global steepness as a geometric criterion parameter can give a good prediction of the incipient and breaking section the comparison of the global wave steepness under different experiment settings and focused wave generation mechanics are collected and summarized in table 2 the focused wave generated by the constant steepness spectra is selected the wave steepness a i k i is same for each wave component in lamarre experiment lamarre 1993 which is similar to the calculational method of the amplitude and frequency of each sinusoidal component in this simulation the value of global wave steepness corresponding to different breaking sections and types are the same as the results of lamarre lamarre 1993 a higher threshold value of global steepness with the constant steepness spectra studied by kway et al 1998 under low frequency ranging from 0 56 hz to 1 1 hz compared with the values of this criterion under a relative high frequency wave energy with low frequency is more stable and has higher global wave steepness when generating breaking besides it is also clear that this criterion is also influenced by the dimension and wave direction by comparing different dimensions results of wu and nepf 2002 this suggests that the wave energy distribution is not only related to the local wave energy collection in wave propagation direction but also has a relative amount of energy dissipating in three dimensions although the threshold of the global wave steepness have relative difference between different experiment and numerical studies this criterion has a good prediction of wave breaking in each research the influence of the setting wave parameter on the threshold values of this criterion still need further study and analysis c local wave steepness and asymmetry parameters fig 18 shows the crest front steepness α the crest rear steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor ψ and the vertical asymmetry factor μ distribution versus the global wave steepness ɛ it appears that these local geometric parameters increase for waves with larger global wave steepness the distribution of the crest front steepness α shows a roughly linear trend along with the variation of global steepness in fig 18 a the linear fitness of the front steepness α shows a good prediction of unique breaking incipient cases for the simulation wave groups varying with different global wave steepness the linear relation between α and ɛ fit α 1 1665 ɛ this implies that the focused wave of relatively large setting wave steepness has a more steep front crest it also corresponds to the increased particle velocity and energy around the front crest of the breaking waves with large global steepness which may change the amount of energy focusing and dissipation during the breaking process it also indicates that the breaking process becomes more vigorous and has a strong irregular profile compared with the crest front steepness α the crest rear steepness δ has a relatively smaller changing range and linear fitness slope 0 2335 versus ɛ in fig 18 b therefore crest rear steepness is not a good indicator for predicting different wave breaking sections in addition the asymmetry parameter vertical factor ψ and the horizontal factor μ are insufficient to predict wave breaking as well as seen in figs 18 c and 18 d the trend of the vertical asymmetry factor versus global wave steepness shows a relative discrete distribution compared to an increasing linear fitness this suggests that the focused wave shows a relative focused axis symmetry profile before the incipient breaking section then the breaking wave generated by constant steepness focused mechanism has a larger backward wave length l almost equaling to 2 times of front wave length l with large wave steepness this is an opposite phenomenon compared with the breaking waves induced by the decrease of water depth which has been studied by alagan chella et al 2015 in their study the vertical asymmetry factor shows a decrease trend when the wave steepness factor h 0 l 0 becomes larger with a beginning values as 3 6 and ended with 2 1 besides these local steepness and asymmetry parameters a local wave steepness ɛ b k b a n prior to wave breaking was introduced by tian et al 2010 a similar result with experiment of tian et al 2010 for a linear function between global wave steepness ɛ and local wave steepness ɛ b has been achieved shown in fig 19 the linear fitness function is ɛ b 1 12 ɛ although the formula and geometric meaning of ɛ b and crest front steepness α are different the same indication that local wave steepness increase with large global wave steepness has arrived it also proves the breaking crest can contain more energy and have a strong nonlinear profile with large global wave steepness this factor also can be a good indicator to predict the unique wave breaking section 3 3 2 kinematic breaking criterion the kinematic breaking criterion ratios u c p are calculated using eqs 9 and 13 and shown as blue solid lines in fig 20 for all cases with different global wave steepness the typical kinematic breaking criterion u c p 1 as a threshold value is plotted as a dashed line the time axis is initialized by the real focused time section t f for the spilling and plunging breakers the scenario for t f is selected when the front wave crest is vertical relative to the water level in fig 4 the maximum value of ratio u c p increase apparently for the nonbreaking waves with global wave steepness changing from 0 25 to 0 35 the kinematic energy rises and collects with the increase of global steepness the maximum of the ratio u c p just below 1 for the incipient non breaking case w g 2 with ɛ 0 35 the breaking phenomenon does not occur until u c p 1 when global steepness ɛ 0 40 in fig 20 when ɛ 0 4 a spilling breakers occurs the ratio u c p only has one maximum amplitude values and a regular variation intervals above 1 when ɛ is 0 45 the interval above the threshold value has two extreme values corresponding to the maximum particle velocity at impingement scenario and that at the second rolling section in figs 13 c and 13 e separately it suggests that the velocity decrease apparently after the second rolling and impingement the variation of the ratio of maximum particle velocity and local wave phase speed also provides another view of the kinematic energy changing during each breaking process the intervals when the ratio u c p above 1 for the spilling breaking process in fig 20d is shorter than that for plunging breakers with ɛ 0 45 in fig 20e this implies that the spilling breakers have a shorter breaking process compared with the plunging breakers from the length of the time interval when the ratio u c p above 1 and ratio elevation exceeding the threshold value 1 the spilling and plunging breakers have an apparent difference between each other so these two parameters may be an indicator to reveal the breaking type the above phenomenons demonstrate that the kinematic breaking ratio not only predicts the breaking but also has functions to distinguish the variation of the breaking type and intensity the kinematic breaking ratio u c p keeps a time interval with an oscillation variation when its values exceed 1 for cases ɛ 0 45 these oscillations are related to the curling and penetrating phenomena during the breaking process the kinematic breaking criterion satisfied u c p 1 for all breaking cases in this study the kinematic breaking ratio u c p at the time section has different values for different global wave steepness in fig 20 this indicator gives a good prediction of wave breaking and reflects the breaking intensity from some characteristics the variation of the maximum particle velocity with the increase of global steepness ɛ at the incipient breaking moment is shown in fig 21 as the global wave steepness increases the ratio u c p shows a nonlinear increasing tendency this phenomenon has a similar conclusion in stansell and macfarlane 2002 that u c p 1 is not an essential requirement for wave breaking it is found that the distribution of u c p versus ɛ satisfies a cubic polynomial curve fitting this implies a nonlinear relation between horizontal particle velocity and the global wave steepness a focused wave group of relatively larger global wave steepness will have bigger horizontal particle velocity around the crest which might lead to more violent wave breaking thus resulting in more kinematic energy dissipation and rough breaking mixing around the free surface the nonlinear relation also suggests that only using the values of u c p at a certain time section does not show a good prediction of wave breaking however the existence of the time interval when u c p shown in fig 20 can be a breaking criterion and the length of this interval is highly correlated with the breaking type and intensity as can be seen in fig 22 the maximum horizontal velocity occurs at the impingement moment when the breaking crest penetrates the wave surface with a magnitude at a range from 1 3 c p to 2 5 c p as the increase of wave global steepness after impingement of the overturning crest there is a smaller decrease of the ratio u c p for the first splash up moment beside the results when ɛ 0 7 it is also indicated that strong nonlinear kinematic energy dissipation occurs for larger global wave steepness the ratio u c p during the breaking process after the incipient moment shows a rough separating chunk at ɛ 0 6 and the values of u c p show an abrupt increase no matter at which breaking moment global steepness as 0 6 is also a segmentation point for the focused position and time in figs 7 a and 7 b these phenomena prove that the velocity variation has the same abrupt shifting during the breaking as the increase of global wave steepness the energy focusing mechanism is the basic reason for these strong nonlinear generations 3 3 3 energy dissipation analysis and dynamic criterion wave breaking inhibits wave propagation reversal symmetry of focused nonbreaking waves alberello et al 2018 it also means that the focused breaking waves have a distinct asymmetry profile of the focusing and defocusing processes the asymmetric profile is not only reflected from the geometry characteristics but also exists on the energy focus and dissipation process the evolution of total energy along wave tank has been shown in fig 23 the values in the x direction have been normalized by the real focused position x f of each case and local crest wavelength l c the total energy has the maximum value when x x f l c 0 for a clear view of the total energy profile the results of all cases have been separated and depicted in two figures in fig 23 the maximum values of the total energy e x rise significantly as the increase of global wave steepness which proves that the focused waves with larger wave steepness will collect more wave energy before breaking energy distribution of nonbreaking waves with steepness as 0 25 and 0 30 shows a relative symmetric profile taking the focused position as the symmetry axis in fig 23 a when the global steepness is 0 35 the asymmetric profile of the focusing and defocusing process has been revealed the overall change trends of total energy e x on both sides of the focused position show asymmetric profiles especially for the cases of breaking waves when the global steepness is bigger than 0 35 the total energy at each position along the wave tank has larger values for steeper wave beside the incipient wave case with ɛ 0 35 when ɛ 0 6 as for the extreme steep waves when the global wave steepness ɛ 0 6 the energy increasing trend disturbs this phenomenon and shows more chaotic evolutions for the dissipation process in fig 23 b this suggests that the wave energy and dissipation processes are more unsteady and have strong nonlinear profiles for extreme steep waves with the large global wave steepness the sketch definition of parameters for calculating the energy changing rate is depicted in fig 24 the energy spatial distribution of case wg5 ɛ 0 5 is taken as an example for the energy parameter definition the variations of the energy within one local wavelength l b 2 l c for the focusing and dissipation processes are defined as δ e f and δ e d separately the variation of energy changing rate r within one local wavelength versus global wave steepness is shown in fig 25 the energy focusing rate is f r a t e assigned as red circles and the dissipation rate is d r a t e marked as blue squares in fig 25 the focusing energy rate f r a t e and energy dissipation rate d r a t e both satisfy the linear function as the increase of global wave steepness the phenomenon of the increasing trend of energy dissipation rate versus increased global steepness is similar to the conclusion in melville 1994 the focused waves with steeper wave slopes not only collect more energy but also have a larger energy changing rate r the slopes of these two linear functions of the energy changing rate r are different which also proved the asymmetric profile of the breaking process the linear fitness distribution suggests that the energy focusing and dissipation rate can both be good breaking indicators if using the focusing energy rate as the dynamic breaking criterion the threshold for the spilling breaking is around 9 j s however if it changed as dissipation energy rate this value turns to 10 7 j s the ratio of slopes of linear fitness function of two energy changing processes is around 0 79 which is also plotted by fitting the ratio of f r a t e d r a t e corresponding to each global steepness the constant value of f r a t e d r a t e indicates that the focusing energy and the energy focusing rate determine the energy dissipation rate to a certain extent 4 conclusions the simulations of focused breaking waves with different breaking intensity have been performed in a two phase numerical wave tank by solving the navier stokes equations together with the level set method and the large eddy simulation turbulent model the constant wave steepness method was employed to generate the focused breaking waves to study the variation of the wave geometry parameters velocity and vorticity field and the energy dissipation with different wave global steepness different wave breaking criteria were examined since the different breaking profiles and types were carried out with a large range of global wave steepness ɛ the comparison of the wave elevation between the simulation and experimental results indicates that the numerical model can provide accurate and reliable simulation results the detailed breaking profiles provided by the present numerical model is consistent with previous studies and give more insight views and understanding of the breaking process such as maximum velocity distribution the generation and existence of the clockwise vortex and counterclockwise vortex the air water chaotic mixing phenomenon and variation of turbulent intensity the focused position and time show a piecewise function as the increase of global steepness the wave surface elevation envelope gives a reasonable explanation of the regular motion of the real focused position x f and focused time t f as the increase of the global steepness not only the amplitude of the focused position increased but also the neighbor wave envelope the segmented variation of the focused position is due to the energy distribution method around the focused position when the energy reached a balance between the focused wave envelope and the neighbors the focused position will move upstreams abruptly as another strong nonlinear element of the wave breaking the air cavity under the impingement crest has been approximated by a 3 aspect ratio ellipse and the area of the air cavity shows a linear function of the global wave steepness it also indicates that the breaking wave with large global steepness can carry and plunge more air into water and cause more chaotic air water mixing the horizontal velocity has the maximum values during the breaking process at the impingement moment for each plunging breaking case the vorticity field experienced a profile changing from simple to complex and chaotic during the breaking process a counterclockwise vortex is generated between two positive vortexes rolling the wave breaking process may have a continued plunging process inducing more air water mixing and energy dissipation the generation of the vortexes and air water mixing is the source of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation as the breaking crest propagates the turbulence intensity increases at first and then decreases and gets a maximum value at the first splash up scenario moment three types of geometry parameters including stokes breaking limitation global wave steepness and local wave parameters were calculated for geometry breaking criterion analysis the breaking coefficient σ which may depend on the breaker type shows a linear functional relationship with the global wave steepness ɛ σ 0 015 could be a classification threshold of spilling and plunging breakers in this study the global wave steepness as a typical geometry wave shape parameter has proved to be a stable and credible criterion to predict wave breaking the threshold values of global wave steepness corresponding to different breaking profiles such as incipient spilling and plunging breaker are in good agreement with the experimental results of lamarre 1993 as for the local steepness parameters the linear fitness trend of crest front steepness shows a relatively good prediction of wave breaking the distributions of the other three local geometry parameters are relatively dispersed and irregular and inappropriate as breaking criteria the local steepness ɛ b estimated by the local wave geometry profile shows a linear functional relationship with the global wave steepness ɛ b 1 12 ɛ from the above summaries the global steepness as a pre established and controllable geometry parameter is a credible and practical criterion for wave breaking prediction the kinematic breaking ratio u c p gives a good prediction of wave breaking and satisfies the kinematic breaking criterion u c p 1 in the present study the breaking ratio has a time interval satisfying the breaking criterion u c p 1 the time interval when u c p 1 is different between the spilling and plunging breakers the length of this time interval is related to the breaking type and intensity so it may be an indicator to predict the breaking type the breaking ratio at the incipient breaking scenario shows a cubic polynomial curve fitting versus global wave steepness and the breaking ratio exists u c p 1 at the incipient section for some breaking cases until ɛ 0 5 so it proved that only using the values of breaking ratio at the incipient section as a judgment to predict wave breaking is not an accurate and sufficient method and criterion the variation of the total energy along the x direction shows an apparent increasing trend as the increase of global wave steepness the energy changing rate r defined by one local wavelength has been proposed and used as the dynamic breaking criterion the energy changing rate r shows a linear function with the global wave steepness both for the focused and dissipation process compared with the previous dynamic breaking criterion which depends too much on wave probe location for energy estimation the energy changing rate could be a good breaking indicator the threshold of the energy focusing rate f r a t e and dissipation rate d r a t e for the spilling breaking are 9 j s and 10 7 j

level set method and les turbulence model on a finite difference framework a staggered rectilinear cartesian grid is used in the two phase flow model for the high order spatial discretization schemes a fifth order accurate weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 is adopted for the spatial discretization of convection terms in the non uniform grid the second order accurate central differences are applied for discretion the diffusion terms the time derivatives in eqs 3 and 18 are discretized by an accurate third order total variation diminishing tvd runge kutta explicit time scheme developed by harten shu and osher 1988 in this study an adaptive time step is selected based on the cfl number when the cfl number is below 1 this time scheme shows good numerical stability and provides a high order of temporal accuracy the time stepping method balances the stability of simulation and the requirement of the computational cost according to velocity diffusion and the source term s the time step size δ t c f l can be defined as follows 24 δ t c f l 2 u m a x d x ν e f f δ δ u m a x d x ν e f f δ δ 2 4 s m a x d x 1 where s is the source term u m a x u m a x 2 v

adjusted with the value of 0 1 δ t c f l during the simulation the pressure gradient is modeled by projection method chorin 1968 for incompressible flow on the staggered grid the momentum equation is solved explicitly without the pressure gradient term and the updated velocity after each time step is the predicted velocity u i the predicted velocity u i will be inserted into the poisson equation

breaking wave case df2 with the grid size of d x 0 005 m 0 003 m the stretching grid from 0 003 m to 0 001 m and 0 001 m fig 26 presents the comparison of the wave surface elevation at the focused position with different grid sizes the real focused point for case df1 and df2 are 7 1 m and 6 2 m respectively the results in fig 26 a show that the numerical values for the wave elevation at stretching grid and d x 0 001 m are similar to each other compared to the results at grid size d x 0 005 m and d x 0 003 m fig 26 b shows the wave elevation at the focused point for case df2 converge for the stretching grid the focused wave crest height is used to calculate the grid convergence ratio stern et al 2001 the grid convergence ratio defined as r d m f d c m where d m f is the difference of the crest values between the medium and fine grids and d c m respect the varies between the coarse and medium grids the grid size 0 003 m stretching grid from 0 003 m to 0 001 m and 0 001 m are selected as coarse medium and fine grids respectively a convergence ratio of r 0 2 is obtained for case df1 and r 0 12 for case df2 both these two values are within the range of the monotonic convergency for r and indicate that the selected grid size satisfies the convergency study the overturning processes for the steep breaking waves with global wave steepness as 0 7 simulated with stretching grid with a total of grid number 2 8 million grids and the fine grid d x 0 001 m with a total of 15 million are presented in figs 27 a and 27 b respectively the high resolution simulation not only provides details on the front overturning crest kinematic feature but also captures the flow profile of the back of the splash up the stretching grid captures similar details like the high resolution simulation around the front of the splash up overturning for the breaking wave the front of the splash up has more significance in wave structure interaction so there is no significant improvement in the results for the wave breaking details when the grid size is refined from stretching grid to d x 0 001 m from the grid convergence study the stretching grid is accurate for both no breaking and breaking cases so the stretching grid is selected for simulation cases in this study 
23817,the profile of fluid field and wave geometry kinematic and dynamic characteristics of focused breaking waves in finite water depth with different wave steepness are studied with a constant wave steepness wave focusing method in this paper the flow field is solved by the two phase flow model in reef3d based on the incompressible navier stokes equation and the large eddy simulation les model to simulate the complex breaking process the numerical model is validated by comparing wave elevation of both focused non breaking and breaking case with the experimental results and satisfactory agreements are achieved a series of simulation cases with different global steepness are carried out to analyze the focused waves of different breaking types the difference between the preset focused condition and the real ones and the area of air cavity rolled by the wave jets are both indicates that the process of wave focusing and breaking show a strong nonlinear profile the maximum values of the horizontal velocity occur after the impingement moment and can reach 2 5 c p for extreme steep waves three typical wave breaking criteria in finite water depth are calculated and discussed successively for the geometric criterion analysis the global wave steepness and local steepness have a good performance both for predicting wave breaking and presenting the breaking intensity the kinematic breaking criterion ratio shows that the previous threshold 1 at the breaking incipient scenario is not sufficient to predict the wave breaking besides it is found that the time interval when the kinematic breaking criterion ratio big than 1 may related to the wave breaking type the energy changing rate for both the focusing and dissipation processes increase linearly with the global wave steepness and show a good ability as a dynamic breaking criterion and also prove the asymmetric profile of breaking waves keywords breaking waves local wave steepness splash up air entrainment energy dissipation turbulence intensity 1 introduction wave breaking as an important ocean phenomenon of the surface gravity waves plays a significant role in momentum and energy transformation around the air water interface the generation of the surface current turbulence mixing both in air and water phase and wave offshore structure interaction rapp et al 1990 bonmarin 1989 melville 1996 wave breaking in different intensities will produce different breaking profiles and have different wave loads and damages on offshore structures the accurate estimation of the strong nonlinear wave geometry and kinematic field parameters plays an important role in the prediction of the breaking wave loads on offshore structures however less attention has been paid to the understanding of the detailed wave breaking process and hydrodynamic profiles thus it is critical and meaningful to carry out fundamental research on the breaking waves especially for the prediction onset of the breaking geometry profile enhanced kinematics description and energy dissipation many significant research works have been made to give a primary introduction of the wave breaking process and provide a more detailed fundamental physical understanding of wave breaking under different water depths a remarkable laboratory of focused wave breaking performed by rapp et al 1990 presented the process of the air water mixing evolution and showed that spilling breakers experience 10 energy flux changing to as much as 25 for plunging breakers based on the air water gas transfer lamarre 1993 reported a series of experiments on air entrainment measurements by wave breaking lamarre and melville 1991 banner and peregrine 1993 provided fundamental research of velocity field and local geometry profile of plunging breakers in deep water duncan 2001 reviewed spilling breakers and studied the surface tension influence on wave breaking a systematic review of the overall process of wave breaking was given by perlin et al 2013 for an understanding of the breaking physical process in deep and intermediate water depth although wave steepness is a crucial and controllable geometry parameter for focused breaking waves few studies took it as control and consecutive variables to analyze different wave breaking criteria and other wave profiles under different wave breaking intensities the essential aim of this paper is to explore the applicability of three typical breaking criteria wave geometry profile kinematics and energy dissipations under different wave breaking intensities even for extreme steep breaking waves a analysis of breaking wave characteristics numerous studies have been performed to provide credible and accurate fundamental reviews on geometry profiles of wave breaking duncan et al 1999 summarized the crest profile evolution of the gentle spilling breakers with dispersive focusing mechanics tian et al 2010 conducted several experiments of unsteady plunging breakers and defined a local wave steepness to predict breaking onset on this basis tian et al 2012 adopted an eddy viscosity model for wave breaking simulations and got reasonable results with their measurements alagan chella et al 2015 analyzed the asymmetry profiles of breaking waves and found that the water depth has a significant influence on breaking type and other geometry properties the above studies include research of wave surface elevation and geometry profiles under different breaking types however the discussions of the geometry profile variation versus different breaking types and wave steepness are seldom mentioned the estimation of the velocity and kinematic field is crucial for the analysis of wave loads on structures grue et al 2003 defined a new reference fluid velocity profile by a third order monochromatic stokes wave beneath the wave surface for steep wave events in deep water lim et al 2015 gave a detailed description of the kinematic field and the variation of the velocity during plunging breaker occurring alberello and iafrati 2019 used the piv particle image velocimetry to capture the kinematic field during breaking na et al 2020 found that the maximum horizontal velocity reached 1 5 times wave phase speed after the onset of spilling breaking waves the comparison of velocity field under different breaking types and the further discussion of the velocity field evolution under extreme steep waves are still worth the time and efforts since the process of wave breaking is chaotic and has large energy transformation the turbulent profile and vorticity field were only mentioned on several lubin and glockner 2015 based on these previous studies the further and detailed analysis of wave characteristics and an quantical description of the breaking process versus different breaking intensity is a successively and orderly investigated b breaking criterion some researchers mentioned some parameters for prediction of wave breaking onsets banner and peregrine 1993 perlin et al 2013 and intensity tian et al 2010 song and banner 2002 the research carried out by bonmarin 1989 duncan and longuet higgins 1981 and ramberg and griffin 1987 were compared with the stokes theory geometry breaking limitation and found that the experimental limiting wave steepness at breaking incipient section is less than theoretical ones rapp et al 1990 proposed the definition of global wave steepness firstly tian et al 2010 used the spectrally weighted wavenumber k s instead of the wavenumber associated with the center frequency of wave group in rapp and melville s analysis and they found the breaking onset predictions using the global wave steepness based on their results stansell and macfarlane 2002 presented the influence of the estimation method of phase speed on predicting wave breaking onset and concluded that the ratio of the horizontal particle velocity and local wave phase speed exceed 1 u c p 1 at the incipient scenario is not a necessary condition for breaking in wu and nepf 2002 paper they summarized previous studies baldock et al 1996 stansell and macfarlane 2002 about the estimation method of the wave phase speed and pointed out that the propagation direction and bandwidth have an influence on the results when choosing different wave phase speed estimation method wu and nepf 2002 adopted the linear wave assumption with an error of 5 20 melville 1994 estimated the energy dissipation rate during breaking and found that the energy dissipation rate increases with the wave steepness in tian et al 2010 paper they found that the normalized energy dissipation closely correlates with global steepness and the wave group of large global steepness might result in larger energy dissipation lim et al 2015 carried out experiments in three dimensions and found that the wave direction had apparent effects on the geometric breaking criterion and had little effect on the kinematic criterion but they did not drawn conclusions on the dynamic criterion due to its dependency on the wave gauge locations wu and nepf 2002 used the proportion of the higher harmonic frequency energy band of the entire spectrum as the breaking dynamic criterion and found that the energy of the higher frequency band is sensitive to the choice of the reference location so the breaking criterion based on the estimation of the energy proportion of the higher frequency is not appropriate and credible to predict wave breaking compared with the geometry and kinematic criterion as summarized from the above literature a systematic analysis of the breaking parameter and breaking criteria including geometry kinematic and dynamics sections is necessary and complex work to achieve a systematic analysis we carried out a series of simulations of focused breaking waves with the constant steepness method to investigate wave characteristics as the variation of global wave steepness the numerical model and wave generation method are proposed in section 2 in section 3 we compare our results with the experimental data and validate the numerical model the analysis of the wave parameters and breaking criteria represent a clear framework of this study the discussion focuses on two subsection one is the wave characteristic analysis including geometry kinematic field and quantical description of breaking process another is the three typical breaking criteria finally in the conclusion section a summary of the wave profile versus the continued increase wave steepness is depicted 2 numerical method and wave tank setup 2 1 governing

eddy viscosity the details about the two phase flow model and numerical method used in this study are presented in appendix a part 2 2 numerical wave tank setup the numerical model is validated by simulating the experiments by tian and choi 2013 at kaist korea the experiments of two dimensional plunging breaking waves were carried out in a narrow wave tank which is 15 m long 1 5 m wide and has a water depth of 0 54 m the same setup conditions are adopted in a numerical two dimensional wave tank to reproduce the breaking waves in the experiment fig 1 depicts the wave tank setting according to the experimental physical setup the computational domain is 15 m long with a constant water depth of 0 54 m the total numerical wave tank height is 1 m including both air and water phases a relaxation zone of 2 m is located at the inlet boundary for wave generation and a numerical wave beach is located at the end of the bank with the length of 3 m to absorb wave and prevent wave reflection correspondingly to replicate the results the wave gauges are set at the same position as the experiments the wave gauges locates at x 2 84 m x 5 13 m x 7 04 m and x 9 07 m recorded as g 1 g 2 g 3 and g 4 in sequence two reference cases are set and reproduced as the same wave conditions as the experiments and wave groups df1 for the focused non breaking waves condition with global wave steepness as 0 25 and 0 57 for df2 the focused breaking wave case the predetermined focused time and location for these two cases are set based on tian s experiment tian and choi 2013 there are 128 sinusoidal wave components in the dispersive focusing wave groups with uniform frequency bands ranging from 1 0 hz to 2 4 hz spectral peak frequency and center frequency as f p 1 1 and f c 1 7 separately the global wave steepness is 0 25 for the non breaking wave group df1 and 0 57 for the breaking wave group df2 respectively the details of the wave parameters associated with the wave groups are list in table 3 in this study the global wave steepness is adjusted for each of the wave groups ranging from 0 25 to 0 75 with an interval of 0 05 that lead to both non breaking and breaking waves with different breaking types and strengths besides the reference case df2 the predetermined focused location and time are kept the same to analyze the effect of nonlinear amplitude on the focused mechanics the frequency bandwidth ratio f r a n g e f c was kept the same for all cases in this study previous research show that the global steepness is highly related to the breaking

the instant focused position and time for validation case df2 are 6 25 m and 23 55 s besides this case the focused position and time are set the same for other cases as 7 m and 25 s separately in this study in this study the classification of breaking type changing from non breaking wave incipient breaking condition spilling and plunging are defined according to a previous study of rapp et al 1990 the numerical domain is discretized using a 6345 443 rectangular mesh considered for the simulations the mesh domain is composed of the stretching zone and the uniform grid zone the base mesh is refined three times to obtain a finer grid size of 0 001 m near the free surface a constant cell size of 0 001 m is generated in the stretching zone of the length 2 0 m around the wave focused area in the x direction from 5 3 m to 7 3 m so that it can cover both non breaking spiller and plunger focusing location and propagation details to reduce the effect of aspect ratio the stretching grid around the wave focused area is kept as a square mesh with an aspect ratio of 1 the grid size in the uniform zone is 0 003 m the stretching zone in the vertical direction is the same for all cases with uniform grid size 0 001 m from 0 465 m to 0 615 m there is a short cross zone between the stretching zone and the outside uniform grid zone the distribution of the stretched grid near the free surface is illustrated in fig 2 2 3 focused wave generation there are several physical mechanisms inducing wave breaking in experiment and simulation studies energy dispersion focusing wind fetch wave current coupling and modulational instability may all introduce wave breaking in the simulation the pre determined energy focused wave is generated based on the constant wave steepness method in this paper linear superposition wave theory is adopted to generate focused waves in the spirit of this method the target focused wave are composed by individual sinusoidal harmonic waves with same wave steepness the first order focused wave theory is employed for the free surface defined as 5 η 1 i 1 n a i cos k i x ω i t ψ i where a i is the amplitude of i th wave component k i is the wavenumber ω i 2 π f i is the radian frequency and ψ i is the phase ω i and k i follow the dispersive relation as follows 6 ω i 2 g k i tanh k i d where d is water depth the phase angle ψ i is determined by setting cos k i

d sin h k i d sin θ i 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the relaxation zone method is employed for wave generation and absorption numerical beach for better wave quality and due to the better absorption of the wave at the end of tank and very little reflection mayer et al 1998 and jacobsen et al 2012 the analytical values of the velocities free surface and pressure based on first order wave theory are expressed by the relaxation function in the relaxation zone for wave generation at the outlet boundary the numerical beach another relaxation zone is set to absorb the incident waves and prevent unwanted reflections 11 f x a n a l y t i c a l γ x f t h e o r e t i c a l 1 γ x f c o m p u t a t i o n a l where f x can represent velocities free surface evolution and pressure at each point x of the relaxation zone and x is scaled to the length of the relaxation zone the length of the relaxation zone is usually taken with one wavelength for the numerical beach the relaxation method is employed in all cases with around two wavelengths the relaxation function in the relaxation zone and numerical beach used is expressed as follows 12 γ x 1 e x 3 5 1 e 1 f o r x 0 1 the top and two side boundaries of the computational domain are treated as symmetry plane where the free slip mixed boundary condition is applied the bottom of the nwt is regarded as a rigid wall and the law of the wall is applied at t 0 s the wave tank is initialized with u i 0 for both the air and water phases and the free surface keeps z 0 the pressure distribution in the whole domain is hydrostatic the level set function is reinitialized after each time step to maintain its signed distance property and to ensure mass conservation 2 5 breaking criteria three typical breaking criteria are introduced in this section including a geometric criterion b kinematic criterion and c dynamic criterion these three criteria are estimated based on the simulated wave profile and their performance in predicting wave breaking are described by the variation tendency between the corresponding predictional parameter and the increasing wave steepness the breaking criteria studied in this paper are specified and adopted in finite water depth the classification and definition of water depth over which the oscillation propagates have been summarized in table 1 2 5 1 geometric criterion 1 theoretical wave breaking criterion based on the connection between wave height h and wave period related parameter g t 2 ramberg and griffin 1987 presents that the ratio between these two parameters can be a breaking criterion this ratio usually was compared with theoretical limiting wave height h 0 027 g t 2 which is calculated based on the stokes limiting wavelength and second order relation between wavelength and period l 1 2 g t 2 fig 3 gives a concise definition of wave geometry parameters used in this paper 2 global wave steepness in this study we adopt the global wave steepness ɛ for the sake of consistency with our focused wave generation method the linear superimposed of the steepness of all the components is expressed as ɛ n a i k i and each wave component has the same wave steepness here n is the total wave components number k i is the wavenumber of i th component given by the linear dispersion relation and a i is the wave amplitude of each wave component 3 local wave geometric steepness and asymmetry there are many geometry parameters to describe the wave geometric steepness in the experiment of rapp et al 1990 they used two parameters the wave crest steepness α h c l and the measured local steepness h l to investigate the effect of bandwidth on wave breaking with low carrier steepness from their results it is insufficient to use the wave geometric parameters during the focusing onset process to estimate the type of breakers however the derivation of steepness can be a good predictable criterion wu and nepf 2002 introduced local steepness and asymmetry using four typical geometric parameters a the crest front steepness α h c l similar with the wave crest steepness in rapp s paper rapp et al 1990 b the crest near steepness δ h f l c the vertical asymmetry ψ l l d the horizontal asymmetry μ h c h tian et al 2010 adopted an another definition of local wave steepness ɛ b k b a n they pointed out that the local wave steepness is strongly related to the energy dissipation rate from the above studies we conclude that it is essential to compare and find a better indicator to predict the onset of wave breaking finally the local geometry parameters are taken into consideration and their sensitiveness with regard to characterizing breaking onset is analysis these geometry parameters are measured at the incipient time section just before the wave breaking as to the instability of the breaking process the incipient scenario is chosen when the wave crest front almost become vertical as shown in fig 4 2 5 2 kinematic breaking criterion the ratio of the maximum horizontal particle velocity u and the local phase speed of the crest propagation is the kinematic breaking indicator the breaking wave was predicted when u c p 1 longuet higgins 1969 the kinematic criterion analysis includes the determination of two parameters maximum horizontal water particle velocity and the local wave phase speed 13 u u 2 v 2 1 2 where u is the particle velocity component along in the x direction and v is the component transverse in the y direction a linear dispersion assumption is used for an acceptable estimation of the wave phase speed from the above studies we adopt the local wave speed definition as follows in eq 14 to calculate local phase speed c p 14 c p ω b k b the local angular frequency is calculated by ω b 2 π t t t where t t t is the time between two troughs around the crest of the wave gauge at the real focused position for the local wavenumber k b is computed from the local wave crest length defined in fig 3 k b π l c the incipient moment when the front crest is vertical to the free surface is selected to calculate the local wave number k b 2 5 3 dynamics breaking criterion as for the analysis above we adopt the energy dissipation rate as the dynamic breaking criterion parameter following the energy analysis of tian et al 2010 the total energy is estimated based on the wave elevation measurements at fixed spatial locations the linear theory energy flux is used to estimate the total energy as follows 15 e x t 1 n ρ g c g s η 2 x t where η x t is the surface elevation recorded by wave gauges and c g s is the spectrally weighted group velocity estimated from the wave elevation defined by drazen et al 2008 as 16 c g s c g n a n 2 δ f n a n 2 δ f n a n and c g n are the wave amplitude and linear group velocity of each wave component of the wave group respectively the group velocity c g n was measured by tracking the wave group maximum several wave gauges are probed to measure the surface elevation to evaluate the group envelope and the maxima δ f is the constant frequency difference between wave components based on the previous studies a parameter to describe the wave energy variation rate is proposed to investigate the energy dissipation and the relations between wave breaking the energy changing rates of focus and dissipation process are both estimated within a local wavelength l b 2 l c l c is the distance between two adjacent zero crossing points defined in fig 3 the energy variation rate is calculated as follows 17 r δ e l b c p where δ e is the energy variation values within a local wavelength l c this parameter can be assigned as δ e f and δ e d corresponding to the focusing and dissipation process separately the local wave phase speed c p calculated using eq 14 3 results and discussion in this section we present the comparison of the wave elevation both for non breaking and breaking cases between the numerical and experimental results to verify and validate the present numerical wave tank model based on the validation research the wave characteristics and three typical breaking criteria have been studied and analyzed 3 1 verification study in this part we provide verification of both focused non breaking and breaking wave cases with experimental results the validation of the numerical model is proved by comparing the numerical free surface elevation and the experimental results of the focused nonbreaking case df1 and breaking case df2 at four wave gauges four wave gauges are located at the computational domain in fig 1 the computational results are compared with the experimental data captured by the high speed imaging technology from the experiments carried out by tian and choi 2013 wave gauge recorded 35 s surface elevations for two cases df1 focused nonbreaking wave and df2 focused plunging breaking wave case are shown in figs 5 and 6 separately for the case of the nonbreaking waves the wave elevation of the simulation results agree with the experimental data almost perfectly in fig 5 the numerical wave elevation for plunging breaking waves also has a good agreement with the experimental data in fig 6 the numerical results can replicate the wave elevation the same as the experimental results for both before and after breaking scenarios since the focused wave is a strong nonlinear phenomenon and very sensitive to the prescribed focused position and time the good agreement of the wave elevation at different wave gauges along the wave tank indicates successful simulations of the focused breaking processes using the numerical model 3 2 wave characteristics analysis in the above section the numerical wave elevations agree with experimental results in different wave gauge for both non breaking and breaking wave cases the wave elevation has a abruptly rogue increasing around the focused position and shows irregular and nonlinear wave generation and propagation progress therefore it is significant to further study and analyze the wave characteristics of the focused breaking waves the purpose of this section is to analyze wave strong nonlinear profile kinematic field and the process of energy focusing and dissipation during the progress of wave focusing and breaking with different wave steepness 3 2 1 strong nonlinear characteristics of breaking waves the strong nonlinear profiles of the focused breaking waves were not only performed by local geometric parameters but also indicated by the difference between the setting focused position x f and time section t f and real focused position x f and time instant t f the differences between the presetting focused position as well as time and real results are defined as x r f and t r f the variation of x r f and t r f versus the increase of global wave steepness is shown in fig 7 the variation of focused positions can be roughly approximated as a piecewise function having a linear monotonic profile of each segmentation the abruptly shifted variation values of the second demarcation point with ɛ ranging 0 6 0 65 is larger than that of the first shift with ɛ changing 0 3 to 0 35 for the first segmentation the focused position moved downstream as a linear trend from the setting position and shifted upstream abruptly at 0 35 global steepness the second and third demarcations follow this changing trend and the focused position moved downstream relative to the shifted demarcation point it is proved that the position of wave energy focusing varies nonlinearly when the input focused position keeps as a fixed value rapp rapp et al 1990 also analyzed the changing of the focused position in their study and had similar results with our study compared with the changing of the focused position the real focused time in fig 7 b almost follows the changing trend of the focused position in fig 7 a different from the linear changing after abrupt shifts of the focused position the focused time almost keeps constant after the demarcation point the abrupt shift of time and position is related to the energy changing during the focused process and it is revealed by the wave surface elevation of the focused waves in fig 8 the color curves in fig 8 are the wave surface elevation with different time sections the time interval for the wave surface capture is 0 02 s wave surface elevations are plotted by connecting surface points recorded with a constant distance interval as 0 003 m in x direction the black dotted lines in each figure respect the wave surface elevation at the focused section the wave surface elevations of the all time section are composed of the wave envelope which has a fair external contour the existence of the wave packet also suggests the quantities and position of energy and amplitude focused in fig 8 the wave focused with the swell wave packet several swell wave packets with relative lower amplitude near the focused wave packet where have the maximum wave amplitude from figs 8 a to 8 b the focused position moved from the middle wave packet to the position of the first wave packet which also corresponds to the first demarcation where the focused position shifted abruptly the focused wave keeps at first wave packet even for global steepness as 0 4 and 0 45 in figs 8 c and 8 d corresponding to spilling and plunging breaker separately as the increase of the global wave steepness the amplitude increases not only for the focused wave packet but also wave packets near it in fig 8 e the difference of the amplitude between the neighbor wave packet and the focused packet is very smaller with the global steepness of 0 6 it also proves the energy and amplitude increase of the wave packet near the focused wave packet the focused wave packet in fig 8 e and the upstream wave packet combine with each other and form a new wave packet with higher amplitude when the global steepness rises to 0 7 this suggests that the energy and amplitude of the focused wave packet and the neighbor packet rise at the same time with the increase of global wave steepness when the amplitude of the neighbor packet is near the value of the focused wave packet the focused position will have an abrupt shift as the increase of steepness and input energy so it can be summarized that the changing of the focused position is due to the energy focusing and distribution mechanism the energy focusing process also has a strong nonlinear profile the overturning process is another typical strong nonlinear phenomenon for the plunging breaking wave the overturning jet brings an entrained air cavity during the process of first curling and splash up new 1983 proposed an applied mathematical model to describe the front crest overturning phenomenon a certain region of the front surface beneath the overturning crest can be well approximated by an ellipse based on this indication the more wave develops the more accuracy the underside cavity of the breaking crest becomes to a 3 aspect ratio ellipses bonmarin 1989 did a comparison between their experimental results and new 1983 mathematical solution and got a good agreement to analyze the variation of air cavity beneath the first splash up overturning jet the scenario shown in fig 9 when the first overturning jet penetrates into the free surface is selected to calculate the area of the best fitted ellipses on these observed profiles the selected ellipse satisfied the requirement of along the largest portion underneath the overturning jet a successive approximation determines an accuracy fitness so the axes ratio of the fitness ellipse in fig 9 is around 3 in the theory of new 1983 the area of the air cavity denoted as a e beneath the overturning jet versus the global steepness is shown in fig 10 the area of the air cavity is roughly a linear function of global steepness ɛ for our wave groups it is found that a e 5 35 ɛ this indicates that wave groups of relatively large wave steepness increase in the area of the air cavity beneath the overturning front jet more area of air cavity means more strong mixing of the air and water after breaking of large wave steepness an increase of the front cavity reflects the wave falling crest height of breaking waves rises the area of the air cavity can also be a rough indicator to calculate and analyze the air entrainment and air water mixing intensity after wave breaking 3 2 2 velocity field analysis the vertical velocity fields beneath the crest surface at the incipient scenario are shown in fig 11 the velocity rises exponentially in the vertical direction and has maximum values at the wave crest the curvature of velocity distributions for different global wave steepness is different from each other waves with larger steepness correspond to having a more curving velocity distribution from this distribution the maximum velocity exists around the wave crest so the maximum horizontal velocity is picked up near the crest for kinematic criterion analysis fig 12 shows the evolution of the horizontal velocity field of the spilling breaking process the velocity is an oriented arrow to the direction of particle velocity and is scaled by the values of horizontal velocity four typical breaking scenario is selected and shown in fig 12 the green dots in each figure is the location of the maximum velocity of the present time section the position of the green dot is always located at the top of the crest or the front of the ejecting jet which indicates that the location of the maximum velocity occurs the incipient scenario when the crest front surface is vertical relative to the water level is shown in fig 12 a local maximum velocity is u m a x 0 86 c p at the incipient section in fig 12 a the particle velocity at the crest exceeds the front wave surface and backward wave face which will compress the front wave face and stretch the backward wave face resulting in a breaking jet in fig 12 b compared with the plunging breaking wave with a large plunging tongue at the front crest jet the spilling breakers show a smaller ejecting jet at the top of the crest in fig 12 b the maximum velocity occurs at the splash up section in fig 12 c of the entire spilling breaker process with a magnitude of 1 2 c p after a weak splash up the crest jet falls to the front surface mixing with entrainment air and swells forward in fig 12 d after splash up the values of maximum velocity decrease apparently and the water surface pushed upward velocity fields of the plunging breaking wave are depicted in fig 13 the maximum velocity at the incipient section in fig 13 a is u m 0 936 c p which is larger than that for spilling breakers a large air cavity is generated by the first rolling continuing to curl and moving forward the maximum velocity particle is located at the plunging tongue for the entire overturning process such as the scenario in fig 13 b after the fully rolling and development the overturning water jet falls and impinges on the front wave trough surface in fig 13 c the scenario in fig 13 c is defined as impingement and has maximum local velocity along this plunging breaking process as u m a x 1 31 c p a splash up is generated by the strong impingement of the falling jets in fig 13 d and the maximum velocity at this moment is smaller than that in the impingement scenario in fig 13 c the maximum of the horizontal particle velocity increases when the splash up developed as second clockwise rolling in fig 13 e the maximum particle velocity arrived u m a x 1 18 c p just below the values of impingement moment a backward counterclockwise rolling is generated and develops as a negative impingement between the first clockwise impingement and the second rolling in fig 13 f this phenomenon is also captured by lim et al 2015 and defined as backward impingement in their research an air cavity generated by first penetrating rolling exists under the free surface two clockwise and one backward impingement formed an irregular triangular packet which was called as surface zone and ascending crest of the breaking waves in lim et al 2015 and nadaoka et al 1989 after these overturning and mixing of the plunging breakers the focused wave energy dissipates and the maximum velocity decreases apparently at this moment the variation of the maximum horizontal velocity for different global wave steepness is introduced in fig 20 it will have more detail and direct understanding of the umax changing during the entire breaking process 3 2 3 qualitative description of breaking process and turbulence structure the profile of the vorticity distribution is very similar to the turbulence intensity lim et al 2015 fig 14 shows the evolution of vorticity and turbulence structures distributions during strong plunging breakers for global steepness 0 7 with the free surface as boundaries the turbulent structures on both air and water are displayed contoured by the magnitude of the vorticity field the motion of the free surface generates chaotic turbulent structures around the free surface in both air and water phases concentrate negative vorticities existed above the breaking crest in the air phase at each breaking moment selected in fig 14 at the incipient moment in fig 14 a two pairs of vorticities locate at the front trough and stretch backward surface separately in the air phase as the forward motion of the breaking crest the vorticities existing in pairs at the backward of the breaking crest have a negative rolling over around the surface from the incipient moment 22 4 s to 23 04 s in fig 14 h the vorticities existing in pair at the front trough in fig 14 a always keep a distance of the wave surface and move from the front of the breaking crest to the back as the breaking wave propagates before the incipient moment in fig 14 a the vorticity field is almost irrotational beneath the wave surface which is similar to the laboratory results of perlin et al 1996 as the development of the breaking crest overturning and plunging forward in fig 14 b a relatively larger positive vorticity field is generated below the rolling crest and has a maximum value at the turning point of the splash up cycle after the first overturning crest penetrating into the wavefront surface the potential energy has been transformed into kinematic and turbulent energy this energy transformation not only gets an increase of the horizontal particle velocity but also leads to the formation of large vortices under the wave surface in fig 14 c the energy dissipation due to wave breaking is the source of the energy for turbulent mixing around the wave surface and air entrainment these energy transformations adjust the air water energy exchanging and enhance the vortex propagation underwater air is entrapped into wave surface and the air entrainment phenomenon has been generated another splash up is also generated and has maximum vorticities after the energy transformation as the effect of inertial force the first plunging impingement continues to roll forward and downward arousing a rising water volume between the entrapped air and second plunging jet in fig 14 e the negative rolling generated between the first air water mixing clouds and second rolling in fig 14 e is defined as first negative rolling this negative vorticity has been developed when the second plunging jet penetrated into the front surface and generated another air entrapped in fig 14 f after the negative rolling impinging into backward and combining with the first air entrapped collapsed bubble clouds and chaotic mixing vortex fields are generated in fig 14 g the second negative vorticity develops between the third positive rolling and second air entrainment in fig 14 g the third splash up rolling and spilling forward dissipates the last energy of the breaking waves in fig 14 h the turbulence intensity of this mixing air water clouds flow decreases with the development of the breaking process and the wave surface tend to smooth after these breaking processes in fig 14 at the same time the vorticity field has a more chaotic and complex profile the complex clockwise and counterclockwise vorticities generated during the breaking process are the main sources of turbulent kinematic energy dissipation 3 3 breaking criteria the above analysis of wave characteristics give an insight view of focused breaking waves besides the prediction of the onset of wave breaking is another crucial point for the understanding of wave breaking in the present section we adopted three typical breaking criteria to predict the focused wave breaking onset under infinite water depth 3 3 1 geometric breaking criterion a stokes breaking limitation the stokes theoretical breaking limiting as the typical breaking criterion is analyzed in this section the relations between wave height h and the period parameter g t 2 of the present results are shown in fig 15 the present limiting wave steepness at breaking inception is less than the stokes limitation h 0 027 g t 2 which is consistent with the previous studies conducted by duncan and longuet higgins 1981 and bonmarin 1989 in fig 15 as for the analysis of breaking criterion it should be noted here that despite the different generation methods of the breaking waves plunger and spilling breakers appear to have qualitatively similar properties bonmarin also pointed out that the breaking coefficient σ h g t 2 depends on the breaker type although the highest values may be typically associated with plunging breakers the author does not think the correlation is sufficient to mark the coefficient as a breaker classification parameter as for the assumption and foundation the relations between the breaking coefficient and global steepness are shown in fig 16 the present results show clearly a linear function trend between breaking coefficient σ and global steepness ɛ as for the simulation results in this study it is spilling breakers when global wave steepness is 0 4 and plungers for 0 45 global steepness so in fig 16 the value of σ as 0 015 could be a classification threshold of the breaking type in this study with the increase of the global steepness the breaking coefficient will have a linear increase with the slope value of 0 0246 it is also consistent with bonmarin s bonmarin 1989 conclusion that higher values of breaking coefficient σ are the rougher breaking waves are b global wave steepness for focused waves wave crest height as the typical wave geometric parameter reflects the amplitude focusing and the energy collection mechanism for focused waves when the wave crest reached a threshold value and arrived at the breaking criterion a steep wave crest exists and breaking takes place the maximum amplitude of the focused wave a m a x along the increased global wave steepness is shown in fig 17 the primary wave parameters and breaking classification information are summarized in table 3 spilling breakers s occur when global wave steepness reached 0 4 and plunging breakers p happen with 0 45 steepness n respects the nonbreaking profile and i corresponds to the incipient section in table 3 the corresponding focused and breaking profiles of each case have been marked in fig 17 for better understanding for the analysis of the geometric criterion parameter global wave steepness as the global steepness increases the maximum wave amplitude shows a curve increasing rate after the focused wave arrived at the plunging profile the increasing rate of the maximum amplitude show a linear trend the focused waves generate different wave focus and breaking intensity as the increase of global steepness it also indicates that the global steepness as a geometric criterion parameter can give a good prediction of the incipient and breaking section the comparison of the global wave steepness under different experiment settings and focused wave generation mechanics are collected and summarized in table 2 the focused wave generated by the constant steepness spectra is selected the wave steepness a i k i is same for each wave component in lamarre experiment lamarre 1993 which is similar to the calculational method of the amplitude and frequency of each sinusoidal component in this simulation the value of global wave steepness corresponding to different breaking sections and types are the same as the results of lamarre lamarre 1993 a higher threshold value of global steepness with the constant steepness spectra studied by kway et al 1998 under low frequency ranging from 0 56 hz to 1 1 hz compared with the values of this criterion under a relative high frequency wave energy with low frequency is more stable and has higher global wave steepness when generating breaking besides it is also clear that this criterion is also influenced by the dimension and wave direction by comparing different dimensions results of wu and nepf 2002 this suggests that the wave energy distribution is not only related to the local wave energy collection in wave propagation direction but also has a relative amount of energy dissipating in three dimensions although the threshold of the global wave steepness have relative difference between different experiment and numerical studies this criterion has a good prediction of wave breaking in each research the influence of the setting wave parameter on the threshold values of this criterion still need further study and analysis c local wave steepness and asymmetry parameters fig 18 shows the crest front steepness α the crest rear steepness δ the horizontal asymmetry factor ψ and the vertical asymmetry factor μ distribution versus the global wave steepness ɛ it appears that these local geometric parameters increase for waves with larger global wave steepness the distribution of the crest front steepness α shows a roughly linear trend along with the variation of global steepness in fig 18 a the linear fitness of the front steepness α shows a good prediction of unique breaking incipient cases for the simulation wave groups varying with different global wave steepness the linear relation between α and ɛ fit α 1 1665 ɛ this implies that the focused wave of relatively large setting wave steepness has a more steep front crest it also corresponds to the increased particle velocity and energy around the front crest of the breaking waves with large global steepness which may change the amount of energy focusing and dissipation during the breaking process it also indicates that the breaking process becomes more vigorous and has a strong irregular profile compared with the crest front steepness α the crest rear steepness δ has a relatively smaller changing range and linear fitness slope 0 2335 versus ɛ in fig 18 b therefore crest rear steepness is not a good indicator for predicting different wave breaking sections in addition the asymmetry parameter vertical factor ψ and the horizontal factor μ are insufficient to predict wave breaking as well as seen in figs 18 c and 18 d the trend of the vertical asymmetry factor versus global wave steepness shows a relative discrete distribution compared to an increasing linear fitness this suggests that the focused wave shows a relative focused axis symmetry profile before the incipient breaking section then the breaking wave generated by constant steepness focused mechanism has a larger backward wave length l almost equaling to 2 times of front wave length l with large wave steepness this is an opposite phenomenon compared with the breaking waves induced by the decrease of water depth which has been studied by alagan chella et al 2015 in their study the vertical asymmetry factor shows a decrease trend when the wave steepness factor h 0 l 0 becomes larger with a beginning values as 3 6 and ended with 2 1 besides these local steepness and asymmetry parameters a local wave steepness ɛ b k b a n prior to wave breaking was introduced by tian et al 2010 a similar result with experiment of tian et al 2010 for a linear function between global wave steepness ɛ and local wave steepness ɛ b has been achieved shown in fig 19 the linear fitness function is ɛ b 1 12 ɛ although the formula and geometric meaning of ɛ b and crest front steepness α are different the same indication that local wave steepness increase with large global wave steepness has arrived it also proves the breaking crest can contain more energy and have a strong nonlinear profile with large global wave steepness this factor also can be a good indicator to predict the unique wave breaking section 3 3 2 kinematic breaking criterion the kinematic breaking criterion ratios u c p are calculated using eqs 9 and 13 and shown as blue solid lines in fig 20 for all cases with different global wave steepness the typical kinematic breaking criterion u c p 1 as a threshold value is plotted as a dashed line the time axis is initialized by the real focused time section t f for the spilling and plunging breakers the scenario for t f is selected when the front wave crest is vertical relative to the water level in fig 4 the maximum value of ratio u c p increase apparently for the nonbreaking waves with global wave steepness changing from 0 25 to 0 35 the kinematic energy rises and collects with the increase of global steepness the maximum of the ratio u c p just below 1 for the incipient non breaking case w g 2 with ɛ 0 35 the breaking phenomenon does not occur until u c p 1 when global steepness ɛ 0 40 in fig 20 when ɛ 0 4 a spilling breakers occurs the ratio u c p only has one maximum amplitude values and a regular variation intervals above 1 when ɛ is 0 45 the interval above the threshold value has two extreme values corresponding to the maximum particle velocity at impingement scenario and that at the second rolling section in figs 13 c and 13 e separately it suggests that the velocity decrease apparently after the second rolling and impingement the variation of the ratio of maximum particle velocity and local wave phase speed also provides another view of the kinematic energy changing during each breaking process the intervals when the ratio u c p above 1 for the spilling breaking process in fig 20d is shorter than that for plunging breakers with ɛ 0 45 in fig 20e this implies that the spilling breakers have a shorter breaking process compared with the plunging breakers from the length of the time interval when the ratio u c p above 1 and ratio elevation exceeding the threshold value 1 the spilling and plunging breakers have an apparent difference between each other so these two parameters may be an indicator to reveal the breaking type the above phenomenons demonstrate that the kinematic breaking ratio not only predicts the breaking but also has functions to distinguish the variation of the breaking type and intensity the kinematic breaking ratio u c p keeps a time interval with an oscillation variation when its values exceed 1 for cases ɛ 0 45 these oscillations are related to the curling and penetrating phenomena during the breaking process the kinematic breaking criterion satisfied u c p 1 for all breaking cases in this study the kinematic breaking ratio u c p at the time section has different values for different global wave steepness in fig 20 this indicator gives a good prediction of wave breaking and reflects the breaking intensity from some characteristics the variation of the maximum particle velocity with the increase of global steepness ɛ at the incipient breaking moment is shown in fig 21 as the global wave steepness increases the ratio u c p shows a nonlinear increasing tendency this phenomenon has a similar conclusion in stansell and macfarlane 2002 that u c p 1 is not an essential requirement for wave breaking it is found that the distribution of u c p versus ɛ satisfies a cubic polynomial curve fitting this implies a nonlinear relation between horizontal particle velocity and the global wave steepness a focused wave group of relatively larger global wave steepness will have bigger horizontal particle velocity around the crest which might lead to more violent wave breaking thus resulting in more kinematic energy dissipation and rough breaking mixing around the free surface the nonlinear relation also suggests that only using the values of u c p at a certain time section does not show a good prediction of wave breaking however the existence of the time interval when u c p shown in fig 20 can be a breaking criterion and the length of this interval is highly correlated with the breaking type and intensity as can be seen in fig 22 the maximum horizontal velocity occurs at the impingement moment when the breaking crest penetrates the wave surface with a magnitude at a range from 1 3 c p to 2 5 c p as the increase of wave global steepness after impingement of the overturning crest there is a smaller decrease of the ratio u c p for the first splash up moment beside the results when ɛ 0 7 it is also indicated that strong nonlinear kinematic energy dissipation occurs for larger global wave steepness the ratio u c p during the breaking process after the incipient moment shows a rough separating chunk at ɛ 0 6 and the values of u c p show an abrupt increase no matter at which breaking moment global steepness as 0 6 is also a segmentation point for the focused position and time in figs 7 a and 7 b these phenomena prove that the velocity variation has the same abrupt shifting during the breaking as the increase of global wave steepness the energy focusing mechanism is the basic reason for these strong nonlinear generations 3 3 3 energy dissipation analysis and dynamic criterion wave breaking inhibits wave propagation reversal symmetry of focused nonbreaking waves alberello et al 2018 it also means that the focused breaking waves have a distinct asymmetry profile of the focusing and defocusing processes the asymmetric profile is not only reflected from the geometry characteristics but also exists on the energy focus and dissipation process the evolution of total energy along wave tank has been shown in fig 23 the values in the x direction have been normalized by the real focused position x f of each case and local crest wavelength l c the total energy has the maximum value when x x f l c 0 for a clear view of the total energy profile the results of all cases have been separated and depicted in two figures in fig 23 the maximum values of the total energy e x rise significantly as the increase of global wave steepness which proves that the focused waves with larger wave steepness will collect more wave energy before breaking energy distribution of nonbreaking waves with steepness as 0 25 and 0 30 shows a relative symmetric profile taking the focused position as the symmetry axis in fig 23 a when the global steepness is 0 35 the asymmetric profile of the focusing and defocusing process has been revealed the overall change trends of total energy e x on both sides of the focused position show asymmetric profiles especially for the cases of breaking waves when the global steepness is bigger than 0 35 the total energy at each position along the wave tank has larger values for steeper wave beside the incipient wave case with ɛ 0 35 when ɛ 0 6 as for the extreme steep waves when the global wave steepness ɛ 0 6 the energy increasing trend disturbs this phenomenon and shows more chaotic evolutions for the dissipation process in fig 23 b this suggests that the wave energy and dissipation processes are more unsteady and have strong nonlinear profiles for extreme steep waves with the large global wave steepness the sketch definition of parameters for calculating the energy changing rate is depicted in fig 24 the energy spatial distribution of case wg5 ɛ 0 5 is taken as an example for the energy parameter definition the variations of the energy within one local wavelength l b 2 l c for the focusing and dissipation processes are defined as δ e f and δ e d separately the variation of energy changing rate r within one local wavelength versus global wave steepness is shown in fig 25 the energy focusing rate is f r a t e assigned as red circles and the dissipation rate is d r a t e marked as blue squares in fig 25 the focusing energy rate f r a t e and energy dissipation rate d r a t e both satisfy the linear function as the increase of global wave steepness the phenomenon of the increasing trend of energy dissipation rate versus increased global steepness is similar to the conclusion in melville 1994 the focused waves with steeper wave slopes not only collect more energy but also have a larger energy changing rate r the slopes of these two linear functions of the energy changing rate r are different which also proved the asymmetric profile of the breaking process the linear fitness distribution suggests that the energy focusing and dissipation rate can both be good breaking indicators if using the focusing energy rate as the dynamic breaking criterion the threshold for the spilling breaking is around 9 j s however if it changed as dissipation energy rate this value turns to 10 7 j s the ratio of slopes of linear fitness function of two energy changing processes is around 0 79 which is also plotted by fitting the ratio of f r a t e d r a t e corresponding to each global steepness the constant value of f r a t e d r a t e indicates that the focusing energy and the energy focusing rate determine the energy dissipation rate to a certain extent 4 conclusions the simulations of focused breaking waves with different breaking intensity have been performed in a two phase numerical wave tank by solving the navier stokes equations together with the level set method and the large eddy simulation turbulent model the constant wave steepness method was employed to generate the focused breaking waves to study the variation of the wave geometry parameters velocity and vorticity field and the energy dissipation with different wave global steepness different wave breaking criteria were examined since the different breaking profiles and types were carried out with a large range of global wave steepness ɛ the comparison of the wave elevation between the simulation and experimental results indicates that the numerical model can provide accurate and reliable simulation results the detailed breaking profiles provided by the present numerical model is consistent with previous studies and give more insight views and understanding of the breaking process such as maximum velocity distribution the generation and existence of the clockwise vortex and counterclockwise vortex the air water chaotic mixing phenomenon and variation of turbulent intensity the focused position and time show a piecewise function as the increase of global steepness the wave surface elevation envelope gives a reasonable explanation of the regular motion of the real focused position x f and focused time t f as the increase of the global steepness not only the amplitude of the focused position increased but also the neighbor wave envelope the segmented variation of the focused position is due to the energy distribution method around the focused position when the energy reached a balance between the focused wave envelope and the neighbors the focused position will move upstreams abruptly as another strong nonlinear element of the wave breaking the air cavity under the impingement crest has been approximated by a 3 aspect ratio ellipse and the area of the air cavity shows a linear function of the global wave steepness it also indicates that the breaking wave with large global steepness can carry and plunge more air into water and cause more chaotic air water mixing the horizontal velocity has the maximum values during the breaking process at the impingement moment for each plunging breaking case the vorticity field experienced a profile changing from simple to complex and chaotic during the breaking process a counterclockwise vortex is generated between two positive vortexes rolling the wave breaking process may have a continued plunging process inducing more air water mixing and energy dissipation the generation of the vortexes and air water mixing is the source of the turbulence kinetic energy dissipation as the breaking crest propagates the turbulence intensity increases at first and then decreases and gets a maximum value at the first splash up scenario moment three types of geometry parameters including stokes breaking limitation global wave steepness and local wave parameters were calculated for geometry breaking criterion analysis the breaking coefficient σ which may depend on the breaker type shows a linear functional relationship with the global wave steepness ɛ σ 0 015 could be a classification threshold of spilling and plunging breakers in this study the global wave steepness as a typical geometry wave shape parameter has proved to be a stable and credible criterion to predict wave breaking the threshold values of global wave steepness corresponding to different breaking profiles such as incipient spilling and plunging breaker are in good agreement with the experimental results of lamarre 1993 as for the local steepness parameters the linear fitness trend of crest front steepness shows a relatively good prediction of wave breaking the distributions of the other three local geometry parameters are relatively dispersed and irregular and inappropriate as breaking criteria the local steepness ɛ b estimated by the local wave geometry profile shows a linear functional relationship with the global wave steepness ɛ b 1 12 ɛ from the above summaries the global steepness as a pre established and controllable geometry parameter is a credible and practical criterion for wave breaking prediction the kinematic breaking ratio u c p gives a good prediction of wave breaking and satisfies the kinematic breaking criterion u c p 1 in the present study the breaking ratio has a time interval satisfying the breaking criterion u c p 1 the time interval when u c p 1 is different between the spilling and plunging breakers the length of this time interval is related to the breaking type and intensity so it may be an indicator to predict the breaking type the breaking ratio at the incipient breaking scenario shows a cubic polynomial curve fitting versus global wave steepness and the breaking ratio exists u c p 1 at the incipient section for some breaking cases until ɛ 0 5 so it proved that only using the values of breaking ratio at the incipient section as a judgment to predict wave breaking is not an accurate and sufficient method and criterion the variation of the total energy along the x direction shows an apparent increasing trend as the increase of global wave steepness the energy changing rate r defined by one local wavelength has been proposed and used as the dynamic breaking criterion the energy changing rate r shows a linear function with the global wave steepness both for the focused and dissipation process compared with the previous dynamic breaking criterion which depends too much on wave probe location for energy estimation the energy changing rate could be a good breaking indicator the threshold of the energy focusing rate f r a t e and dissipation rate d r a t e for the spilling breaking are 9 j s and 10 7 j

surface γ moved by the correct velocity field in eq 18 ϕ may lose its properties as a distance signed function at a new time step thus to maintain its properties and ensure the mass conservation the reinitialization of the level set function is required after each time step 20 ϕ t s ϕ ϕ 1 0 here s ϕ is the smoothed sign function peng et al 1999 defined as s ϕ ϕ ϕ 2 ϕ ɛ 2 to overcome the

determined at the cell faces to get a more stable and accurate solution bihs et al 2016 a 2 numerical method the governing equations depicted above eqs 1 and 3 are solved with the application of the level set method and les turbulence model on a finite difference framework a staggered rectilinear cartesian grid is used in the two phase flow model for the high order spatial discretization schemes a fifth order accurate weighted essentially non oscillatory weno scheme jiang and shu 1996 is adopted for the spatial discretization of convection terms in the non uniform grid the second order accurate central differences are applied for discretion the diffusion terms the time derivatives in eqs 3 and 18 are discretized by an accurate third order total variation diminishing tvd runge kutta explicit time scheme developed by harten shu and osher 1988 in this study an adaptive time step is selected based on the cfl number when the cfl number is below 1 this time scheme shows good numerical stability and provides a high order of temporal accuracy the time stepping method balances the stability of simulation and the requirement of the computational cost according to velocity diffusion and the source term s the time step size δ t c f l can be defined as follows 24 δ t c f l 2 u m a x d x ν e f f δ δ u m a x d x ν e f f δ δ 2 4 s m a x d x 1 where s is the source term u m a x u m a x 2 v

adjusted with the value of 0 1 δ t c f l during the simulation the pressure gradient is modeled by projection method chorin 1968 for incompressible flow on the staggered grid the momentum equation is solved explicitly without the pressure gradient term and the updated velocity after each time step is the predicted velocity u i the predicted velocity u i will be inserted into the poisson equation

breaking wave case df2 with the grid size of d x 0 005 m 0 003 m the stretching grid from 0 003 m to 0 001 m and 0 001 m fig 26 presents the comparison of the wave surface elevation at the focused position with different grid sizes the real focused point for case df1 and df2 are 7 1 m and 6 2 m respectively the results in fig 26 a show that the numerical values for the wave elevation at stretching grid and d x 0 001 m are similar to each other compared to the results at grid size d x 0 005 m and d x 0 003 m fig 26 b shows the wave elevation at the focused point for case df2 converge for the stretching grid the focused wave crest height is used to calculate the grid convergence ratio stern et al 2001 the grid convergence ratio defined as r d m f d c m where d m f is the difference of the crest values between the medium and fine grids and d c m respect the varies between the coarse and medium grids the grid size 0 003 m stretching grid from 0 003 m to 0 001 m and 0 001 m are selected as coarse medium and fine grids respectively a convergence ratio of r 0 2 is obtained for case df1 and r 0 12 for case df2 both these two values are within the range of the monotonic convergency for r and indicate that the selected grid size satisfies the convergency study the overturning processes for the steep breaking waves with global wave steepness as 0 7 simulated with stretching grid with a total of grid number 2 8 million grids and the fine grid d x 0 001 m with a total of 15 million are presented in figs 27 a and 27 b respectively the high resolution simulation not only provides details on the front overturning crest kinematic feature but also captures the flow profile of the back of the splash up the stretching grid captures similar details like the high resolution simulation around the front of the splash up overturning for the breaking wave the front of the splash up has more significance in wave structure interaction so there is no significant improvement in the results for the wave breaking details when the grid size is refined from stretching grid to d x 0 001 m from the grid convergence study the stretching grid is accurate for both no breaking and breaking cases so the stretching grid is selected for simulation cases in this study 
23818,we updated the estimated state of the global ocean for climate research estoc a long term ocean state estimation dataset that includes physical and biogeochemical fields the physical field is optimized through a data synthesis experiment using a quasi global four dimensional variational data assimilation system and under the optimized physical field the biogeochemical field is optimized by using a green s function to improve the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in the model we implemented tidally induced turbulent mixing schemes and geothermal heat flux this paper provides an overview of the assimilation system with an emphasis on updated elements and including details of the mixing schemes and presents preliminary results focusing on the warming in the abyssal ocean below 3000 m using this updated estoc published as version 04a the reproduction of both the climatological state and temporal change in abyssal water properties is on the whole improved in this updated estoc in comparison with a previous version this improved reproduction of the abyssal ocean state with the refined physical processes that play major roles in determining abyssal water properties makes our new synthesized dataset valuable at least for understanding the abyssal ocean in this updated estoc the abyssal water warming results from a near steady imbalance between the heating effect due to vertical diffusion and geothermal flux and the cooling effect by advection and horizontal diffusion in the north pacific suggesting that the warming occurs over a long timescale we also show that the downward heat flux related to bottom intensified vertical mixing near the generation site of the internal tide plays an important role in determining the improved distribution of abyssal water warming in the pacific ocean these results suggest the importance of using knowledge of vertical mixing as a priori information in ocean state estimation keywords ocean state estimation data assimilation tide vertical mixing geothermal heating abyssal water 1 introduction oceans absorb large amounts of heat and dissolved gases such as co2 and are thought to play a central role in stabilizing earth s climate system therefore it is important to understand this role and the dynamics controlling it to better assess the present climate state and enhance the accuracy of climate prediction however it is challenging to derive the essential dynamics on climate timescales of years to decades based solely on observations that include variability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales from eddy to gyre scale circulation given this background much effort has been devoted to ocean state estimation a synthesis of observations through a data assimilation approach that brings an ocean general circulation model ogcm into consistency with diverse observations e g wunsch and heimbach 2013 an important role of oceans is the absorption of excess heat accumulated in the earth system the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 reported that oceans have absorbed over 90 of the excess heat over the past few decades with more than 7 absorbed by the deep ocean 2000 m depth ipcc 2021 modern high quality full depth hydrographic section observations repeated at decadal intervals and the recently developed deep argo have revealed the occurrence of warming near the bottom of many basins e g desbruyères et al 2016 fukasawa et al 2004 johnson and doney 2006 johnson et al 2007 2008 2019 kawano et al 2006 purkey and johnson 2010 purkey et al 2019 by compiling those hydrographic section data kouketsu et al 2011 estimated decadal rates of temperature change from the 1990s to 2000s in the abyssal layer below 3000 m water depth to the bottom and showed that whereas the temperature increase was especially large around antarctica modest but basin wide warming occurred even in the pacific ocean where formation of deep and bottom water does not occur those authors estimated that the increase in abyssal heat content in the pacific was second only to that in the southern ocean when integrated over each basin this finding highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that cause temporal variations in ocean temperature through the entire water column across the global ocean including the abyssal pacific ocean when assessing the present climate state vertical turbulence mixing is one of the most important physical processes controlling water mass formation and ocean circulation including global moc munk and wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 therefore the nature and physics of mixing have been actively studied e g mackinnon et al 2017 as moc is closely related to the properties and distribution of the abyssal water vertical mixing should be a key element in reproducing a realistic abyssal ocean state in an ogcm application of existing knowledge of mixing should prove valuable to the improved estimation of ocean state in this study we focus on vertical mixing below the surface mixed layer in the open ocean which we refer to as interior vertical mixing this mixing is related largely to the breaking of internal waves the main sources of which are tides and winds mackinnon et al 2013 barotropic tidal currents generate internal waves when flowing over topographic obstacles and these waves are termed internal tides a part of the internal tides causes vertical mixing near their generation site owing to direct breaking of internal waves and enhanced rates of interaction with other internal waves and the rest propagates over greater distances and causes vertical mixing through various mechanisms such as a cascade to smaller scales through wave wave interactions in this study these two types of mixing are referred to as near field mixing nfm and far field mixing ffm respectively as the breaking of internal waves occurs on scales too small to be resolved explicitly in ogcms vertical mixing needs to be parameterized in ogcms various schemes for vertical mixing have been proposed on the basis of knowledge about mixing derived from observations theories and numerical simulations the distribution of the rate of conversion from barotropic to internal tidal energy can be estimated using tidal models and satellite observations of sea surface height e g jayne and st laurent 2001 using this distribution dynamically based parameterization for nfm was first proposed by st laurent et al 2002 this type of nfm scheme in some cases in a modified form is now widely used in ogcms and climate models e g jayne 2009 oka and niwa 2013 first incorporated an ffm scheme into an ogcm by extending the approach employed in the nfm scheme those authors demonstrated that the simulated moc and radiocarbon distribution in the pacific ocean are improved by incorporating ffm in addition to nfm using an improved ffm scheme kawasaki et al 2021 successfully reproduced radiocarbon distribution in the pacific ocean recently a more complicated dynamically based parameterization has been proposed considering both nfm and ffm through not only wave wave interaction but also various other mechanisms de lavergne et al 2020 however such dynamically based parameterization for tidally induced vertical mixing has not yet been used for ocean state estimation in this study we use the ogcm optimized by osafune et al 2021 which uses the nfm scheme of st laurent et al 2002 as well as an ffm scheme based on hibiya et al 2006 this ffm scheme was adopted by osafune et al 2021 with an emphasis on consistency with observations the details of the schemes are presented in section 2 one promising approach for ocean state estimation would be a four dimensional variational 4d var method based on the strong constraint as it provides the best time trajectory fit to the observations and hence can create a dataset that is dynamically consistent without any artificial sources or sinks for heat and salt and thus potential energy e g masuda et al 2003 stammer et al 2002 wunsch and heimbach 2013 however as this operation requires vast computing resources and complex coding schemes there is a limited number of institutions conducting data synthesis studies on global scale long term ocean state estimation using this approach representative examples include the ecco consortium led by nasa s physical oceanography modeling and cryosphere programs http ecco group org home cgi in the united states e g forget et al 2015a fukumori et al 2018 stammer et al 2002 and the gecco german contribution to ecco based at the university of hamburg germany e g köhl and stammer 2008 some data synthesis experiments conducted by ecco and gecco groups have estimated vertical and other mixing coefficients through the 4d var assimilation approach liu et al 2012 forget et al 2015b see the review by masuda and osafune 2021 those previous studies did not use any knowledge of interior vertical mixing as prior information starting with globally constant coefficients as their first guess values and estimated three dimensional maps of the coefficients those studies have shown that adjusting mixing coefficients is effective in reducing the global misfit between a model simulation and ocean observations over recent decades and that the adjustment of vertical diffusivity is relatively small in the deep ocean however the estimated vertical diffusivity lacks bottom intensified structure and is inconsistent with our current understanding of nfm this is probably because the number of available observations is insufficient to determine the mixing coefficient in three dimensions at least in the deep ocean forget et al 2015b in addition the previous studies did not clearly reproduce the modest but broadly distributed abyssal warming in the pacific whereas they successfully reproduced the strong warming in the southern ocean which might cause the warming in the pacific these points imply that knowledge about mixing should be used as a priori information to assess the role of vertical mixing in small changes in water properties in the abyssal ocean masuda et al 2010 reproduced the abyssal warming in the pacific reasonably well in a quasi global excluding parts of the polar regions data synthesis experiment using a 4d var assimilation system which is used to provide the ocean state estimation dataset referred to as the estimated state of global ocean for climate research estoc osafune et al 2015 this assimilation system was developed with particular attention to obtaining a long term state estimation with a better representation of the abyssal ocean for this purpose the system uses an ogcm with parameters tuned by toyoda et al 2015 in the ogcm interior vertical mixing below the surface mixed layer is represented by a linear combination of three semi empirical mixing schemes and the weighting factor for each scheme along with other physical parameters is optimally estimated by toyoda et al 2015 to reproduce the climatological distribution of water properties in a spin up run using a green s function method menemenlis et al 2005 one of those schemes is a parameterization for bottom intensified mixing depending on the bottom topography hasumi and suginohara 1999 which makes a large contribution to the optimized vertical mixing although that scheme does not impose the energetic constraints for nfm estimated by the tide models the large contribution suggests the importance of nfm in reproducing the climatological deep ocean state and possibly abyssal warming on the basis of adjoint sensitivity analysis using their own assimilation system masuda et al 2010 also showed that abyssal warming in the pacific ocean is linked to changes in the surface air sea heat flux off the adèlie coast of antarctica and that this link is established over only four decades through the action of internal waves those authors suggested that a change in circulation due to wave propagation weakens the cooling effect of the abyssal ocean and leads to an excess heating effect that is related to downward heat flux by vertical mixing and geothermal heating from below however the representation of the heating effect in the ogcm is not sufficiently realistic as it uses three semi empirical vertical mixing schemes that are not based on recent knowledge of mixing and does not take into account the geothermal heat flux it is possible that this poor representation distorts the spatial pattern and intensity of the temperature difference caused by internal waves the heating effect can influence the background structure of temperature and density in the model and the background structure determines the anomalous advection flux associated with wave velocity as well as the characteristics of waves such as path and propagation speed to improve the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in our ocean state estimation we modified the 4d var data assimilation system for estoc including incorporating tidally induced mixing schemes and geothermal heat flux into the ogcm and conducted a new data synthesis experiment for the period 1957 to 2014 in this paper we describe the fundamental implementation of this new system to assess the impact of the modification we evaluate the reproduction of abyssal ocean state by comparing the new ocean state estimation dataset with a previous version of estoc that was derived from the original data assimilation system in addition to demonstrate the importance of the improved physical processes we investigate the role of tidally induced mixing and geothermal heat flux in the abyssal warming in the new dataset an approach that combines biogeochemical processes with improved physical variables estimated using an assimilation system is a promising tool to help understand the long term dynamic state of oceanic dissolved materials for example knowledge of the long term dynamic state of oceanic co2 is needed to understand some important aspects of global warming and therefore the development of material cycle models has progressed to integrate the assimilation system of physical and biogeochemical variables with biogeochemical observations e g toyoda et al 2013 brix et al 2015 estoc also includes material cycle models based on lower trophic level ecosystems doi et al 2015 and the dataset for ocean state estimation is provided by a physical biogeochemical ocean model we also compare dissolved inorganic carbon dic storage which is closely related to the absorption of anthropogenic co2 into the ocean with storage from a previous version to show the influence of this update on the biogeochemical part of the system 2 materials and methods here we describe our modification of the assimilation system and the experimental setting adopted in this study the basic information common to our new experiment and previous experiments using the original system is described in detail by osafune et al 2015 the modification of the ogcm briefly described below was made in our previous study osafune et al 2021 2 1 ocean general circulation model the ogcm used in our assimilation system is version 3 of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory noaa usa modular ocean model mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 which is equipped with established and effective parameterizations including a turbulent closure scheme for the surface mixed layer noh 2004 and an isopycnal mixing scheme gent and mcwilliams 1990 this model does not contain a sea ice model but the related water mass formation is represented by subsurface fluxes of heat and salt as explained below in this subsection the quasi global model domain covers the region between 75 s and 80 n the horizontal resolution is 1 for both longitude and latitude and there are 45 levels in the vertical dimension with thicknesses of 10 400 m together with a layer representing the bottom boundary layer we used the ogcm modified by osafune et al 2021 who replaced three semi empirical mixing schemes used for interior mixing in the original ogcm with two tidally induced mixing schemes for nfm and ffm vertical diffusivity for nfm was calculated based on st laurent et al 2002 1 κ near γ n 2 ɛ near γ n 2 q ρ e g x y f z where γ is the mixing efficiency of turbulence assumed to be 0 2 n is the buoyancy frequency q is the local dissipation efficiency ρ is the reference density of seawater kg m 3 and e g is the rate of conversion of barotropic tidal energy into internal waves w m 2 f z is a vertical distribution function that assumes that ɛ decays exponentially away from the ocean bottom as follows 2 f z exp h z ζ ζ 1 exp h ζ where z is the vertical coordinate positive upward h is the bottom depth m and ζ is the vertical decay scale m we used e g values of the major semidiurnal m 2 and s 2 and diurnal k 1 and o 1 tidal constituents estimated from the three dimensional global numerical simulation of niwa and hibiya 2011 following tanaka et al 2010 we assumed that q takes different values for subinertial and superinertial tidal frequencies referred to as q sub and q sup respectively we used q sub only for diurnal constituents poleward of 30 vertical diffusivity for ffm was calculated from the empirical relationship hibiya et al 2006 between diapycnal diffusivity in the thermocline estimated from observed fine scale vertical shear and the numerically predicted available energy density of the semidiurnal internal tide the major energy source for diapycnal diffusivity at each location the vertical diffusivity κ far at longitude θ and latitude ϕ was calculated as follows 3 κ far f far θ ϕ b far ϕ 20 for 0 ϕ 20 κ far f far θ ϕ b far for 20 ϕ 30 κ far f far θ ϕ 35 ϕ 5 b far for 30 ϕ 35 κ far b far for 35 ϕ with f far θ ϕ r far log 10 e internal θ ϕ 0 1 for e internal θ ϕ 0 1 j m 3 f far θ ϕ 0 for e internal θ ϕ 0 1 j m 3 where b far and r far are unknown parameters and e internal is the available energy density of the internal tide this dependence on latitude is determined under the assumption that the cascade of internal waves is dominated by wave wave interaction known as parametric subharmonic instability staquet and sommeria 2002 and is consistent with observations we used e internal estimated by niwa and hibiya 2011 for the four major tidal constituents we assumed that κ far is vertically constant on the basis of observations of the relationship between dissipation and stratification in the open ocean away from rough topography waterhouse et al 2014 this scheme was adopted with an emphasis on consistency with observations osafune et al 2021 vertical diffusivity κ in our model is represented as the sum of κ near κ far and the diffusivity from the other schemes for the surface mixed layer noh 2004 and double diffusion due to salt fingering schmitt 1988 and diffusive convection marmorino and caldwell 1976 in the case that stratification was unstable vertical diffusivity was set to 0 1 m2 s 1 to represent convection we made other changes to the model in addition to the replacement of the interior mixing schemes the original model imposes temporally constant heat and salinity fluxes through the whole water column except for the top layer in several regions where the model cannot simulate important processes such as deep convection and inflow from unresolved marginal seas those subsurface fluxes were estimated by restoring potential temperature t and salinity s to annual mean values in the world ocean atlas 1998 antonov et al 1998 during the climatological spin up run using the original ogcm to refine the spreading of dense water formed on the antarctic shelf region to the deep southern ocean we extended the region of the subsurface fluxes around antarctica to the continental shelf and slope shallower than 2000 m south of 69 s we also added the geothermal heat flux based on the global distribution map constructed by davies 2013 by combining a half space conduction model observed heat flow data sets and an assumed relationship between heat flow and geology following toyoda et al 2015 osafune et al 2021 employed a green s function in conducting a linear optimization experiment with the modified ogcm of the present study to reproduce the climatological distribution of water properties the authors estimated optimal values for physical parameters including those in the tidally induced mixing schemes except for γ and showed that the optimized model performs reasonably well in reproducing deep water properties in the pacific ocean from the end of year state of the optimized model this ogcm using the optimized parameters and subsurface fluxes estimated in the optimized model was integrated from 1946 to 2014 using 10 day mean air sea fluxes heat freshwater and momentum derived from the 6 hourly national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis 1 during this integration sea surface temperature sst was relaxed to a historical 10 day mean sst dataset compiled from the optimally interpolated sst oisst dataset reynolds et al 2002 extended back to 1946 using the reconstructed reynolds sst dataset whereas sea surface salinity sss was relaxed to the climatological monthly mean sss of the world ocean atlas 1998 woa98 this relaxation corrected the surface freshwater and heat fluxes using the state at the end of 1956 as the initial condition we conducted the first guess run covering the 58 years from 1957 to 2014 in this first guess run we used the corrected fluxes without sst and sss relaxation although exceptions were made in parts of the arctic sea to avoid unrealistically large correction of freshwater flux we did not apply the sst and sss relaxation in the forward model run in the data synthesis experiment 2 2 adjoint model the adjoint code of the ogcm was obtained with the use of the transformation of algorithms in fortran giering and kaminski 2003 the turbulent closure model was excluded from the adjoint model so as to stabilize the latter the original system used the three dimensional initial condition of model variables i e t s sea surface height and horizontal velocities and the 10 day air sea fluxes as the control variables in our new experiment we also used the six globally constant parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes i e q sub q sup ζ γ b far and r far for this purpose we modified the adjoint model to be able to calculate the adjoint sensitivity of these parameters in comparison with previous studies which estimated mixing coefficients in three dimensions without knowledge of mixing this strategy reduces the number of control variables by using the mixing schemes as constraints on vertical diffusivity this enables us to reduce the possible risks of overfitting through unrealistic mixing and to provide an estimation of ocean state that is consistent with the knowledge on which the mixing schemes are based although the reduced controllability of the model might limit the ability to reproduce the ocean state 2 3 cost function our assimilation system seeks an optimized four dimensional dataset by minimizing a cost function as in stammer et al 2002 the cost function is written as 4 j j bg j obs 1 2 a a 0 t b 1 a a 0 1 2 z a y t r 1 z a y where j bg and j obs are background and observation costs respectively a and a 0 represent the vectors of control variables and their first guess values respectively b and r are the background and observation error covariance matrices respectively and z and y are model data and observations respectively the heat and freshwater fluxes corrected through the surface relaxation are used as a 0 r 1 is assumed to be diagonal and each diagonal component of r 1 is inversely proportional to the mean square difference between i the variation in model values from the mean and ii the variation in observation values from the mean while considering a factor that depends on the number of observation data b 1 is assumed to have a tridiagonal form that represents the closeness and smoothness of the air sea fluxes relative to the first guess field each component of b 1 is inversely proportional to the variance of a 0 and its gradients while considering a factor that depends on the area of the grid cell the observations that are assimilated in the original system are subsurface temperature and salinity from the en4 dataset compiled by the hadley centre of the uk meteorological office good et al 2013 sst from historical 10 day datasets compiled from the optimally interpolated sst oisst dataset reynolds et al 2002 and extended reconstructed ersst dataset smith et al 2008 the historical 10 day sea surface dynamic height anomaly ssdha derived from sea surface height data in the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems dataset and a global mean sea level reconstructed using the method of church and white 2011 which is updated and provided by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro we added an observation cost for ɛ to assimilate observations of ɛ which required the calculation of ɛ in the ogcm we assumed that ɛ is represented by the sum of ɛ near and ɛ far and calculated ɛ far by using the osborn 1980 relationship as ɛ far κ far n 2 γ 1 in this calculation we used the first guess value for γ 0 2 throughout the synthesis experiment to avoid the influence of overestimation of the model ɛ associated with large n 2 in the surface mixed layer where the relationship of osborn 1980 cannot be applied we did not use the adjoint sensitivities of the parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes for the top 200 m observed ɛ is intermittent in both time and space and does not obey a gaussian distribution which is assumed in the quadratic observation cost in the form of eq 4 however we can assume that the logarithm of ɛ approximately obeys a gaussian distribution such an approximation is possible because each observed profile consisting of ln ɛ appears as a path with an intermittent structure that can be considered as being generated from an additive cascade with generators that obey a stable distribution similar to an extent to an uncentered gaussian distribution e g sugiura et al 2020 under this assumption we assimilated the logarithm of ɛ using a quadratic cost we used observational data for ɛ estimated from ctd attached microstructure profilers in the pacific ocean goto et al 2021 we calculated averages of observed ln ɛ in the model grids and defined them as climatological means model ɛ in each grid cell was also averaged over time for the calculation period after taking the natural logarithm these two averages are highly correlated but the model values have a positive bias with respect to the observed values which is expected when the logarithm is taken of each point in an observed intermittent series before averaging using the same observational data as employed in this study sugiura et al 2020 demonstrated that the observed intermittent series of ln ɛ can be considered as being generated from an additive cascade and showed that the logarithm of the spatial average of ɛ becomes larger than the spatial average of ln ɛ with a regular dependence on the resolution referring to the method of those authors we applied a scale correction to the model values the bias b can be calculated as 5 e 1 2 n j 1 2 n l n ɛ j obs l n ɛ j model e 1 2 n j 1 2 n i 1 n g i j 1 2 n i 1 b where e represents an expectation value ɛ j obs is the observed value at the j th vertical observation level ɛ j model is the model value at the corresponding level 2 n is a number of vertical points g i k are the independent and identically distributed random number generators sampled from a stable distribution and s is the floor function which assigns the integer that satisfies 0 s s 1 assuming that the model ɛ represents an average at a scale of 2000 m corresponding to n 9 we used b 3 as the correction the diagonal term of r for ɛ was defined to be proportional to the number of observational data in that grid with a factor determined by balancing with the other observation costs we also added a background cost for the parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes the background values were set to the first guess values optimally estimated by osafune et al 2020 using the green s function method the diagonal term of b was defined to be proportional to the uncertainty table 1 with a factor determined by balancing with the other background costs 2 4 data synthesis experiment our assimilation system seeks the minimum of the cost function by iterative calculation of forward and backward adjoint models using the modified system we performed 50 iterations by which stage the cost function became reasonably stable the observation costs decreased by 67 71 and 34 for t s and sst respectively unfortunately no significant cost reduction for ɛ was confirmed and the adjustment of the tidally induced mixing parameter was very small we refer to this new synthesized dataset as the tide case this has been published as version 04a estocv4a on our website osafune et al 2014a we also used our previous synthesized dataset version 03b estocv3b as reference data derived from the original system using the semi empirical mixing scheme we refer to estocv3b as the notide case it is noted that notide is a result after 100 iterations with successive correction for statistics used in the anomaly assimilation in which the bias correction at each level is determined by using the root mean squares of difference in mean and temporal variation between model and observation osafune et al 2015 however tide is a result after 50 iterations without the successive correction this difference in optimization makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from a comparison between tide and notide however the comparison may indicate the usefulness of tide and the modified assimilation system 2 5 biogeochemical model to evaluate the biogeochemical cycle internal to the ocean using the estimated physical field with the method mentioned above we added a biogeochemical model a lower trophic level ecosystem model to the original ogcm descriptions of this biogeochemical model and its performance can be found in doi et al 2015 the ecosystem model used is a simple npzd model based on the nitrogen cycle the basic compartments of nitrate n phytoplankton p zooplankton z and detritus d are considered as well as the functions of carbon c and oxygen o the temporal rate of change in the distribution of biomass in ecosystem

set of optimized model parameters was obtained by carrying out a data synthesis scheme based on a green s function approach to integrate information available from observations e g menemenlis et al 2005 toyoda et al 2013 brix et al 2015 in the carbon cycle and oxygen cycle parts of the model c n and o n ratios from the redfield ratio were assumed for the conversion of nitrogen to carbon and of nitrogen to oxygen in the biomass and biochemical processes 3 results 3 1 vertical diffusivity vertical diffusivity κ shows a marked spatial variation in tide which is consistent with our knowledge of mixing on which tidally induced mixing schemes are based fig 1 at 2000 m κ is generally small around the equator modest in high latitude areas and relatively large around the rough bottom topography in low to mid latitude areas reflecting ffm reflecting nfm κ is large along ridges such as the central ridge in the atlantic and the hawaiian ridge and along sills like those along the kuril and aleutian island chains this distribution is similar to the distribution estimated by applying fine scale parameterization to the argo float data whalen et al 2012 at 3695 m this latitude dependent structure is faintly visible but κ is larger than at 2000 m in many areas this depth dependence is associated with nfm and such large values are seen in regions with rough bottom topography which in the north pacific occur mainly in the western part of the basin particularly large values of κ 100 10 4 m2s 1 seen in some isolated basins such as the philippine basin can be explained by weak stratification in this model this distribution is very similar to that in the model linearly optimized by osafune et al 2021 as the modifications of the parameters in the tidally induced mixing schemes are small table 1 when standardized by their uncertainties the modifications of parameters in ffm are rather larger than those in nfm this suggests that the model is more sensitive to ffm than nfm in this setting however these small modifications suggest that there is room for improvement in the optimization system although it is possible that the first guess values that were optimized by osafune et al 2021 are sufficient without modification the reason for the small modifications should be investigated in future studies but the obtained 4 dimensional state could perhaps be regarded as a result that does not control for those parameters 3 2 climatological bottom water properties here we show the climatological annual mean state of bottom water properties averaged from 4000 to 5500 m the climatological state is defined as the temporal mean from 1972 to 2014 in the synthesized data as a climatological state based on observations we use the world ocean atlas 2018 woa18 garcia et al 2019 the overall pattern of t in woa18 is closely reproduced in tide as in notide fig 2a c to determine whether the reproduction of t is improved in the tide case relative to t in the notide case we show the difference in model bias t tide t woa 18 t notide t woa 18 in fig 2d where the subscripts indicate datasets this comparison shows that on the whole the reproduction of t is improved in tide a relatively large decrease in model bias from notide to tide is seen in the southern ocean indian ocean and western atlantic these decreases are related to warm biases in the notide case which are less pronounced in the tide case fig 2e f although the increase in the model bias shown by red in fig 2d indicates that the reproduction of t is degraded from notide to tide in the eastern region in both the pacific and atlantic the increase is generally less than 0 1 c and is smaller than the broader scale decrease in addition the overall pattern of s in woa18 is closely reproduced in tide as in notide fig 3a c the difference in model bias for s between the tide and notide cases shows that on the whole the reproduction of s is improved in tide in comparison with notide whereas a large increase in model bias from notide to tide is seen in parts of the eastern south atlantic fig 3d model bias is substantially decreased in the western atlantic especially in the northern hemisphere the next largest decrease in model bias from notide to tide is seen in the western pacific which corresponds to the model reproduction of water with relatively high salinity s 34 7 these decreases are related to relatively large biases in notide which are less pronounced in the tide case fig 3e f 3 3 decadal abyssal water change here we investigate the reproduction of the decadal change in t in the abyssal ocean below 3000 m to the bottom which we divided into three layers as in the estimation from observation obs by kouketsu et al 2011 fig 4 in tide a positive decadal change in t is widely distributed in the abyssal ocean this positive change is large in the southern ocean and western atlantic in all three layers as in obs in the pacific ocean this positive change is distributed in almost the entire region in the two layers below 4000 m and the region of this positive change in t appears to extend from the southern ocean to the northern north pacific along its western part with its amplitude decreasing to the north this pattern is consistent with that of obs a negative decadal change in t is seen at depths generally shallower than 4000 m in the eastern pacific and eastern atlantic this pattern of negative change is also similar to that of obs in addition there is a negative decadal change in t in all three layers below 3000 m in the western indian ocean in tide this negative change is consistent with that of obs below 4000 m whereas there is a positive change with large uncertainty above 4000 m in obs focusing on the region below 4000 m the reproduction of the above mentioned pattern appears to be improved on the whole in tide relative to notide although it is difficult to determine which of these reproductions is realistic because of the large uncertainty in obs the pacific ocean is one such region for a depth range of 4000 5000 m the warming region extends continuously from the southern ocean to the northern north pacific in tide but is divided at around 30 n in notide the amplitude of warming in notide is much larger than that of obs in the southern to equatorial pacific in addition the negative change in t below 4000 m in the western indian ocean in tide is consistent with that of obs whereas there is a positive change in notide 3 4 abyssal water temperature budget the improved reproduction of the abyssal warming with the refined physical processes that probably have a strong influence on abyssal water properties i e vertical mixing and or geothermal heating motivates us to investigate the contributions of each process to the improved warming in tide here we investigate the budget for the decadal change in bottom water temperature in the pacific ocean by using monthly average fluxes between grid cells in the ogcm it is noted that vertical diffusion was implicitly solved in the simulation for stability thus the vertical diffusion flux diagnosed by the explicit method was output for the budget analysis we consider average t within a water column from 3695 m to the bottom in each horizontal grid cell 7 t t 1 δ v ω t d v where δ v is the volume of the water column and ω is the domain of the water column using the three dimensional flux caused by advection and diffusion f adv and f diff the conservation equation for t is written as 8 t t 1 δ v ω f adv f diff n d s where ω is the surface of the domain and n is an inward unit vector normal to the surface by decomposing the contribution by diffusion on the right hand side to three components related to the horizontal flux across the lateral boundary the vertical flux across the upper boundary and geothermal heat flux across the bottom boundary this equation can be rewritten as 9 t t f adv f hdiff f vdiff f geoth where the terms f with superscripts adv hdiff vdiff and geoth denote contributions from each component related to advection the horizontal and vertical components of diffusion and geothermal heat flux respectively by integrating this equation over time we obtain 10 t t t 0 c adv c hdiff c vdiff c geoth where c denotes the temporal integration of f from this we calculate the contributions of each component to the decadal change in t δ t as 11 δ t δ c adv δ c hdiff δ c vdiff δ c geoth as horizontal diffusion represents a kind of advection by eddies we hereinafter refer to the sum of advection and horizontal diffusion as advection the sum of those four components is very similar to δ t fig 5a b meaning that the error in the vertical diffusion flux diagnosed by the explicit method is negligible in this analysis in most regions δ c vdiff is positive fig 5c particularly large positive values 0 01 c decade 1 are confined to small areas except for in the southern ocean where the contribution from the vertical component of isopycnal mixing is large these large positive values appear around the rough topography that is located mainly in the western pacific ocean this distribution corresponds closely to the distribution of large values of κ at 3695 m depth which is associated with nfm fig 1b this correspondence suggests that the particularly strong heating associated with the vertical component of diffusion is generally related to vertical mixing by nfm in the pacific ocean in most of the remaining regions δ c vdiff is relatively small 0 004 c decade 1 and it is especially small 0 002 c decade 1 in the northern north pacific and the western equatorial region likely because of the small κ associated with the spatial distribution of ffm the spatial distribution of δ c geoth which is positive everywhere reflects almost directly the distribution of the geothermal fluxes although it is modified according to the spatial variation in the bottom depth fig 5d particularly large positive values 0 01 c decade 1 are confined to small areas located mainly in the eastern pacific ocean along the pacific antarctic ridge and along the west coast of north america in most of the remaining regions δ c geoth is relatively small 0 004 c decade 1 unlike δ c vdiff there are no regions where δ c geoth is smaller than 0 002 c decade 1 we note that δ t is quite different from the sum of these heating effects as it has no small scale structures with particularly large values this is explained by the remaining advection term δ c adv δ c hdiff fig 5e which is negative in most regions fig 5e with a structure similar to the sum of δ c vdiff and δ c geoth but with the opposite sign particularly large negative values are confined to small areas where particularly large positive values of δ c vdiff and or δ c geoth are located as a result these particularly large positive and negative values tend to cancel each other out resulting in the lack of small scale structures in δ t this cancellation of values means that the particularly large heat added sparsely in space spreads quickly by advection thus we need to consider the effect of spreading due to advection to understand where and to what extent the heat added by each heating process affects δ t we also note that the advection term does not have a structure similar to the warming pattern this result is not necessarily inconsistent with masuda et al 2010 who suggested that weakening of the cooling via advection may cause abyssal water warming this mechanism can explain our result if the warming is caused by a weakening of the cooling via advection and the weakening is sufficiently minor that the spatial structure is unaltered to determine the size of the imbalance we show the temporal variation in each budget term eq 9 fig 6a shows the budget term for the region enclosed in the box in fig 5a where the decadal change in t appears to be improved in tide compared with notide the heating effect due to vertical diffusion is almost constant and is more than two times larger than the effect due to geothermal heat flux supporting the importance of vertical mixing in this region the cooling effect due to horizontal diffusion is nearly constant whereas the cooling effect due to advection varies significantly with an almost annual cycle reflecting the variation in advection the tendency varies significantly with rare negative values fig 6b shows the time integral of each budget term and reveals that the imbalance corresponding to the warming is small in comparison with the sum of the heating effects and with the absolute value of the sum of cooling effects meaning that the imbalance is small it is noted that all of the terms in fig 6b including advection are nearly linear this linearity indicates that the warming results from a near steady imbalance suggesting that the warming occurs over a long timescale and the cause of this warming may lie outside of the model period we also note that the distribution of the particularly large positive values clearly differs between δ c vdiff and δ c geoth and only δ c vdiff has such values in the western region this pattern implies that heating by vertical mixing probably nfm plays an important role in determining the improved reproduction of bottom water warming that is enhanced in the western pacific ocean however it is unclear whether relatively weak but broadly distributed heating in both δ c vdiff and δ c geoth can be ignored in determining the spatial structure of the improved warming to confirm the importance of nfm we conducted forward impact experiments as described in the following section 3 5 forward impact experiment as discussed above because of the large effect of spreading by advection it is unclear from the eulerian budget where and to what extent the heat added by each process affects δ t in tide here we conducted two forward impact experiments that use the same ogcm initial conditions and fluxes as for tide in one experiment nfm is reduced by 10 herein the nfm90 experiment and in the other the geothermal flux is reduced by 10 herein the geoth90 experiment by subtracting δ t in each impact experiment from δ t in tide we obtain the sensitivity of δ t to a 10 increase in each heating process it is noted that we used the prescribed heat and freshwater fluxes optimized by data assimilation and did not restore sst and sss in the forward run in the data synthesis experiment therefore those fluxes were not altered in response to the differences in sst and sss from tide meaning that these experiments allow the pure response of the ocean to the reduction in nfm and the geothermal flux to be determined the deviation of δ t from nfm90 to tide is positive over almost the entire pacific and is large in the region from the equatorial to the western north pacific fig 7a in contrast the deviation of δ t from geoth90 to tide which is positive over the entire pacific is large in the eastern regions fig 7b we also conducted an additional forward impact experiment that reduced the effect of ffm by 10 but its impact is several times weaker than those from reducing nfm and geothermal flux not shown this finding indicates that heating by nfm is effective in causing the enhanced bottom water warming in the western pacific ocean at least in tide implying that the incorporation of the nfm scheme was important in improving the reproduction of abyssal water warming 3 6 changes in dissolved inorganic carbon fluctuations as an example of biogeochemical analysis using estoc here we show temporal changes in the increasing rate of dic storage in the global ocean fig 8 which is closely related to absorption of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere the rate of increase was 1 2 pgc yr 1 in the 2000s and reached 2 pgc yr 1 in the middle of the 2010s in tide this long term change is similar to the increasing rate in notide and the increasing rate reported by doi et al 2015 who used the previous version of notide this similarity suggests that the long term change is controlled mainly by anthropogenic co2 in the atmosphere to evaluate the absorption of anthropogenic co2 by the ocean after the beginning of the experiment in 1957 we conducted an additional experiment in which the co2 concentration in the atmosphere was assumed to be constant and equal to that in january 1957 and the other conditions were the same as in tide we assumed that the natural changes in carbon budgets were obtained with the additional experiment and defined anthropogenic carbon as the deviation of the co2 concentration of the normal experiment from the additional experiment the carbon budget without anthropogenic carbon in the global ocean was about 0 7 pgc yr 1 although the outgassing emission might be influenced by model bias and or initial conditions this value is consistent with natural co2 outgassing from the ocean to the atmosphere estimated in previous studies e g resplandy et al 2018 taking this value into account the anthropogenic co2 absorption by the ocean was about 1 9 2 7 pgc yr 1 in tide similar to the values reported in previous studies using different methods e g le quéré et al 2018 focusing on interannual changes there is a slight difference between tide and notide in particular the increasing rate of dic in tide around 2000 was higher than the corresponding rate in notide this difference in the interannual change in the rate of increase must also be related mainly to differences in the rate of co2 absorption from the atmosphere the difference in primary production between these experiments was too small to account for the difference in atmospheric co2 absorption although the difference in vertical diffusivity between tide and notide could influence the nutrient supply from under the mixed layer into the surface layer therefore the excess co2 absorbed around 2000 in tide compared with notide was most likely transported below the mixed layer by the stronger vertical mixing relative to notide however differences in the spatial patterns of water column inventory increases from 1990 to 2010 between tide and notide seems to be strongly influenced by circulation change rather than local changes in vertical diffusivity not shown as a large amount of anthropogenic carbon was in the upper ocean even in the 2010s e g khatiwala et al 2013 it might be difficult to discern the effect of marked spatial changes in vertical diffusivity near the bottom on changes in the distribution of anthropogenic carbon this suggests that the impact of circulation change which depends on the vertical mixing parameterization should be evaluated to obtain improved estimates of carbon and biogeochemical circulation 4 discussion we have shown that the reproduction of both climatological state and the temporal change in abyssal water properties is on the whole improved in tide in comparison with notide although tide has a smaller and possibly insufficient number of iterations for optimization than notide this improved reproduction of abyssal ocean state with refined physical processes that play major roles in determining deep water properties i e vertical mixing and or geothermal heating makes our new synthesized dataset valuable at least for understanding the deep ocean we investigated the modest but broadly distributed bottom water warming in the pacific ocean which is closely reproduced in our new dataset by using a budget for bottom water temperature and forward impact experiments the bottom water warming derives from a small imbalance between larger effects of heating by vertical diffusion and geothermal flux and cooling by advection and that the downward heat flux by bottom intensified nfm which is large in the western pacific ocean operates effectively in forming the improved distribution of bottom water warming in the pacific ocean in our new ogcm it is unclear from the results of the budget analysis and the impact experiments whether the use of nfm is essential for improving the reproduction of abyssal ocean state however the results clearly show that vertical mixing can have a substantial impact on ocean state estimation it is possible that the existence of downward heat flux by nfm in the first guess run makes it easier to reproduce the bottom water warming through synthesis experiments suggesting the importance of using knowledge of vertical mixing as a priori information in ocean state estimation the cause of this abyssal water warming is not clear from this study however the budget analysis suggests that the warming in the north pacific occurs over a long timescale and its cause may lie outside of the model period this interpretation is consistent with the study of masuda et al 2010 who suggested that the warming is a result of the change in circulation caused by internal waves that propagate from the southern ocean over a period of about four decades this proposed mechanism suggests that the source of this warming is embedded in the initial state in our dataset therefore refining the modification of the initial state through data assimilation should be an important aspect of developing more reliable deep ocean state estimation further refinement of physical processes in the ogcm should enhance the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in our ocean state estimation and may improve the reproduction of the ocean state not only in the deep ocean there is still large uncertainty in the representation of vertical mixing in the modified ogcm it remains unclear where and how far field internal tides dissipate and cause ffm although we used an ffm scheme associated with the cascade to smaller scales through wave wave interaction there are other mechanisms hypothesized as potential dissipators of far field internal tides mackinnon et al 2017 depending on the mechanism ɛ has a different vertical structure which affects the structure of ocean circulation and the thermocline melet et al 2016 also although we assume that the vertical decay scale in nfm ζ is constant globally its value depends on the wave number of the bottom topography and the tidal flow amplitude hibiya et al 2017 although this dependency is not considered here de lavergne et al 2020 presented a tidally induced vertical mixing scheme that considers nfm and ffm associated with some cascade mechanisms we focused only on tidally induced mixing but it may be important to consider mixing that is related to processes involving wind e g alford et al 2016 and geostrophic currents e g bell 1975 large uncertainty exists not only for the interior mixing focused on in this study but also for the mixing in the surface boundary layer which affects water mass formation and thereby water properties in the ocean interior large et al 1994 li et al 2019 we do not consider mixing related to wave current interaction qiao et al 2004 or near inertial waves jochum et al 2013 which affects the temperature structure in the surface layer including sst those mixing schemes should affect the estimation of surface heat flux and thus the global heat budget mixing varies widely over various time scales moum 2021 and it may be important to consider temporal variations in interior mixing which could have an impact on circulation and also temperature and salinity structures nakamura et al 2014 osafune et al 2014b 2020 it is not clear which combination of schemes would be best but it would be possible to verify the effectiveness of the schemes by using ocean state estimation as in this study energetical consistency is an important aspect in obtaining a reliable global ocean circulation we adopted the ffm scheme based on the empirical relationship of hibiya et al 2006 with an emphasis on consistency with observations of turbulence this does not necessarily guarantee consistency with the global energy budget to avoid energetically unrealistic simulations we directly introduced constraints on turbulent energy here we attempted to make a well balanced data synthesis scheme considering both observations and dynamics energetics more recent schemes which are weighted with respect to energetics e g oka and niwa 2013 eden and olbers 2014 would be applicable to forecasting based on data synthesis in our data synthesis experiment there is no clear decrease in the observation cost for local ɛ this may be because the scale corrected ɛ in the first guess run is highly consistent with the observed ɛ we note however that this level of consistency depends on the averaging scale employed in the scale correction therefore the validity of the scale correction needs to be examined in a future study also it is possible that this absence of a clear decrease is related to the design of our adjoint model which only calculates the sensitivity of diffusivity to the cost for local ɛ whereas ɛ also depends on n 2 we adopted this choice because we are interested in adjusting mixing parameters however this neglect of the sensitivity of n 2 to ɛ may make it difficult to decrease the cost for local ɛ although it is unclear whether the cost for ɛ is effective in this experiment it is expected that this cost could serve to suppress the unrealistic adjustment of mixing parameters that could occur in relation to other observation costs to enhance the reliability of this cost we should use more observations of turbulence however as the number of direct observations of ɛ based on microstructure measurement is limited it would be useful to include those observations in existing more extensive databases based on fine scale parameterizations e g kunze 2017 whalen et al 2015 it has been shown that ogcms using background vertical diffusivity obtained by applying a fine scale parameterization to argo work well in reproducing temperature over the tropical pacific zhu and zhang 2018 2019 this close reproduction suggests the usefulness of assimilating ɛ based on fine scale parameterizations it is expected that more extensive databases of direct observations will be obtained by float observation e g roemmich et al 2019 in addition it should prove useful to impose a cost on the global integrated value of tidal energy dissipation and or to use a more realistic scheme that is confirmed from observations of turbulence e g de lavergne et al 2020 so far we have focused on turbulent mixing in the vertical direction only whereas previous data synthesis experiments that adjusted mixing coefficients in three dimensions have shown that the adjustment of coefficients related to lateral turbulent mixing makes a larger contribution to the reduction in the cost function we used globally constant isopycnal thickness and horizontal diffusivities that osafune et al 2021 optimally estimated with parameters in the tidally induced mixing schemes however many studies have shown that those parameters have spatial variation our strategy using parameterizations and adjusting global constants in them can be used to synthesize knowledge regarding lateral mixing our recent work has involved developing a 4d var data synthesis system and generating an ocean state estimation dataset obtained by data synthesis experiments such as that reported in this study as well as updating reanalysis terms on our website http www godac jamstec go jp estoc e index html in the future we plan to update the mixing scheme especially ffm to improve the physical state of the upper ocean we also intend to introduce dissolved iron and an adjustment of the settling flux through particulate organic matter to improve the accuracy of estimation of the state of biogeochemical cycles credit authorship contribution statement satoshi osafune

23818,we updated the estimated state of the global ocean for climate research estoc a long term ocean state estimation dataset that includes physical and biogeochemical fields the physical field is optimized through a data synthesis experiment using a quasi global four dimensional variational data assimilation system and under the optimized physical field the biogeochemical field is optimized by using a green s function to improve the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in the model we implemented tidally induced turbulent mixing schemes and geothermal heat flux this paper provides an overview of the assimilation system with an emphasis on updated elements and including details of the mixing schemes and presents preliminary results focusing on the warming in the abyssal ocean below 3000 m using this updated estoc published as version 04a the reproduction of both the climatological state and temporal change in abyssal water properties is on the whole improved in this updated estoc in comparison with a previous version this improved reproduction of the abyssal ocean state with the refined physical processes that play major roles in determining abyssal water properties makes our new synthesized dataset valuable at least for understanding the abyssal ocean in this updated estoc the abyssal water warming results from a near steady imbalance between the heating effect due to vertical diffusion and geothermal flux and the cooling effect by advection and horizontal diffusion in the north pacific suggesting that the warming occurs over a long timescale we also show that the downward heat flux related to bottom intensified vertical mixing near the generation site of the internal tide plays an important role in determining the improved distribution of abyssal water warming in the pacific ocean these results suggest the importance of using knowledge of vertical mixing as a priori information in ocean state estimation keywords ocean state estimation data assimilation tide vertical mixing geothermal heating abyssal water 1 introduction oceans absorb large amounts of heat and dissolved gases such as co2 and are thought to play a central role in stabilizing earth s climate system therefore it is important to understand this role and the dynamics controlling it to better assess the present climate state and enhance the accuracy of climate prediction however it is challenging to derive the essential dynamics on climate timescales of years to decades based solely on observations that include variability over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales from eddy to gyre scale circulation given this background much effort has been devoted to ocean state estimation a synthesis of observations through a data assimilation approach that brings an ocean general circulation model ogcm into consistency with diverse observations e g wunsch and heimbach 2013 an important role of oceans is the absorption of excess heat accumulated in the earth system the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 reported that oceans have absorbed over 90 of the excess heat over the past few decades with more than 7 absorbed by the deep ocean 2000 m depth ipcc 2021 modern high quality full depth hydrographic section observations repeated at decadal intervals and the recently developed deep argo have revealed the occurrence of warming near the bottom of many basins e g desbruyères et al 2016 fukasawa et al 2004 johnson and doney 2006 johnson et al 2007 2008 2019 kawano et al 2006 purkey and johnson 2010 purkey et al 2019 by compiling those hydrographic section data kouketsu et al 2011 estimated decadal rates of temperature change from the 1990s to 2000s in the abyssal layer below 3000 m water depth to the bottom and showed that whereas the temperature increase was especially large around antarctica modest but basin wide warming occurred even in the pacific ocean where formation of deep and bottom water does not occur those authors estimated that the increase in abyssal heat content in the pacific was second only to that in the southern ocean when integrated over each basin this finding highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms that cause temporal variations in ocean temperature through the entire water column across the global ocean including the abyssal pacific ocean when assessing the present climate state vertical turbulence mixing is one of the most important physical processes controlling water mass formation and ocean circulation including global moc munk and wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 therefore the nature and physics of mixing have been actively studied e g mackinnon et al 2017 as moc is closely related to the properties and distribution of the abyssal water vertical mixing should be a key element in reproducing a realistic abyssal ocean state in an ogcm application of existing knowledge of mixing should prove valuable to the improved estimation of ocean state in this study we focus on vertical mixing below the surface mixed layer in the open ocean which we refer to as interior vertical mixing this mixing is related largely to the breaking of internal waves the main sources of which are tides and winds mackinnon et al 2013 barotropic tidal currents generate internal waves when flowing over topographic obstacles and these waves are termed internal tides a part of the internal tides causes vertical mixing near their generation site owing to direct breaking of internal waves and enhanced rates of interaction with other internal waves and the rest propagates over greater distances and causes vertical mixing through various mechanisms such as a cascade to smaller scales through wave wave interactions in this study these two types of mixing are referred to as near field mixing nfm and far field mixing ffm respectively as the breaking of internal waves occurs on scales too small to be resolved explicitly in ogcms vertical mixing needs to be parameterized in ogcms various schemes for vertical mixing have been proposed on the basis of knowledge about mixing derived from observations theories and numerical simulations the distribution of the rate of conversion from barotropic to internal tidal energy can be estimated using tidal models and satellite observations of sea surface height e g jayne and st laurent 2001 using this distribution dynamically based parameterization for nfm was first proposed by st laurent et al 2002 this type of nfm scheme in some cases in a modified form is now widely used in ogcms and climate models e g jayne 2009 oka and niwa 2013 first incorporated an ffm scheme into an ogcm by extending the approach employed in the nfm scheme those authors demonstrated that the simulated moc and radiocarbon distribution in the pacific ocean are improved by incorporating ffm in addition to nfm using an improved ffm scheme kawasaki et al 2021 successfully reproduced radiocarbon distribution in the pacific ocean recently a more complicated dynamically based parameterization has been proposed considering both nfm and ffm through not only wave wave interaction but also various other mechanisms de lavergne et al 2020 however such dynamically based parameterization for tidally induced vertical mixing has not yet been used for ocean state estimation in this study we use the ogcm optimized by osafune et al 2021 which uses the nfm scheme of st laurent et al 2002 as well as an ffm scheme based on hibiya et al 2006 this ffm scheme was adopted by osafune et al 2021 with an emphasis on consistency with observations the details of the schemes are presented in section 2 one promising approach for ocean state estimation would be a four dimensional variational 4d var method based on the strong constraint as it provides the best time trajectory fit to the observations and hence can create a dataset that is dynamically consistent without any artificial sources or sinks for heat and salt and thus potential energy e g masuda et al 2003 stammer et al 2002 wunsch and heimbach 2013 however as this operation requires vast computing resources and complex coding schemes there is a limited number of institutions conducting data synthesis studies on global scale long term ocean state estimation using this approach representative examples include the ecco consortium led by nasa s physical oceanography modeling and cryosphere programs http ecco group org home cgi in the united states e g forget et al 2015a fukumori et al 2018 stammer et al 2002 and the gecco german contribution to ecco based at the university of hamburg germany e g köhl and stammer 2008 some data synthesis experiments conducted by ecco and gecco groups have estimated vertical and other mixing coefficients through the 4d var assimilation approach liu et al 2012 forget et al 2015b see the review by masuda and osafune 2021 those previous studies did not use any knowledge of interior vertical mixing as prior information starting with globally constant coefficients as their first guess values and estimated three dimensional maps of the coefficients those studies have shown that adjusting mixing coefficients is effective in reducing the global misfit between a model simulation and ocean observations over recent decades and that the adjustment of vertical diffusivity is relatively small in the deep ocean however the estimated vertical diffusivity lacks bottom intensified structure and is inconsistent with our current understanding of nfm this is probably because the number of available observations is insufficient to determine the mixing coefficient in three dimensions at least in the deep ocean forget et al 2015b in addition the previous studies did not clearly reproduce the modest but broadly distributed abyssal warming in the pacific whereas they successfully reproduced the strong warming in the southern ocean which might cause the warming in the pacific these points imply that knowledge about mixing should be used as a priori information to assess the role of vertical mixing in small changes in water properties in the abyssal ocean masuda et al 2010 reproduced the abyssal warming in the pacific reasonably well in a quasi global excluding parts of the polar regions data synthesis experiment using a 4d var assimilation system which is used to provide the ocean state estimation dataset referred to as the estimated state of global ocean for climate research estoc osafune et al 2015 this assimilation system was developed with particular attention to obtaining a long term state estimation with a better representation of the abyssal ocean for this purpose the system uses an ogcm with parameters tuned by toyoda et al 2015 in the ogcm interior vertical mixing below the surface mixed layer is represented by a linear combination of three semi empirical mixing schemes and the weighting factor for each scheme along with other physical parameters is optimally estimated by toyoda et al 2015 to reproduce the climatological distribution of water properties in a spin up run using a green s function method menemenlis et al 2005 one of those schemes is a parameterization for bottom intensified mixing depending on the bottom topography hasumi and suginohara 1999 which makes a large contribution to the optimized vertical mixing although that scheme does not impose the energetic constraints for nfm estimated by the tide models the large contribution suggests the importance of nfm in reproducing the climatological deep ocean state and possibly abyssal warming on the basis of adjoint sensitivity analysis using their own assimilation system masuda et al 2010 also showed that abyssal warming in the pacific ocean is linked to changes in the surface air sea heat flux off the adèlie coast of antarctica and that this link is established over only four decades through the action of internal waves those authors suggested that a change in circulation due to wave propagation weakens the cooling effect of the abyssal ocean and leads to an excess heating effect that is related to downward heat flux by vertical mixing and geothermal heating from below however the representation of the heating effect in the ogcm is not sufficiently realistic as it uses three semi empirical vertical mixing schemes that are not based on recent knowledge of mixing and does not take into account the geothermal heat flux it is possible that this poor representation distorts the spatial pattern and intensity of the temperature difference caused by internal waves the heating effect can influence the background structure of temperature and density in the model and the background structure determines the anomalous advection flux associated with wave velocity as well as the characteristics of waves such as path and propagation speed to improve the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in our ocean state estimation we modified the 4d var data assimilation system for estoc including incorporating tidally induced mixing schemes and geothermal heat flux into the ogcm and conducted a new data synthesis experiment for the period 1957 to 2014 in this paper we describe the fundamental implementation of this new system to assess the impact of the modification we evaluate the reproduction of abyssal ocean state by comparing the new ocean state estimation dataset with a previous version of estoc that was derived from the original data assimilation system in addition to demonstrate the importance of the improved physical processes we investigate the role of tidally induced mixing and geothermal heat flux in the abyssal warming in the new dataset an approach that combines biogeochemical processes with improved physical variables estimated using an assimilation system is a promising tool to help understand the long term dynamic state of oceanic dissolved materials for example knowledge of the long term dynamic state of oceanic co2 is needed to understand some important aspects of global warming and therefore the development of material cycle models has progressed to integrate the assimilation system of physical and biogeochemical variables with biogeochemical observations e g toyoda et al 2013 brix et al 2015 estoc also includes material cycle models based on lower trophic level ecosystems doi et al 2015 and the dataset for ocean state estimation is provided by a physical biogeochemical ocean model we also compare dissolved inorganic carbon dic storage which is closely related to the absorption of anthropogenic co2 into the ocean with storage from a previous version to show the influence of this update on the biogeochemical part of the system 2 materials and methods here we describe our modification of the assimilation system and the experimental setting adopted in this study the basic information common to our new experiment and previous experiments using the original system is described in detail by osafune et al 2015 the modification of the ogcm briefly described below was made in our previous study osafune et al 2021 2 1 ocean general circulation model the ogcm used in our assimilation system is version 3 of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory noaa usa modular ocean model mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 which is equipped with established and effective parameterizations including a turbulent closure scheme for the surface mixed layer noh 2004 and an isopycnal mixing scheme gent and mcwilliams 1990 this model does not contain a sea ice model but the related water mass formation is represented by subsurface fluxes of heat and salt as explained below in this subsection the quasi global model domain covers the region between 75 s and 80 n the horizontal resolution is 1 for both longitude and latitude and there are 45 levels in the vertical dimension with thicknesses of 10 400 m together with a layer representing the bottom boundary layer we used the ogcm modified by osafune et al 2021 who replaced three semi empirical mixing schemes used for interior mixing in the original ogcm with two tidally induced mixing schemes for nfm and ffm vertical diffusivity for nfm was calculated based on st laurent et al 2002 1 κ near γ n 2 ɛ near γ n 2 q ρ e g x y f z where γ is the mixing efficiency of turbulence assumed to be 0 2 n is the buoyancy frequency q is the local dissipation efficiency ρ is the reference density of seawater kg m 3 and e g is the rate of conversion of barotropic tidal energy into internal waves w m 2 f z is a vertical distribution function that assumes that ɛ decays exponentially away from the ocean bottom as follows 2 f z exp h z ζ ζ 1 exp h ζ where z is the vertical coordinate positive upward h is the bottom depth m and ζ is the vertical decay scale m we used e g values of the major semidiurnal m 2 and s 2 and diurnal k 1 and o 1 tidal constituents estimated from the three dimensional global numerical simulation of niwa and hibiya 2011 following tanaka et al 2010 we assumed that q takes different values for subinertial and superinertial tidal frequencies referred to as q sub and q sup respectively we used q sub only for diurnal constituents poleward of 30 vertical diffusivity for ffm was calculated from the empirical relationship hibiya et al 2006 between diapycnal diffusivity in the thermocline estimated from observed fine scale vertical shear and the numerically predicted available energy density of the semidiurnal internal tide the major energy source for diapycnal diffusivity at each location the vertical diffusivity κ far at longitude θ and latitude ϕ was calculated as follows 3 κ far f far θ ϕ b far ϕ 20 for 0 ϕ 20 κ far f far θ ϕ b far for 20 ϕ 30 κ far f far θ ϕ 35 ϕ 5 b far for 30 ϕ 35 κ far b far for 35 ϕ with f far θ ϕ r far log 10 e internal θ ϕ 0 1 for e internal θ ϕ 0 1 j m 3 f far θ ϕ 0 for e internal θ ϕ 0 1 j m 3 where b far and r far are unknown parameters and e internal is the available energy density of the internal tide this dependence on latitude is determined under the assumption that the cascade of internal waves is dominated by wave wave interaction known as parametric subharmonic instability staquet and sommeria 2002 and is consistent with observations we used e internal estimated by niwa and hibiya 2011 for the four major tidal constituents we assumed that κ far is vertically constant on the basis of observations of the relationship between dissipation and stratification in the open ocean away from rough topography waterhouse et al 2014 this scheme was adopted with an emphasis on consistency with observations osafune et al 2021 vertical diffusivity κ in our model is represented as the sum of κ near κ far and the diffusivity from the other schemes for the surface mixed layer noh 2004 and double diffusion due to salt fingering schmitt 1988 and diffusive convection marmorino and caldwell 1976 in the case that stratification was unstable vertical diffusivity was set to 0 1 m2 s 1 to represent convection we made other changes to the model in addition to the replacement of the interior mixing schemes the original model imposes temporally constant heat and salinity fluxes through the whole water column except for the top layer in several regions where the model cannot simulate important processes such as deep convection and inflow from unresolved marginal seas those subsurface fluxes were estimated by restoring potential temperature t and salinity s to annual mean values in the world ocean atlas 1998 antonov et al 1998 during the climatological spin up run using the original ogcm to refine the spreading of dense water formed on the antarctic shelf region to the deep southern ocean we extended the region of the subsurface fluxes around antarctica to the continental shelf and slope shallower than 2000 m south of 69 s we also added the geothermal heat flux based on the global distribution map constructed by davies 2013 by combining a half space conduction model observed heat flow data sets and an assumed relationship between heat flow and geology following toyoda et al 2015 osafune et al 2021 employed a green s function in conducting a linear optimization experiment with the modified ogcm of the present study to reproduce the climatological distribution of water properties the authors estimated optimal values for physical parameters including those in the tidally induced mixing schemes except for γ and showed that the optimized model performs reasonably well in reproducing deep water properties in the pacific ocean from the end of year state of the optimized model this ogcm using the optimized parameters and subsurface fluxes estimated in the optimized model was integrated from 1946 to 2014 using 10 day mean air sea fluxes heat freshwater and momentum derived from the 6 hourly national center for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis 1 during this integration sea surface temperature sst was relaxed to a historical 10 day mean sst dataset compiled from the optimally interpolated sst oisst dataset reynolds et al 2002 extended back to 1946 using the reconstructed reynolds sst dataset whereas sea surface salinity sss was relaxed to the climatological monthly mean sss of the world ocean atlas 1998 woa98 this relaxation corrected the surface freshwater and heat fluxes using the state at the end of 1956 as the initial condition we conducted the first guess run covering the 58 years from 1957 to 2014 in this first guess run we used the corrected fluxes without sst and sss relaxation although exceptions were made in parts of the arctic sea to avoid unrealistically large correction of freshwater flux we did not apply the sst and sss relaxation in the forward model run in the data synthesis experiment 2 2 adjoint model the adjoint code of the ogcm was obtained with the use of the transformation of algorithms in fortran giering and kaminski 2003 the turbulent closure model was excluded from the adjoint model so as to stabilize the latter the original system used the three dimensional initial condition of model variables i e t s sea surface height and horizontal velocities and the 10 day air sea fluxes as the control variables in our new experiment we also used the six globally constant parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes i e q sub q sup ζ γ b far and r far for this purpose we modified the adjoint model to be able to calculate the adjoint sensitivity of these parameters in comparison with previous studies which estimated mixing coefficients in three dimensions without knowledge of mixing this strategy reduces the number of control variables by using the mixing schemes as constraints on vertical diffusivity this enables us to reduce the possible risks of overfitting through unrealistic mixing and to provide an estimation of ocean state that is consistent with the knowledge on which the mixing schemes are based although the reduced controllability of the model might limit the ability to reproduce the ocean state 2 3 cost function our assimilation system seeks an optimized four dimensional dataset by minimizing a cost function as in stammer et al 2002 the cost function is written as 4 j j bg j obs 1 2 a a 0 t b 1 a a 0 1 2 z a y t r 1 z a y where j bg and j obs are background and observation costs respectively a and a 0 represent the vectors of control variables and their first guess values respectively b and r are the background and observation error covariance matrices respectively and z and y are model data and observations respectively the heat and freshwater fluxes corrected through the surface relaxation are used as a 0 r 1 is assumed to be diagonal and each diagonal component of r 1 is inversely proportional to the mean square difference between i the variation in model values from the mean and ii the variation in observation values from the mean while considering a factor that depends on the number of observation data b 1 is assumed to have a tridiagonal form that represents the closeness and smoothness of the air sea fluxes relative to the first guess field each component of b 1 is inversely proportional to the variance of a 0 and its gradients while considering a factor that depends on the area of the grid cell the observations that are assimilated in the original system are subsurface temperature and salinity from the en4 dataset compiled by the hadley centre of the uk meteorological office good et al 2013 sst from historical 10 day datasets compiled from the optimally interpolated sst oisst dataset reynolds et al 2002 and extended reconstructed ersst dataset smith et al 2008 the historical 10 day sea surface dynamic height anomaly ssdha derived from sea surface height data in the copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems dataset and a global mean sea level reconstructed using the method of church and white 2011 which is updated and provided by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro we added an observation cost for ɛ to assimilate observations of ɛ which required the calculation of ɛ in the ogcm we assumed that ɛ is represented by the sum of ɛ near and ɛ far and calculated ɛ far by using the osborn 1980 relationship as ɛ far κ far n 2 γ 1 in this calculation we used the first guess value for γ 0 2 throughout the synthesis experiment to avoid the influence of overestimation of the model ɛ associated with large n 2 in the surface mixed layer where the relationship of osborn 1980 cannot be applied we did not use the adjoint sensitivities of the parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes for the top 200 m observed ɛ is intermittent in both time and space and does not obey a gaussian distribution which is assumed in the quadratic observation cost in the form of eq 4 however we can assume that the logarithm of ɛ approximately obeys a gaussian distribution such an approximation is possible because each observed profile consisting of ln ɛ appears as a path with an intermittent structure that can be considered as being generated from an additive cascade with generators that obey a stable distribution similar to an extent to an uncentered gaussian distribution e g sugiura et al 2020 under this assumption we assimilated the logarithm of ɛ using a quadratic cost we used observational data for ɛ estimated from ctd attached microstructure profilers in the pacific ocean goto et al 2021 we calculated averages of observed ln ɛ in the model grids and defined them as climatological means model ɛ in each grid cell was also averaged over time for the calculation period after taking the natural logarithm these two averages are highly correlated but the model values have a positive bias with respect to the observed values which is expected when the logarithm is taken of each point in an observed intermittent series before averaging using the same observational data as employed in this study sugiura et al 2020 demonstrated that the observed intermittent series of ln ɛ can be considered as being generated from an additive cascade and showed that the logarithm of the spatial average of ɛ becomes larger than the spatial average of ln ɛ with a regular dependence on the resolution referring to the method of those authors we applied a scale correction to the model values the bias b can be calculated as 5 e 1 2 n j 1 2 n l n ɛ j obs l n ɛ j model e 1 2 n j 1 2 n i 1 n g i j 1 2 n i 1 b where e represents an expectation value ɛ j obs is the observed value at the j th vertical observation level ɛ j model is the model value at the corresponding level 2 n is a number of vertical points g i k are the independent and identically distributed random number generators sampled from a stable distribution and s is the floor function which assigns the integer that satisfies 0 s s 1 assuming that the model ɛ represents an average at a scale of 2000 m corresponding to n 9 we used b 3 as the correction the diagonal term of r for ɛ was defined to be proportional to the number of observational data in that grid with a factor determined by balancing with the other observation costs we also added a background cost for the parameters in the two tidally induced mixing schemes the background values were set to the first guess values optimally estimated by osafune et al 2020 using the green s function method the diagonal term of b was defined to be proportional to the uncertainty table 1 with a factor determined by balancing with the other background costs 2 4 data synthesis experiment our assimilation system seeks the minimum of the cost function by iterative calculation of forward and backward adjoint models using the modified system we performed 50 iterations by which stage the cost function became reasonably stable the observation costs decreased by 67 71 and 34 for t s and sst respectively unfortunately no significant cost reduction for ɛ was confirmed and the adjustment of the tidally induced mixing parameter was very small we refer to this new synthesized dataset as the tide case this has been published as version 04a estocv4a on our website osafune et al 2014a we also used our previous synthesized dataset version 03b estocv3b as reference data derived from the original system using the semi empirical mixing scheme we refer to estocv3b as the notide case it is noted that notide is a result after 100 iterations with successive correction for statistics used in the anomaly assimilation in which the bias correction at each level is determined by using the root mean squares of difference in mean and temporal variation between model and observation osafune et al 2015 however tide is a result after 50 iterations without the successive correction this difference in optimization makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions from a comparison between tide and notide however the comparison may indicate the usefulness of tide and the modified assimilation system 2 5 biogeochemical model to evaluate the biogeochemical cycle internal to the ocean using the estimated physical field with the method mentioned above we added a biogeochemical model a lower trophic level ecosystem model to the original ogcm descriptions of this biogeochemical model and its performance can be found in doi et al 2015 the ecosystem model used is a simple npzd model based on the nitrogen cycle the basic compartments of nitrate n phytoplankton p zooplankton z and detritus d are considered as well as the functions of carbon c and oxygen o the temporal rate of change in the distribution of biomass in ecosystem compartment b of the model n p z d c o is represented by the physical processes of advection adv and diffusion diff and the biochemical process sms as follows 6 b t a d v b d i f f b s m s b the estimation of the nitrogen cycle process sms b follows oschlies 2001 but includes the optimization of model parameters to reproduce the distribution of biomass in the global ocean doi et al 2015 the set of optimized model parameters was obtained by carrying out a data synthesis scheme based on a green s function approach to integrate information available from observations e g menemenlis et al 2005 toyoda et al 2013 brix et al 2015 in the carbon cycle and oxygen cycle parts of the model c n and o n ratios from the redfield ratio were assumed for the conversion of nitrogen to carbon and of nitrogen to oxygen in the biomass and biochemical processes 3 results 3 1 vertical diffusivity vertical diffusivity κ shows a marked spatial variation in tide which is consistent with our knowledge of mixing on which tidally induced mixing schemes are based fig 1 at 2000 m κ is generally small around the equator modest in high latitude areas and relatively large around the rough bottom topography in low to mid latitude areas reflecting ffm reflecting nfm κ is large along ridges such as the central ridge in the atlantic and the hawaiian ridge and along sills like those along the kuril and aleutian island chains this distribution is similar to the distribution estimated by applying fine scale parameterization to the argo float data whalen et al 2012 at 3695 m this latitude dependent structure is faintly visible but κ is larger than at 2000 m in many areas this depth dependence is associated with nfm and such large values are seen in regions with rough bottom topography which in the north pacific occur mainly in the western part of the basin particularly large values of κ 100 10 4 m2s 1 seen in some isolated basins such as the philippine basin can be explained by weak stratification in this model this distribution is very similar to that in the model linearly optimized by osafune et al 2021 as the modifications of the parameters in the tidally induced mixing schemes are small table 1 when standardized by their uncertainties the modifications of parameters in ffm are rather larger than those in nfm this suggests that the model is more sensitive to ffm than nfm in this setting however these small modifications suggest that there is room for improvement in the optimization system although it is possible that the first guess values that were optimized by osafune et al 2021 are sufficient without modification the reason for the small modifications should be investigated in future studies but the obtained 4 dimensional state could perhaps be regarded as a result that does not control for those parameters 3 2 climatological bottom water properties here we show the climatological annual mean state of bottom water properties averaged from 4000 to 5500 m the climatological state is defined as the temporal mean from 1972 to 2014 in the synthesized data as a climatological state based on observations we use the world ocean atlas 2018 woa18 garcia et al 2019 the overall pattern of t in woa18 is closely reproduced in tide as in notide fig 2a c to determine whether the reproduction of t is improved in the tide case relative to t in the notide case we show the difference in model bias t tide t woa 18 t notide t woa 18 in fig 2d where the subscripts indicate datasets this comparison shows that on the whole the reproduction of t is improved in tide a relatively large decrease in model bias from notide to tide is seen in the southern ocean indian ocean and western atlantic these decreases are related to warm biases in the notide case which are less pronounced in the tide case fig 2e f although the increase in the model bias shown by red in fig 2d indicates that the reproduction of t is degraded from notide to tide in the eastern region in both the pacific and atlantic the increase is generally less than 0 1 c and is smaller than the broader scale decrease in addition the overall pattern of s in woa18 is closely reproduced in tide as in notide fig 3a c the difference in model bias for s between the tide and notide cases shows that on the whole the reproduction of s is improved in tide in comparison with notide whereas a large increase in model bias from notide to tide is seen in parts of the eastern south atlantic fig 3d model bias is substantially decreased in the western atlantic especially in the northern hemisphere the next largest decrease in model bias from notide to tide is seen in the western pacific which corresponds to the model reproduction of water with relatively high salinity s 34 7 these decreases are related to relatively large biases in notide which are less pronounced in the tide case fig 3e f 3 3 decadal abyssal water change here we investigate the reproduction of the decadal change in t in the abyssal ocean below 3000 m to the bottom which we divided into three layers as in the estimation from observation obs by kouketsu et al 2011 fig 4 in tide a positive decadal change in t is widely distributed in the abyssal ocean this positive change is large in the southern ocean and western atlantic in all three layers as in obs in the pacific ocean this positive change is distributed in almost the entire region in the two layers below 4000 m and the region of this positive change in t appears to extend from the southern ocean to the northern north pacific along its western part with its amplitude decreasing to the north this pattern is consistent with that of obs a negative decadal change in t is seen at depths generally shallower than 4000 m in the eastern pacific and eastern atlantic this pattern of negative change is also similar to that of obs in addition there is a negative decadal change in t in all three layers below 3000 m in the western indian ocean in tide this negative change is consistent with that of obs below 4000 m whereas there is a positive change with large uncertainty above 4000 m in obs focusing on the region below 4000 m the reproduction of the above mentioned pattern appears to be improved on the whole in tide relative to notide although it is difficult to determine which of these reproductions is realistic because of the large uncertainty in obs the pacific ocean is one such region for a depth range of 4000 5000 m the warming region extends continuously from the southern ocean to the northern north pacific in tide but is divided at around 30 n in notide the amplitude of warming in notide is much larger than that of obs in the southern to equatorial pacific in addition the negative change in t below 4000 m in the western indian ocean in tide is consistent with that of obs whereas there is a positive change in notide 3 4 abyssal water temperature budget the improved reproduction of the abyssal warming with the refined physical processes that probably have a strong influence on abyssal water properties i e vertical mixing and or geothermal heating motivates us to investigate the contributions of each process to the improved warming in tide here we investigate the budget for the decadal change in bottom water temperature in the pacific ocean by using monthly average fluxes between grid cells in the ogcm it is noted that vertical diffusion was implicitly solved in the simulation for stability thus the vertical diffusion flux diagnosed by the explicit method was output for the budget analysis we consider average t within a water column from 3695 m to the bottom in each horizontal grid cell 7 t t 1 δ v ω t d v where δ v is the volume of the water column and ω is the domain of the water column using the three dimensional flux caused by advection and diffusion f adv and f diff the conservation equation for t is written as 8 t t 1 δ v ω f adv f diff n d s where ω is the surface of the domain and n is an inward unit vector normal to the surface by decomposing the contribution by diffusion on the right hand side to three components related to the horizontal flux across the lateral boundary the vertical flux across the upper boundary and geothermal heat flux across the bottom boundary this equation can be rewritten as 9 t t f adv f hdiff f vdiff f geoth where the terms f with superscripts adv hdiff vdiff and geoth denote contributions from each component related to advection the horizontal and vertical components of diffusion and geothermal heat flux respectively by integrating this equation over time we obtain 10 t t t 0 c adv c hdiff c vdiff c geoth where c denotes the temporal integration of f from this we calculate the contributions of each component to the decadal change in t δ t as 11 δ t δ c adv δ c hdiff δ c vdiff δ c geoth as horizontal diffusion represents a kind of advection by eddies we hereinafter refer to the sum of advection and horizontal diffusion as advection the sum of those four components is very similar to δ t fig 5a b meaning that the error in the vertical diffusion flux diagnosed by the explicit method is negligible in this analysis in most regions δ c vdiff is positive fig 5c particularly large positive values 0 01 c decade 1 are confined to small areas except for in the southern ocean where the contribution from the vertical component of isopycnal mixing is large these large positive values appear around the rough topography that is located mainly in the western pacific ocean this distribution corresponds closely to the distribution of large values of κ at 3695 m depth which is associated with nfm fig 1b this correspondence suggests that the particularly strong heating associated with the vertical component of diffusion is generally related to vertical mixing by nfm in the pacific ocean in most of the remaining regions δ c vdiff is relatively small 0 004 c decade 1 and it is especially small 0 002 c decade 1 in the northern north pacific and the western equatorial region likely because of the small κ associated with the spatial distribution of ffm the spatial distribution of δ c geoth which is positive everywhere reflects almost directly the distribution of the geothermal fluxes although it is modified according to the spatial variation in the bottom depth fig 5d particularly large positive values 0 01 c decade 1 are confined to small areas located mainly in the eastern pacific ocean along the pacific antarctic ridge and along the west coast of north america in most of the remaining regions δ c geoth is relatively small 0 004 c decade 1 unlike δ c vdiff there are no regions where δ c geoth is smaller than 0 002 c decade 1 we note that δ t is quite different from the sum of these heating effects as it has no small scale structures with particularly large values this is explained by the remaining advection term δ c adv δ c hdiff fig 5e which is negative in most regions fig 5e with a structure similar to the sum of δ c vdiff and δ c geoth but with the opposite sign particularly large negative values are confined to small areas where particularly large positive values of δ c vdiff and or δ c geoth are located as a result these particularly large positive and negative values tend to cancel each other out resulting in the lack of small scale structures in δ t this cancellation of values means that the particularly large heat added sparsely in space spreads quickly by advection thus we need to consider the effect of spreading due to advection to understand where and to what extent the heat added by each heating process affects δ t we also note that the advection term does not have a structure similar to the warming pattern this result is not necessarily inconsistent with masuda et al 2010 who suggested that weakening of the cooling via advection may cause abyssal water warming this mechanism can explain our result if the warming is caused by a weakening of the cooling via advection and the weakening is sufficiently minor that the spatial structure is unaltered to determine the size of the imbalance we show the temporal variation in each budget term eq 9 fig 6a shows the budget term for the region enclosed in the box in fig 5a where the decadal change in t appears to be improved in tide compared with notide the heating effect due to vertical diffusion is almost constant and is more than two times larger than the effect due to geothermal heat flux supporting the importance of vertical mixing in this region the cooling effect due to horizontal diffusion is nearly constant whereas the cooling effect due to advection varies significantly with an almost annual cycle reflecting the variation in advection the tendency varies significantly with rare negative values fig 6b shows the time integral of each budget term and reveals that the imbalance corresponding to the warming is small in comparison with the sum of the heating effects and with the absolute value of the sum of cooling effects meaning that the imbalance is small it is noted that all of the terms in fig 6b including advection are nearly linear this linearity indicates that the warming results from a near steady imbalance suggesting that the warming occurs over a long timescale and the cause of this warming may lie outside of the model period we also note that the distribution of the particularly large positive values clearly differs between δ c vdiff and δ c geoth and only δ c vdiff has such values in the western region this pattern implies that heating by vertical mixing probably nfm plays an important role in determining the improved reproduction of bottom water warming that is enhanced in the western pacific ocean however it is unclear whether relatively weak but broadly distributed heating in both δ c vdiff and δ c geoth can be ignored in determining the spatial structure of the improved warming to confirm the importance of nfm we conducted forward impact experiments as described in the following section 3 5 forward impact experiment as discussed above because of the large effect of spreading by advection it is unclear from the eulerian budget where and to what extent the heat added by each process affects δ t in tide here we conducted two forward impact experiments that use the same ogcm initial conditions and fluxes as for tide in one experiment nfm is reduced by 10 herein the nfm90 experiment and in the other the geothermal flux is reduced by 10 herein the geoth90 experiment by subtracting δ t in each impact experiment from δ t in tide we obtain the sensitivity of δ t to a 10 increase in each heating process it is noted that we used the prescribed heat and freshwater fluxes optimized by data assimilation and did not restore sst and sss in the forward run in the data synthesis experiment therefore those fluxes were not altered in response to the differences in sst and sss from tide meaning that these experiments allow the pure response of the ocean to the reduction in nfm and the geothermal flux to be determined the deviation of δ t from nfm90 to tide is positive over almost the entire pacific and is large in the region from the equatorial to the western north pacific fig 7a in contrast the deviation of δ t from geoth90 to tide which is positive over the entire pacific is large in the eastern regions fig 7b we also conducted an additional forward impact experiment that reduced the effect of ffm by 10 but its impact is several times weaker than those from reducing nfm and geothermal flux not shown this finding indicates that heating by nfm is effective in causing the enhanced bottom water warming in the western pacific ocean at least in tide implying that the incorporation of the nfm scheme was important in improving the reproduction of abyssal water warming 3 6 changes in dissolved inorganic carbon fluctuations as an example of biogeochemical analysis using estoc here we show temporal changes in the increasing rate of dic storage in the global ocean fig 8 which is closely related to absorption of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere the rate of increase was 1 2 pgc yr 1 in the 2000s and reached 2 pgc yr 1 in the middle of the 2010s in tide this long term change is similar to the increasing rate in notide and the increasing rate reported by doi et al 2015 who used the previous version of notide this similarity suggests that the long term change is controlled mainly by anthropogenic co2 in the atmosphere to evaluate the absorption of anthropogenic co2 by the ocean after the beginning of the experiment in 1957 we conducted an additional experiment in which the co2 concentration in the atmosphere was assumed to be constant and equal to that in january 1957 and the other conditions were the same as in tide we assumed that the natural changes in carbon budgets were obtained with the additional experiment and defined anthropogenic carbon as the deviation of the co2 concentration of the normal experiment from the additional experiment the carbon budget without anthropogenic carbon in the global ocean was about 0 7 pgc yr 1 although the outgassing emission might be influenced by model bias and or initial conditions this value is consistent with natural co2 outgassing from the ocean to the atmosphere estimated in previous studies e g resplandy et al 2018 taking this value into account the anthropogenic co2 absorption by the ocean was about 1 9 2 7 pgc yr 1 in tide similar to the values reported in previous studies using different methods e g le quéré et al 2018 focusing on interannual changes there is a slight difference between tide and notide in particular the increasing rate of dic in tide around 2000 was higher than the corresponding rate in notide this difference in the interannual change in the rate of increase must also be related mainly to differences in the rate of co2 absorption from the atmosphere the difference in primary production between these experiments was too small to account for the difference in atmospheric co2 absorption although the difference in vertical diffusivity between tide and notide could influence the nutrient supply from under the mixed layer into the surface layer therefore the excess co2 absorbed around 2000 in tide compared with notide was most likely transported below the mixed layer by the stronger vertical mixing relative to notide however differences in the spatial patterns of water column inventory increases from 1990 to 2010 between tide and notide seems to be strongly influenced by circulation change rather than local changes in vertical diffusivity not shown as a large amount of anthropogenic carbon was in the upper ocean even in the 2010s e g khatiwala et al 2013 it might be difficult to discern the effect of marked spatial changes in vertical diffusivity near the bottom on changes in the distribution of anthropogenic carbon this suggests that the impact of circulation change which depends on the vertical mixing parameterization should be evaluated to obtain improved estimates of carbon and biogeochemical circulation 4 discussion we have shown that the reproduction of both climatological state and the temporal change in abyssal water properties is on the whole improved in tide in comparison with notide although tide has a smaller and possibly insufficient number of iterations for optimization than notide this improved reproduction of abyssal ocean state with refined physical processes that play major roles in determining deep water properties i e vertical mixing and or geothermal heating makes our new synthesized dataset valuable at least for understanding the deep ocean we investigated the modest but broadly distributed bottom water warming in the pacific ocean which is closely reproduced in our new dataset by using a budget for bottom water temperature and forward impact experiments the bottom water warming derives from a small imbalance between larger effects of heating by vertical diffusion and geothermal flux and cooling by advection and that the downward heat flux by bottom intensified nfm which is large in the western pacific ocean operates effectively in forming the improved distribution of bottom water warming in the pacific ocean in our new ogcm it is unclear from the results of the budget analysis and the impact experiments whether the use of nfm is essential for improving the reproduction of abyssal ocean state however the results clearly show that vertical mixing can have a substantial impact on ocean state estimation it is possible that the existence of downward heat flux by nfm in the first guess run makes it easier to reproduce the bottom water warming through synthesis experiments suggesting the importance of using knowledge of vertical mixing as a priori information in ocean state estimation the cause of this abyssal water warming is not clear from this study however the budget analysis suggests that the warming in the north pacific occurs over a long timescale and its cause may lie outside of the model period this interpretation is consistent with the study of masuda et al 2010 who suggested that the warming is a result of the change in circulation caused by internal waves that propagate from the southern ocean over a period of about four decades this proposed mechanism suggests that the source of this warming is embedded in the initial state in our dataset therefore refining the modification of the initial state through data assimilation should be an important aspect of developing more reliable deep ocean state estimation further refinement of physical processes in the ogcm should enhance the reliability of the dynamics reproduced in our ocean state estimation and may improve the reproduction of the ocean state not only in the deep ocean there is still large uncertainty in the representation of vertical mixing in the modified ogcm it remains unclear where and how far field internal tides dissipate and cause ffm although we used an ffm scheme associated with the cascade to smaller scales through wave wave interaction there are other mechanisms hypothesized as potential dissipators of far field internal tides mackinnon et al 2017 depending on the mechanism ɛ has a different vertical structure which affects the structure of ocean circulation and the thermocline melet et al 2016 also although we assume that the vertical decay scale in nfm ζ is constant globally its value depends on the wave number of the bottom topography and the tidal flow amplitude hibiya et al 2017 although this dependency is not considered here de lavergne et al 2020 presented a tidally induced vertical mixing scheme that considers nfm and ffm associated with some cascade mechanisms we focused only on tidally induced mixing but it may be important to consider mixing that is related to processes involving wind e g alford et al 2016 and geostrophic currents e g bell 1975 large uncertainty exists not only for the interior mixing focused on in this study but also for the mixing in the surface boundary layer which affects water mass formation and thereby water properties in the ocean interior large et al 1994 li et al 2019 we do not consider mixing related to wave current interaction qiao et al 2004 or near inertial waves jochum et al 2013 which affects the temperature structure in the surface layer including sst those mixing schemes should affect the estimation of surface heat flux and thus the global heat budget mixing varies widely over various time scales moum 2021 and it may be important to consider temporal variations in interior mixing which could have an impact on circulation and also temperature and salinity structures nakamura et al 2014 osafune et al 2014b 2020 it is not clear which combination of schemes would be best but it would be possible to verify the effectiveness of the schemes by using ocean state estimation as in this study energetical consistency is an important aspect in obtaining a reliable global ocean circulation we adopted the ffm scheme based on the empirical relationship of hibiya et al 2006 with an emphasis on consistency with observations of turbulence this does not necessarily guarantee consistency with the global energy budget to avoid energetically unrealistic simulations we directly introduced constraints on turbulent energy here we attempted to make a well balanced data synthesis scheme considering both observations and dynamics energetics more recent schemes which are weighted with respect to energetics e g oka and niwa 2013 eden and olbers 2014 would be applicable to forecasting based on data synthesis in our data synthesis experiment there is no clear decrease in the observation cost for local ɛ this may be because the scale corrected ɛ in the first guess run is highly consistent with the observed ɛ we note however that this level of consistency depends on the averaging scale employed in the scale correction therefore the validity of the scale correction needs to be examined in a future study also it is possible that this absence of a clear decrease is related to the design of our adjoint model which only calculates the sensitivity of diffusivity to the cost for local ɛ whereas ɛ also depends on n 2 we adopted this choice because we are interested in adjusting mixing parameters however this neglect of the sensitivity of n 2 to ɛ may make it difficult to decrease the cost for local ɛ although it is unclear whether the cost for ɛ is effective in this experiment it is expected that this cost could serve to suppress the unrealistic adjustment of mixing parameters that could occur in relation to other observation costs to enhance the reliability of this cost we should use more observations of turbulence however as the number of direct observations of ɛ based on microstructure measurement is limited it would be useful to include those observations in existing more extensive databases based on fine scale parameterizations e g kunze 2017 whalen et al 2015 it has been shown that ogcms using background vertical diffusivity obtained by applying a fine scale parameterization to argo work well in reproducing temperature over the tropical pacific zhu and zhang 2018 2019 this close reproduction suggests the usefulness of assimilating ɛ based on fine scale parameterizations it is expected that more extensive databases of direct observations will be obtained by float observation e g roemmich et al 2019 in addition it should prove useful to impose a cost on the global integrated value of tidal energy dissipation and or to use a more realistic scheme that is confirmed from observations of turbulence e g de lavergne et al 2020 so far we have focused on turbulent mixing in the vertical direction only whereas previous data synthesis experiments that adjusted mixing coefficients in three dimensions have shown that the adjustment of coefficients related to lateral turbulent mixing makes a larger contribution to the reduction in the cost function we used globally constant isopycnal thickness and horizontal diffusivities that osafune et al 2021 optimally estimated with parameters in the tidally induced mixing schemes however many studies have shown that those parameters have spatial variation our strategy using parameterizations and adjusting global constants in them can be used to synthesize knowledge regarding lateral mixing our recent work has involved developing a 4d var data synthesis system and generating an ocean state estimation dataset obtained by data synthesis experiments such as that reported in this study as well as updating reanalysis terms on our website http www godac jamstec go jp estoc e index html in the future we plan to update the mixing scheme especially ffm to improve the physical state of the upper ocean we also intend to introduce dissolved iron and an adjustment of the settling flux through particulate organic matter to improve the accuracy of estimation of the state of biogeochemical cycles credit authorship contribution statement satoshi osafune

corresponding author a modified thermodynamic sea ice model suitable for large scale climate simulations is described originated from the winton s three layer model framework this new model includes several improvements in the vertical thermodynamics 1 the number of ice layers increases from two to three 2 the snow heat capacity is included 3 a vertically varying salinity profile is implemented and 4 a temperature and salinity dependent heat conductivity parameterization scheme is introduced a non iterative fully implicit time stepping scheme similar to winton s model is used to calculate the temperature of ice and snow results from a series of one dimensional experiments show that equilibrium ice thickness in the modified model is increased by 45 cm when compared with the original winton s model all modifications mentioned above contribute to this change of ice thickness among which the increase of ice layer has the most significant effect experiments using the modular ocean model version 4 mom4 coupled with the modified model show an improved sea ice simulation which includes an increase in both the sea ice volume and thickness over the entire arctic region confirming the above founding however contrary model behavior exhibits when the snow heat capacity is considered that warrants further investigation keywords thermodynamic sea ice model vertical thermodynamic arctic sea ice sea ice simulator 1 introduction the sea ice is a fundamental component of the earth climate system and an amplifier of the global climate change since the 1970s the arctic sea ice has been declining rapidly with the accelerating global warming particularly during summer cavalieri and parkinson 2012 onarheim et al 2018 on one hand significant changes in sea ice will amplify the polar warming through the positive ice albedo feedback mechanism screen and simmonds 2010 jahn and holland 2013 on the other hand these changes can also influence the atmospheric circulation and ocean thermohaline circulation by altering air sea heat fluxes and sea ice salt freshwater fluxes consequently affecting the global climate meier et al 2014 yamanouchi and takata 2020 climate system models are effective tools to study the evolution characteristics of sea ice under a changing climate results from the fifth and sixth phases of the global coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 6 have shown that most current climate system models fail to simulate the accelerated decline of observed arctic sea ice in recent decades stroeve et al 2012 shu et al 2020 this model deficiency is at least partly due to the incapability of the sea ice model used in these cmip5 6 class models to simulate realistically the sea ice mean state and variability therefore continuous development and optimization of sea ice component in climate system models are of great significance for a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms governing the sea ice as well as the climate prediction and projection researches on thermodynamic sea ice models started as early as 1970s maykut and untersteiner 1971 developed a one dimensional thermodynamic sea ice model in which the surface energy balances determine the sea ice growth rate and diffusion equations govern the heat transport within the ice in addition this model takes into account the effects of the snow cover brine pockets bubbles internal heating due to penetration of incoming shortwave radiation vertical varying ice density and thermal conductivity the model performs well in simulating sea ice thickness and temperature however it is seldom used in practical climate simulations as it takes too long to reach the equilibrium state due to the too complex physical processes and too many vertical layers involved semtner 1976 simplified this model as three layer and zero layer versions in addition the finite difference method is used to solve model equations making it suitable for three dimensional simulations the semtner model and its varying versions have been widely used in various fields such as the thermodynamic processes of sea ice fichefet and maqueda 1977 koga and krstic 2019 the air sea ice interaction cheng et al 2003 heimbach et al 2010 wang et al 2019 and the sea ice simulation and prediction silva et al 2015 bitz and lipscomb 1999 proposed a multi layer sea ice thermodynamic model the model is energy conserved by taking into account effect of the brine pocket on the latent heat of sea ice thus can significantly reduce the spurious sea ice when compared with energy non conservation models inspired by this work winton 2000 developed a reformulated three layer thermodynamic sea ice model one snow layer and two sea ice layers hereafter referred to as win2000 based on the semtner s model where the effect of brine pockets on the latent heat of melting is considered only in the upper sea ice layer due to the dominant occurrence of surface melting this model uses a non iterative fully implicit time stepping scheme to solve the forecast equations for ice temperature which is more computationally efficient for long term climate simulations compared with the more sophisticated model of bitz and lipscomb 1999 because of this the noaa s geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl sea ice model named the sea ice simulator sis takes win2000 as its thermodynamic framework the gfdl sis has been adopted as the sea ice component by many climate system models in the world due to its high portability and computational efficiency watts et al 2021 however delworth et al 2006 found that poor representation of vertical thermodynamics processes of sea ice in sis is still a big obstacle for the accurate sea ice simulation and prediction by analyzing the simulation results from the cmip5 and cmip6 models it is found that most coupled models adopting sis as sea ice component show similar bias such as the thinner ice and overestimation underestimation sea ice extent in winter summer shu et al 2015 long et al 2021 this also suggests that the biases may be related to the deficiency of the sis therefore in this study a range of modifications have been made to win2000 specifically one additional ice layer is added which makes the vertical resolution of the model become four layers with one snow layer and three ice layers and a vertically varying sea ice salinity profile is implemented besides the heat capacity of snow and the influence of the sea ice salinity and temperature on the thermal conductivity are also taken into account this modified thermodynamic sea ice framework is then applied to the gfdl modular ocean model version 4 mom4 for long term simulations and the superiority and deficiency of the modified model in simulating the arctic sea ice are further discussed the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief introduction to the modified thermodynamic sea ice model in section 3 the performance of the model on arctic sea ice simulation is analyzed and the causes for improvements are explored through sensitivity tests finally section 4 presents the main conclusions and discussion 2 model description the new modified four layer thermodynamic model consists of one snow layer and three ice layers with equal thickness as shown in fig 1 table 1 shows the specifics of physical variables in the model and the physical constants in the following equations and physical parameterization schemes the brine content of the upper ice is represented with a varying specific heat capacity while constant specific heat capacity is adopted in the snow as well as the middle and lower ice layers compared with win2000 the most significant modifications of the new model are the increase of one vertical ice layer the consideration of snow heat capacity zero capacity snow layer in win2000 and a more sophisticated description of the sea ice salinity and thermal conductivity similar to the win2000 the integral process of the modified model can be divided into the following three steps first the model calculates surface penetrating solar radiation and the air ice ocean heat fluxes on the basis of the atmospheric and oceanic forcing fields and the sea ice thickness and temperature at the previous step note that the solar radiation absorbed by the ice is calculated in each ice layer in the modified model fig 1 whereas in win2000 it is assumed that all solar radiation trapped in ice is absorbed by the upper layer second the ice snow surface temperature t s f the ice temperature t 1 t 2 and t 3 as well as the snow temperature t s are calculated by solving the new ice snow heat diffusion equations as shown below in the last step the ice snow temperature calculated in the second step is used to calculate the energy fluxes on the surface and at the bottom of the sea ice according to which the thicknesses of sea ice and snow as well as the surface temperature and temperatures of each ice snow layer and are adjusted 2 1 model equations and solutions internal temperatures of ice and snow are determined by the heat diffusion equations based on the snow and ice enthalpy referring to bitz and lipscomb 1999 the energy required to melt a unit mass of sea ice is defined as the enthalpy which is expressed as 1 e t s c i t μ s l 1 μ s t where t and s are the sea ice temperature and salinity respectively the specific heat capacity of sea ice c i 2110 j kg 1 c 1 the empirical constant μ 0 054 c psu 1 representing the coefficient relating sea ice melting temperature to salinity assur 1958 and the constant latent heat for melting of pure ice l 334 kj kg 1 since the salinity of the snow layer is zero the enthalpy expression is as 2 e s t s c s t s l where c s denotes the snow specific heat capacity that equals to the specific heat capacity of ice for the ice layers the term l 1 μ s t in eq 1 represents the melting latent heat per unit mass of sea ice with the influence of brine pockets since the sea ice temperature t μ s there is no singularity in this term however the μ s t has a large effect on the value of this term when t is close to 0 c due to the relatively high melting point of the upper ice layer in middle and lower layers of sea ice since the temperature ranges between the sea ice surface and bottom temperatures freezing point temperature and thus the influence of μ s t on the term l 1 μ s t in eq 1 is relatively small the experiments from bitz and lipscomb 1999 have shown that when t 2 c and s 3 2 psu l 1 μ s t 0 92 l ebert and curry 1993 suggested that setting l 1 μ s t 0 9 l in sea ice models does not cause significant biases in simulating the formation and ablation rate of the sea ice in the bottom layer similar results can also be found in gabison 1987 and cheng et al 2008 therefore in this study the influence of brine pockets on the melting latent heat is not considered in middle and lower sea ice layers the enthalpy of the middle and lower sea ice layers is correspondingly expressed as 3 e t s c i t μ s l the change in the enthalpy reflects the energy budget in the sea ice and snow layers the heat diffusion equation per unit mass of sea ice and snow is 4 d e d t f where f is the net heat income per unit mass of sea ice snow in combination with eqs 1 2 3 4 and fig 1 the heat diffusion equations of the snow and three ice layers can be obtained 5 c s ρ s h s d t s d t k a s t sf t s k s i t 1 t s 6 ρ i h i 3 c i l μ s 1 t 1 2 d t 1 d t k s i t s t 1 k 1 2 t 2 t 1 i 1 7 ρ i h i c i 3 d t 2 d t

ice with a thickness of z without being absorbed f s w the downward visible solar radiation α the sea ice albedo and κ 1 49 m 1 the extinction coefficient of sea ice according to the solar radiation penetrating the sea ice with different thicknesses the absorbed solar radiation for ice layer k can be derived as 14 i k i 0 p k 1 h i 3 p k h i 3 where i 0 is the fraction of solar radiation that penetrates the upper ice surface which is formulated following hunke et al 2013 15 i 0 0 3 1 h s h s 0 02 here we assume that the snow does not absorb solar radiation note that snow absorbs relatively more solar radiation than ice due to a much bigger attenuation coefficient lecomte et al 2011 this implies the necessity of sophisticated representation of radiation transfer for snow in our modified

downward solar radiation f r 1 α the incoming solar radiation into the ice snow surface i 0 the penetrating solar radiation into sea ice snow f l the downward long wave radiation and σ t s f 4 the upward long wave radiation f s e n and f l a t represent the sensible and latent heat fluxes between the ice snow and the air which are calculated by a modified bulk formula by lu et al 2013 it is found that this algorithm has the superiority in flux parameterizations over the sea ice region wu et al 2019 a first order taylor expansion of t s f is performed to discrete eq 16 if there is snow according to fig 1 the energy balance equation on snow surface is 17 f sf t sf k a s t s t sf f sf t ˆ sf f sf t ˆ sf t sf t sf t ˆ sf when there is no snow rewriting eq 17 as 18 f sf t sf k s i t 1 t

temperature of seawater s w is the seawater salinity a b b 0 c 0 a 1 b 1 c 1 b 2 and c 2 are all functions of the surface temperature temperature and thickness of snow and sea ice at the previous time step as well as sea ice salinity which can be treated as known quantities therefore firstly solve eq 31 for t 1 and then solve eqs 20 19 and 25 for t s t 2 and t 3 in turn finally solve eq 17 for t s

1 i 1 in this case the sea ice temperature equation comprises eqs 11 12 18 and 33 and the solution procedure is similar to the case with snow omitted 2 2 sea ice salinity profile and thermal conductivity in win2000 the ice salinity is distributed uniformly from the upper to lower ice layers maykut and grenfell 1975 eicken 1992 while this isosaline profile is observed in the arctic and antarctic during winter for first year ice maykut and grenfell 1975 eicken 1992 more observations reveal an upward decreasing distribution of sea ice salinity for multiyear ice tucker iii et al 1987 eicken et al 1995b currently the most widely used profile of this type is the vertically varying salinity profile developed by bitz and lipscomb 1999 which is based on the work of schwarzacher 1959 numerical study on this profile by vancoppenolle et al 2006 demonstrates substantial differences in ice thickness and ice ocean salt flux when comparing to the isosaline salinity profile situation vancoppenolle et al 2006 therefore the bitz and lipscomb 1999 profile is adopted in the modified model 34 s n 1 6 1 cos π z a b z where z n 0 5 n and n denotes the n th layer in addition a and b are empirical constants where a 0 407 and b 0 573 and n is the total number of sea ice layers the salinity profile does not vary with time and the ice salinity at each layer is determined by its relative position as shown in fig 2 the ice salinity in the modified model increases gradually from the upper to the lower layers with the lowest at the upper ice surface s t 0 and the highest at the bottom surface s b 3 2 psu for the thermal conductivity of ice win2000 takes a constant value of 2 03 w m 1 k 1 for the thermal conductivity of pure ice while the modified model employs the parameterization scheme proposed by pringle et al 2007 this scheme is developed based on the observations in the antarctic and arctic which is expressed as a function of sea ice salinity and temperature 35 k n ρ i 917 2 11 0 011 t n 0 09 s n t n where ρ i denotes the sea ice density t n and s n the sea ice temperature salinity respectively in the ice layer n this scheme accounts for the impacts of sea ice salinity and temperature on its thermal conductivity and has been applied to well known sea ice models such as the los alamos sea ice model cice hunke et al 2013 and the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim rousset et al 2015 based on thermal conductivities in three sea ice layers namely k 1 k 2 and k 3 the effective thermal conductivities at interface of layers fig 1 are defined as follows k a s 2 k s h s k s i 6 k 1 k s 3 k 1 h s k s h i k 1 2 6 k 1 k 2 k 1 k 2 h i 36 k 2 3 6 k 2 k 3 k 2 k 3 h i k 3 4 6 k 3 h i where the snow thermal conductivity k s 0 31 w m 1 k 1 2 3 sea ice growth and decay the growth and decay of the sea ice cover are mainly governed by the top and bottom heat forcing which are calculated by the updated t s f t s and t 1 in section 2 1 when there is snow 37 m s k a s t s t

conductivity u the friction velocity between the ocean and the sea ice and sst the sea surface temperature the melting of the ice snow layer is firstly processed for the surface layer if m s 0 the melting of the snow layer starts from the surface to the bottom and the thicknesses of the snow layer and each sea ice layer change to δ h s m i n m s δ t e s t s ρ s h s δ h 1 min max m s δ t e s t s

h 2 and h 3 are the upper middle and lower ice layer thickness respectively for sea ice bottom melting m b 0 the treatment is similar but the direction of the melting is from the bottom to the surface the formation of new ice mainly occurs at the bottom of the ice layer if m b 0 the increment of new ice thickness δ h 3 δ t m b e t f s b will be added in the lower ice layer among them e t f s b is the enthalpy of the newly formed ice at the temperature t f and the salinity s b which can be calculated by eq 3 the new lower ice layer temperature is calculated based on enthalpy conservation the

further adjusted to initialize the state of integration for next time step firstly the thickness of the snow layer is changed if new snowfall event or snow ice formation occurs secondly the thickness of each ice layer is equalized the specific steps are as follows the new snowfall is firstly treated in the model specifically for the snowfall with a thickness of δ h s the model assumes the ice snow surface temperature t s f as its temperature and the adjusted thickness of snow layer is h s δ h s similarly an enthalpy conservation equation similar to eq 42 can be constructed to solve for the temperature of the new snow layer 44 t s n o w h s t s δ h s t sf h s δ h s similar to win2000 the modified model performs the snow ice conversion for the snow below the waterline based on the buoyancy equation the snow below the waterline is given by 45 δ h s m a x h s ρ w ρ i ρ s h i ρ i ρ w 0 into the upper layer ice 46 δ h i m a x h s ρ w ρ i ρ s h i ρ s ρ w 0 where ρ w and ρ s are the densities of seawater and snow respectively after the snow ice conversion the temperature of the snow layer remains unchanged and the temperature of the upper ice layer can be calculated by solving an enthalpy conservation equation similar to eq 42 finally if there is still sea ice existed after the above adjustments then the thickness of each ice layer is equalized to facilitate the integration for the next time step this process would cause mass exchange among different ice layers here we suppose the temperature of the ice layer that donates sea ice remains unchanged while the temperature of the layer receiving sea ice is adjusted base on the enthalpy conservation for example if sea ice with thickness of δ h transfers from lower to upper ice layer in this situation both the upper and middle sea ice layers have been fully melted the sum of enthalpies of the fraction from the lower ice layer and original upper ice layer should equal to that of the new upper ice layer 47 δ h h 1 e 1 t 1 n e w s 1 h 1 e 1 t 1 s 1 δ h e 3 t 3 s 3 solving the above equation gives 48 t 1 n e w t t 2 4 l μ s 1 c i 2 where 49 t h 1 δ h h 1 t 1 δ h δ h h 1 t 3 μ δ h δ h h 1 s 3 s 1 h 1 l μ s 1 δ h h 1 t 1 c i similar method is adopted if mutual transformations occur among other sea ice layers it is worth to note that when the sea ice coverts from the upper to the middle layer or from the middle to the lower layer the adjusted sea ice temperature of the receiving layer may exceed its freezing temperature as its freezing temperature is relatively low in this case the sea ice temperature of the receiving layer is fixed at its freezing temperature and the excess energy will be redistributed in the three ice layers to ensure same thicknesses of ice melting at each layer 3 model performance in arctic sea ice simulation 3 1 1 d experiments a series of 1 d simulations are firstly conducted to evaluate the new thermodynamic sea ice model and compare it with the original win2000 model the standard forcing data is the climatological atmospheric and oceanic conditions which are widely used in the literature bitz and lipscomb 1999 vancoppenolle et al 2006 the monthly values of these surface forcing data downwelling radiative and turbulent heat fluxes are typical of the central arctic region the surface albedo is same as in win2000 the ocean ice heat flux is set to 2 0 w m2 all experiments are run for 50 years with detailed design shown in table 2 in e1d new and e1d win the modified sea ice thermodynamic framework introduced above and the original win2000 are employed respectively in e1d sen1 the new 4 layer vertical framework is used but the salinity and thermal conductivity of sea ice are constants same as in win2000 and the heat capacity effect of snow is not taken into account zero capacity e1d sen2 is similar to e1d sen1 but with the heat capacity effect of snow being considered e1d sen3 is similar to e1d sen2 but a vertical varying profile scheme of sea ice salinity is adopted specifically a comparison between e1d sen1 and e1d win can help explore the impact of the increasing in vertical resolution of the model on sea ice simulation the effect of snow heat capacity on sea ice simulation by comparing e1d sen2 with e1d sen1 and the influences of vertical varying salinity profile and sea ice thermal conductivity parameterization scheme on sea ice simulation by comparing e1d sen2 and e1d new with e1d sen3 respectively fig 3a shows the first annual cycle after initializing with the same ice thickness for the five experiments while the phase variations of the sea ice thickness are nearly the same magnitude difference among five experiments is significant during the melt season as a result the equilibrium thickness for the first 50 years of the integration is substantially different as shown in fig 3b the new model exhibits a highest equilibrium thickness which is about 45 cm greater than the original win2000 model 259 cm in e1d new versus 214 cm in e1d win all modifications focusing on the ice thermodynamic contribute to this change of ice thickness among which the increase of the vertical resolution from three to four layers has the most significant effect followed by inclusion of heat conductivity parameterization scheme the consideration of snow heat capacity and the vertical varying salinity profile also play a role but their contributions are relatively small fig 3b fig 3c shows the last annual cycle of ice temperature averaged for all ice layers it is found that the all experiments are quite consistent with each other the largest difference is that the ice temperatures in e1d new e1d sen2 and e1d sen3 are somewhat colder than other two experiments in all seasons except for summer this phenomenon demonstrates the role of the consideration of snow heat capacity the possible reason is that the energy that need to melt the same mass of snow is increased when the snow heat capacity is considered according to eq 2 this may reduce the melting rate of snow and consequently lessen the input solar radiation thus although thicker sea ice in e1d new e1d sen2 and e1d sen3 can relatively absorb more solar radiation the decrease of total input solar radiation into the sea ice eventually leads to colder ice in these experiments fig 3b c 3 2 3 d experiments the modified model is then couple into the sea ice part sis of the ocean model gfdl mom4 to further assess its performance in simulating the arctic sea ice the sea ice in mom4 is classified into five categories according to its thickness and the redistribution among different categories of thicknesses is based on a simple enthalpy conservation principle winton 2001 the sea ice dynamics is based on an elastic viscosity plastic rheology hunke and dukowicz 1997 as for the ice transport the global ice state variables in form of grid extensive quantities are transported horizontally by using an upstream advection scheme haltiner and williams 1980 besides the sea ice snow albedo adopts the scheme from the community climate system model version 3 ccsm3 briegleb et al 2004 details of the mom4 are described in griffies et al 2004 in this study both ocean and sea ice components adopt a tripolar grid with the horizontal resolution of 1 latitude 0 3 longitude near the equatorial region and 1 1 in middle and high latitudes in addition the ocean has 40 layers in the vertical direction with a finer resolution of 10 m above the depth of 200 m the forcing field used in all experiments is the 20 year 1990 2009 averaged data from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments version2 core2 which includes the downward longwave and shortwave radiation the precipitation data the snowfall data the 10 m specific humidity the sea level pressure the 10 m air temperature and the wind field data large and yeager 2009 as shown in table 2 five experiments were conducted with difference only occurring in sea ice thermodynamic which are similar to 1 d experiments the ocean is initialized by a previous 200 year model run while initial sea ice thickness and temperature for each layer is prescribed to 1 m and 5 c respectively the ice thickness data from us navy submarines rothrock et al 2008 during 1958 2000 is used to assess the sea ice thickness simulations fig 4 shows the changes in the simulated arctic sea ice volume with time for five experiments it can be noted that the model equilibrium states of sea ice volume range from 13 16 1012 m3 with e3d new and e3d win exhibiting the maximum and minimum respectively a recent study by watts et al 2021 indicated that the annual mean sea ice volume for the period of 1980 2014 derived from the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system reanalysis data zhang and rothrock 2003 is about 20 18 1012 m3 this indicates a systematical underestimation of sea ice volume in both the original and the modified model while this bias may be introduced partially by the deficiencies of the ocean component mom4 itself griffies et al 2011 fang et al 2017 the significant increase of sea ice volume in e3d new suggests modifications on sea ice thermodynamic have positive roles on this bias reduction assessment on the sea ice concentration indicates that all experiments capture the gross spatial temporal features of sea ice concentration but the differences among them are negligible figure omitted fig 5 therefore further presents the simulated and observed distributions of spring and autumn sea ice thicknesses the observed sea ice thickness in spring exhibits maxima more than 2 5 m located in south of greenland sea the canadian basin and the eurasia shelf seas the e3d win can reasonably capture the spatial pattern of sea ice thickness but the magnitude is seriously underestimated with value less than 2 0 m over most of arctic region which is more than 40 smaller than the observation fig 5b compared with e3d win the simulated sea ice thickness in e3d new is thickened over the central arctic with values exceeding 2 0 m over the canadian basin and laptev sea more consistent with the observation fig 5c however it is noteworthy that the simulated sea ice thicknesses in e3d new are still systematically thinner than the observation over the whole arctic region the observed sea ice thicknesses distribution in autumn is featured by a maximum over the canadian basin with values gradually declining toward zero in the eurasia shelf seas similarly the sea ice thickness simulated by the e3d win is by far too thin while that in e3d new is more realistic fig 6 further gives the difference of autumn sea ice thickness among experiments from fig 6a it is clear that the vertical framework change from three to four layers leads to significant thickness increase over the whole arctic region with maxima up to 0 5 m located over the greenland sea norwegian sea barents sea kara sea and laptev sea this is the main reason for the improvement of the sea ice thickness simulation in e3d new fig 5c f moreover the implementations of the vertical varying salinity profile and temperature and salinity dependent heat conductivity parameterization also result in thickness increase over most of the arctic region but the magnitude is small 0 1 m fig 6c d these investigations are consistent with the those in 1 d experiments as shown in fig 3b implying the beneficial effects of improvements on sea ice thermodynamic however the sea ice thickness is slightly reduced when the snow heat capacity is considered in the model fig 6b which is contrary to that in 1 d simulations fig 3b this may be associated with the other physics processes in mom4 which attenuate the model response to change in snow heat capacity such as the ice transport and ocean ice interaction etc 4 conclusions and discussion this paper presents a modified thermodynamic sea ice model based on the winton s three layer model framework several improvements focused on the vertical thermodynamics have been made in the model specifically the vertical resolution is increased from three to four layers by adding an additional ice layer one snow layer and three ice layers the effect of snow heat capacity is considered as well moreover a vertically varying salinity profile is implemented and the effect of the sea ice salinity and temperature on the sea ice thermal conductivity is also taken into account similar to win2000 the effect of brine pockets on the melting latent heat of sea ice is considered only in the first layer sea ice in the modified model and a fully implicit time difference scheme is adopted to solve the model equations this scheme allows for longer time steps which is thus more computationally efficient for long term global climate simulation results from a series of one dimensional experiments show that equilibrium ice thickness in our modified model is increased by about 45 cm when compared with the original winton s model sensitivity tests indicate that all modifications mentioned above contribute to this change of ice thickness among which the increase of ice layer has the most significant effect followed by the sea ice conductivity parameterization the modified thermodynamic sea ice model is then coupled into the sea ice component sis in gfdl mom4 to exert long term integration experiments forced by core2 0 data results indicate that the modified model shows significant improvement in simulating the arctic sea ice including an increase in both the sea ice thickness and volume over the whole arctic region this confirms the above founding from 1 d simulations both the 1 d and 3 d sensitivity tests show that the inclusion of the third ice layer causes noticeable increase in the sea ice concentration and thickness this finding is consistent with the results from cheng et al 2008 and bitz and lipscomb 1999 they found that even the equilibrium thickness in semtner s 3 layer model is spurious increased due to the neglected effect of the brine pocket it is still obviously thinner than their energy conserving model with 10 ice layers see their fig 6 this demonstrates the importance of increasing the vertical resolution of the sea ice model serving also as the motivation of our study also it should be noted the sea ice thickness is slightly reduced when the snow heat capacity is considered in mom4 which is contrary to that in 1 d simulations as shown fig 3b although this seems contradictory to each other eicken et al 1995a suggested that this model behavior is related to the reduction of bottom ice growth rate due to the thermal insulation effect of snow this effect may be enhanced when ocean ice interaction is included in mom4 since the ocean flux is fixed in 1 d experiments this needs to be more carefully explored in future work the implementation of conductivity parameterization induces an increase in simulated sea ice thickness uotila et al 2012 show a similar result by exploring the parameter sensitivity using cice they found that according to eq 2 when the sea ice temperature rises and approaches to the freezing temperature the 0 09 s t term will increase dramatically which reduces the thermal conductivity of sea ice unfavorable for the sea ice melting the implementation of vertically varying ice salinity profile also somewhat contributes to improvement in the simulated sea ice thickness this is consistent with the findings of some previous studies for example vancoppenolle et al 2005 found that sea ice thickness difference between experiments with the vertically varying salinity and the iso salinity profile can reach up to 0 24 m which is probably associated with the difference in melt growth rate at the sea ice bottom moreover vancoppenolle et al 2006 further found that the brine entrapment and drainage processes play an important role on the ice thermodynamics as well as the sea ice salt freshwater exchange thus need to be described in large scale

model version 4 mom4 coupled with the modified model show an improved sea ice simulation which includes an increase in both the sea ice volume and thickness over the entire arctic region confirming the above founding however contrary model behavior exhibits when the snow heat capacity is considered that warrants further investigation keywords thermodynamic sea ice model vertical thermodynamic arctic sea ice sea ice simulator 1 introduction the sea ice is a fundamental component of the earth climate system and an amplifier of the global climate change since the 1970s the arctic sea ice has been declining rapidly with the accelerating global warming particularly during summer cavalieri and parkinson 2012 onarheim et al 2018 on one hand significant changes in sea ice will amplify the polar warming through the positive ice albedo feedback mechanism screen and simmonds 2010 jahn and holland 2013 on the other hand these changes can also influence the atmospheric circulation and ocean thermohaline circulation by altering air sea heat fluxes and sea ice salt freshwater fluxes consequently affecting the global climate meier et al 2014 yamanouchi and takata 2020 climate system models are effective tools to study the evolution characteristics of sea ice under a changing climate results from the fifth and sixth phases of the global coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 6 have shown that most current climate system models fail to simulate the accelerated decline of observed arctic sea ice in recent decades stroeve et al 2012 shu et al 2020 this model deficiency is at least partly due to the incapability of the sea ice model used in these cmip5 6 class models to simulate realistically the sea ice mean state and variability therefore continuous development and optimization of sea ice component in climate system models are of great significance for a better understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms governing the sea ice as well as the climate prediction and projection researches on thermodynamic sea ice models started as early as 1970s maykut and untersteiner 1971 developed a one dimensional thermodynamic sea ice model in which the surface energy balances determine the sea ice growth rate and diffusion equations govern the heat transport within the ice in addition this model takes into account the effects of the snow cover brine pockets bubbles internal heating due to penetration of incoming shortwave radiation vertical varying ice density and thermal conductivity the model performs well in simulating sea ice thickness and temperature however it is seldom used in practical climate simulations as it takes too long to reach the equilibrium state due to the too complex physical processes and too many vertical layers involved semtner 1976 simplified this model as three layer and zero layer versions in addition the finite difference method is used to solve model equations making it suitable for three dimensional simulations the semtner model and its varying versions have been widely used in various fields such as the thermodynamic processes of sea ice fichefet and maqueda 1977 koga and krstic 2019 the air sea ice interaction cheng et al 2003 heimbach et al 2010 wang et al 2019 and the sea ice simulation and prediction silva et al 2015 bitz and lipscomb 1999 proposed a multi layer sea ice thermodynamic model the model is energy conserved by taking into account effect of the brine pocket on the latent heat of sea ice thus can significantly reduce the spurious sea ice when compared with energy non conservation models inspired by this work winton 2000 developed a reformulated three layer thermodynamic sea ice model one snow layer and two sea ice layers hereafter referred to as win2000 based on the semtner s model where the effect of brine pockets on the latent heat of melting is considered only in the upper sea ice layer due to the dominant occurrence of surface melting this model uses a non iterative fully implicit time stepping scheme to solve the forecast equations for ice temperature which is more computationally efficient for long term climate simulations compared with the more sophisticated model of bitz and lipscomb 1999 because of this the noaa s geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl sea ice model named the sea ice simulator sis takes win2000 as its thermodynamic framework the gfdl sis has been adopted as the sea ice component by many climate system models in the world due to its high portability and computational efficiency watts et al 2021 however delworth et al 2006 found that poor representation of vertical thermodynamics processes of sea ice in sis is still a big obstacle for the accurate sea ice simulation and prediction by analyzing the simulation results from the cmip5 and cmip6 models it is found that most coupled models adopting sis as sea ice component show similar bias such as the thinner ice and overestimation underestimation sea ice extent in winter summer shu et al 2015 long et al 2021 this also suggests that the biases may be related to the deficiency of the sis therefore in this study a range of modifications have been made to win2000 specifically one additional ice layer is added which makes the vertical resolution of the model become four layers with one snow layer and three ice layers and a vertically varying sea ice salinity profile is implemented besides the heat capacity of snow and the influence of the sea ice salinity and temperature on the thermal conductivity are also taken into account this modified thermodynamic sea ice framework is then applied to the gfdl modular ocean model version 4 mom4 for long term simulations and the superiority and deficiency of the modified model in simulating the arctic sea ice are further discussed the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a brief introduction to the modified thermodynamic sea ice model in section 3 the performance of the model on arctic sea ice simulation is analyzed and the causes for improvements are explored through sensitivity tests finally section 4 presents the main conclusions and discussion 2 model description the new modified four layer thermodynamic model consists of one snow layer and three ice layers with equal thickness as shown in fig 1 table 1 shows the specifics of physical variables in the model and the physical constants in the following equations and physical parameterization schemes the brine content of the upper ice is represented with a varying specific heat capacity while constant specific heat capacity is adopted in the snow as well as the middle and lower ice layers compared with win2000 the most significant modifications of the new model are the increase of one vertical ice layer the consideration of snow heat capacity zero capacity snow layer in win2000 and a more sophisticated description of the sea ice salinity and thermal conductivity similar to the win2000 the integral process of the modified model can be divided into the following three steps first the model calculates surface penetrating solar radiation and the air ice ocean heat fluxes on the basis of the atmospheric and oceanic forcing fields and the sea ice thickness and temperature at the previous step note that the solar radiation absorbed by the ice is calculated in each ice layer in the modified model fig 1 whereas in win2000 it is assumed that all solar radiation trapped in ice is absorbed by the upper layer second the ice snow surface temperature t s f the ice temperature t 1 t 2 and t 3 as well as the snow temperature t s are calculated by solving the new ice snow heat diffusion equations as shown below in the last step the ice snow temperature calculated in the second step is used to calculate the energy fluxes on the surface and at the bottom of the sea ice according to which the thicknesses of sea ice and snow as well as the surface temperature and temperatures of each ice snow layer and are adjusted 2 1 model equations and solutions internal temperatures of ice and snow are determined by the heat diffusion equations based on the snow and ice enthalpy referring to bitz and lipscomb 1999 the energy required to melt a unit mass of sea ice is defined as the enthalpy which is expressed as 1 e t s c i t μ s l 1 μ s t where t and s are the sea ice temperature and salinity respectively the specific heat capacity of sea ice c i 2110 j kg 1 c 1 the empirical constant μ 0 054 c psu 1 representing the coefficient relating sea ice melting temperature to salinity assur 1958 and the constant latent heat for melting of pure ice l 334 kj kg 1 since the salinity of the snow layer is zero the enthalpy expression is as 2 e s t s c s t s l where c s denotes the snow specific heat capacity that equals to the specific heat capacity of ice for the ice layers the term l 1 μ s t in eq 1 represents the melting latent heat per unit mass of sea ice with the influence of brine pockets since the sea ice temperature t μ s there is no singularity in this term however the μ s t has a large effect on the value of this term when t is close to 0 c due to the relatively high melting point of the upper ice layer in middle and lower layers of sea ice since the temperature ranges between the sea ice surface and bottom temperatures freezing point temperature and thus the influence of μ s t on the term l 1 μ s t in eq 1 is relatively small the experiments from bitz and lipscomb 1999 have shown that when t 2 c and s 3 2 psu l 1 μ s t 0 92 l ebert and curry 1993 suggested that setting l 1 μ s t 0 9 l in sea ice models does not cause significant biases in simulating the formation and ablation rate of the sea ice in the bottom layer similar results can also be found in gabison 1987 and cheng et al 2008 therefore in this study the influence of brine pockets on the melting latent heat is not considered in middle and lower sea ice layers the enthalpy of the middle and lower sea ice layers is correspondingly expressed as 3 e t s c i t μ s l the change in the enthalpy reflects the energy budget in the sea ice and snow layers the heat diffusion equation per unit mass of sea ice and snow is 4 d e d t f where f is the net heat income per unit mass of sea ice snow in combination with eqs 1 2 3 4 and fig 1 the heat diffusion equations of the snow and three ice layers can be obtained 5 c s ρ s h s d t s d t k a s t sf t s k s i t 1 t s 6 ρ i h i 3 c i l μ s 1 t 1 2 d t 1 d t k s i t s t 1 k 1 2 t 2 t 1 i 1 7 ρ i h i c i 3 d t 2 d t

ice with a thickness of z without being absorbed f s w the downward visible solar radiation α the sea ice albedo and κ 1 49 m 1 the extinction coefficient of sea ice according to the solar radiation

penetrates the upper ice surface which is formulated following hunke et al 2013 15 i 0 0 3 1 h s h s 0 02 here we assume that the snow does not absorb solar radiation note that snow absorbs relatively more solar radiation than ice due to a much bigger attenuation coefficient lecomte et al 2011 this implies the necessity of sophisticated representation of radiation transfer for snow in our modified

upward long wave radiation f s e n and f l a t represent the sensible and latent heat fluxes between the ice snow and the air which are calculated by a modified bulk formula by lu et al 2013 it is found that this algorithm has the superiority in flux parameterizations over the sea ice region wu et al 2019 a first order taylor expansion of t s f is performed to discrete eq 16 if there is snow

step as well as sea ice salinity which can be treated as known quantities therefore firstly solve eq 31 for t 1 and then solve eqs 20 19 and 25 for t s t 2 and t 3 in turn finally solve eq 17 for t s

conductivity in win2000 the ice salinity is distributed uniformly from the upper to lower ice layers maykut and grenfell 1975 eicken 1992 while this isosaline profile is observed in the arctic and antarctic during winter for first year ice maykut and grenfell 1975 eicken 1992 more observations reveal an upward decreasing distribution of sea ice salinity for multiyear ice tucker iii et al 1987 eicken et al 1995b currently the most widely used profile of this type is the vertically varying salinity profile developed by bitz and lipscomb 1999 which is based on the work of schwarzacher 1959 numerical study on this profile by vancoppenolle et al 2006 demonstrates substantial differences in ice thickness and ice ocean salt flux when comparing to the isosaline salinity profile situation vancoppenolle et al 2006 therefore the bitz and lipscomb 1999 profile is adopted in the modified model 34 s n 1 6 1 cos π z a b z where z n 0 5 n and n denotes the n th layer in addition a and b are empirical constants where a 0 407 and b 0 573 and n is the total number of sea ice layers the salinity profile does not vary with time and the ice salinity at each layer is determined by its relative position as shown in fig 2 the ice salinity in the modified model increases gradually from the upper to the lower layers with the lowest at the upper ice surface s t 0 and the highest at the bottom surface s b 3 2 psu for the thermal conductivity of ice win2000 takes a constant value of 2 03 w m 1 k 1 for the thermal conductivity of pure ice while the modified model employs the parameterization scheme proposed by pringle et al 2007 this scheme is developed based on the observations in the antarctic and arctic which is expressed as a function of sea ice salinity and temperature 35 k n ρ i 917 2 11 0 011 t n 0 09 s n t n where ρ i denotes the sea ice density t n and s n the sea ice temperature salinity respectively in the ice layer n this scheme accounts for the impacts of sea ice salinity and temperature on its thermal conductivity and has been applied to well known sea ice models such as the los alamos sea ice model cice hunke et al 2013 and the louvain la neuve sea ice model lim rousset et al 2015 based on thermal conductivities in three sea ice layers namely k 1 k 2 and k 3 the effective thermal conductivities at interface of layers fig 1 are defined as follows k a s 2 k s h

growth and decay of the sea ice cover are mainly governed by the top and bottom heat forcing which are calculated by the updated t s f t s and t 1 in section 2 1 when there is snow 37 m s k a s t s t sf a b t sf when there is no snow 38 m s k s i t 1 t sf a b t sf the net heat flux in the bottom of sea ice can be obtained by t 3 and t f 39 m b f b k 3 4 t f t 3 where m s and m b are the imbalance energy at the snow or ice surface and ice bottom respectively f b is the heat flux entering from the ocean into the bottom of sea ice which is calculated by the heat transport parameterization scheme proposed by maykut and mcphee 1995 40 f b ρ w c w α h u δ t sst t f where ρ w denotes the seawater density c w the specific heat of seawater at the temperature of t f α h 0 008 the thermal conductivity u the friction velocity between the ocean and the sea ice and sst the sea surface temperature the melting of the ice snow layer is firstly processed for the surface layer if m s 0 the melting of the snow layer starts from the surface to the bottom and the thicknesses of the snow layer and each sea ice layer change to δ h s m i n m s δ t e s t s ρ s h s δ h 1 min max m s δ t e s t s

h 2 and h 3 are the upper middle and lower ice layer thickness respectively for sea ice bottom melting m b 0 the treatment is similar but the direction of the melting is from the bottom to the surface the formation of new ice mainly occurs at the bottom of the ice layer if m b 0 the increment of new ice thickness δ h 3 δ t m b e t f s b will be added in the lower ice layer among them e t f s b is the enthalpy of the newly formed ice at the temperature t f and the salinity s b which can be calculated by eq 3 the new lower ice layer temperature is calculated based on enthalpy conservation the sum of enthalpies of the newly formed ice and original lower ice layer should equal to the enthalpy of the new lower ice layer 42 δ h 3 h 3 e 3 t 3 n e w s 3 h 3 e 3 t 3 s 3 δ h 3 e 3 t f s b the solution is given by 43 t 3 new h 3 t 3 δ h 3 t f δ h 3 μ s b δ h 3 μ s 3 δ h 3 h 3 2 4 mass and enthalpy adjustments of the sea ice snow layer the mass and enthalpy of snow and sea ice must be further adjusted to initialize the state of integration for next time step firstly the thickness of the snow layer is changed if new snowfall event or snow ice formation occurs secondly the thickness of each ice layer is equalized the specific steps are as follows the new snowfall is firstly treated in the model specifically for the snowfall with a thickness of δ h s the model assumes the ice snow surface temperature t s f as its temperature and the adjusted thickness of snow layer is h s δ h s similarly an enthalpy conservation equation similar to eq 42 can be constructed to solve for the temperature of the new snow layer 44 t s n o w h s t s δ h s t sf h s δ h s similar to win2000 the modified model performs the snow ice conversion for the snow below the waterline based on the buoyancy equation the snow below the waterline is given by 45 δ h s m a x h s ρ w ρ i ρ s h i ρ i ρ w 0 into the upper layer ice 46 δ h i m a x h s ρ w ρ i ρ s h i ρ s ρ w 0 where ρ w and ρ s are the densities of seawater and snow respectively after the snow ice conversion the temperature of the snow layer remains unchanged and the temperature of the upper ice layer can be calculated by solving an enthalpy conservation equation similar to eq 42 finally if there is still sea ice existed after the above adjustments then the thickness of each ice layer is equalized to facilitate the integration for the next time step this process would cause mass exchange among different ice layers here we suppose the temperature of the ice layer that donates sea ice remains unchanged while the temperature of the layer receiving sea ice is adjusted base on the enthalpy conservation for example if sea ice with thickness of δ h transfers from lower to upper ice layer in this situation both the upper and middle sea ice layers have been fully melted the sum of enthalpies of the fraction from the lower ice layer and original upper ice layer should equal to that of the new upper ice layer 47 δ h h 1 e 1 t 1 n e w s 1 h 1 e 1 t 1 s 1 δ h e 3 t 3 s 3 solving the above equation gives 48 t 1 n e w t t 2 4 l μ s 1 c i 2 where 49 t h 1 δ h h 1 t 1 δ h δ h h 1 t 3 μ δ h δ h h 1 s 3 s 1 h 1 l μ s 1 δ h h 1 t 1 c i similar method is adopted if mutual transformations occur among other sea ice layers it is worth to note that when the sea ice coverts from the upper to the middle layer or from the middle to the lower layer the adjusted sea ice temperature of the receiving layer may exceed its freezing temperature as its freezing temperature is relatively low in this case the sea ice temperature of the receiving layer is fixed at its freezing temperature and the excess energy will be redistributed in the three ice layers to ensure same thicknesses of ice melting at each layer 3 model performance in arctic sea ice simulation 3 1 1 d experiments a series of 1 d simulations are firstly conducted to evaluate the new thermodynamic sea ice model and compare it with the original win2000 model the standard forcing data is the climatological atmospheric and oceanic conditions which are widely used in the literature bitz and lipscomb 1999 vancoppenolle et al 2006 the monthly values of these surface forcing data downwelling radiative and turbulent heat fluxes are typical of the central arctic region the surface albedo is same as in win2000 the ocean ice heat flux is set to 2 0 w m2 all experiments are run for 50 years with detailed design shown in table 2 in e1d new and e1d win the modified sea ice thermodynamic framework introduced above and the original win2000 are employed respectively in e1d sen1 the new 4 layer vertical framework is used but the salinity and thermal conductivity of sea ice are constants same as in win2000 and the heat capacity effect of snow is not taken into account zero capacity e1d sen2 is similar to e1d sen1 but with the heat capacity effect of snow being considered e1d sen3 is similar to e1d sen2 but a vertical varying profile scheme of sea ice salinity is adopted specifically a comparison between e1d sen1 and e1d win can help explore the impact of the increasing in vertical resolution of the model on sea ice simulation the effect of snow heat capacity on sea ice simulation by comparing e1d sen2 with e1d sen1 and the influences of vertical varying salinity profile and sea ice thermal conductivity parameterization scheme on sea ice simulation by comparing e1d sen2 and e1d new with e1d sen3 respectively fig 3a shows the first annual cycle after initializing with the same ice thickness for the five experiments while the phase variations of the sea ice thickness are nearly the same magnitude difference among five experiments is significant during the melt season as a result the equilibrium thickness for the first 50 years of the integration is substantially different as shown in fig 3b the new model exhibits a highest equilibrium thickness which is about 45 cm greater than the original win2000 model 259 cm in e1d new versus 214 cm in e1d win all modifications focusing on the ice thermodynamic contribute to this change of ice thickness among which the increase of the vertical resolution from three to four layers has the most significant effect followed by inclusion of heat conductivity parameterization scheme the consideration of snow heat capacity and the vertical varying salinity profile also play a role but their contributions are relatively small fig 3b fig 3c shows the last annual cycle of ice temperature averaged for all ice layers it is found that the all experiments are quite consistent with each other the largest difference is that the ice temperatures in e1d new e1d sen2 and e1d sen3 are somewhat colder than other two experiments in all seasons except for summer this phenomenon demonstrates the role of the consideration of snow heat capacity the possible reason is that the energy that need to melt the same mass of snow is increased when the snow heat capacity is considered according to eq 2 this may reduce the melting rate of snow and consequently lessen the input solar radiation thus although thicker sea ice in e1d new e1d sen2 and e1d sen3 can relatively absorb more solar radiation the decrease of total input solar radiation into the sea ice eventually leads to colder ice in these experiments fig 3b c 3 2 3 d experiments the modified model is then couple into the sea ice part sis of the ocean model gfdl mom4 to further assess its performance in simulating the arctic sea ice the sea ice in mom4 is classified into five categories according to its thickness and the redistribution among different categories of thicknesses is based on a simple enthalpy conservation principle winton 2001 the sea ice dynamics is based on an elastic viscosity plastic rheology hunke and dukowicz 1997 as for the ice transport the global ice state variables in form of grid extensive quantities are transported horizontally by using an upstream advection scheme haltiner and williams 1980 besides the sea ice snow albedo adopts the scheme from the community climate system model version 3 ccsm3 briegleb et al 2004 details of the mom4 are described in griffies et al 2004 in this study both ocean and sea ice components adopt a tripolar grid with the horizontal resolution of 1 latitude 0 3 longitude near the equatorial region and 1 1 in middle and high latitudes in addition the ocean has 40 layers in the vertical direction with a finer resolution of 10 m above the depth of 200 m the forcing field used in all experiments is the 20 year 1990 2009 averaged data from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments version2 core2 which includes the downward longwave and shortwave radiation the precipitation data the snowfall data the 10 m specific humidity the sea level pressure the 10 m air temperature and the wind field data large and yeager 2009 as shown in table 2 five experiments were conducted with difference only occurring in sea ice thermodynamic which are similar to 1 d experiments the ocean is initialized by a previous 200 year model run while initial sea ice thickness and temperature for each layer is prescribed to 1 m and 5 c respectively the ice thickness data from us navy submarines rothrock et al 2008 during 1958 2000 is used to assess the sea ice thickness simulations fig 4 shows the changes in the simulated arctic sea ice volume with time for five experiments it can be noted that the model equilibrium states of sea ice volume range from 13 16 1012 m3 with e3d new and e3d win exhibiting the maximum and minimum respectively a recent study by watts et al 2021 indicated that the annual mean sea ice volume for the period of 1980 2014 derived from the pan arctic ice ocean modeling and assimilation system reanalysis data zhang and rothrock 2003 is about 20 18 1012 m3 this indicates a systematical underestimation of sea ice volume in both the original and the modified model while this bias may be introduced partially by the deficiencies of the ocean component mom4 itself griffies et al 2011 fang et al 2017 the significant increase of sea ice volume in e3d new suggests modifications on sea ice thermodynamic have positive roles on this bias reduction assessment on the sea ice concentration indicates that all experiments capture the gross spatial temporal features of sea ice concentration but the differences among them are negligible figure omitted fig 5 therefore further presents the simulated and observed distributions of spring and autumn sea ice thicknesses the observed sea ice thickness in spring exhibits maxima more than 2 5 m located in south of greenland sea the canadian basin and the eurasia shelf seas the e3d win can reasonably capture the spatial pattern of sea ice thickness but the magnitude is seriously underestimated with value less than 2 0 m over most of arctic region which is more than 40 smaller than the observation fig 5b compared with e3d win the simulated sea ice thickness in e3d new is thickened over the central arctic with values exceeding 2 0 m over the canadian basin and laptev sea more consistent with the observation fig 5c however it is noteworthy that the simulated sea ice thicknesses in e3d new are still systematically thinner than the observation over the whole arctic region the observed sea ice thicknesses distribution in autumn is featured by a maximum over the canadian basin with values gradually declining toward zero in the eurasia shelf seas similarly the sea ice thickness simulated by the e3d win is by far too thin while that in e3d new is more realistic fig 6 further gives the difference of autumn sea ice thickness among experiments from fig 6a it is clear that the vertical framework change from three to four layers leads to significant thickness increase over the whole arctic region with maxima up to 0 5 m located over the greenland sea norwegian sea barents sea kara sea and laptev sea this is the main reason for the improvement of the sea ice thickness simulation in e3d new fig 5c f moreover the implementations of the vertical varying salinity profile and temperature and salinity dependent heat conductivity parameterization also result in thickness increase over most of the arctic region but the magnitude is small 0 1 m fig 6c d these investigations are consistent with the those in 1 d experiments as shown in fig 3b implying the beneficial effects of improvements on sea ice thermodynamic however the sea ice thickness is slightly reduced when the snow heat capacity is considered in the model fig 6b which is contrary to that in 1 d simulations fig 3b this may be associated with the other physics processes in mom4 which attenuate the model response to change in snow heat capacity such as the ice transport and ocean ice interaction etc 4 conclusions and discussion this paper presents a modified thermodynamic sea ice model based on the winton s three layer model framework several improvements focused on the vertical thermodynamics have been made in the model specifically the vertical resolution is increased from three to four layers by adding an additional ice layer one snow layer and three ice layers the effect of snow heat capacity is considered as well moreover a vertically varying salinity profile is implemented and the effect of the sea ice salinity and temperature on the sea ice thermal conductivity is also taken into account similar to win2000 the effect of brine pockets on the melting latent heat of sea ice is considered only in the first layer sea ice in the modified model and a fully implicit time difference scheme is adopted to solve the model equations this scheme allows for longer time steps which is thus more computationally efficient for long term global climate simulation results from a series of one dimensional experiments show that equilibrium ice thickness in our modified model is increased by about 45 cm when compared with the original winton s model sensitivity tests indicate that all modifications mentioned above contribute to this change of ice thickness among which the increase of ice layer has the most significant effect followed by the sea ice conductivity parameterization the modified thermodynamic sea ice model is then coupled into the sea ice component sis in gfdl mom4 to exert long term integration experiments forced by core2 0 data results indicate that the modified model shows significant improvement in simulating the arctic sea ice including an increase in both the sea ice thickness and volume over the whole arctic region this confirms the above founding from 1 d simulations both the 1 d and 3 d sensitivity tests show that the inclusion of the third ice layer causes noticeable increase in the sea ice concentration and thickness this finding is consistent with the results from cheng et al 2008 and bitz and lipscomb 1999 they found that even the equilibrium thickness in semtner s 3 layer model is spurious increased due to the neglected effect of the brine pocket it is still obviously thinner than their energy conserving model with 10 ice layers see their fig 6 this demonstrates the importance of increasing the vertical resolution of the sea ice model serving also as the motivation of our study also it should be noted the sea ice thickness is slightly reduced when the snow heat capacity is considered in mom4 which is contrary to that in 1 d simulations as shown fig 3b although this seems contradictory to each other eicken et al 1995a suggested that this model behavior is related to the reduction of bottom ice growth rate due to the thermal insulation effect of snow this effect may be enhanced when ocean ice interaction is included in mom4 since the ocean flux is fixed in 1 d experiments this needs to be more carefully explored in future work the implementation of conductivity parameterization induces an increase in simulated sea ice thickness uotila et al 2012 show a similar result by exploring the parameter sensitivity using cice they found that according to eq 2 when the sea ice temperature rises and approaches to the freezing temperature the 0 09 s t term will increase dramatically which reduces the thermal conductivity of sea ice unfavorable for the sea ice melting the implementation of vertically varying ice salinity profile also somewhat contributes to improvement in the simulated sea ice thickness this is consistent with the findings of some previous studies for example vancoppenolle et al 2005 found that sea ice thickness difference between experiments with the vertically varying salinity and the iso salinity profile can reach up to 0 24 m which is probably associated with the difference in melt growth rate at the sea ice bottom moreover vancoppenolle et al 2006 further found that the brine entrapment and drainage processes play an important role on the ice thermodynamics as well as the sea ice salt freshwater exchange thus need to be described in large scale
