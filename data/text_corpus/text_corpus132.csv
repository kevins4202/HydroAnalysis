660,seagrasses are marine flowering plants that provide key ecological services in recent decades multiple stressors have caused a worldwide decline in seagrass beds changes in bottom friction associated with seagrass loss are expected to influence the ability of estuarine systems to trap sediment inputs through local and regional changes in hydrodynamics herein we document a numerical study using six historical maps of seagrass distribution in barnegat bay usa to demonstrate that reductions in seagrass coverage destabilize estuarine systems decreasing flood dominance in areas affected by seagrass disappearance and increasing bed shear stress values across the entire back barrier basin furthermore we reveal how seagrass decline has considerably increased the impact of wind waves on marsh edges between 1968 and 2009 from a comparison with a numerical experiment without submerged aquatic vegetation we estimate that up to 40 of the computed wave thrust on marsh boundaries can be reduced by seagrass beds and we find that the location of a seagrass patch in addition to its aerial extent plays a crucial role in this attenuation process this study highlights the benefits of seagrass meadows in enhancing estuarine resilience and reducing marsh edge retreat by wind wave attack which is recognized as a chief agent in lateral marsh loss keywords seagrass coawst ecosystem

the period of flood and reduces shear stresses on the estuarine seabed which in turn influences the capacity of estuarine systems to capture and store sediment inputs from rivers and the ocean these outcomes are relevant for the long term survival of coastal bays e g fagherazzi et al 2014 and suggest that seagrass can provide significant coastal protection temmerman et al 2013 2 study site the

little egg inlet and barnegat inlet tides are mainly semidiurnal with the m 2 harmonic being the dominant constituent offshore the tidal amplitude is 1 m but energy dissipation through the inlets

last several decades the total loss is estimated as 2000 3000 ha in 30 years from 1960 to 1990 the main causes of the seagrass decline are related to the shading effect of phytoplankton blooms

transport modeling system modeling framework warner et al 2010 in this study the circulation model roms shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 warner et al 2008 and the wave model swan booij et al 1999 have

coefficient to attain the best agreement between model results and water level data and water discharge measurements collected by the u s geological survey in march 2012 defne and ganju 2014 the calibration did not include sav hydrodynamic feedbacks the friction exerted by the bed on flow is computed using a bottom boundary layer formulation warner et al 2008 that includes enhanced wave based apparent roughness madsen 1994 the wave thrust the integral along the vertical of the dynamic pressure of waves is explicitly computed by the model following tonelli et al 2010 and leonardi et al 2016 the flow vegetation interaction is computed using the vegetation module recently implemented in coawst beudin et al 2017 kalra et al 2017 the flow vegetation module includes plant posture dependent three dimensional drag in canopy wave induced streaming and production of turbulent kinetic energy and enstrophy for the vertical mixing parameterization the spatially averaged vegetation drag force is approximated using a quadratic drag law and the effect of plant flexibility on drag is computed using the approach of luhar and nepf 2011 the selected turbulence model is the k ε scheme which accounts for extra dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy production due to vegetation uittenbogaard 2003 similarly the wave dissipation due to vegetation is accounted by the model modifying the source term of the action balance equation following the formulation of mendez and losada 2004 the other external contributions to wave energy such as wind wave breaking bottom dissipation and nonlinear waves interactions are computed as follows i wind energy input according to cavalieri and malanotte rizzoli 1981 and komen et al 1984 formulations for the linear and exponential wind growth respectively ii bottom friction following madsen et al 1988 iii whitecapping following komen et al 1984 an idealized wind field was used as these numerical experiments are not intended to quantify the real wave thrust on marsh boundaries but are built with the goal to unravel the effect of seagrass loss on wave energy different scenarios were considered for the wind forcing characterized by winds of constant speed 5 10 and 15 m s blowing from south west and south east fig 1h for the entire simulation period as wave action on marsh edges is strongly related to tidal level tonelli et al 2010 we ran the simulations for a spring neap tidal cycle the temporal evolution of the study site has not been considered and the present day morphology has been used for each year particularly recent studies e g leonardi et al 2016a b show that marshes are eroding at around 0 5 2 m year with the highest erosion rate registered in great bay the resolution of the model domain is such that morphological changes due to marsh edge erosion cannot be taken into account at these erosion rates therefore we focus solely on the impact of seagrass coverage on waves and tides by adopting an exploratory model approach murray 2007 salt marsh and seagrass coverage data were derived from the crssa s center for remote sensing and spatial analysis geographic information systems gis database vegetation parameters are listed in table 2 of donatelli et al 2019 nominally selected using kennish et al 2013 for guidance simulations are run implementing different seagrass coverages corresponding to the years 1968 1979 1987 1999 2003 2009 and for a test case without seagrasses 1968 map u s army corps of engineers 1976 1979 map macomber and allen 1979 1987 map joseph et al 1992 1999 map mcclain and mchale 1996 bologna et al 2000 2003 and 2009 maps lathrop and haag 2011 4 results from 1968 until 2009 the extent of seagrass meadows within the barnegat bay little egg harbor system largely declined fig 1 fig 2 table 1 in donatelli et al 2019 fig 2 shows the area colonized by seagrass as a function of water depth for each year the impact of seagrass loss on tidal propagation was evaluated following classic harmonic analysis using t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 and by computing the spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase lag of the m 2 constituent within the entire back barrier basin for coastal areas with multiple inlets water levels are controlled by the interaction between tidal forcing propagating from each inlet and changes in bottom friction that can alter their relative phase a comparison between amplitude and phase lag values for the scenario with maximum seagrass coverage year 1979 and a scenario without seagrass reveals that the phase lag of the tidal wave coming from great bay and directed to barnegat bay decreased with seagrass removal as a consequence the tidal amplitude within the entire northern part of the estuary increases for the non seagrass case because the tidal waves from barnegat inlet and from great bay have a similar phase and become additive seagrass loss also influences tidal asymmetry asymmetric tides are important for the transport and deposition of sediments in shallow estuaries aubrey and speer 1985 changes in tidal asymmetry were calculated following the formulation of friedrichs and aubrey 1988 and are depicted in fig 4 the amplitude and phase ratios between the fourth diurnal m 4 constituent and the semidiurnal m 2 constituent have been calculated our results suggest that seagrass meadows tend to enhance the flood dominance of the system increasing the m 4 m 2 water level amplitude ratio as tidal nonlinearities are enhanced in this study we also evaluated the influence of seagrass beds on locally generated wind waves for winds of 5 10 and 15 m s blowing from the southwest and southeast wind directions and speeds were chosen based on the most frequent winds fig 1h with southwest winds maximizing fetch in the southern half of the estuary fig 5 presents the distribution of mean wave heights as a function of water depth in the non seagrass case and for the scenarios with maximum year 1979 and minimum year 2009 seagrass coverage the mean wave height is the mean value throughout the entire simulation computed at each cell our results show that the presence of seagrass attenuates waves across the entire bay although this damping effect is more limited on bare beds fig 6 colored areas in fig 5 indicate locations where some seagrass is present while no seagrass is present in the white areas of the plot colored areas do not necessary have 100 seagrass coverage and red areas have the highest seagrass presence fig 6 distinguishes areas with and without seagrass meadows for every depth for areas with meadows the reduction in wave height peaks where seagrass presence is maximum in contrast the reduction in wave height over bare beds is more uniform across all depths with small decreases occurring where seagrass presence is maximum as well as across transitional depth values above which no seagrass are present results for all wind speed values are presented in the supplementary material figs 3 4 in donatelli et al 2019 seagrass loss increases the action of waves and tides at the basin bottom the distributions of shear stresses are presented in fig 7 the presence of seagrass largely increases the extent of basin areas with shear stress values smaller than 0 1 pa in addition seagrass removal rises the lateral wave thrust exerted on marsh boundaries the spatial distribution of wave thrust averaged throughout a spring neap tidal cycle is depicted in fig 8 for the non seagrass case and for the case with maximum seagrass coverage 1979 fig 9 shows the decrease in wave action due to seagrass presence with respect to the non seagrass case over the last 50 years average wave thrust reduction in time and across the entire bay are thus expressed in terms of percentage reduction with respect to the non seagrass case fig 9 our numerical findings suggest that in barnegat bay the wave attack on marsh boundaries increased significantly between 1979 and 1987 light blue areas in fig 10 although on average a small reduction in seagrass coverage occurred fig 10 and table 1 in donatelli et al 2019 though the average decrease in seagrass extent was small seagrass loss was greater in areas sheltering the marsh boundaries fig 2c in donatelli et al 2019 in contrary in the last five decades the wave thrust increased uniformly in manahawkin bay fig 10 as the seagrass removal was uniform 5 discussion and conclusions the impact of submerged aquatic vegetation on wind waves and tides within a semi enclosed shallow lagoon system has been evaluated using the barnegat bay little egg harbor system as test case the analyses are based on historical trends of seagrass distribution from 1968 to 2009 a scenario with no seagrass represents a plausible system configuration in the near future this study has shown that seagrass decline influences tidal propagation in shallow bays with multiple inlets specifically changes in bottom friction alter the relative phase between the tidal waves coming from each inlet modifying water levels within the entire estuary fig 3 tidal asymmetry in coastal embayments and estuaries is governed by the ratio of tidal amplitude to mean water depth and the ratio of intertidal storage area occupied by tidal flats and salt marshes to that of channels speer and aubrey 1985 previous studies have investigated the impact of tidal flat elevations e g fortunato and oliveira 2005 and salt marsh erosion donatelli et al 2018b on tidal propagation and asymmetry within shallow estuaries in this study we show that seagrass also influences tidal asymmetry for this test case the average increase in tidal nonlinearities due to seagrass presence fig 4 is higher than the one caused by an increase in intertidal storage volume due to a complete removal of salt marsh areas the latter was explored in donatelli et al 2018b hence submerged aquatic vegetation might increase the flood dominance of microtidal back barrier estuaries particularly the friction due to seagrasses slows the propagation of tidal water levels around low tide relative to high tide dronkers 1988 leading to longer ebb and higher velocity currents during the flood phase moreover we show that increased seagrass coverage decreases bed shear stress across the entire basin fig 7 these findings agree with previous field measurements and numerical studies hansen and reidenbach 2012 donatelli et al 2018a which demonstrate that seagrasses reduce bottom shear stresses within and behind patches and also impact the sediment budget of coastal bays marsh loss associated with edge erosion is a major mechanism of marsh deterioration in estuaries and lagoons worldwide schwimmer 2001 barbier et al 2008 marani et al 2011 tommasini et al 2019 wind waves are recognized as the chief erosional agent and schwimmer 2001 first suggested the existence of a relationship between wave energy and marsh retreat subsequent studies further corroborated this finding e g marani et al 2011 leonardi and fagherazzi 2014 leonardi et al 2016a b tidal levels play a key role in wind wave attack determining the elevation at which waves attack the marsh edge wave action on marsh boundaries increases with tidal elevation and then drops when the marsh is submerged tonelli et al 2010 in this study we showed in agreement with previous researches e g nowacki et al 2017 beudin et al 2017b nardin et al 2018 that submerged aquatic vegetation has a local effect in dampening waves indeed seagrasses strongly reduce wave heights over meadows but have a more limited effect on un vegetated flats fig 6 therefore given a certain seagrass distribution marsh boundaries experience a decrease in wave attack and such decrease in wave action is significantly larger for those salt marshes located next to meadows our numerical results show that over the last five decades the wave action on salt marshes fringing the mainland in the barnegat bay little egg harbor estuary increased with seagrass loss fig 10 reveals how seagrass deterioration affected wave attack in the central and north part of the estuary and highlights how the disappearance of small sav patches next to marsh boundaries table s1 fig s2 increased the wave thrust by 35 in the period 1979 1987 these results highlight that in terms of protection of the marsh boundary the location of disappearing seagrasses is important our research underlines how seagrass decline can decrease bay sediment storage capacity and potentially enhance salt marsh lateral erosion because salt marsh loss reduces the ability of shallow estuaries to retain sediments donatelli et al 2018b this might in turn promote further deterioration of salt marshes through a positive feedback loop e g ganju et al 2017 leonardi et al 2017 the influence of seagrasses on hydrodynamics should be explored seasonally as aboveground biomass peaks during june july and declines significantly during fall when it becomes five times smaller kennish et al 2007b 2008 farnsworth 1998 koch et al 2009 hansen and reidenbach 2013 the capacity of meadows to influence waves changes over the year and a minimum shoot density is necessary to initiate wave attenuation e g paul and amos 2011 the lack of seasonal data in our study constitutes a significant gap in the understanding of how these ecosystems can affect the stability

studies e g leonardi et al 2016a b show that marshes are eroding at around 0 5 2 m year with the highest erosion rate registered in great bay the resolution of the model domain is such that morphological changes due to marsh edge erosion cannot be taken into account at these erosion rates therefore we focus solely on the impact of seagrass coverage on waves and tides by adopting an exploratory model approach murray 2007 salt marsh and seagrass coverage data were derived from the crssa s center for remote sensing and spatial analysis geographic information systems gis database vegetation parameters are listed in table 2 of donatelli et al 2019 nominally selected using kennish et al 2013 for guidance simulations are run implementing different seagrass coverages corresponding to the years 1968 1979 1987 1999 2003 2009 and for a test case without seagrasses 1968 map u s army corps of engineers 1976 1979 map macomber and allen 1979 1987 map joseph et al 1992 1999 map mcclain and mchale 1996 bologna et al 2000 2003 and 2009 maps lathrop and haag 2011 4 results from 1968 until 2009 the extent of seagrass meadows within the barnegat bay little egg harbor system largely declined fig 1 fig 2 table 1 in donatelli et al 2019 fig 2 shows the area colonized by seagrass as a function of water depth for each year the impact of seagrass loss on tidal propagation was evaluated following classic harmonic analysis using t tide pawlowicz et al 2002 and by computing the spatial distribution of the amplitude and phase lag of the m 2 constituent within the entire back barrier basin for coastal areas with multiple inlets water levels are controlled by the interaction between tidal forcing propagating from each inlet and changes in bottom friction that can alter their relative phase a comparison between amplitude and phase lag values for the scenario with maximum seagrass coverage year 1979 and a scenario without seagrass reveals that the phase lag of the tidal wave coming from great bay and directed to barnegat bay decreased with seagrass removal as a consequence the tidal amplitude within the entire northern part of the estuary increases for the non seagrass case because the tidal waves from barnegat inlet and from great bay have a similar phase and become additive seagrass loss also influences tidal asymmetry asymmetric tides are important for the transport and deposition of sediments in shallow estuaries aubrey and speer 1985 changes in tidal asymmetry were calculated following the formulation of friedrichs and aubrey 1988 and are depicted in fig 4 the amplitude and phase ratios between the fourth diurnal m 4 constituent and the semidiurnal m 2 constituent have been calculated our results suggest that seagrass meadows tend to enhance the flood dominance of the system increasing the m 4 m 2 water level amplitude ratio as tidal nonlinearities are enhanced in this study we also evaluated the influence of seagrass beds on locally generated wind waves for winds of 5 10 and 15 m s blowing from the southwest and southeast wind directions and speeds were chosen based on the most frequent winds fig 1h with southwest winds maximizing fetch in the southern half of the estuary fig 5 presents the distribution of mean wave heights as a function of water depth in the non seagrass case and for the scenarios with maximum year 1979 and minimum year 2009 seagrass coverage the mean wave height is the mean value throughout the entire simulation computed at each cell our results show that the presence of seagrass attenuates waves across the entire bay although this damping effect is more limited on bare beds fig 6 colored areas in fig 5 indicate locations where some seagrass is present while no seagrass is present in the white areas of the plot colored areas do not necessary have 100 seagrass coverage and red areas have the highest seagrass presence fig 6 distinguishes areas with and without seagrass meadows for every depth for areas with meadows the reduction in wave height peaks where seagrass presence is maximum in contrast the reduction in wave height over bare beds is more uniform across all depths with small decreases occurring where seagrass presence is maximum as well as across transitional depth values above which no seagrass are present results for all wind speed values are presented in the supplementary material figs 3 4 in donatelli et al 2019 seagrass loss increases the action of waves and tides at the basin bottom the distributions of shear stresses are presented in fig 7 the presence of seagrass largely increases the extent of basin areas with shear stress values smaller than 0 1 pa in addition seagrass removal rises the lateral wave thrust exerted on marsh boundaries the spatial distribution of wave thrust averaged throughout a spring neap tidal cycle is depicted in fig 8 for the non seagrass case and for the case with maximum seagrass coverage 1979 fig 9 shows the decrease in wave action due to seagrass presence with respect to the non seagrass case over the last 50 years average wave thrust reduction in time and across the entire bay are thus expressed in terms of percentage reduction with respect to the non seagrass case fig 9 our numerical findings suggest that in barnegat bay the wave attack on marsh boundaries increased significantly between 1979 and 1987 light blue areas in fig 10 although on average a small reduction in seagrass coverage occurred fig 10 and table 1 in donatelli et al 2019 though the average decrease in seagrass extent was small seagrass loss was greater in areas sheltering the marsh boundaries fig 2c in donatelli et al 2019 in contrary in the last five decades the wave thrust increased uniformly in manahawkin bay fig 10 as the seagrass removal was uniform 5 discussion and conclusions the impact of submerged aquatic vegetation on wind waves and tides within a semi enclosed shallow lagoon system has been evaluated using the barnegat bay little egg harbor system as test case the analyses are based on historical trends of seagrass distribution from 1968 to 2009 a scenario with no seagrass represents a plausible system configuration in the near future this study has shown that seagrass decline influences tidal propagation in shallow bays with multiple inlets specifically changes in bottom friction alter the relative phase between the tidal waves coming from each inlet modifying water levels within the entire estuary fig 3 tidal asymmetry in coastal embayments and estuaries is governed by the ratio of tidal amplitude to mean water depth and the ratio of intertidal storage area occupied by tidal flats and salt marshes to that of channels speer and aubrey 1985 previous studies have investigated the impact of tidal flat elevations e g fortunato and oliveira 2005 and salt marsh erosion donatelli et al 2018b on tidal propagation and asymmetry within shallow estuaries in this study we show that seagrass also influences tidal asymmetry for this test case the average increase in tidal nonlinearities due to seagrass presence fig 4 is higher than the one caused by an increase in intertidal storage volume due to a complete removal of salt marsh areas the latter was explored in donatelli et al 2018b hence submerged aquatic vegetation might increase the flood dominance of microtidal back barrier estuaries particularly the friction due to seagrasses slows the propagation of tidal water levels around low tide relative to high tide dronkers 1988 leading to longer ebb and higher velocity currents during the flood phase moreover we show that increased seagrass coverage decreases bed shear stress across the entire basin fig 7 these findings agree with previous field measurements and numerical studies hansen and reidenbach 2012 donatelli et al 2018a which demonstrate that seagrasses reduce bottom shear stresses within and behind patches and also impact the sediment budget of coastal bays marsh loss associated with edge erosion is a major mechanism of marsh deterioration in estuaries and lagoons worldwide schwimmer 2001 barbier et al 2008 marani et al 2011 tommasini et al 2019 wind waves are recognized as the chief erosional agent and schwimmer 2001 first suggested the existence of a relationship between wave energy and marsh retreat subsequent studies further corroborated this finding e g marani et al 2011 leonardi and fagherazzi 2014 leonardi et al 2016a b tidal levels play a key role in wind wave attack determining the elevation at which waves attack the marsh edge wave action on marsh boundaries increases with tidal elevation and then drops when the marsh is submerged tonelli et al 2010 in this study we showed in agreement with previous researches e g nowacki et al 2017 beudin et al 2017b nardin et al 2018 that submerged aquatic vegetation has a local effect in dampening waves indeed seagrasses strongly reduce wave heights over meadows but have a more limited effect on un vegetated flats fig 6 therefore given a certain seagrass distribution marsh boundaries experience a decrease in wave attack and such decrease in wave action is significantly larger for those salt marshes located next to meadows our numerical results show that over the last five decades the wave action on salt marshes fringing the mainland in the barnegat bay little egg harbor estuary increased with seagrass loss fig 10 reveals how seagrass deterioration affected wave attack in the central and north part of the estuary and highlights how the disappearance of small sav patches next to marsh boundaries table s1 fig s2 increased the wave thrust by 35 in the period 1979 1987 these results highlight that in terms of protection of the marsh boundary the location of disappearing seagrasses is important our research underlines how seagrass decline can decrease bay sediment storage capacity and potentially enhance salt marsh lateral erosion because salt marsh loss reduces the ability of shallow estuaries to retain sediments donatelli et al 2018b this might in turn promote further deterioration of salt marshes through a positive feedback loop e g ganju et al 2017 leonardi et al 2017 the influence of seagrasses on hydrodynamics should be explored seasonally as aboveground biomass peaks during june july and declines significantly during fall when it becomes five times smaller kennish et al 2007b 2008 farnsworth 1998 koch et al 2009 hansen and reidenbach 2013 the capacity of meadows to influence waves changes over the year and a minimum shoot density is necessary to initiate wave attenuation e g paul and amos 2011 the lack of seasonal data in our study constitutes a significant gap in the understanding of how these ecosystems can affect the stability

661,upscaling the microscopic processes in charged porous media which are responsible for pore pressure evolution and swelling is a topic of ongoing research current theories assume homogeneous media with uniform pore sizes and the impact of microscopic heterogeneity is neglected this is a preliminary study to determine the significance of such pore scale heterogeneity on the pressure evolution in charged porous media where we neglect deformation of the solid phase we present a pore network model to simulate salt transport and pressure evolution in a charged porous medium results show that for pore radii following a log normal distribution the average pressure in heterogeneous networks are significantly lower than in homogeneous networks with the same mean pore size this is expressed by lower average pressures as well as lower streaming potentials and faster ion transport rates in heterogeneous networks these results indicate that heterogeneity in charged porous media should be

in salinity can affect the pressure in tight charged porous media which leads to numerous problems an example of a charged porous medium is clay where changes in salinity affect the pressure this causes the clay to expand or shrink such swelling processes cause problems in several different fields of study for example the use of poor quality irrigation water can lead to swell shrink processes in agricultural soils decreasing the growing conditions of crops quirk and schofield 1955 shainberg and letey 1984 in petroleum engineering the use low salinity water based drilling fluids in shale leads to swelling and can cause wellbore instabilities joekar niasar and mahani 2016 van oort et al 1996 furthermore swelling increases the sealing capacity of clay barriers preventing the migration of radionuclides when storing radioactive waste in the subsurface pusch 1992 understanding the pressure evolution in such materials is therefore of great importance the salinity and fluid pressure in such porous media are related because of the charged surfaces the charge of the porous medium is balanced by a surplus of counter ions near the charged surface bolt 1982 the resulting ion distribution near the charged surface is often described by the diffuse double layer model here the first layer consists of immobile cations which are strongly adsorbed to the charged surface referred to as the stern layer the second layer consists of diffuse ions which is the net result of electrostatic forces and thermal motion the thickness of the double layer is inversely related to the ion valence and salt concentration the presence of this diffuse layer and the corresponding electric field is what affects the pressure inside charged porous media the salt concentration affects the pressure through two processes barbour et al 1992 the first process is osmotic water flow gradients in salinity drive osmotic flow which alters the bulk pressure in the porous medium the electric potential in the double layer promotes transport of counterions while it hinders transport of coions thus a net transport of charge occurs which results in an electric potential the so called streaming potential or diffusion potential this electric potential induces movement of ions through electrophoresis the movement of the cations induces viscous drag on the fluid and thus water also flows in response to the streaming potential such water flow is termed electro osmosis this water flow changes the bulk pressure i e the pressure in the water that is not affected by the diffuse double layer secondly the diffuse double layer influences the interparticle stresses as it changes the disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is the additional pressure between two surfaces the diffuse double layer affects the electric component of the disjoining pressure this component is the net result of the repulsive osmotic pressure and the attractive maxwell stress both processes will be considered in this study on the macroscopic scale swelling of media is related to the swelling pressure the macroscopic swelling pressure is defined as the external pressure that must be applied to a sample to keep it from expanding low 1987 under transient conditions the bulk pressure and disjoining pressure should both be considered to calculate the swelling pressure under no flow conditions the swelling pressure is simply the volume averaged disjoining pressure derjaguin et al 1987 the swelling pressure has been estimated based on theoretical frameworks before most studies estimate the swelling pressure according to diffuse double layer theory for both equilibrium conditions madsen and müller vonmoos 1985 shainberg et al 1971 and transient conditions gonçalvès et al 2010 horseman et al 2007 moyne and murad 2002 these transient models included the combined effect of the bulk pressure and the disjoining pressure in the effective stress in the porous medium the effect of salinity on the reduction of hydraulic conductivity due to swelling in soils based on double layer theory has also been investigated e g bresler et al 1982 russo 2013 the aforementioned studies translated the relevant microscopic processes to larger scales however these studies omitted the impact of microscopic heterogeneity on the large scale behaviour these studies considered clay as the porous medium and assumed that the microstructure is homogeneous and consists of parallel particles this allows for a simplification of the mathematical problem however most natural porous media have heterogeneous pore sizes e g kuila and prasad 2013 in most studies the disjoining pressure is estimated based on a representative interplatelet distance gonçalvès et al 2010 however a definition of such an interplatelet distance is lacking for heterogeneous media to determine the importance of heterogeneity we apply an alternative upscaling method pore network modelling is a useful approach for scaling up flow and transport processes in heterogeneous porous media the effect of microscopic heterogeneities can be translated to large scale behaviour in such models the geometry of the pore space is simplified and flow and transport between individual pores is simulated pore network models were originally tools for upscaling multiphase flow in porous media fatt 1956 over time these models have been applied to other topics such as dynamic multiphase flow joekar niasar et al 2010 and reactive transport acharya et al 2005 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 a pore network model that includes electrokinetic transport has been developed before by obliger et al 2014 however in this study we use the framework developed by joekar niasar et al 2013 which gives a more accurate description of the ion distributions in charged channels the aim of this study is to determine the significance of heterogeneous pore sizes on the pressure evolution in charged porous media this study is a first step in including heterogeneity in which we neglect deformation of the solid structure for this purpose we developed a pore network model that includes the effect of diffuse double layers in pores on water flow and ionic transport the model considers both the evolution of the bulk pressure and the disjoining pressure we find the swelling pressure by volume averaging the sum of these pressure components these computations will be done for both homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks and the results are compared to determine the significance of heterogeneity 2 pore network model we developed a pore network model that includes electrokinetic effects on water flow and ionic transport to investigate the effect of heterogeneity on the swelling pressure the model was used simulate the evolution of the pressure field electric field and salt concentration inside a pore network as a consequence of changes in ionic strength this study was limited to homovalent electrolyte solutions in particular 1 1 electrolyte solutions such as nacl we only considered scenarios where the pore network is fully saturated thus only the effect of the electrolyte concentration on the swelling pressure was considered the pore space is discretized in pore bodies and pore throats storage of mass and charge occurs in pore bodies while transport of these properties occurs in the pore throats the shape of the pore bodies is spherical the walls of the pore bodies are assumed to have no charge the ion distribution inside the pore bodies can therefore be considered homogeneous thus a single value for the cation concentration anion concentration fluid pressure and electric potential is assigned to each pore body the potential in the pore bodies is the streaming potential which develops as a result of electroneutrality the pore throats have rectangular cross sections the geometry of the pore throat is characterized by its height h and the dimensionless width w w h fig 1 we consider only square cross sections w 1 in this study but this method can also be applied to different pore geometries contrary to pore bodies walls of pore throats are charged we employ the gouy chapman model and thus assume that the charge of the porous medium is completely compensated by the diffuse layer there is no immobile stern layer in our model the no slip surface for fluid flow is therefore located at the channel wall thus the surface potential equals the zeta potential in this case a uniform zeta potential is assigned to the channel walls we consider a dimensionless zeta potential ζ defined as ζ f ζ r t here ζ is the zeta potential v f is the faraday constant c mol r is the gas constant j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k the zeta potential can vary as a function of time since we assumed a uniform zeta potential this implies that the surface charge density cannot be uniform across the channel walls as the charge of adjacent walls interact with each other therefore we apply a constant average surface charge density σζ instead this is explained in more detail in appendix a we assume that the ions are in local equilibrium which allows for the use of the poisson boltzmann equation in the pore throats additionally we assume that resistance to flow in pore bodies is negligible compared with that in pore throats thus only the permeability of pore throats is of interest furthermore we assume that the pore network is rigid and not deformable and that the temperature dynamic viscosity and permittivity of water are constant finally the effect of gravity on water flow is neglected as it is not relevant to this study table 1 shows the values of material fluid and transport properties used in the pore network modelling parametrisation was based on properties of montmorillonite water and electrolyte properties of nacl we use the same diffusion coefficient for both the cation and anion species which for nacl is reasonable the next section presents the properties of the pore network itself 2 1 pore network geometry and topology the pore body radii and pore throat inscribed radii were generated from a truncated log normal distribution with no spatial correlation as spatial autocorrelation data are not available the pore size distribution f is described by 1 f 2 exp 1 2 ln r i r m σ p s 2 π σ p s 2 r i erf ln r m a x r m 2 σ p s 2 erf ln r m i n r m 2 σ p s 2 where ri is the radius of a pore rm is the mean pore body radius r max is the maximum pore radius r min is the minimum pore body radius and σps is the standard deviation the pore body radii were generated with a mean pore body size of 80 nm and standard deviation of 20 nm based on experimental n2 gas adsorption data from kuila and prasad 2013 the minimum pore body radius was set to 10 nm and the maximum pore body radius was set to 150 nm since the pore throats have square cross sections we refer here to the inscribed radii the inscribed pore throat radii were generated from a distribution with mean pore size of 20 nm and standard deviation of 10 nm with a minimum radius of 10 nm and a maximum of 50 nm these values are based on the experimental data of kuila and prasad 2013 larger standard deviations have also been tested which did not lead to different conclusions we imposed the condition that the pore throat radius could not be larger than the radius of the adjacent pore bodies when a pore throat radius was generated that did not meet this condition a new pore throat radius was generated until this condition was met the network used in this study was a cubic lattice the pores have a coordination number of 6 except for boundary pores the distance between two pore bodies was set to 1 8 μ m which resembles the upper limit of a clay particle size the size of the network must be large enough to give a good representation of the pore size distribution therefore several network sizes were tested to determine the appropriate network size 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the pore network is connected to a salt reservoir at one end of the network the salt concentration fluid pressure and electric potential inside the reservoir are constant in time dirichlet type boundary conditions are imposed on this boundary at all other boundaries we imposed a zero flux for water salt and charge the fluid pressure and electric potential are set to zero thus the pressure and electric potential we calculate are reference values the solution in the reservoir is electrically neutral the cation concentration is therefore equal to the anion concentration for a homovalent case the initial condition is that the pressure and electric potential are equal to their boundary conditions meaning there is no initial gradient in these properties the initial salt concentration is set to 1 0 10 2 m and the reservoir concentration is set to 1 5 10 4 m we expose the pore network to a low salinity reservoir to induce an increase in pressure with these initial and boundary concentrations the dimensionless radius k h λ d varies between 0 4 and 16 and the dimensionless zeta potential ζ varies between 0 08 and 3 45 2 3 equations for water flow ion transport and electric current the expressions for water flow ion transport and the electric current are based on the work of joekar niasar et al 2013 that derived the equations presented here a minor difference with the equations from joekar niasar et al 2013 is that in this paper the exponential term is approximated by a fourth order polynomial series instead of an even degree second order polynomial this was done to obtain more convenient expressions for the flow and transport coefficients in the following sections the subscripts i and j denote variables defined in pore bodies i and j the subscript ij denotes variables defined in the pore throat connecting pore bodies i and j 2 3 1 water flow in charged porous media water flow has a hydrodynamic chemical osmotic and electro osmotic component lemaire et al 2007 these water fluxes are driven by gradients in fluid pressure salt concentration and electric potential respectively the net water flux is the sum of these components these water fluxes can be written as a pore throat permeability multiplied by the difference in pressure salt concentration and electric potential 2 q i j k i j h p i b p j b k i j c c i b c j b k i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where qij is the total volumetric water flux through pore throat ij m3 s pb is the bulk pressure in pore bodies i and j pa cb is the bulk concentration in pore bodies i and j mol m3 and ϕb is the streaming potential in pore bodies i and j v k i j h k i j c and k i j e are the hydrodynamic chemical osmotic and electro osmotic permeability of pore throat ij respectively expressions for these coefficients are given in eqs c 3 c 4 and c 7 in appendix c 2 3 2 ion transport transport of ions in the presence of an electric field is described by the nernst planck equation the distribution of ions inside pore throats is influenced by the charge of the channel walls this causes a discrepancy between transport of cations and anions the average ion flux through a pore throat is given by 3 j i j g i j h p i b p j b g i j c c i b c j b g i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where j i j and j i j are the cation and anion mass fluxes through pore throat ij mol s respectively the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 g i j h describes hydrodynamic advective transport the second term g i j c describes the combined transport by chemical osmotic advection and diffusion the last term g i j e describes combined transport by electro osmotic advection and electromigration the expressions for all these terms are given in appendix c 2 3 3 electric current the electric current through a pore throat is defined as the difference between the mass flux of cations and the mass flux of anions through the pore throat multiplied by faraday s constant and the ion charge the resulting expression for the electric current through a pore throat is then 4 i i j z f j i j j i j m i j h p i b p j b m i j c c i b c j b m i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where iij is the electric current through pore throat ij c s m i j h is the hydrodynamic component of the electric current m i j c is the electric current due to the combined effect of chemical osmotic advection and diffusion and m i j e is the electric current due to the combined effect of electro osmotic advection and electromigration the expressions for these terms are given in appendix c this equation is only valid for homovalent electrolyte solutions 2 4 disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is the difference between the bulk fluid pressure and the pressure between two charged surfaces it consists of three components in this study we will only consider the electric component and thus neglect the structural component originating from the modified structure of water molecules near the charged solid surface and the van der waals force the neglected components are only significant at length scales smaller than 5 nm mcguiggan and pashley 1988 moreover these components are constant in a rigid pore network according to current theoretical expressions the electric component of the disjoining pressure is the net result of the osmotic pressure and the maxwell stress an expression for the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional channel is derived in appendix b the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional channel is variable in space unlike in the commonly used one dimensional case since we are interested in the swelling pressure we choose to calculate the average disjoining pressure an the channel walls the average disjoining pressure is the same on every wall of a pore throat since we consider square pore throats we only look at the disjoining pressure normal to the pore surface the average disjoining pressure in a pore throat is given by 5 π d r t c b ζ 2 ϵ 2 e y 2 where π d is the averaged disjoining pressure pa in a pore throat and ey is the average electric field at the channel wall v m the expression for ey is provided in appendix b it should be noted that in our pore network model the bulk pressure is defined only in pore bodies while the disjoining pressure is only defined in pore throats 2 5 computational procedure 2 5 1 governing equations the governing equations of the pore network model are the conservation equations for fluid mass salt mass and charge these equations are used to calculate the unknown variables of the system which are fluid pressure pb salt concentration cb and electric potential ϕb the first conservation equation is the fluid mass balance for an incompressible fluid under saturated conditions the volume of water entering a pore body is equal to the volume of water leaving the pore body the fluid mass balance then yields 6 m 1 n q i j 0 the expressions for flow eq 2 can be substituted in this equation which yields 7 m 1 n k i j h p i b p j b k i j c c i b c j b k i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 0 where n is the number of pores connected to pore i secondly we use the steady state charge conservation equation the electric field is assumed to be in steady state as the time scale of electric relaxation is much smaller than the time scale of ionic transport which prohibits separation of cations and anions the conservation of charge equation then yields 8 m 1 n i i j 0 substituting the expressions for the electric current from eq 4 this equation can be written as 9 m 1 n m i j h p i b p j b m i j c c i b c j b m i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 0 finally we use the mass balance equations for both the cation and anion species which are given by 10 v i δ c i τ m 1 n j i j where vi is the volume of pore body i m3 and τ is the time step size s substituting the expression for the ion mass fluxes eq 3 the equation can be rewritten as 11 v i δ c i τ m 1 n g i j h p i b p j b g i j c c i b c j b g i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 2 5 2 solver procedure at the start of each time step the concentration of the previous time step is used to calculate the electric potential in each pore throat from which the flow and transport coefficients are calculated second the charge balance equation eq 9 is solved using a semi implicit scheme using the pressure and the salt concentration of the previous time step this results in a linear system of equations this system is solved to obtain the electric potential in each pore body for the current time step third the fluid mass balance equation eq 7 is solved using a semi implicit scheme for the pressure field this results in a linear system of equations which is solved to obtain the pressure in each pore body finally the ion concentrations are then updated by solving the ion mass balance eq 11 using an explicit scheme since we imposed that there is no net change of the charge in a pore body the cation and anion concentrations are equal therefore eq 11 has to be solved only once either for cation or anion concentration the systems of linear equations are solved by using the direct sparse solver from intel mkl pardiso intel 2018 2 5 3 time stepping the maximum time step size is limited by the ion mass fluxes through the pores to prevent numerical instabilities the time step size is determined by the time it takes to fill or drain a pore to its maximum or minimum concentration respectively a local time step size is calculated for each pore body based on the ion fluxes when there is a net inflow of salt in the pore body the local time step is defined as the amount of time it takes to reach the maximum concentration i e τ i c max c i j i j on the other hand when there is a net outflow of salt in the pore body the local time step is equal to the time it takes to reaches the minimum concentration τ i abs c i c min j i j here τi is the local time step size of pore i the global time step size is then chosen as a fraction of the minimum local time step size 12 τ 0 01 min τ i a truncation criterion of 10 3 is imposed when the concentration is close to c min or c max 2 5 4 averaging of parameters local parameters are averaged to obtain macroscopic parameters parameters defined in pore bodies such as the bulk pressure salt concentration and electric potential are averaged over the pore body volume for example the average concentration is defined as 13 c v i c i v i averaging of the disjoining pressure is more complicated in swelling pressure measurements in clay the pressure in the direction perpendicular to the clay bedding is often measured low 1987 to mimic this we want to know the average disjoining pressure in the vertical direction of the network a complication is that the disjoining pressure is anisotropic and thus the orientation of the pore throats must be taken into account therefore we are interested only in the component of the disjoining pressure that acts on the vertical direction of the pore network which is defined as π d v π d cos θ here π d v is the vertical component of the disjoining pressure pa and θ is the angle of the pore throat with respect to the longitudinal axis of the pore network we assumed that all pore throats are not rotated along its longitudinal axis meaning that there is only one channel wall facing the vertical direction per pore throat the average disjoining pressure in this study is therefore actually the average vertical disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is averaged over the pore surface on which it acts 14 π d v a i j s π d v a i j s where a i j s is the surface area of the walls of pore throat ij 3 results and discussion 3 1 network size the pore network size needs to be sufficiently large to get a good representation of the pore size distribution at the same time we want it as small as possible to decrease computation time therefore we tested various pore network sizes to determine the appropriate network size we networks considered n n n cubic lattices for the pore network defined by the number of pore bodies in one direction n a sufficient network size should result in a similar average pressures between different realisations we found that this was the case for a network size of n 20 a similar network size was reported by obliger et al 2014 who looked at macroscopic flow and transport coefficients in charged pore networks the results below are all obtained from simulations with network size n 20 the total network length is therefore 35 μ m the computation time for such networks was 12 16 h on an intel r core tm i5 4690 cpu 3 50 ghz with 8 00gb ram 3 2 evolution of the salt concentration salt transport is governed by diffusion fig 2 to assert the significance of diffusion compared to advection the péclet number was computed for each pore throat the maximum péclet number did not exceed 0 05 which indicates that diffusion is indeed the dominant process in salt transport the discrepancy between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks becomes significant when the concentration drops below 0 001 m when the effect of the diffuse double layers becomes more important the salt concentration decreases in the whole network until it reaches the boundary condition value the concentration front moves faster in heterogeneous pore networks than in homogeneous pore networks fig 2 the time until steady state is reached is therefore also shorter for heterogeneous networks the time to reach steady state for the homogeneous network was 3 5 s while for heterogeneous networks it was around 2 5 s 3 3 evolution of the streaming potential the profile of the streaming potential at various points in time is shown in fig 3 this is the electric potential that develops due to unequal transport of cations and anions this is not the electric potential in the diffuse double layer the streaming potential starts out at the reference value which is zero ions diffuse into the reservoir at distance of 1 0 due to the lower salt concentration in the reservoir cations travel relatively faster through the network than anions since anions are repelled from the negatively charged channel walls to keep the bulk solution in the pore bodies electroneutral the electric potential drops as the salt concentration decreases the diffuse double layers extend this causes a stronger unequal transport between cations and anions however the salt concentration gradient becomes smaller over time which reduces the ionic flux however the first process dominates and the electric potential becomes more negative over time see t 0 1 s and t 0 3 s in fig 3 the situation reverses when the salt concentration becomes small i e when the system approaches the steady state situation during this phase the electric potential increases back to its reference value t 1 s and t 1 5 s in fig 3 the final electric potential is not shown as it is the same as the initial electric potential fig 3 also shows the difference in electric potential for homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks the average electric potential in heterogeneous networks is significantly lower less negative than that in homogeneous networks the streaming potential develops due to different transport rates of cations and anions in the negatively charged channels this difference in ionic transport rates becomes more significant when the thickness of the double layer is thick compared to the pore radius there is less overlapping of the diffuse double layers in the larger pores that exist in heterogeneous networks which results in smaller streaming potentials less negative in such networks 3 4 evolution of the pressure fig 4 shows the profile of the bulk pressure at various moments in time the bulk pressure shows non monotonic behaviour at first it increases then it drops the development of the bulk pressure is closely related to the evolution of the streaming potential as the electric potential in the pore network drops water flows into the network by electro osmosis at the same time chemical osmotic flow drives water in the opposite direction towards the reservoir the increase of the bulk pressure suggests there is a net inflow of water thus electro osmotic flow dominates over chemical osmotic flow when the electric potential drops the inflow of water decreases and the pressure drops to its reference value the effect of heterogeneity on the bulk pressure is similar to its effect on the streaming potential in our model the streaming potential is the main driving force for water flow since lower streaming potentials are observed in heterogeneous networks lower bulk pressures are also observed in such networks the bulk pressure in a heterogeneous network was up to 46 smaller than that in a homogeneous network the maximum pressure in homogeneous porous media was 1172 pa while in heterogeneous networks the maximum observed pressure was 650 pa thus the differences in average bulk pressure between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are significant this implies that the pressure evolution in heterogeneous networks cannot be approximated by a homogeneous network with the same mean pore radius a second homogenous network was considered where the median value of the pore size distribution was assigned to all pore throat radii while this yielded results closer to the heterogeneous network the pressure was still significantly overestimated the disjoining pressure increases monotonically over time as the salt concentration drops fig 5 the disjoining pressure is higher near the reservoir distance equal to 1 0 where the salt concentration is lower at steady state the disjoining pressure is the same over the whole network in the homogeneous system because the pore radii and bulk concentration are identical for every pore in the heterogeneous network the bulk concentration is equal in each pore but the pore radii are different therefore the disjoining pressure is not equal in each pore this causes the erratic pattern of the disjoining pressure in heterogeneous networks fig 5 this pattern would be smoother for larger pore networks with more pores per cross section additionally fig 5 shows that the average disjoining pressure in the heterogeneous network is significantly lower than that in the homogeneous network the maximum average disjoining pressure in homogeneous systems is 1056 pa while for heterogeneous systems the maximum observed pressure is 882 pa which is 16 lower although we used intrinsic average pressure in the previous sections a clear definition of the average pressure in a porous medium is lacking the pressure is often averaged as we did using the intrinsic phase average operator e g joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 however nordbotten et al 2007 showed that this can introduce averaging artefacts and they proposed a centroid corrected averaging operator instead nevertheless the intrinsic phase average is still frequently used the definition of the average pressure in a charged porous medium is even more complex as the disjoining pressure is anisotropic gonçalvès et al 2010 proposed to average the disjoining pressure over the surface area of the solid particles as this is the surface on which the pressure acts a similar method was used in this study however in a heterogeneous system this averaged pressure does not reflect the swelling potential the pressure in smaller pores is much larger than in the larger pores for example at steady state the pressure in the smallest pore is 4 2 kpa while in the largest pore it is 0 6 kpa the small pores would swell significantly more than the large pores which is not captured by the volume averaged pressure this suggests that the volume averaged pressure does not give a good indication on the effective swelling pressure in a heterogeneous network the pressure in this study is on the order of kpa while most experimental studies in clays show pressures on the order of mpa the reason for this is that the surface charge density of the solid phase used in the model was based on experimentally obtained data from delgado et al 1986 and low 1987 these studies show that most of the charge of the clay is compensated by the stern layer which would yield low electric potentials in the diffuse double layer for example low 1987 reports that only 2 of the charge of the clay is compensated by the diffuse layer which results in disjoining pressures in the range as reported in this study this discrepancy between diffuse double layer theory and experiments have been attributed to the structural component of the disjoining pressure by low 1987 although theoretical development of this component is lacking alternatively some studies neglect the charge of the stern layer and assume that the full charge deficit of the clay is compensated by the diffuse double layer such situations result in high electric potentials and disjoining pressures comparable to experimental measurements in the pore network model we chose to use small electric potentials since it makes use of the debye hückel approximation which is only accurate for small electric potentials this approximation would overestimate the electric potential in the pore throats under high electric potential conditions in such cases the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation should be solved instead to obtain an accurate solution for the electric potential however for the message of this paper the use of the debye hückel approximation instead of the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation is not important 4 conclusions we investigated the significance of heterogeneity on the pressure evolution in rigid charged porous media for this purpose we developed a pore network model for simulating water flow and salt transport in such media we simulated water flow and salt transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks a log normal pore size distribution was assumed for the heterogeneous networks with a mean pore size equal to the homogeneous networks pore size we compared the evolution of the pressure between both cases of course for homogeneous networks at steady state the averaged swelling pressure was equal to the microscopic disjoining pressure which is in agreement with derjaguin et al 1987 in the heterogeneous networks the average pressure was much lower than in the homogeneous network while local pressures could be much higher this raises the question if the volume averaged pressure represents the swelling potential of heterogeneous systems this also makes it difficult to estimate the swelling pressure based on diffuse double layer theory as a definition of a representative pore size is not clear as expected large pores dominate electrokinetic processes in heterogeneous networks this effect is seen in both the lower average bulk pressure and the lower average disjoining pressure and is also reflected in the lower streaming potential and higher ion transport rates compared to the homogeneous network the results indicate that heterogeneity in charged porous media should be investigated further as these insights can have implications for practical purposes such as the management of agricultural soils the pore network model presented in this study can be extended in future work the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation could be included in the model to make it applicable to high electric potentials which allows for a better comparison with experimental data however no analytical solution exists for the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation in rectangular or cylindrical domains therefore the poisson boltzmann equation has to be solved numerically for each pore or approximated semi analytically similar to the work of oyanader and arce 2005 this would drastically increase the computational demand but makes the model applicable to a wider range of situations additionally the gouy chapman model could be extended for more realistic descriptions of the diffuse double layer possibilities are including the stern layer cation exchange or ion ion correlation finally including deformation of the pore network in response to the swelling pressure could give valuable information on the evolution of the hydraulic properties in swelling soils acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo which is partly funded

schreyer for her valuable comments on this manuscript appendix a electric potential in a charged rectangular channel we consider the gouy chapman model and thus neglect the stern layer the zeta potential is equal to the surface potential in this case the ions in the diffuse layer can move due to external gradients like pressure concentration or electric potential the ion concentration profiles in the diffuse layer under equilibrium conditions can be described by the boltzmann distribution which for a homovalent electrolyte is given by a 1 c c b exp z ψ where c is the ion concentration of species in a pore throat mol m3 cb is the concentration in the bulk solution z is the ion valence of the electrolyte species and ψ is the dimensionless electric potential in the electric double layer the dimensionless electric potential is defined as ψ f ψ r t where ψ is the electric potential v the electric field in a channel is given by the solution to the poisson boltzmann equation to obtain an analytical solution for the poisson boltzmann equation in a rectangular channel we have to make use of the debye hückel approximation to linearise the poisson boltzmann this is done by using the approximation sinh ψ ψ which is a valid approximation for small electric potentials while strictly speaking this is a valid approximation only for zeta potentials of less than 25 mv it is still a good approximation for zeta potentials up to 75 mv masliyah and bhattacharjee 2005 the linearised poisson boltzmann equation is given by a 2 2 ψ 1 λ d 2 ψ where λd is the debye length m which for a homovalent electrolyte is defined as λ d ϵ r t 2 z 2 f 2 c b before this equation can be solved appropriate boundary conditions should be applied montmorillonite is assumed to have a constant surface charge density lehikoinen 1999 van olphen 1963 sperry and peirce 1999 tournassat et al 2011 this boundary condition implies that the zeta potential is a function of the salt concentration however we use the analytical expressions for flow and transport through rectangular charged channels by joekar niasar et al 2013 which are based on a constant zeta potential at the channel walls the solution to the linear poisson boltzmann equation in a rectangular channel with a constant zeta potential is given by a 3 ψ ζ cosh k y cosh k m 1 a m cos 2 m 1 π y 2 cosh ℜ m x where ζ is the zeta potential ℜ m 2 m 1 2 π 2 4 k 2 a m 4 1 m 1 k 2 2 m 1 π ℜ m 2 cosh ℜ m w and the dimensionless coordinates x x h and y y h joekar niasar et al 2013 ng and qi 2015 we truncate the infinite series to two terms to include such a dynamic zeta potential but still make use of the expression for the electric potential in eq a 3 we derive a relationship between the surface charge density and the zeta potential the solution for the electric potential can be used to find a relationship between the surface charge density and the zeta potential since σ ζ ϵ ψ n integrating this over the channel walls yields the average surface charge density for this expression for the electric potential the following relationship between the average surface charge density and the zeta potential is obtained a 4 σ ζ ϵ ζ h k tanh k m 1 a m 1 m 1 2 m 1 π ℜ m sinh ℜ m w where σζ is the average electrokinetic surface charge density c m2 the above expression for the electric potential was used to derive expressions for the ion concentration profiles this expression is only valid for pore throats with square cross sections appendix b disjoining pressure in a charged rectangular channel the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional situation is different than in one dimensional case in a two dimensional case the disjoining pressure is not constant across the whole channel we choose to calculate the normal component of the disjoining stress tensor at the channel walls since we have rectangular channel cross sections this component is equal at each wall of the channel therefore it is arbitrary which channel wall is chosen we chose the wall perpendicular to the y axis at y 1 since we look only at the normal component on one of the channel walls we consider only a single element of the disjoining pressure stress tensor this component is given by b 1 π d π ϵ 2 e x 2 e y 2 where π is the osmotic pressure pa and ex and ey are the x and y components of the electric field the x component of the electric field the tangential component is zero at this wall since the electric potential is constant and equal to the zeta potential over the whole length of the wall the expression for the disjoining pressure then reduces to b 2 π d π ϵ 2 e y 2 since we have a constant zeta potential at the channel walls the electric field directed normal from the wall is variable in space therefore we calculate the average disjoining pressure on the surface as b 3 π d π ϵ 2 e y 2 the electric field is related to the electric potential through the relation e y ψ y the average electric field e 2 can then be calculated using our expression for the electric potential this yields b 4 e y 2 r t ζ h f 2 k 2 tanh 2 k a 1 2 π 2 8 1 sinh 2 ℜ 1 w 2 w ℜ 1 9 a 2 2 π 2 8 1 sinh 2 ℜ 2 w 2 w ℜ 2

obtained assuming a boltzmann distribution for the ions for low electric potentials this yields b 5 π r t c b ζ 2 the osmotic pressure is constant across the length of the channel wall because the zeta potential is constant the expression for the osmotic pressure is therefore the same as for the average osmotic pressure π π eqs b 4 and b 5 are substituted into eq b 3 to calculate the disjoining pressure at each time step appendix c expressions for flow and transport the equations for transport of water salt and electric charge are based on the work of joekar niasar et al 2013 a brief summary is given here the water flow velocity is obtained from the modified stokes equation the flow velocity can be divided into three components the hydrodynamic velocity uh driven by gradients in fluid pressure the chemical osmotic velocity uc driven by gradients in salt concentration and the electro osmotic velocity ue driven by gradients in electric potential c 1a η 2 u h x 2 2 u h y 2 p b z c 1b

a rectangular domain the solutions are not shown here but can be found in joekar niasar et al 2013 the gradient e g p b z between two pore bodies is discretized as p i b p j b l where l is the length of pore throat ij m for the pore network model we require average fluxes for each pore throat therefore the local fluxes are averaged over the cross sectional area of the pore throat to obtain coefficients for flow and transport for example the average hydrodynamic flow velocity is given by c 2 u h 1 4 w 1 1 w w u h d x d y the volumetric water flux through a pore throat is then simply the average flow rate multiplied by the cross sectional area of the pore throat for example the hydrodynamic water flux is given by q i j h a u h k i j h p i b p j b where a is the cross sectional area of the pore throat m2 and k i j h is the hydrodynamic permeability of pore throat ij the expression for the hydrodynamic permeability is then given by c 3 k i j h 32 h 2 η π 5 w l a π w 2 tanh π w 2 the same methodology is used to obtain the coefficients for chemico osmotic and electro osmotic flow the chemical osmotic permeability of pore throat ij is given by c 4 k i j c 32 r t w h 2 η π 4 l a a 0

gradients in electric potential the electro osmotic permeability of pore throat ij is given by c 7 k i j e ϵ r t η f l a ψ ζ where ϵ is the electric permittivity of water c2 j m f is the faraday constant c mol the zeta potential ζ denotes the electric potential at the shear plane inside the pore throat we assume that it is located at the channel wall the term ψ is the average electric potential in the pore throat the expression for this term is shown in table c 1 in appendix c transport of ions is based on the nernst planck equation assuming a monovalent electrolyte solution with a boltzmann distribution the average ion flux through pore throat ij for a monovalent electrolyte is given by c 8 j i j u h exp ψ c b u c exp ψ c b u e exp ψ c b d exp ψ c b z d exp ψ c b ϕ b z where ϕ b f ϕ b r t is the dimensionless streaming potential and cb is the ion concentration of the upstream pore body the averaging of the parameters occurs in the same manner as eq c 2 the ion distribution is described by the exponential boltzmann distribution which we approximated by a polynomial function c 9 exp ψ b 0 b 1 ψ b 2 ψ 2 b 3 ψ 3 b 4 ψ 4 we fitted this function for a range of 0 ψ 3 with an r

01097 for the coefficients b 0 b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 respectively the pressure driven salt transport through pore throat ij only consists of hydrodynamic advection c 10 g i j h a l u h exp ψ c b the average hydrodynamic advective flux can be written by making use of the polynomial approximation c 11 u h exp ψ b 0 u h b 1 u h ψ b 2 u h ψ 2 b 3 u h ψ 3 b 4 u h ψ 4 these terms are shown in table c 2 gradients in salt concentration cause ionic transport through pore throat ij via both chemical osmotic advection and diffusion c 12 g i j c a u c exp ψ c b d a l exp ψ where d is the ion diffusion coefficient m2 s which we set equal for both cations and anions in this study the average chemical osmotic advection can be written as c 13 u c exp ψ b 0 u c b 1 u c ψ b 2 u c ψ 2 b 3 u c ψ 3 b 4 u c

we only consider homovalent electrolyte solutions the electric current through pore throat ij is given by c 17 i i j z f j i j j i j thus the coefficients for charge transport through pore throat ij can be written in terms of the coefficients for salt transport c 18a m i j h z f g i j h g i j h c 18b m i j c z f g i j c g i j c c 18c m i j e z f g i j e g i j e no new expressions are therefore

661,upscaling the microscopic processes in charged porous media which are responsible for pore pressure evolution and swelling is a topic of ongoing research current theories assume homogeneous media with uniform pore sizes and the impact of microscopic heterogeneity is neglected this is a preliminary study to determine the significance of such pore scale heterogeneity on the pressure evolution in charged porous media where we neglect deformation of the solid phase we present a pore network model to simulate salt transport and pressure evolution in a charged porous medium results show that for pore radii following a log normal distribution the average pressure in heterogeneous networks are significantly lower than in homogeneous networks with the same mean pore size this is expressed by lower average pressures as well as lower streaming potentials and faster ion transport rates in heterogeneous networks these results indicate that heterogeneity in charged porous media should be

in salinity can affect the pressure in tight charged porous media which leads to numerous problems an example of a charged porous medium is clay where changes in salinity affect the pressure this causes the clay to expand or shrink such swelling processes cause problems in several different fields of study for example the use of poor quality irrigation water can lead to swell shrink processes in agricultural soils decreasing the growing conditions of crops quirk and schofield 1955 shainberg and letey 1984 in petroleum engineering the use low salinity water based drilling fluids in shale leads to swelling and can cause wellbore instabilities joekar niasar and mahani 2016 van oort et al 1996 furthermore swelling increases the sealing capacity of clay barriers preventing the migration of radionuclides when storing radioactive waste in the subsurface pusch 1992 understanding the pressure evolution in such materials is therefore of great importance the salinity and fluid pressure in such porous media are related because of the charged surfaces the charge of the porous medium is balanced by a surplus of counter ions near the charged surface bolt 1982 the resulting ion distribution near the charged surface is often described by the diffuse double layer model here the first layer consists of immobile cations which are strongly adsorbed to the charged surface referred to as the stern layer the second layer consists of diffuse ions which is the net result of electrostatic forces and thermal motion the thickness of the double layer is inversely related to the ion valence and salt concentration the presence of this diffuse layer and the corresponding electric field is what affects the pressure inside charged porous media the salt concentration affects the pressure through two processes barbour et al 1992 the first process is osmotic water flow gradients in salinity drive osmotic flow which alters the bulk pressure in the porous medium the electric potential in the double layer promotes transport of counterions while it hinders transport of coions thus a net transport of charge occurs which results in an electric potential the so called streaming potential or diffusion potential this electric potential induces movement of ions through electrophoresis the movement of the cations induces viscous drag on the fluid and thus water also flows in response to the streaming potential such water flow is termed electro osmosis this water flow changes the bulk pressure i e the pressure in the water that is not affected by the diffuse double layer secondly the diffuse double layer influences the interparticle stresses as it changes the disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is the additional pressure between two surfaces the diffuse double layer affects the electric component of the disjoining pressure this component is the net result of the repulsive osmotic pressure and the attractive maxwell stress both processes will be considered in this study on the macroscopic scale swelling of media is related to the swelling pressure the macroscopic swelling pressure is defined as the external pressure that must be applied to a sample to keep it from expanding low 1987 under transient conditions the bulk pressure and disjoining pressure should both be considered to calculate the swelling pressure under no flow conditions the swelling pressure is simply the volume averaged disjoining pressure derjaguin et al 1987 the swelling pressure has been estimated based on theoretical frameworks before most studies estimate the swelling pressure according to diffuse double layer theory for both equilibrium conditions madsen and müller vonmoos 1985 shainberg et al 1971 and transient conditions gonçalvès et al 2010 horseman et al 2007 moyne and murad 2002 these transient models included the combined effect of the bulk pressure and the disjoining pressure in the effective stress in the porous medium the effect of salinity on the reduction of hydraulic conductivity due to swelling in soils based on double layer theory has also been investigated e g bresler et al 1982 russo 2013 the aforementioned studies translated the relevant microscopic processes to larger scales however these studies omitted the impact of microscopic heterogeneity on the large scale behaviour these studies considered clay as the porous medium and assumed that the microstructure is homogeneous and consists of parallel particles this allows for a simplification of the mathematical problem however most natural porous media have heterogeneous pore sizes e g kuila and prasad 2013 in most studies the disjoining pressure is estimated based on a representative interplatelet distance gonçalvès et al 2010 however a definition of such an interplatelet distance is lacking for heterogeneous media to determine the importance of heterogeneity we apply an alternative upscaling method pore network modelling is a useful approach for scaling up flow and transport processes in heterogeneous porous media the effect of microscopic heterogeneities can be translated to large scale behaviour in such models the geometry of the pore space is simplified and flow and transport between individual pores is simulated pore network models were originally tools for upscaling multiphase flow in porous media fatt 1956 over time these models have been applied to other topics such as dynamic multiphase flow joekar niasar et al 2010 and reactive transport acharya et al 2005 babaei and joekar niasar 2016 a pore network model that includes electrokinetic transport has been developed before by obliger et al 2014 however in this study we use the framework developed by joekar niasar et al 2013 which gives a more accurate description of the ion distributions in charged channels the aim of this study is to determine the significance of heterogeneous pore sizes on the pressure evolution in charged porous media this study is a first step in including heterogeneity in which we neglect deformation of the solid structure for this purpose we developed a pore network model that includes the effect of diffuse double layers in pores on water flow and ionic transport the model considers both the evolution of the bulk pressure and the disjoining pressure we find the swelling pressure by volume averaging the sum of these pressure components these computations will be done for both homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks and the results are compared to determine the significance of heterogeneity 2 pore network model we developed a pore network model that includes electrokinetic effects on water flow and ionic transport to investigate the effect of heterogeneity on the swelling pressure the model was used simulate the evolution of the pressure field electric field and salt concentration inside a pore network as a consequence of changes in ionic strength this study was limited to homovalent electrolyte solutions in particular 1 1 electrolyte solutions such as nacl we only considered scenarios where the pore network is fully saturated thus only the effect of the electrolyte concentration on the swelling pressure was considered the pore space is discretized in pore bodies and pore throats storage of mass and charge occurs in pore bodies while transport of these properties occurs in the pore throats the shape of the pore bodies is spherical the walls of the pore bodies are assumed to have no charge the ion distribution inside the pore bodies can therefore be considered homogeneous thus a single value for the cation concentration anion concentration fluid pressure and electric potential is assigned to each pore body the potential in the pore bodies is the streaming potential which develops as a result of electroneutrality the pore throats have rectangular cross sections the geometry of the pore throat is characterized by its height h and the dimensionless width w w h fig 1 we consider only square cross sections w 1 in this study but this method can also be applied to different pore geometries contrary to pore bodies walls of pore throats are charged we employ the gouy chapman model and thus assume that the charge of the porous medium is completely compensated by the diffuse layer there is no immobile stern layer in our model the no slip surface for fluid flow is therefore located at the channel wall thus the surface potential equals the zeta potential in this case a uniform zeta potential is assigned to the channel walls we consider a dimensionless zeta potential ζ defined as ζ f ζ r t here ζ is the zeta potential v f is the faraday constant c mol r is the gas constant j mol k and t is the absolute temperature k the zeta potential can vary as a function of time since we assumed a uniform zeta potential this implies that the surface charge density cannot be uniform across the channel walls as the charge of adjacent walls interact with each other therefore we apply a constant average surface charge density σζ instead this is explained in more detail in appendix a we assume that the ions are in local equilibrium which allows for the use of the poisson boltzmann equation in the pore throats additionally we assume that resistance to flow in pore bodies is negligible compared with that in pore throats thus only the permeability of pore throats is of interest furthermore we assume that the pore network is rigid and not deformable and that the temperature dynamic viscosity and permittivity of water are constant finally the effect of gravity on water flow is neglected as it is not relevant to this study table 1 shows the values of material fluid and transport properties used in the pore network modelling parametrisation was based on properties of montmorillonite water and electrolyte properties of nacl we use the same diffusion coefficient for both the cation and anion species which for nacl is reasonable the next section presents the properties of the pore network itself 2 1 pore network geometry and topology the pore body radii and pore throat inscribed radii were generated from a truncated log normal distribution with no spatial correlation as spatial autocorrelation data are not available the pore size distribution f is described by 1 f 2 exp 1 2 ln r i r m σ p s 2 π σ p s 2 r i erf ln r m a x r m 2 σ p s 2 erf ln r m i n r m 2 σ p s 2 where ri is the radius of a pore rm is the mean pore body radius r max is the maximum pore radius r min is the minimum pore body radius and σps is the standard deviation the pore body radii were generated with a mean pore body size of 80 nm and standard deviation of 20 nm based on experimental n2 gas adsorption data from kuila and prasad 2013 the minimum pore body radius was set to 10 nm and the maximum pore body radius was set to 150 nm since the pore throats have square cross sections we refer here to the inscribed radii the inscribed pore throat radii were generated from a distribution with mean pore size of 20 nm and standard deviation of 10 nm with a minimum radius of 10 nm and a maximum of 50 nm these values are based on the experimental data of kuila and prasad 2013 larger standard deviations have also been tested which did not lead to different conclusions we imposed the condition that the pore throat radius could not be larger than the radius of the adjacent pore bodies when a pore throat radius was generated that did not meet this condition a new pore throat radius was generated until this condition was met the network used in this study was a cubic lattice the pores have a coordination number of 6 except for boundary pores the distance between two pore bodies was set to 1 8 μ m which resembles the upper limit of a clay particle size the size of the network must be large enough to give a good representation of the pore size distribution therefore several network sizes were tested to determine the appropriate network size 2 2 boundary and initial conditions the pore network is connected to a salt reservoir at one end of the network the salt concentration fluid pressure and electric potential inside the reservoir are constant in time dirichlet type boundary conditions are imposed on this boundary at all other boundaries we imposed a zero flux for water salt and charge the fluid pressure and electric potential are set to zero thus the pressure and electric potential we calculate are reference values the solution in the reservoir is electrically neutral the cation concentration is therefore equal to the anion concentration for a homovalent case the initial condition is that the pressure and electric potential are equal to their boundary conditions meaning there is no initial gradient in these properties the initial salt concentration is set to 1 0 10 2 m and the reservoir concentration is set to 1 5 10 4 m we expose the pore network to a low salinity reservoir to induce an increase in pressure with these initial and boundary concentrations the dimensionless radius k h λ d varies between 0 4 and 16 and the dimensionless zeta potential ζ varies between 0 08 and 3 45 2 3 equations for water flow ion transport and electric current the expressions for water flow ion transport and the electric current are based on the work of joekar niasar et al 2013 that derived the equations presented here a minor difference with the equations from joekar niasar et al 2013 is that in this paper the exponential term is approximated by a fourth order polynomial series instead of an even degree second order polynomial this was done to obtain more convenient expressions for the flow and transport coefficients in the following sections the subscripts i and j denote variables defined in pore bodies i and j the subscript ij denotes variables defined in the pore throat connecting pore bodies i and j 2 3 1 water flow in charged porous media water flow has a hydrodynamic chemical osmotic and electro osmotic component lemaire et al 2007 these water fluxes are driven by gradients in fluid pressure salt concentration and electric potential respectively the net water flux is the sum of these components these water fluxes can be written as a pore throat permeability multiplied by the difference in pressure salt concentration and electric potential 2 q i j k i j h p i b p j b k i j c c i b c j b k i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where qij is the total volumetric water flux through pore throat ij m3 s pb is the bulk pressure in pore bodies i and j pa cb is the bulk concentration in pore bodies i and j mol m3 and ϕb is the streaming potential in pore bodies i and j v k i j h k i j c and k i j e are the hydrodynamic chemical osmotic and electro osmotic permeability of pore throat ij respectively expressions for these coefficients are given in eqs c 3 c 4 and c 7 in appendix c 2 3 2 ion transport transport of ions in the presence of an electric field is described by the nernst planck equation the distribution of ions inside pore throats is influenced by the charge of the channel walls this causes a discrepancy between transport of cations and anions the average ion flux through a pore throat is given by 3 j i j g i j h p i b p j b g i j c c i b c j b g i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where j i j and j i j are the cation and anion mass fluxes through pore throat ij mol s respectively the first term on the right hand side of eq 3 g i j h describes hydrodynamic advective transport the second term g i j c describes the combined transport by chemical osmotic advection and diffusion the last term g i j e describes combined transport by electro osmotic advection and electromigration the expressions for all these terms are given in appendix c 2 3 3 electric current the electric current through a pore throat is defined as the difference between the mass flux of cations and the mass flux of anions through the pore throat multiplied by faraday s constant and the ion charge the resulting expression for the electric current through a pore throat is then 4 i i j z f j i j j i j m i j h p i b p j b m i j c c i b c j b m i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b where iij is the electric current through pore throat ij c s m i j h is the hydrodynamic component of the electric current m i j c is the electric current due to the combined effect of chemical osmotic advection and diffusion and m i j e is the electric current due to the combined effect of electro osmotic advection and electromigration the expressions for these terms are given in appendix c this equation is only valid for homovalent electrolyte solutions 2 4 disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is the difference between the bulk fluid pressure and the pressure between two charged surfaces it consists of three components in this study we will only consider the electric component and thus neglect the structural component originating from the modified structure of water molecules near the charged solid surface and the van der waals force the neglected components are only significant at length scales smaller than 5 nm mcguiggan and pashley 1988 moreover these components are constant in a rigid pore network according to current theoretical expressions the electric component of the disjoining pressure is the net result of the osmotic pressure and the maxwell stress an expression for the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional channel is derived in appendix b the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional channel is variable in space unlike in the commonly used one dimensional case since we are interested in the swelling pressure we choose to calculate the average disjoining pressure an the channel walls the average disjoining pressure is the same on every wall of a pore throat since we consider square pore throats we only look at the disjoining pressure normal to the pore surface the average disjoining pressure in a pore throat is given by 5 π d r t c b ζ 2 ϵ 2 e y 2 where π d is the averaged disjoining pressure pa in a pore throat and ey is the average electric field at the channel wall v m the expression for ey is provided in appendix b it should be noted that in our pore network model the bulk pressure is defined only in pore bodies while the disjoining pressure is only defined in pore throats 2 5 computational procedure 2 5 1 governing equations the governing equations of the pore network model are the conservation equations for fluid mass salt mass and charge these equations are used to calculate the unknown variables of the system which are fluid pressure pb salt concentration cb and electric potential ϕb the first conservation equation is the fluid mass balance for an incompressible fluid under saturated conditions the volume of water entering a pore body is equal to the volume of water leaving the pore body the fluid mass balance then yields 6 m 1 n q i j 0 the expressions for flow eq 2 can be substituted in this equation which yields 7 m 1 n k i j h p i b p j b k i j c c i b c j b k i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 0 where n is the number of pores connected to pore i secondly we use the steady state charge conservation equation the electric field is assumed to be in steady state as the time scale of electric relaxation is much smaller than the time scale of ionic transport which prohibits separation of cations and anions the conservation of charge equation then yields 8 m 1 n i i j 0 substituting the expressions for the electric current from eq 4 this equation can be written as 9 m 1 n m i j h p i b p j b m i j c c i b c j b m i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 0 finally we use the mass balance equations for both the cation and anion species which are given by 10 v i δ c i τ m 1 n j i j where vi is the volume of pore body i m3 and τ is the time step size s substituting the expression for the ion mass fluxes eq 3 the equation can be rewritten as 11 v i δ c i τ m 1 n g i j h p i b p j b g i j c c i b c j b g i j e ϕ i b ϕ j b 2 5 2 solver procedure at the start of each time step the concentration of the previous time step is used to calculate the electric potential in each pore throat from which the flow and transport coefficients are calculated second the charge balance equation eq 9 is solved using a semi implicit scheme using the pressure and the salt concentration of the previous time step this results in a linear system of equations this system is solved to obtain the electric potential in each pore body for the current time step third the fluid mass balance equation eq 7 is solved using a semi implicit scheme for the pressure field this results in a linear system of equations which is solved to obtain the pressure in each pore body finally the ion concentrations are then updated by solving the ion mass balance eq 11 using an explicit scheme since we imposed that there is no net change of the charge in a pore body the cation and anion concentrations are equal therefore eq 11 has to be solved only once either for cation or anion concentration the systems of linear equations are solved by using the direct sparse solver from intel mkl pardiso intel 2018 2 5 3 time stepping the maximum time step size is limited by the ion mass fluxes through the pores to prevent numerical instabilities the time step size is determined by the time it takes to fill or drain a pore to its maximum or minimum concentration respectively a local time step size is calculated for each pore body based on the ion fluxes when there is a net inflow of salt in the pore body the local time step is defined as the amount of time it takes to reach the maximum concentration i e τ i c max c i j i j on the other hand when there is a net outflow of salt in the pore body the local time step is equal to the time it takes to reaches the minimum concentration τ i abs c i c min j i j here τi is the local time step size of pore i the global time step size is then chosen as a fraction of the minimum local time step size 12 τ 0 01 min τ i a truncation criterion of 10 3 is imposed when the concentration is close to c min or c max 2 5 4 averaging of parameters local parameters are averaged to obtain macroscopic parameters parameters defined in pore bodies such as the bulk pressure salt concentration and electric potential are averaged over the pore body volume for example the average concentration is defined as 13 c v i c i v i averaging of the disjoining pressure is more complicated in swelling pressure measurements in clay the pressure in the direction perpendicular to the clay bedding is often measured low 1987 to mimic this we want to know the average disjoining pressure in the vertical direction of the network a complication is that the disjoining pressure is anisotropic and thus the orientation of the pore throats must be taken into account therefore we are interested only in the component of the disjoining pressure that acts on the vertical direction of the pore network which is defined as π d v π d cos θ here π d v is the vertical component of the disjoining pressure pa and θ is the angle of the pore throat with respect to the longitudinal axis of the pore network we assumed that all pore throats are not rotated along its longitudinal axis meaning that there is only one channel wall facing the vertical direction per pore throat the average disjoining pressure in this study is therefore actually the average vertical disjoining pressure the disjoining pressure is averaged over the pore surface on which it acts 14 π d v a i j s π d v a i j s where a i j s is the surface area of the walls of pore throat ij 3 results and discussion 3 1 network size the pore network size needs to be sufficiently large to get a good representation of the pore size distribution at the same time we want it as small as possible to decrease computation time therefore we tested various pore network sizes to determine the appropriate network size we networks considered n n n cubic lattices for the pore network defined by the number of pore bodies in one direction n a sufficient network size should result in a similar average pressures between different realisations we found that this was the case for a network size of n 20 a similar network size was reported by obliger et al 2014 who looked at macroscopic flow and transport coefficients in charged pore networks the results below are all obtained from simulations with network size n 20 the total network length is therefore 35 μ m the computation time for such networks was 12 16 h on an intel r core tm i5 4690 cpu 3 50 ghz with 8 00gb ram 3 2 evolution of the salt concentration salt transport is governed by diffusion fig 2 to assert the significance of diffusion compared to advection the péclet number was computed for each pore throat the maximum péclet number did not exceed 0 05 which indicates that diffusion is indeed the dominant process in salt transport the discrepancy between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks becomes significant when the concentration drops below 0 001 m when the effect of the diffuse double layers becomes more important the salt concentration decreases in the whole network until it reaches the boundary condition value the concentration front moves faster in heterogeneous pore networks than in homogeneous pore networks fig 2 the time until steady state is reached is therefore also shorter for heterogeneous networks the time to reach steady state for the homogeneous network was 3 5 s while for heterogeneous networks it was around 2 5 s 3 3 evolution of the streaming potential the profile of the streaming potential at various points in time is shown in fig 3 this is the electric potential that develops due to unequal transport of cations and anions this is not the electric potential in the diffuse double layer the streaming potential starts out at the reference value which is zero ions diffuse into the reservoir at distance of 1 0 due to the lower salt concentration in the reservoir cations travel relatively faster through the network than anions since anions are repelled from the negatively charged channel walls to keep the bulk solution in the pore bodies electroneutral the electric potential drops as the salt concentration decreases the diffuse double layers extend this causes a stronger unequal transport between cations and anions however the salt concentration gradient becomes smaller over time which reduces the ionic flux however the first process dominates and the electric potential becomes more negative over time see t 0 1 s and t 0 3 s in fig 3 the situation reverses when the salt concentration becomes small i e when the system approaches the steady state situation during this phase the electric potential increases back to its reference value t 1 s and t 1 5 s in fig 3 the final electric potential is not shown as it is the same as the initial electric potential fig 3 also shows the difference in electric potential for homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks the average electric potential in heterogeneous networks is significantly lower less negative than that in homogeneous networks the streaming potential develops due to different transport rates of cations and anions in the negatively charged channels this difference in ionic transport rates becomes more significant when the thickness of the double layer is thick compared to the pore radius there is less overlapping of the diffuse double layers in the larger pores that exist in heterogeneous networks which results in smaller streaming potentials less negative in such networks 3 4 evolution of the pressure fig 4 shows the profile of the bulk pressure at various moments in time the bulk pressure shows non monotonic behaviour at first it increases then it drops the development of the bulk pressure is closely related to the evolution of the streaming potential as the electric potential in the pore network drops water flows into the network by electro osmosis at the same time chemical osmotic flow drives water in the opposite direction towards the reservoir the increase of the bulk pressure suggests there is a net inflow of water thus electro osmotic flow dominates over chemical osmotic flow when the electric potential drops the inflow of water decreases and the pressure drops to its reference value the effect of heterogeneity on the bulk pressure is similar to its effect on the streaming potential in our model the streaming potential is the main driving force for water flow since lower streaming potentials are observed in heterogeneous networks lower bulk pressures are also observed in such networks the bulk pressure in a heterogeneous network was up to 46 smaller than that in a homogeneous network the maximum pressure in homogeneous porous media was 1172 pa while in heterogeneous networks the maximum observed pressure was 650 pa thus the differences in average bulk pressure between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are significant this implies that the pressure evolution in heterogeneous networks cannot be approximated by a homogeneous network with the same mean pore radius a second homogenous network was considered where the median value of the pore size distribution was assigned to all pore throat radii while this yielded results closer to the heterogeneous network the pressure was still significantly overestimated the disjoining pressure increases monotonically over time as the salt concentration drops fig 5 the disjoining pressure is higher near the reservoir distance equal to 1 0 where the salt concentration is lower at steady state the disjoining pressure is the same over the whole network in the homogeneous system because the pore radii and bulk concentration are identical for every pore in the heterogeneous network the bulk concentration is equal in each pore but the pore radii are different therefore the disjoining pressure is not equal in each pore this causes the erratic pattern of the disjoining pressure in heterogeneous networks fig 5 this pattern would be smoother for larger pore networks with more pores per cross section additionally fig 5 shows that the average disjoining pressure in the heterogeneous network is significantly lower than that in the homogeneous network the maximum average disjoining pressure in homogeneous systems is 1056 pa while for heterogeneous systems the maximum observed pressure is 882 pa which is 16 lower although we used intrinsic average pressure in the previous sections a clear definition of the average pressure in a porous medium is lacking the pressure is often averaged as we did using the intrinsic phase average operator e g joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2011 however nordbotten et al 2007 showed that this can introduce averaging artefacts and they proposed a centroid corrected averaging operator instead nevertheless the intrinsic phase average is still frequently used the definition of the average pressure in a charged porous medium is even more complex as the disjoining pressure is anisotropic gonçalvès et al 2010 proposed to average the disjoining pressure over the surface area of the solid particles as this is the surface on which the pressure acts a similar method was used in this study however in a heterogeneous system this averaged pressure does not reflect the swelling potential the pressure in smaller pores is much larger than in the larger pores for example at steady state the pressure in the smallest pore is 4 2 kpa while in the largest pore it is 0 6 kpa the small pores would swell significantly more than the large pores which is not captured by the volume averaged pressure this suggests that the volume averaged pressure does not give a good indication on the effective swelling pressure in a heterogeneous network the pressure in this study is on the order of kpa while most experimental studies in clays show pressures on the order of mpa the reason for this is that the surface charge density of the solid phase used in the model was based on experimentally obtained data from delgado et al 1986 and low 1987 these studies show that most of the charge of the clay is compensated by the stern layer which would yield low electric potentials in the diffuse double layer for example low 1987 reports that only 2 of the charge of the clay is compensated by the diffuse layer which results in disjoining pressures in the range as reported in this study this discrepancy between diffuse double layer theory and experiments have been attributed to the structural component of the disjoining pressure by low 1987 although theoretical development of this component is lacking alternatively some studies neglect the charge of the stern layer and assume that the full charge deficit of the clay is compensated by the diffuse double layer such situations result in high electric potentials and disjoining pressures comparable to experimental measurements in the pore network model we chose to use small electric potentials since it makes use of the debye hückel approximation which is only accurate for small electric potentials this approximation would overestimate the electric potential in the pore throats under high electric potential conditions in such cases the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation should be solved instead to obtain an accurate solution for the electric potential however for the message of this paper the use of the debye hückel approximation instead of the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation is not important 4 conclusions we investigated the significance of heterogeneity on the pressure evolution in rigid charged porous media for this purpose we developed a pore network model for simulating water flow and salt transport in such media we simulated water flow and salt transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous pore networks a log normal pore size distribution was assumed for the heterogeneous networks with a mean pore size equal to the homogeneous networks pore size we compared the evolution of the pressure between both cases of course for homogeneous networks at steady state the averaged swelling pressure was equal to the microscopic disjoining pressure which is in agreement with derjaguin et al 1987 in the heterogeneous networks the average pressure was much lower than in the homogeneous network while local pressures could be much higher this raises the question if the volume averaged pressure represents the swelling potential of heterogeneous systems this also makes it difficult to estimate the swelling pressure based on diffuse double layer theory as a definition of a representative pore size is not clear as expected large pores dominate electrokinetic processes in heterogeneous networks this effect is seen in both the lower average bulk pressure and the lower average disjoining pressure and is also reflected in the lower streaming potential and higher ion transport rates compared to the homogeneous network the results indicate that heterogeneity in charged porous media should be investigated further as these insights can have implications for practical purposes such as the management of agricultural soils the pore network model presented in this study can be extended in future work the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation could be included in the model to make it applicable to high electric potentials which allows for a better comparison with experimental data however no analytical solution exists for the nonlinear poisson boltzmann equation in rectangular or cylindrical domains therefore the poisson boltzmann equation has to be solved numerically for each pore or approximated semi analytically similar to the work of oyanader and arce 2005 this would drastically increase the computational demand but makes the model applicable to a wider range of situations additionally the gouy chapman model could be extended for more realistic descriptions of the diffuse double layer possibilities are including the stern layer cation exchange or ion ion correlation finally including deformation of the pore network in response to the swelling pressure could give valuable information on the evolution of the hydraulic properties in swelling soils acknowledgements this research is financed by the netherlands organisation for scientific research nwo which is partly funded by the ministry of economic affairs and co financed by the netherlands ministry of infrastructure and environment and partners of the dutch waternexus consortium under nwo contract 14299 we thank lynn schreyer for her valuable comments on this manuscript appendix a electric potential in a charged rectangular channel we consider the gouy chapman model and thus neglect the stern layer the zeta potential is equal to the surface potential in this case the ions in the diffuse layer can move due to external gradients like pressure concentration or electric potential the ion concentration profiles in the diffuse layer under equilibrium conditions can be described by the boltzmann distribution which for a homovalent electrolyte is given by a 1 c c b exp z ψ where c is the ion concentration of species in a pore throat mol m3 cb is the concentration in the bulk solution z is the ion valence of the electrolyte species and ψ is the dimensionless electric potential in the electric double layer the dimensionless electric potential is defined as ψ f ψ r t where ψ is the electric potential v the electric field in a channel is given by the solution to the poisson boltzmann equation to obtain an analytical solution for the poisson boltzmann equation in a rectangular channel we have to make use of the debye hückel approximation to linearise the poisson boltzmann this is done by using the approximation sinh ψ ψ which is a valid approximation for small electric potentials while strictly speaking this is a valid approximation only for zeta potentials of less than 25 mv it is still a good approximation for zeta potentials up to 75 mv masliyah and bhattacharjee 2005 the linearised poisson boltzmann equation is given by a 2 2 ψ 1 λ d 2 ψ where λd is the debye length m which for a homovalent electrolyte is defined as λ d ϵ r t 2 z 2 f 2 c b before this equation can be solved appropriate boundary conditions should be applied montmorillonite is assumed to have a constant surface charge density lehikoinen 1999 van olphen 1963 sperry and peirce 1999 tournassat et al 2011 this boundary condition implies that the zeta potential is a function of the salt concentration however we use the analytical expressions for flow and transport through rectangular charged channels by joekar niasar et al 2013 which are based on a constant zeta potential at the channel walls the solution to the linear poisson boltzmann equation in a rectangular channel with a constant zeta potential is given by a 3 ψ ζ cosh k y cosh k m 1 a m cos 2 m 1 π y 2 cosh ℜ m x where ζ is the zeta potential ℜ m 2 m 1 2 π 2 4 k 2 a m 4 1 m 1 k 2 2 m 1 π ℜ m 2 cosh ℜ m w and the dimensionless coordinates x x h and y y h joekar niasar et al 2013 ng and qi 2015 we truncate the infinite series to two terms to include such a dynamic zeta potential but still make use of the expression for the electric potential in eq a 3 we derive a relationship between the surface charge density and the zeta potential the solution for the electric potential can be used to find a relationship between the surface charge density and the zeta potential since σ ζ ϵ ψ n integrating this over the channel walls yields the average surface charge density for this expression for the electric potential the following relationship between the average surface charge density and the zeta potential is obtained a 4 σ ζ ϵ ζ h k tanh k m 1 a m 1 m 1 2 m 1 π ℜ m sinh ℜ m w where σζ is the average electrokinetic surface charge density c m2 the above expression for the electric potential was used to derive expressions for the ion concentration profiles this expression is only valid for pore throats with square cross sections appendix b disjoining pressure in a charged rectangular channel the disjoining pressure in a two dimensional situation is different than in one dimensional case in a two dimensional case the disjoining pressure is not constant across the whole channel we choose to calculate the normal component of the disjoining stress tensor at the channel walls since we have rectangular channel cross sections this component is equal at each wall of the channel therefore it is arbitrary which channel wall is chosen we chose the wall perpendicular to the y axis at y 1 since we look only at the normal component on one of the channel walls we consider only a single element of the disjoining pressure stress tensor this component is given by b 1 π d π ϵ 2 e x 2 e y 2 where π is the osmotic pressure pa and ex and ey are the x and y components of the electric field the x component of the electric field the tangential component is zero at this wall since the electric potential is constant and equal to the zeta potential over the whole length of the wall the expression for the disjoining pressure then reduces to b 2 π d π ϵ 2 e y 2 since we have a constant zeta potential at the channel walls the electric field directed normal from the wall is variable in space therefore we calculate the average disjoining pressure on the surface as b 3 π d π ϵ 2 e y 2 the electric field is related to the electric potential through the relation e y ψ y the average electric field e 2 can then be calculated using our expression for the electric potential this yields b 4 e y 2 r t ζ h f 2 k 2 tanh 2 k a 1 2 π 2 8 1 sinh 2 ℜ 1 w 2 w ℜ 1 9 a 2 2 π 2 8 1 sinh 2 ℜ 2 w 2 w ℜ 2

obtained assuming a boltzmann distribution for the ions for low electric potentials this yields b 5 π r t c b ζ 2 the osmotic pressure is constant across the length of the channel wall because the zeta potential is constant the expression for the osmotic pressure is therefore the same as for the average osmotic pressure π π eqs b 4 and b 5 are substituted into eq b 3 to calculate the disjoining pressure at each time step appendix c expressions for flow and transport the equations for transport of water salt and electric charge are based on the work of joekar niasar et al 2013 a brief summary is given here the water flow velocity is obtained from the modified stokes equation the flow velocity can be divided into three components the hydrodynamic velocity uh driven by gradients in fluid pressure the chemical osmotic velocity uc driven by gradients in salt concentration and the electro osmotic velocity ue driven by gradients in electric potential c 1a η 2 u h x 2 2 u h y 2 p b z c 1b

a rectangular domain the solutions are not shown here but can be found in joekar niasar et al 2013 the gradient e g p b z between two pore bodies is discretized as p i b p j b l where l is the length of pore throat ij m for the pore network model we require average fluxes for each pore throat therefore the local fluxes are averaged over the cross sectional area of the pore throat to obtain coefficients for flow and transport for example the average hydrodynamic flow velocity is given by c 2 u h 1 4 w 1 1 w w u h d x d y the volumetric water flux through a pore throat is then simply the average flow rate multiplied by the cross sectional area of the pore throat for example the hydrodynamic water flux is given by q i j h a u h k i j h p i b p j b where a is the cross sectional area of the pore throat m2 and k i j h is the hydrodynamic permeability of pore throat ij the expression for the hydrodynamic permeability is then given by c 3 k i j h 32 h 2 η π 5 w l a π w 2 tanh π w 2 the same methodology is used to obtain the coefficients for chemico osmotic and electro osmotic flow the chemical osmotic permeability of pore throat ij is given by c 4 k i j c 32 r t w h 2 η π 4 l a a 0

chemical osmotic velocity was obtained by approximating the hyperbolic cosine by a polynomial function c 6 cosh ψ a 0 a 1 ψ a 2 ψ 2 a 3 ψ 3 a 4 ψ 4 we fitted this function for the range 0 ψ 3 with an r 2 of 1 the values of the fitting coefficients were 1 0 0 08858 0 7524 0 2172 and 0 1037 for the coefficients a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 and a 4 respectively finally electro osmosis is water flow driven by gradients in electric potential the electro osmotic permeability of pore throat ij is given by c 7 k i j e ϵ r t η f l a ψ ζ where ϵ is the electric permittivity of water c2 j m f is the faraday constant c mol the zeta potential ζ denotes the electric potential at the shear plane inside the pore throat we assume that it is located at the channel wall the term ψ is the average electric potential in the pore throat the expression for this term is shown in table c 1 in appendix c transport of ions is based on the nernst planck equation assuming a monovalent electrolyte solution with a boltzmann distribution the average ion flux through pore throat ij for a monovalent electrolyte is given by c 8 j i j u h exp ψ c b u c exp ψ c b u e exp ψ c b d exp ψ c b z d exp ψ c b ϕ b z where ϕ b f ϕ b r t is the dimensionless streaming potential and cb is the ion concentration of the upstream pore body the averaging of the parameters occurs in the same manner as eq c 2 the ion distribution is described by the exponential boltzmann distribution which we approximated by a polynomial function c 9 exp ψ b 0 b 1 ψ b 2 ψ 2 b 3 ψ 3 b 4 ψ 4 we fitted this function for a range of 0 ψ 3 with an r

gradients in salt concentration cause ionic transport through pore throat ij via both chemical osmotic advection and diffusion c 12 g i j c a u c exp ψ c b d a l exp ψ where d is the ion diffusion

we only consider homovalent electrolyte solutions the electric current through pore throat ij is given by c 17 i i j z f j i j j i j thus the coefficients for charge transport through pore throat ij

662,we derive a novel double continuum transport model based on pore scale characteristics our approach relies on building a simplified unit cell made up of immobile and mobile continua we employ a numerically resolved pore scale velocity distribution to characterize the volume of each continuum and to define the velocity profile in the mobile continuum using the simplified unit cell we derive a closed form model which includes two effective parameters that need to be estimated a characteristic length scale and a parameter rd given by the ratio of characteristic times that lumps the effect of stagnant regions and escape process to calibrate and validate our model we rely on a set of pore scale numerical simulation performed on a 2d disordered segregated periodic porous medium taking into account different initial solute distributions using a global sensitivity analysis we explore the impact of the two effective parameters on solute concentration profiles and thereby define a sensitivity analysis driven criterion for model calibration the latter is compared to a classical calibration approach our results show that depending on the initial condition the mass exchange process between mobile and immobile continua impact on solute profile shape significantly our transport model is capable of interpreting both symmetric and highly skewed solute concentration profiles effectiveness of the calibration of the two parameters largely depends on the calibration dataset and the selected objective function whose definition can be supported by the implementation of sensitivity analysis by relying on a sensitivity analysis driven calibration we are able to provide an accurate and robust interpretation of the concentration profile evolution across different given initial conditions by relying on a unique set of effective parameter values 1 introduction the development of accurate mathematical models to describe solute mass transport in porous media is particularly challenging when the medium is characterized by the presence of cavities dead end pores stagnant zones and a highly heterogeneous velocity field the structure and the extent of low velocity regions directly impact solute transport potentially leading to long mass retention times accurately modeling such trapping effects is crucial for example in the context of remediation and risk assessment e g de barros et al 2013 a sound understanding of the conditions and pore scale processes that physically control the rate of exchange between stagnant and fast flowing regions is needed to better understand solute spreading and mixing and subsequently the evolution of conservative and reactive transport processes e g alhashmi et al 2015 lichtner and kang 2007 kitanidis and dykaar 1997 wirner et al 2014 cortis and berkowitz 2004 briggs et al 2018 baveye et al 2018 solute transport has been widely studied by performing direct numerical simulations at the pore scale see e g scheibe et al 2015 bijeljic et al 2013b hochstetler et al 2013 porta et al 2013 such techniques present the remarkable advantage of providing detailed information on solute concentration evolution at each point of the porous domain however the applicability of such methods which are computationally demanding is limited to small domains typically much smaller than field scales of common interest dentz et al 2011 upscaled continuum models are consequently more suited to simulating larger scale systems to upscale the effects of low velocity regions on emerging transport features different approaches have been proposed such as multi rate mass transfer model mrmt tecklenburg et al 2016 haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 various continuous time random walk approaches ctrw berkowitz and scher 2009 1997 le borgne et al 2008 dentz and castro 2009 time and space fractional models fade kelly et al 2017 berkowitz et al 2002 time domain random walk approaches tdrw banton et al 1997 delay et bodin 2001 russian et al 2016 and other nonlocal formulations neuman and tartakovsky 2009 in particular double or multiple continua approaches are appealing due to their ability to explicitly distinguish stagnant zones from fast flowing channels in the classical double continuum approach haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 bear and cheng 2010 a mobile and immobile continuum exchange mass as a first order process with an effective mass transfer coefficient typically effective parameters of double or multi continuum models need to be estimated via fitting against solute concentration data e g measured breakthrough curves or solute concentration profiles alternatively upscaled dual continua models have been formally derived see e g souadnia et al 2002 by means of volume averaging techniques while appealing due to their sound theoretical basis as discussed by davit et al 2012 these formally derived double continua formulations present practical limitations in terms of their applicability to real problems often such models can be nearly as difficult to solve as their pore scale direct simulation counterparts as they include complex non local terms which imply significant numerical implementation challenges porta et al 2016 as a consequence a number of studies have proposed more parsimonious effective up scaled formulations that however still exploit key pore scale information these studies encompass eulerian porta et al 2015 and lagrangian formulations sund et al 2017a b dentz et al 2018 these methods are designed to embed pore scale characteristics into effective parameters which can be applied at a larger scale for example sund et al 2017a b employ trajectories and travel times distributions measured numerically at pore scale to infer the effective evolution of mixing and reaction rates in an effective lagrangian spatial markov model the work of porta et al 2015 focuses on the use of pore scale information to characterize a double continuum transport model from an eulerian perspective porta et al 2015 model relies on the cumulative distribution function of velocity measured from a pore scale simulation of single phase flow and assumes that the exchange time between high and low velocity regions is dictated by the characteristic diffusion time scale the model reproduces observed transport behaviors in relatively well connected three dimensional porous systems i e a beadpack and a sandstone sample however as shown by bénichou and voituriez 2008 realistic cavities may be characterized by complex geometry such that it can take an extremely long time to exchange mass from slow regions to faster flowing channels for this reason the double continuum approach proposed by porta et al 2015 might suffer limitations when the geometry of the porous medium is highly tortuous and presents significant stagnant cavities such features may arise in both three dimensional e g carbonate rocks see bijeljic et al 2013a and two dimensional porous media which are often employed in simulations and experiments acharya et al 2007 wirner et al 2014 de anna et al 2014 starting from the model developed in porta et al 2015 we develop a double continuum model which explicitly accounts for a characteristic time for the exchange process between high and low velocity regions which may be larger than the diffusion time scale this model lumps the effect of exchange process at pore scale into a single effective parameter which is defined as the ratio of the time required by the solute to escape explore the stagnant regions of the porous medium to the characteristic diffusive time scale our main objective is to derive a closed form double continuum model and to test it against numerical pore scale simulations of solute transport performed in a disordered synthetic two dimensional porous medium considering different initial conditions we explore the flexibility of the model by means of a sensitivity analysis we assess the effectiveness of the model by means of i a qualitative inspection of concentration profiles predicted considering different initial conditions and ii quantification of the sobol indices of appropriately defined target metrics we also investigate the role of a global sensitivity analysis gsa in defining a tailor made objective function to increase the efficacy of model calibration the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the problem setup that will be used as the test bed for the proposed double continuum model along with details on the pore scale model in section 3 we derive the proposed closed form double continuum model in section 4 the flexibility of the model is explored via a gsa calibration and validation of the model are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are presented in section 6 2 problem setting 2 1 pore scale domain in this work we consider a two dimensional porous medium made up of repeating periodic unit cells ω the cell configuration is the same as that of porta et al 2016 the geometry of the unit cell is generated by the disordered superposition of circular grains of uniform diameter w 8 10 5 m and then discretized into pixels of 2 10 5 m the resulting pixelated image characterized by porosity ϕ 0 5948 constitutes the reference cell configuration for the pore scale numerical simulations while this porosity value is larger than the one typically observed for three dimensional porous media two dimensional porous media with porosities equal or higher than the one considered here are commonly used in previous experimental and numerical studies see e g wirner et al 2014 acharya et al 2007 de anna et al 2014 the domain is periodic in both longitudinal and transversal directions the fluid flow in the unit cell is driven imposing a unit gradient pressure along the longitudinal direction and zero pressure gradient along the transverse direction the velocity field is steady and laminar and computed by solving the incompressible navier stokes equations assuming a fully saturated medium and considering impermeable boundary conditions on the grain liquid interface see porta et al 2016 the velocity field is resolved on a regular spatial grid with a resolution of 2 10 5 m and the numerical approximation is obtained following the methods introduced by bekri et al 1995 and coelho et al 1997 the grid resolution is one order of magnitude smaller than the average grain size which is estimated to 214 µm as given by imagej fiji imaging processing software ferreira and rasband 2012 the porous medium permeability along the longitudinal direction is equal to 4 87 10 5 cm2 the latter is estimated through the darcy s law where the total flow discharge and the pressure drop is computed using the numerically resolved pressure and velocity field the resulting value of permeability is of the same order of magnitude of those associated with clean sand and gravel see bear and cheng 2010 and thus comparable with real porous systems the geometry of the unit cell and the associated normalized velocity field normalized such that the mean velocity modulus is equal to 1 is shown in fig 1 a a unit cell has a total dimension of 4 8 10 3 m longitudinal to the main flow direction times 1 2 10 3 m transverse to the main flow direction the total length d of the porous domain is equal to 0 192 m corresponding to a sequence of 40 unit cells the average velocity along the x axis u ms 1 is equal to 6 22 10 5 ms 1 the velocity field shows large variability ranging over 10 orders of magnitude the probability density function pdf of velocity is similar to the one observed in real three dimensional porous media such as sandstones in fig 1b we compare the pdf observed for two real 3d geometries i e bentheimer sandstone ϕ 0 2147 and doddington sandstone ϕ 0 1949 presented by alhashmi et al 2016 against the pdf of the local velocities computed for our 2d geometry this comparison supports that the two dimensional system considered in our work presents a similar occurrence of low velocity regions as the one observed in three dimensional porous media we define low velocity regions as those below 10 2 in the normalized velocity field these regions are segregated from the well connected higher velocity channels we use this value to distinguish between the disconnected low velocity lv regions and the continuous high velocity hv channels in fig 1c we explicitly identify the solid phase and the lv and hv regions based on our chosen threshold 10 2 we can split the total porosity ϕ into two parts ϕ hv 0 5131 and ϕ lv 0 0817 associated with the hv and lv regions respectively the choice of 10 2 as velocity threshold between lv and hv regions is here based on a set of preliminary analyses investigating the sensitivity of ϕ hv ϕ to the velocity threshold for the chosen geometry we observe that the ratio ϕ hv ϕ shows minor changes when the velocity threshold varies between 10 2 and 10 8 2 2 initial conditions the analysis of the impact of the initial solute displacement is a critical feature in assessing the robustness of solute transport models as recently discussed in puyguiraud et al 2019 as a test bed for the double continuum model that we will present in section 3 we perform a series of pore scale simulations of conservative transport with three different initial scenarios labeled s u s hv and s lv s u in one unit cell the solute is uniformly distributed in both the hv and lv regions we define the initial concentration as e 0 s hv solute is uniformly distributed in only the hv region for the extent of one unit cell the cross sectional averaged initial concentration in the hv region e 0 h v is such that e 0 e 0 h v ϕ h v ϕ s lv solute is uniformly distributed in the lv region for the extent of one unit cell the cross sectional averaged initial concentration in the lv region e 0 l v is such that e 0 e 0 l v ϕ l v ϕ the aforementioned initial conditions are chosen to mimic conditions of particular interest when considering for example a contaminated site e g de barros et al 2013 or for the interpretation of experimental results where solute injection in a column is typically flux weighted 2 3 pore scale numerical simulations pore scale modeling of the concentration field is performed in a particle tracking framework with the time domain random walk tdrw approach described in detail in russian et al 2016 this approach is particularly suitable for simulations in media that display a broad range of velocity such as the one considered here banton et al 1997 delay et al 2002 bodin 2015 classical random walk algorithms are characterized by constant time discretization random walkers move over variable distances at constant time increments alternatively in the tdrw the domain is spatially discretized and random walkers move over fixed distances in variable time steps its benefit is that particles do not spend a large number of random walk steps in low velocity regions due to a constant time discretization the tdrw method is formally equivalent to a discretized advection diffusion equation russian et al 2016 at the same time its formulation coincides with a continuous time domain random walk ctrw with space dependent transition times and probabilities here we use 2 million particles for each simulation for each initial condition illustrated in section 2 2 we explore the temporal evolution of concentration over a total time of 400 s profile concentrations are obtained by vertical integration of particle numbers normalized by the corresponding porosity of the vertical slice 3 dual continuum model formulation the development of the double porosity model proposed here is built starting from the procedure originally developed by porta et al 2015 and it is schematically outlined in fig 2 we start with the 2d porous medium introduced in section 2 fig 1 we define the average péclet number p e a v u l d m where dm m2s 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and l m a characteristic length scale of the system that is considered unknown a priori and should be properly determined in the double continuum model the porous system is then conceptualized as a simplified unit cell of thickness l with a uniform shear flow fig 2a the direction of flow is only in the x m direction the unit cell is split into two parts labeled mobile and immobile the mobile zone light color in fig 2a occupies l 2 y l 2 with y m and the immobile zone dark color in fig 2a l 2 y l 2 and l 2 y l 2 the value of l m is computed such that l l ϕ h v ϕ and l l l ϕ l v ϕ to partition the mobile immobile region in the elementary cell in the same manner as the hv and lv regions in the reference porous medium the velocity distribution in the mobile zone is the appropriately rescaled sample cumulative distribution function cdf from pore scale velocities belonging to the hv region of the porous medium in fig 2b we depict the cdf computed for the normalized fluid velocity the vertical dashed line represents the chosen threshold discriminating between hv and lv regions we define a dimensionless coordinate reference system introducing x x l and y y l where x and y are the dimensional coordinates reported in fig 2a using the dimensionless reference system we assume that solute transport in the unit cell is described by the following dimensionless system of equations 1 e m t u e m x 1 p e 1 τ m 2 e m x 2 1 p e 2 e m y 2 y l 2 l e i t 1 p e 1 τ i m 2 e i x 2 r d p e 2 e i y 2 y l 2 l completed by the following boundary conditions 2 e m e i and e m y r d e i y y l 2 l a e i y 0 y 1 2 b where em x y t ce m x y t c 0 and ei x y t ce i x y t c 0 are dimensionless concentrations in the mobile hv and immobile lv zones of solute e respectively ce m x y t mol l 1 and ce i x y t mol l 1 are the concentrations in mobile and immobile region mol l 1 and c 0 mol l 1 is a characteristic concentration u represents the dimensionless velocity along the x direction computed as the ratio between the dimensional velocity u ms 1 and the mean velocity in the mobile region um ms 1 i e u u u m t is the dimensionless time defined as t t t a where t s is the time and ta l um s is the advective time scale pe is the péclet number computed based on the mean mobile velocity as pe uml dm we introduce in 2 two key novel elements with respect to the formulation of porta et al 2015 we include the dimensionless parameters τ m and τ im that represent the tortuosity factors associated with the hv and lv regions respectively including τ m and τ im embeds the impact of the phase geometry on the evolution of solute diffusion along the x direction in the simplified unit cell shen and chen 2007 the values of τ m and τ im are computed directly using the hv and lv geometries by mean of the taufactor matlab code cooper et al 2016 matlab and statistics toolbox release 2016b the hv region is characterized by τ m 2 48 while τ im is infinite since the lv region is clearly disconnected fig 1c the latter is a consequence of considering a two dimensional porous medium in more realistic 3d systems the lv region is connected due to the no slip boundary condition imposed at the solid fluid interface and the fact that solid phases connect unlike in 2d here to mimic a disconnected lv region we imposed a very high value of tortuosity τ im 100 we introduce parameter rd in 2 a defined as 3 r d t d t e where te s is the characteristic time required by the solute to escape explore the stagnant regions of the porous medium while the td s is the characteristic time scale of the diffusion process in a free fluid in porta et al 2015 the mass exchange between hv and lv regions is modeled as a diffusive process at the interface of immobile and mobile zones which means that the characteristic time of the mass exchange is assumed equal to the characteristic diffusion time td l 2 dm this choice may not always be appropriate for example if the porous structure includes large stagnant cavities connected to fast channels through narrow bottlenecks indeed pore scale and theoretical investigations e g wirner et al 2014 bénichou and voituriez 2008 van genuchten 1985 holcman and schuss 2013 holcman and schuss 2004 show that solute mass enclosed in a stagnant or fast flowing region may take an extremely long time to escape or explore the zone depending on its shape applying the same averaging procedure implemented by porta et al 2015 on the system 2 and 3 the closed section averaged form of the proposed model reads see the supplementary material for more details 4 e m t e m x x d h 1 e m x d h 2 δ e mi 1 p e 1 τ m 2 e m x 2 ϕ p e ϕ hv e 1 e m x e 2 δ e mi e i t 1 τ im 1 p e 2 e i x 2 ϕ ϕ

closure variables bi i 1 4 can be solved numerically given the known u y and bi y in the simplified unit cell details on the closure problem and its solution are provided in the supplementary materials investigating the specific relationship between porous geometry structure and rd is beyond the scope of the present work and is postponed to future efforts but understanding its role on large scale transport is considered next for the purposes of this work the quantity rd is considered as an effective parameter along with the characteristic length scale l whose characterization based on pore scale geometry feature is still open to debate and different methodologies have been proposed in literature see e g bear and cheng 2010 mostaghimi et al 2012 siena et al 2014 meyer and bijeljic 2016 alhashmi et al 2016 dullien 2012 moreover we highlight here that the definition of the unit cell depends on the velocity threshold imposed on the porous medium to distinguish between hv and lv regions in this study we select a specific threshold value and focus on the investigation of different transport conditions as a consequence of different solute distributions the identification of thresholds to discriminate high and low velocity regions has been a subject of previous works see e g de anna et al 2017 porta et al 2015 and may be reconsidered in future works to extend our analysis 4 characterization of the mass transfer at the continuum scale in this section we elucidate how the proposed model accounts for the exchange process between fast and slow regions and the impact of the exchange process on solute evolution depending on the initial conditions 4 1 quantification of mass transfer time as a proxy to quantify the exchange process simulated by the model we introduce 7 q t e i t e m t e 0 where t s is time e 0 is the initial concentration of the conservative solute e i t and e m t are the average concentration in the immobile and mobile zones along the x direction d respectively i e 8 e j d e j dx v j with j i m with vm and vi equal to the pore volume associated with the hv and lv regions of the porous domain an illustrative example of q t computed for initial condition s lv and four combinations of l and rd is shown in fig 3 a we observe that q t decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 over time when q t is equal to 1 all of the solute mass is in the immobile zone while q t 0 indicates an equilibrium between the solute mass flux escaping and entering the immobile zone how quickly q reaches zero tells us how quickly the exchange process occurs the red line l 1000 µm rd 1 10 4 72 and blue line l 98 µm rd 1 10 0 16 in fig 3a illustrate two extremes cases for large l and small rd q t suggests an extremely slow escape process such that at 400 s the solute is still almost totally trapped in the immobile zone this is confirmed in fig 3b where we display solute concentration profiles at t 200 s for the same combination of l and rd values of in fig 3a the yellow area identifies the initial step condition the concentration profile for l 1000 µm and rd 1 10 4 72 red line coincides closely with the initial condition by contrast for small l and rd close to one the exchange process is virtually instantaneous since q t approaches zero in the first time step of the simulation see blue line in fig 3a the corresponding concentration profile blue line in fig 3b does not present heavy tailing nor strong asymmetry suggesting that the retentive effect of the stagnant regions is negligible the black and magenta lines represent intermediate conditions demonstrating that both l and rd influence the mass exchange process the four different profiles in fig 3b present completely different shapes and spreading patterns demonstrating that within the context of the proposed model accessibility of the stagnant regions can significantly impact the profile evolution even when starting from the same initial condition i e s lv 4 2 impact of the initial condition the value of effective parameters embedded in the formulation 4 6 should depend solely on the porous medium structure and geometry of cavities this implies that the parameter values should not depend on the initial condition being investigated by considering different initial conditions as introduced in section 2 we can compare concentration profiles at t 200 s yielded by fixing the values of effective parameters l and rd fig 4 the combinations of parameters selected for fig 4 are those in fig 3 for the s lv scenario when the exchange process is very fast magenta and blue lines in fig 3a the impact of the initial condition is virtually not detectable fig 4d as the exchange process slows down the initial condition impacts predictions more markedly the scenarios s hv and s u lead to similar profiles in term of spread and skewness the only notable difference is that the solute with s u is prone to develop a thicker backward tail see fig 4a c as part of the solute is initially entrapped in the immobile zone the profiles generated starting from the s hv scenario present a symmetric shape for both very fast and extremely slow exchange process see fig 4b and d the solute profiles features associated with s lv are markedly different as solute has to leave the trapped phase before beginning its downstream journey 4 3 global sensitivity analysis the qualitative analysis illustrated above provides a quick understanding of the impact of the exchange process on model predictions limited to only four combinations of effective parameters selected for presentation purposes to explore more extensively and rigorously the impact of the variability of the effective parameters on solute transport depending on the initial condition we investigate different model responses by means of a global sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2008 sobol 1993 our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the mass transfer process to l and rd and thereby the resulting impact of mass transfer on the shape of longitudinal concentration profiles under different scenarios to this end we define the following outputs 9 t 50 t q t 0 5 10 σ 2 t d x μ t 2 e n x t d x 11 γ t d x μ t 3 e n x t d x σ 3 t where e n is the section averaged concentration normalized to total solute mass present in the system and μ t is the first spatial moment of e n here t 50 s is a characteristic time for mass transfer while σ2 and γ quantify spreading and skewness of the solute concentration profile we assume the two effective parameters embedded in the model i e rd and l to be two independent uniformly distributed random variables the parameter l is assumed to vary in ωl defined between 80 µm the diameter of the cylinders used to generate the porous medium see section 2 and 1200 µm i e the total length of the periodic unit cell in the transverse direction the parameter space of rd ωrd is bounded between 1 and 10 5 the upper bound corresponds to a porous structure that is easily accessible by the solute with the escape exploration time of the cavities equal to td the lower bound is estimated based on the results of wirner et al 2014 who investigate trapping effects of stagnant zones in a quasi two dimensional porous medium similar in nature to the one we use here using n quasi monte carlo sobol 1998 samples n 1000 of the parameter space ω l ω rd we run the model for each of the three different initial conditions and compute the first order sobol indices associated with the three target variables 9 11 note that as we consider only two parameters we can state the following equality by the anova analysis of variance sobol 1993 decomposition of variance 12 s i k l s i k r d s i k l r d 1 with k t 50 σ 2 γ where si k l and si k rd are the first order sobol indices of variable k associated with parameters l and rd respectively while si k l rd is the second order sobol index quantifying two parameter interaction effects on target quantity k fig 5 shows that the characteristic time associated with mass transfer t 50 is influenced by both parameters so that its variability is explained mostly by the combined variation of the two parameters this result is quantified by sobol indices which show the largest contribution to the variance of t 50 is given by the combined effect of the two effective parameters si t 50 l rd 0 55 see table 1 this essentially means that information on both parameters l and rd can help to better constrain this output and vice versa i e this output if measurable could be used to constrain both parameters the signature of the results on t 50 is reflected in a different fashion on profile shapes for different scenarios as shown in fig 6 the sobol indices indicate that for scenario s lv spreading is mainly influenced by the combined variability of l and rd because si σ2 l si σ2 rd 0 5 for all the considered times this is explained by the fact that for s lv solute displacement is limited by mass transfer to high velocity regions from low velocity regions where the solute is initially residing a similar result is obtained for the skewness γ limited to early times at larger times γ appears to be chiefly influenced by rd for s lv while the influence of l becomes relatively small after t 50 s in the s hv scenario parameter l almost entirely controls the variance of σ2 and the chosen length scale has a prominent impact on the solute spread in the mobile region in this scenario the solute accesses low velocity regions by mass transfer while being transported downstream parameter l has an effect on the pe number and thereby on the spreading of the profile due to dispersion in the mobile region i e dispersive parameters in eq 5 increase with l the effect of rd and the coupled effect between the two parameters emerge more clearly when profile skewness γ is considered in particular γ is chiefly influenced by the joint variation of the two parameters si γ l si γ rd 0 6 for t 50 s these results show that solute mass transfer has a negligible influence on spreading for s hv but is persistently reflected in the profile skewness at long times in scenario s u mass distribution between high and low velocity regions is at equilibrium in the initial condition i e the effect of mass transfer can be expected to be minor compared with the other two cases consistent with this observation spreading σ2 is initially controlled exclusively by l while with time the situation is gradually reversed i e rd becomes the most important parameter at all times si σ2 l si σ2 rd 1 and si γ l si γ rd 0 8 showing that the two parameters act independently to influence the profile shape in scenario s u 5 model calibration and validation in section 4 we showed that the proposed model is flexible and able to reproduce symmetric highly skewed profiles or entrapped solute for an extremely long time by opportunely setting two effective parameters l and rd in this section we discuss calibration and validation of the model against pore scale simulations performed in the two dimensional porous medium from section 2 5 1 model calibration calibration of the continuum model is performed through the minimization of two different objective functions obf and a sensitivity oriented objective function soof we define obf as 13 o b f i 1 d c e x i e i 2 where e x i is the concentration from the continuum model at x i while e i x i is the section average concentration from the pore scale simulations dc is the number of data used in the calibration to compute e we use the same discretization as for the velocity field grid objective functions like that in 13 are commonly used to estimate effective model parameters for solute transport e g porta et al 2016 hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 sanchez vila et al 2010 since concentration profiles are a typical experimental observable e g gramling et al 2002 berkowitz et al 2000 ye et al 2015 molins et al 2014 molins et al 2012 we employ obf in the maximum likelihood framework carrera and neuman 1986 to estimate l and rd considering the concentration profile at t 100 s for only the s hv initial condition this choice is consistent with the common practice of characterizing transport parameters in scenarios where the solute is injected in the porous domain in a flux weighted fashion the estimated values of l and rd and corresponding variability inferred from the estimated standard deviations as given by the approximated parameter covariance matrix see carrera and neuman 1986 are reported in table 2 successively as an alternative to obf we define a sensitivity oriented objective function soof as 14 p 1 1 σ 2 m σ 2 ps 15 p 2 1 γ f γ ps 16 s o o f p 1 p 2 where γ f and γ ps represent the skewness computed from the double continuum model and pore scale model implementation respectively at t 400 s considering the s u initial condition quantities σ2 m and σ2 ps indicate the spread yielded by the continuum model and pore scale model respectively at t 50 s considering the s hv initial scenario the objective function soof is specifically chosen based on the result of our sensitivity analysis razavi and gupta 2015 pianosi et al 2016 based on the sobol sensitivity indices in fig 6 we highlight that σ2 in the s hv scenario shows a substantial sensitivity to l especially for early time t 10 s and 50 s while γ presents a marked sensitivity to rd at large time this is corroborated by further inspection of the evolution of p1 and p2 through the parameter spaces ωl fig 7 a and ωrd fig 7b respectively in fig 7a and b we depict the evolution of p1 and p2 respectively for all combinations of parameters explored in the sensitivity analysis the trend of p1 clearly suggests the presence of a minimum on the interval il i e il 763 µm 863 µm note that the confidence interval and the best estimate reported in table 2 are in agreement with this interval il p1 shows steep gradients outside il which is a desired feature of the objective function when dealing with the calibration process in fig 7b the p2 is displayed as a function of rd p2 approaches its minimum in the interval ird 10 2 37 10 1 955 note that the best estimate and the confidence interval of rd in table 2 do not correspond to the indications given by the p2 criterion this is further discussed in section 5 2 similar to criterion p1 p2 shows a unique minimum located in a delimited area of the parameter space criterion soof combining the quantities p1 and p2 results in an objective function sensitive to both parameters included in the continuum model by observing the value of soof over the parameter space investigated in the sensitivity analysis fig 7c we note that it has a global minimum corresponding to the intersection of the two white solid lines soof is minimized using the fmincon matlab function leading to l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 which lie in il and ird respectively 5 2 model validation and discussion in fig 8 we present the comparison between the solute concentration profiles yielded by the model and the section averaged pore scale data e at different times t 50 100 200 and 400 s the dashed lines represent the continuum model results using l 743 µm and rd 10 1 011 based on obf as discussed in section 5 1 the solid lines indicate the continuum model profiles obtained for l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 based on soof fig 8a c corresponds to the three different initial conditions i e s hv fig 8a s u fig 8b and s lv fig 8c for simplicity we refer to m1 and m2 as predictions by the continuum model calibrated according to obf and soof respectively in fig 8a both m1 and m2 demonstrate good performance for scenario s hv the predictions of m1 and m2 are very close leading to similar values of concentration peak spread and shape for all the times investigated a closer inspection reveals that at t 100 s m1 better matches the pore scale profile consistent with the definition of obf at larger times t 200 s and t 400 s a qualitative analysis suggests that m1 tends to match closely the frontward tail while m2 shows more accuracy in reproducing the backward tail we avoid quantitative comparison given the intense fluctuations from the pore scale data which may yield misleading results the formulation of the continuum model presented in sections 3 and 4 embeds the effect of pore scale processes in the two effective parameters l and rd which should depend only on pore structure and geometry if so in principle the estimated parameters relying on obf should be exportable to the prediction of solute concentrations obtained in s lv and s u even though these scenarios were not part of the calibration process for s u fig 8b m1 provides a good interpretation of the forward tail and the concentration peak but tends to underestimate the backward tail this is clear especially at t 100 s and t 200 s concerning s lv m1 poorly interprets pore scale data the backward tail is markedly underestimated while the concentration peak is overestimated for all considered times shown in fig 8c model m1 only presents a good match with data associated with fast flowing solute i e a small portion of the frontward concentration tail this is because m1 is calibrated to describe the mobile solute as shown in fig 8a based on the results in fig 8 we can assert that the classical obf allows calibration of a model with enough accuracy to predict concentration profiles at all times when the same initial condition is explored however we show that obf may not be appropriate to estimate parameter values intended to be implemented for diverse initial conditions the combination of effective parameters i e l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 associated with m2 leads to improved predictions of the profiles for s u and s hv when compared to m1 in fig 8b m2 and m1 are virtually indistinguishable at t 50 s but m2 better captures the behavior of the backward tail at longer times this result is obtained by explicitly incorporating information on the skewness of the profile which carries the necessary information to constrain rd fig 6 as the length scale in m1 l 743 µm is close to that of m2 l 673 4 µm we expect that the improved interpretation of the backward tails in fig 8b is mainly attributable to the different order of magnitude in the estimate of rd concerning the s lv scenario m2 shows excellent performance in reproducing the larger times t 200 400 s and matching the peak of solute concentration at t 100 s even as it fails in capturing the exact profile shape at early times i e t 100 s and t 50 s fig 8c the mismatch at early times can be attributed to a limitation of the continuum model which condenses the escape process from cavities with a single characteristic time scale te this simplifies implementation but only captures the average behavior of the cavities and not the complete distribution of transit times that may be present see e g wirner et al 2014 this limitation is highlighted when considering scenario s lv where the escape process is crucial for determining concentration evolution as discussed in section 5 1 soof is tailor made for this specific model and problem setting based on the sensitivity analysis in section 4 by investigating the sensitivity we can explain discrepancies and the reliability of parameter estimates obtained by using obf compared to soof we conclude our analysis by a close inspection of the shortcomings in the implementation of obf fig 9 shows that obf has its minimum in the region highlighted by the white rectangle criterion obf sharply varies with l close to the minimum but has negligible gradients along rd this observation suggests that obf is a strong criterion for estimating l indeed the estimated values of l from obf and soof are consistent and reinforce one another on the other hand the identification of an optimal value for rd is problematic through obf thereby backward tails are not matched by m1 this result is in apparent contrast with the observation that the skewness γ of the profile obtained for s hv is largely influenced by rd at t 100 s as indicated by the sobol indices si γ rd 0 43 see fig 6 which would suggest that these data are appropriate to properly estimate rd by looking at fig 9 we can note that the sensitivity of obf to rd is not uniform across the parameter space for values of l larger than 500 µm i e log l 3 3 this result agrees with previous observations that global sensitivity measures are effective in identifying general trends but may overlook local sensitivities which are eventually relevant in a parameter estimation context see also ceriotti et al 2018 6 conclusions the present work is devoted to the formulation calibration and validation of a double continuum model for solute transport in porous media which aims to embed characteristics of the pore scale geometry and velocity field as opposed to available non fickian transport models neuman and tartakovsky 2009 or those rigorously derived through volume averaging davit et al 2012 our model does not include any nonlocal term which makes the model implementation straightforward in spite of this simplification the method can reproduce features commonly observed in porous media with essentially disconnected micro and macro pores i e single peak to a double peak concentration profile see de vries et al 2017 the switch between different emerging behaviors is governed in our model by two effective parameters which are explicitly linked to the geometry and the velocity field of the porous medium supported by the efficient sensitivity oriented calibration our proposed model is able to capture many crucial features of the concentration profile evolution over time for all considered scenarios see fig 8 thus despite the simplicity of model structure and the absence of spatial and temporal non local terms that arise in rigorous upscaling approaches the model shows promising performances yielding good fits and predictive capabilities to the diverse solute transport scenarios considered here we are able to identify a unique combination of effective parameters that characterize well on average the exchange process based solely on the features of the porous medium and the velocity field however its identification is not trivial and depends on the type of calibration data available and the structure of the objective function to be optimized the use of classical mismatch between data and observations obf for model calibration provides parameter estimates that perform well in describing solute transport for the s hv scenario but these estimates were not exportable to other initial scenarios in our case study using a criterion driven by sensitivity analysis results soof for parameter estimation instead of obf leads to an improved characterization of the model effective parameters especially rd this result aligns with the idea that formulating an efficient objective function is a crucial aim along with the model development implementation depending on the data available and the reference scenario investigated this clearly suggests that the sensitivity analysis of an effective model can be an efficient tool to design ad hoc metrics for model calibration and circumvent the use of weakly sensitive objective functions for parameter estimation moreover investigating the role played by the different parameters by means of sensitivity analysis allows a better understanding of the solute transport phenomena itself our results demonstrate that the impact of the exchange process on the solute profile is significant and can lead to notably different shapes and spreading patterns even when starting from the same initial condition fig 4 modeling the access escape process of stagnant zones is crucial for capturing the complex patterns associated with complex real porous media structures e g such as those observed in carbonates our analysis on three different initial conditions clearly suggests that the mass exchange process does not always affect the solute profile evolution it is possible to observe a perfectly symmetric profile even in porous media characterized by extremely inaccessible cavities and dead end pores depending on the initial condition selected see fig 4b s hv dashed line this is clearly shown by the sobol indices results table 1 and fig 6 which indicate that the exchange mass process and model parameters have a different impact depending on the initial scenario considered we can conclude that tracer tests performed for a single initial condition may lead to incomplete knowledge of the porous medium structure and understanding of the impact of mass exchange processes acknowledgments g ceriotti and g m porta would like

662,we derive a novel double continuum transport model based on pore scale characteristics our approach relies on building a simplified unit cell made up of immobile and mobile continua we employ a numerically resolved pore scale velocity distribution to characterize the volume of each continuum and to define the velocity profile in the mobile continuum using the simplified unit cell we derive a closed form model which includes two effective parameters that need to be estimated a characteristic length scale and a parameter rd given by the ratio of characteristic times that lumps the effect of stagnant regions and escape process to calibrate and validate our model we rely on a set of pore scale numerical simulation performed on a 2d disordered segregated periodic porous medium taking into account different initial solute distributions using a global sensitivity analysis we explore the impact of the two effective parameters on solute concentration profiles and thereby define a sensitivity analysis driven criterion for model calibration the latter is compared to a classical calibration approach our results show that depending on the initial condition the mass exchange process between mobile and immobile continua impact on solute profile shape significantly our transport model is capable of interpreting both symmetric and highly skewed solute concentration profiles effectiveness of the calibration of the two parameters largely depends on the calibration dataset and the selected objective function whose definition can be supported by the implementation of sensitivity analysis by relying on a sensitivity analysis driven calibration we are able to provide an accurate and robust interpretation of the concentration profile evolution across different given initial conditions by relying on a unique set of effective parameter values 1 introduction the development of accurate mathematical models to describe solute mass transport in porous media is particularly challenging when the medium is characterized by the presence of cavities dead end pores stagnant zones and a highly heterogeneous velocity field the structure and the extent of low velocity regions directly impact solute transport potentially leading to long mass retention times accurately modeling such trapping effects is crucial for example in the context of remediation and risk assessment e g de barros et al 2013 a sound understanding of the conditions and pore scale processes that physically control the rate of exchange between stagnant and fast flowing regions is needed to better understand solute spreading and mixing and subsequently the evolution of conservative and reactive transport processes e g alhashmi et al 2015 lichtner and kang 2007 kitanidis and dykaar 1997 wirner et al 2014 cortis and berkowitz 2004 briggs et al 2018 baveye et al 2018 solute transport has been widely studied by performing direct numerical simulations at the pore scale see e g scheibe et al 2015 bijeljic et al 2013b hochstetler et al 2013 porta et al 2013 such techniques present the remarkable advantage of providing detailed information on solute concentration evolution at each point of the porous domain however the applicability of such methods which are computationally demanding is limited to small domains typically much smaller than field scales of common interest dentz et al 2011 upscaled continuum models are consequently more suited to simulating larger scale systems to upscale the effects of low velocity regions on emerging transport features different approaches have been proposed such as multi rate mass transfer model mrmt tecklenburg et al 2016 haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 various continuous time random walk approaches ctrw berkowitz and scher 2009 1997 le borgne et al 2008 dentz and castro 2009 time and space fractional models fade kelly et al 2017 berkowitz et al 2002 time domain random walk approaches tdrw banton et al 1997 delay et bodin 2001 russian et al 2016 and other nonlocal formulations neuman and tartakovsky 2009 in particular double or multiple continua approaches are appealing due to their ability to explicitly distinguish stagnant zones from fast flowing channels in the classical double continuum approach haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 bear and cheng 2010 a mobile and immobile continuum exchange mass as a first order process with an effective mass transfer coefficient typically effective parameters of double or multi continuum models need to be estimated via fitting against solute concentration data e g measured breakthrough curves or solute concentration profiles alternatively upscaled dual continua models have been formally derived see e g souadnia et al 2002 by means of volume averaging techniques while appealing due to their sound theoretical basis as discussed by davit et al 2012 these formally derived double continua formulations present practical limitations in terms of their applicability to real problems often such models can be nearly as difficult to solve as their pore scale direct simulation counterparts as they include complex non local terms which imply significant numerical implementation challenges porta et al 2016 as a consequence a number of studies have proposed more parsimonious effective up scaled formulations that however still exploit key pore scale information these studies encompass eulerian porta et al 2015 and lagrangian formulations sund et al 2017a b dentz et al 2018 these methods are designed to embed pore scale characteristics into effective parameters which can be applied at a larger scale for example sund et al 2017a b employ trajectories and travel times distributions measured numerically at pore scale to infer the effective evolution of mixing and reaction rates in an effective lagrangian spatial markov model the work of porta et al 2015 focuses on the use of pore scale information to characterize a double continuum transport model from an eulerian perspective porta et al 2015 model relies on the cumulative distribution function of velocity measured from a pore scale simulation of single phase flow and assumes that the exchange time between high and low velocity regions is dictated by the characteristic diffusion time scale the model reproduces observed transport behaviors in relatively well connected three dimensional porous systems i e a beadpack and a sandstone sample however as shown by bénichou and voituriez 2008 realistic cavities may be characterized by complex geometry such that it can take an extremely long time to exchange mass from slow regions to faster flowing channels for this reason the double continuum approach proposed by porta et al 2015 might suffer limitations when the geometry of the porous medium is highly tortuous and presents significant stagnant cavities such features may arise in both three dimensional e g carbonate rocks see bijeljic et al 2013a and two dimensional porous media which are often employed in simulations and experiments acharya et al 2007 wirner et al 2014 de anna et al 2014 starting from the model developed in porta et al 2015 we develop a double continuum model which explicitly accounts for a characteristic time for the exchange process between high and low velocity regions which may be larger than the diffusion time scale this model lumps the effect of exchange process at pore scale into a single effective parameter which is defined as the ratio of the time required by the solute to escape explore the stagnant regions of the porous medium to the characteristic diffusive time scale our main objective is to derive a closed form double continuum model and to test it against numerical pore scale simulations of solute transport performed in a disordered synthetic two dimensional porous medium considering different initial conditions we explore the flexibility of the model by means of a sensitivity analysis we assess the effectiveness of the model by means of i a qualitative inspection of concentration profiles predicted considering different initial conditions and ii quantification of the sobol indices of appropriately defined target metrics we also investigate the role of a global sensitivity analysis gsa in defining a tailor made objective function to increase the efficacy of model calibration the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we present the problem setup that will be used as the test bed for the proposed double continuum model along with details on the pore scale model in section 3 we derive the proposed closed form double continuum model in section 4 the flexibility of the model is explored via a gsa calibration and validation of the model are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are presented in section 6 2 problem setting 2 1 pore scale domain in this work we consider a two dimensional porous medium made up of repeating periodic unit cells ω the cell configuration is the same as that of porta et al 2016 the geometry of the unit cell is generated by the disordered superposition of circular grains of uniform diameter w 8 10 5 m and then discretized into pixels of 2 10 5 m the resulting pixelated image characterized by porosity ϕ 0 5948 constitutes the reference cell configuration for the pore scale numerical simulations while this porosity value is larger than the one typically observed for three dimensional porous media two dimensional porous media with porosities equal or higher than the one considered here are commonly used in previous experimental and numerical studies see e g wirner et al 2014 acharya et al 2007 de anna et al 2014 the domain is periodic in both longitudinal and transversal directions the fluid flow in the unit cell is driven imposing a unit gradient pressure along the longitudinal direction and zero pressure gradient along the transverse direction the velocity field is steady and laminar and computed by solving the incompressible navier stokes equations assuming a fully saturated medium and considering impermeable boundary conditions on the grain liquid interface see porta et al 2016 the velocity field is resolved on a regular spatial grid with a resolution of 2 10 5 m and the numerical approximation is obtained following the methods introduced by bekri et al 1995 and coelho et al 1997 the grid resolution is one order of magnitude smaller than the average grain size which is estimated to 214 µm as given by imagej fiji imaging processing software ferreira and rasband 2012 the porous medium permeability along the longitudinal direction is equal to 4 87 10 5 cm2 the latter is estimated through the darcy s law where the total flow discharge and the pressure drop is computed using the numerically resolved pressure and velocity field the resulting value of permeability is of the same order of magnitude of those associated with clean sand and gravel see bear and cheng 2010 and thus comparable with real porous systems the geometry of the unit cell and the associated normalized velocity field normalized such that the mean velocity modulus is equal to 1 is shown in fig 1 a a unit cell has a total dimension of 4 8 10 3 m longitudinal to the main flow direction times 1 2 10 3 m transverse to the main flow direction the total length d of the porous domain is equal to 0 192 m corresponding to a sequence of 40 unit cells the average velocity along the x axis u ms 1 is equal to 6 22 10 5 ms 1 the velocity field shows large variability ranging over 10 orders of magnitude the probability density function pdf of velocity is similar to the one observed in real three dimensional porous media such as sandstones in fig 1b we compare the pdf observed for two real 3d geometries i e bentheimer sandstone ϕ 0 2147 and doddington sandstone ϕ 0 1949 presented by alhashmi et al 2016 against the pdf of the local velocities computed for our 2d geometry this comparison supports that the two dimensional system considered in our work presents a similar occurrence of low velocity regions as the one observed in three dimensional porous media we define low velocity regions as those below 10 2 in the normalized velocity field these regions are segregated from the well connected higher velocity channels we use this value to distinguish between the disconnected low velocity lv regions and the continuous high velocity hv channels in fig 1c we explicitly identify the solid phase and the lv and hv regions based on our chosen threshold 10 2 we can split the total porosity ϕ into two parts ϕ hv 0 5131 and ϕ lv 0 0817 associated with the hv and lv regions respectively the choice of 10 2 as velocity threshold between lv and hv regions is here based on a set of preliminary analyses investigating the sensitivity of ϕ hv ϕ to the velocity threshold for the chosen geometry we observe that the ratio ϕ hv ϕ shows minor changes when the velocity threshold varies between 10 2 and 10 8 2 2 initial conditions the analysis of the impact of the initial solute displacement is a critical feature in assessing the robustness of solute transport models as recently discussed in puyguiraud et al 2019 as a test bed for the double continuum model that we will present in section 3 we perform a series of pore scale simulations of conservative transport with three different initial scenarios labeled s u s hv and s lv s u in one unit cell the solute is uniformly distributed in both the hv and lv regions we define the initial concentration as e 0 s hv solute is uniformly distributed in only the hv region for the extent of one unit cell the cross sectional averaged initial concentration in the hv region e 0 h v is such that e 0 e 0 h v ϕ h v ϕ s lv solute is uniformly distributed in the lv region for the extent of one unit cell the cross sectional averaged initial concentration in the lv region e 0 l v is such that e 0 e 0 l v ϕ l v ϕ the aforementioned initial conditions are chosen to mimic conditions of particular interest when considering for example a contaminated site e g de barros et al 2013 or for the interpretation of experimental results where solute injection in a column is typically flux weighted 2 3 pore scale numerical simulations pore scale modeling of the concentration field is performed in a particle tracking framework with the time domain random walk tdrw approach described in detail in russian et al 2016 this approach is particularly suitable for simulations in media that display a broad range of velocity such as the one considered here banton et al 1997 delay et al 2002 bodin 2015 classical random walk algorithms are characterized by constant time discretization random walkers move over variable distances at constant time increments alternatively in the tdrw the domain is spatially discretized and random walkers move over fixed distances in variable time steps its benefit is that particles do not spend a large number of random walk steps in low velocity regions due to a constant time discretization the tdrw method is formally equivalent to a discretized advection diffusion equation russian et al 2016 at the same time its formulation coincides with a continuous time domain random walk ctrw with space dependent transition times and probabilities here we use 2 million particles for each simulation for each initial condition illustrated in section 2 2 we explore the temporal evolution of concentration over a total time of 400 s profile concentrations are obtained by vertical integration of particle numbers normalized by the corresponding porosity of the vertical slice 3 dual continuum model formulation the development of the double porosity model proposed here is built starting from the procedure originally developed by porta et al 2015 and it is schematically outlined in fig 2 we start with the 2d porous medium introduced in section 2 fig 1 we define the average péclet number p e a v u l d m where dm m2s 1 is the molecular diffusion coefficient and l m a characteristic length scale of the system that is considered unknown a priori and should be properly determined in the double continuum model the porous system is then conceptualized as a simplified unit cell of thickness l with a uniform shear flow fig 2a the direction of flow is only in the x m direction the unit cell is split into two parts labeled mobile and immobile the mobile zone light color in fig 2a occupies l 2 y l 2 with y m and the immobile zone dark color in fig 2a l 2 y l 2 and l 2 y l 2 the value of l m is computed such that l l ϕ h v ϕ and l l l ϕ l v ϕ to partition the mobile immobile region in the elementary cell in the same manner as the hv and lv regions in the reference porous medium the velocity distribution in the mobile zone is the appropriately rescaled sample cumulative distribution function cdf from pore scale velocities belonging to the hv region of the porous medium in fig 2b we depict the cdf computed for the normalized fluid velocity the vertical dashed line represents the chosen threshold discriminating between hv and lv regions we define a dimensionless coordinate reference system introducing x x l and y y l where x and y are the dimensional coordinates reported in fig 2a using the dimensionless reference system we assume that solute transport in the unit cell is described by the following dimensionless system of equations 1 e m t u e m x 1 p e 1 τ m 2 e m x 2 1 p e 2 e m y 2 y l 2 l e i t 1 p e 1 τ i m 2 e i x 2 r d p e 2 e i y 2 y l 2 l completed by the following boundary conditions 2 e m e i and e m y r d e i y y l 2 l a e i y 0 y 1 2 b where em x y t ce m x y t c 0 and ei x y t ce i x y t c 0 are dimensionless concentrations in the mobile hv and immobile lv zones of solute e respectively ce m x y t mol l 1 and ce i x y t mol l 1 are the concentrations in mobile and immobile region mol l 1 and c 0 mol l 1 is a characteristic concentration u represents the dimensionless velocity along the x direction computed as the ratio between the dimensional velocity u ms 1 and the mean velocity in the mobile region um ms 1 i e u u u m t is the dimensionless time defined as t t t a where t s is the time and ta l um s is the advective time scale pe is the péclet number computed based on the mean mobile velocity as pe uml dm we introduce in 2 two key novel elements with respect to the formulation of porta et al 2015 we include the dimensionless parameters τ m and τ im that represent the tortuosity factors associated with the hv and lv regions respectively including τ m and τ im embeds the impact of the phase geometry on the evolution of solute diffusion along the x direction in the simplified unit cell shen and chen 2007 the values of τ m and τ im are computed directly using the hv and lv geometries by mean of the taufactor matlab code cooper et al 2016 matlab and statistics toolbox release 2016b the hv region is characterized by τ m 2 48 while τ im is infinite since the lv region is clearly disconnected fig 1c the latter is a consequence of considering a two dimensional porous medium in more realistic 3d systems the lv region is connected due to the no slip boundary condition imposed at the solid fluid interface and the fact that solid phases connect unlike in 2d here to mimic a disconnected lv region we imposed a very high value of tortuosity τ im 100 we introduce parameter rd in 2 a defined as 3 r d t d t e where te s is the characteristic time required by the solute to escape explore the stagnant regions of the porous medium while the td s is the characteristic time scale of the diffusion process in a free fluid in porta et al 2015 the mass exchange between hv and lv regions is modeled as a diffusive process at the interface of immobile and mobile zones which means that the characteristic time of the mass exchange is assumed equal to the characteristic diffusion time td l 2 dm this choice may not always be appropriate for example if the porous structure includes large stagnant cavities connected to fast channels through narrow bottlenecks indeed pore scale and theoretical investigations e g wirner et al 2014 bénichou and voituriez 2008 van genuchten 1985 holcman and schuss 2013 holcman and schuss 2004 show that solute mass enclosed in a stagnant or fast flowing region may take an extremely long time to escape or explore the zone depending on its shape applying the same averaging procedure implemented by porta et al 2015 on the system 2 and 3 the closed section averaged form of the proposed model reads see the supplementary material for more details 4 e m t e m x x d h 1 e m x d h 2 δ e mi 1 p e 1 τ m 2 e m x 2 ϕ p e ϕ hv e 1 e m x e 2 δ e mi e i t 1 τ im 1 p e 2 e i x 2 ϕ ϕ

closure variables bi i 1 4 can be solved numerically given the known u y and bi y in the simplified unit cell details on the closure problem and its solution are provided in the supplementary materials investigating the specific relationship between porous geometry structure and rd is beyond the scope of the present work and is postponed to future efforts but understanding its role on large scale transport is considered next for the purposes of this work the quantity rd is considered as an effective parameter along with the characteristic length scale l whose characterization based on pore scale geometry feature is still open to debate and different methodologies have been proposed in literature see e g bear and cheng 2010 mostaghimi et al 2012 siena et al 2014 meyer and bijeljic 2016 alhashmi et al 2016 dullien 2012 moreover we highlight here that the definition of the unit cell depends on the velocity threshold imposed on the porous medium to distinguish between hv and lv regions in this study we select a specific threshold value and focus on the investigation of different transport conditions as a consequence of different solute distributions the identification of thresholds to discriminate high and low velocity regions has been a subject of previous works see e g de anna et al 2017 porta et al 2015 and may be reconsidered in future works to extend our analysis 4 characterization of the mass transfer at the continuum scale in this section we elucidate how the proposed model accounts for the exchange process between fast and slow regions and the impact of the exchange process on solute evolution depending on the initial conditions 4 1 quantification of mass transfer time as a proxy to quantify the exchange process simulated by the model we introduce 7 q t e i t e m t e 0 where t s is time e 0 is the initial concentration of the conservative solute e i t and e m t are the average concentration in the immobile and mobile zones along the x direction d respectively i e 8 e j d e j dx v j with j i m with vm and vi equal to the pore volume associated with the hv and lv regions of the porous domain an illustrative example of q t computed for initial condition s lv and four combinations of l and rd is shown in fig 3 a we observe that q t decreases monotonically from 1 to 0 over time when q t is equal to 1 all of the solute mass is in the immobile zone while q t 0 indicates an equilibrium between the solute mass flux escaping and entering the immobile zone how quickly q reaches zero tells us how quickly the exchange process occurs the red line l 1000 µm rd 1 10 4 72 and blue line l 98 µm rd 1 10 0 16 in fig 3a illustrate two extremes cases for large l and small rd q t suggests an extremely slow escape process such that at 400 s the solute is still almost totally trapped in the immobile zone this is confirmed in fig 3b where we display solute concentration profiles at t 200 s for the same combination of l and rd values of in fig 3a the yellow area identifies the initial step condition the concentration profile for l 1000 µm and rd 1 10 4 72 red line coincides closely with the initial condition by contrast for small l and rd close to one the exchange process is virtually instantaneous since q t approaches zero in the first time step of the simulation see blue line in fig 3a the corresponding concentration profile blue line in fig 3b does not present heavy tailing nor strong asymmetry suggesting that the retentive effect of the stagnant regions is negligible the black and magenta lines represent intermediate conditions demonstrating that both l and rd influence the mass exchange process the four different profiles in fig 3b present completely different shapes and spreading patterns demonstrating that within the context of the proposed model accessibility of the stagnant regions can significantly impact the profile evolution even when starting from the same initial condition i e s lv 4 2 impact of the initial condition the value of effective parameters embedded in the formulation 4 6 should depend solely on the porous medium structure and geometry of cavities this implies that the parameter values should not depend on the initial condition being investigated by considering different initial conditions as introduced in section 2 we can compare concentration profiles at t 200 s yielded by fixing the values of effective parameters l and rd fig 4 the combinations of parameters selected for fig 4 are those in fig 3 for the s lv scenario when the exchange process is very fast magenta and blue lines in fig 3a the impact of the initial condition is virtually not detectable fig 4d as the exchange process slows down the initial condition impacts predictions more markedly the scenarios s hv and s u lead to similar profiles in term of spread and skewness the only notable difference is that the solute with s u is prone to develop a thicker backward tail see fig 4a c as part of the solute is initially entrapped in the immobile zone the profiles generated starting from the s hv scenario present a symmetric shape for both very fast and extremely slow exchange process see fig 4b and d the solute profiles features associated with s lv are markedly different as solute has to leave the trapped phase before beginning its downstream journey 4 3 global sensitivity analysis the qualitative analysis illustrated above provides a quick understanding of the impact of the exchange process on model predictions limited to only four combinations of effective parameters selected for presentation purposes to explore more extensively and rigorously the impact of the variability of the effective parameters on solute transport depending on the initial condition we investigate different model responses by means of a global sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2008 sobol 1993 our goal is to explore the sensitivity of the mass transfer process to l and rd and thereby the resulting impact of mass transfer on the shape of longitudinal concentration profiles under different scenarios to this end we define the following outputs 9 t 50 t q t 0 5 10 σ 2 t d x μ t 2 e n x t d x 11 γ t d x μ t 3 e n x t d x σ 3 t where e n is the section averaged concentration normalized to total solute mass present in the system and μ t is the first spatial moment of e n here t 50 s is a characteristic time for mass transfer while σ2 and γ quantify spreading and skewness of the solute concentration profile we assume the two effective parameters embedded in the model i e rd and l to be two independent uniformly distributed random variables the parameter l is assumed to vary in ωl defined between 80 µm the diameter of the cylinders used to generate the porous medium see section 2 and 1200 µm i e the total length of the periodic unit cell in the transverse direction the parameter space of rd ωrd is bounded between 1 and 10 5 the upper bound corresponds to a porous structure that is easily accessible by the solute with the escape exploration time of the cavities equal to td the lower bound is estimated based on the results of wirner et al 2014 who investigate trapping effects of stagnant zones in a quasi two dimensional porous medium similar in nature to the one we use here using n quasi monte carlo sobol 1998 samples n 1000 of the parameter space ω l ω rd we run the model for each of the three different initial conditions and compute the first order sobol indices associated with the three target variables 9 11 note that as we consider only two parameters we can state the following equality by the anova analysis of variance sobol 1993 decomposition of variance 12 s i k l s i k r d s i k l r d 1 with k t 50 σ 2 γ where si k l and si k rd are the first order sobol indices of variable k associated with parameters l and rd respectively while si k l rd is the second order sobol index quantifying two parameter interaction effects on target quantity k fig 5 shows that the characteristic time associated with mass transfer t 50 is influenced by both parameters so that its variability is explained mostly by the combined variation of the two parameters this result is quantified by sobol indices which show the largest contribution to the variance of t 50 is given by the combined effect of the two effective parameters si t 50 l rd 0 55 see table 1 this essentially means that information on both parameters l and rd can help to better constrain this output and vice versa i e this output if measurable could be used to constrain both parameters the signature of the results on t 50 is reflected in a different fashion on profile shapes for different scenarios as shown in fig 6 the sobol indices indicate that for scenario s lv spreading is mainly influenced by the combined variability of l and rd because si σ2 l si σ2 rd 0 5 for all the considered times this is explained by the fact that for s lv solute displacement is limited by mass transfer to high velocity regions from low velocity regions where the solute is initially residing a similar result is obtained for the skewness γ limited to early times at larger times γ appears to be chiefly influenced by rd for s lv while the influence of l becomes relatively small after t 50 s in the s hv scenario parameter l almost entirely controls the variance of σ2 and the chosen length scale has a prominent impact on the solute spread in the mobile region in this scenario the solute accesses low velocity regions by mass transfer while being transported downstream parameter l has an effect on the pe number and thereby on the spreading of the profile due to dispersion in the mobile region i e dispersive parameters in eq 5 increase with l the effect of rd and the coupled effect between the two parameters emerge more clearly when profile skewness γ is considered in particular γ is chiefly influenced by the joint variation of the two parameters si γ l si γ rd 0 6 for t 50 s these results show that solute mass transfer has a negligible influence on spreading for s hv but is persistently reflected in the profile skewness at long times in scenario s u mass distribution between high and low velocity regions is at equilibrium in the initial condition i e the effect of mass transfer can be expected to be minor compared with the other two cases consistent with this observation spreading σ2 is initially controlled exclusively by l while with time the situation is gradually reversed i e rd becomes the most important parameter at all times si σ2 l si σ2 rd 1 and si γ l si γ rd 0 8 showing that the two parameters act independently to influence the profile shape in scenario s u 5 model calibration and validation in section 4 we showed that the proposed model is flexible and able to reproduce symmetric highly skewed profiles or entrapped solute for an extremely long time by opportunely setting two effective parameters l and rd in this section we discuss calibration and validation of the model against pore scale simulations performed in the two dimensional porous medium from section 2 5 1 model calibration calibration of the continuum model is performed through the minimization of two different objective functions obf and a sensitivity oriented objective function soof we define obf as 13 o b f i 1 d c e x i e i 2 where e x i is the concentration from the continuum model at x i while e i x i is the section average concentration from the pore scale simulations dc is the number of data used in the calibration to compute e we use the same discretization as for the velocity field grid objective functions like that in 13 are commonly used to estimate effective model parameters for solute transport e g porta et al 2016 hochstetler and kitanidis 2013 sanchez vila et al 2010 since concentration profiles are a typical experimental observable e g gramling et al 2002 berkowitz et al 2000 ye et al 2015 molins et al 2014 molins et al 2012 we employ obf in the maximum likelihood framework carrera and neuman 1986 to estimate l and rd considering the concentration profile at t 100 s for only the s hv initial condition this choice is consistent with the common practice of characterizing transport parameters in scenarios where the solute is injected in the porous domain in a flux weighted fashion the estimated values of l and rd and corresponding variability inferred from the estimated standard deviations as given by the approximated parameter covariance matrix see carrera and neuman 1986 are reported in table 2 successively as an alternative to obf we define a sensitivity oriented objective function soof as 14 p 1 1 σ 2 m σ 2 ps 15 p 2 1 γ f γ ps 16 s o o f p 1 p 2 where γ f and γ ps represent the skewness computed from the double continuum model and pore scale model implementation respectively at t 400 s considering the s u initial condition quantities σ2 m and σ2 ps indicate the spread yielded by the continuum model and pore scale model respectively at t 50 s considering the s hv initial scenario the objective function soof is specifically chosen based on the result of our sensitivity analysis razavi and gupta 2015 pianosi et al 2016 based on the sobol sensitivity indices in fig 6 we highlight that σ2 in the s hv scenario shows a substantial sensitivity to l especially for early time t 10 s and 50 s while γ presents a marked sensitivity to rd at large time this is corroborated by further inspection of the evolution of p1 and p2 through the parameter spaces ωl fig 7 a and ωrd fig 7b respectively in fig 7a and b we depict the evolution of p1 and p2 respectively for all combinations of parameters explored in the sensitivity analysis the trend of p1 clearly suggests the presence of a minimum on the interval il i e il 763 µm 863 µm note that the confidence interval and the best estimate reported in table 2 are in agreement with this interval il p1 shows steep gradients outside il which is a desired feature of the objective function when dealing with the calibration process in fig 7b the p2 is displayed as a function of rd p2 approaches its minimum in the interval ird 10 2 37 10 1 955 note that the best estimate and the confidence interval of rd in table 2 do not correspond to the indications given by the p2 criterion this is further discussed in section 5 2 similar to criterion p1 p2 shows a unique minimum located in a delimited area of the parameter space criterion soof combining the quantities p1 and p2 results in an objective function sensitive to both parameters included in the continuum model by observing the value of soof over the parameter space investigated in the sensitivity analysis fig 7c we note that it has a global minimum corresponding to the intersection of the two white solid lines soof is minimized using the fmincon matlab function leading to l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 which lie in il and ird respectively 5 2 model validation and discussion in fig 8 we present the comparison between the solute concentration profiles yielded by the model and the section averaged pore scale data e at different times t 50 100 200 and 400 s the dashed lines represent the continuum model results using l 743 µm and rd 10 1 011 based on obf as discussed in section 5 1 the solid lines indicate the continuum model profiles obtained for l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 based on soof fig 8a c corresponds to the three different initial conditions i e s hv fig 8a s u fig 8b and s lv fig 8c for simplicity we refer to m1 and m2 as predictions by the continuum model calibrated according to obf and soof respectively in fig 8a both m1 and m2 demonstrate good performance for scenario s hv the predictions of m1 and m2 are very close leading to similar values of concentration peak spread and shape for all the times investigated a closer inspection reveals that at t 100 s m1 better matches the pore scale profile consistent with the definition of obf at larger times t 200 s and t 400 s a qualitative analysis suggests that m1 tends to match closely the frontward tail while m2 shows more accuracy in reproducing the backward tail we avoid quantitative comparison given the intense fluctuations from the pore scale data which may yield misleading results the formulation of the continuum model presented in sections 3 and 4 embeds the effect of pore scale processes in the two effective parameters l and rd which should depend only on pore structure and geometry if so in principle the estimated parameters relying on obf should be exportable to the prediction of solute concentrations obtained in s lv and s u even though these scenarios were not part of the calibration process for s u fig 8b m1 provides a good interpretation of the forward tail and the concentration peak but tends to underestimate the backward tail this is clear especially at t 100 s and t 200 s concerning s lv m1 poorly interprets pore scale data the backward tail is markedly underestimated while the concentration peak is overestimated for all considered times shown in fig 8c model m1 only presents a good match with data associated with fast flowing solute i e a small portion of the frontward concentration tail this is because m1 is calibrated to describe the mobile solute as shown in fig 8a based on the results in fig 8 we can assert that the classical obf allows calibration of a model with enough accuracy to predict concentration profiles at all times when the same initial condition is explored however we show that obf may not be appropriate to estimate parameter values intended to be implemented for diverse initial conditions the combination of effective parameters i e l 673 4 µm and rd 10 1 9972 associated with m2 leads to improved predictions of the profiles for s u and s hv when compared to m1 in fig 8b m2 and m1 are virtually indistinguishable at t 50 s but m2 better captures the behavior of the backward tail at longer times this result is obtained by explicitly incorporating information on the skewness of the profile which carries the necessary information to constrain rd fig 6 as the length scale in m1 l 743 µm is close to that of m2 l 673 4 µm we expect that the improved interpretation of the backward tails in fig 8b is mainly attributable to the different order of magnitude in the estimate of rd concerning the s lv scenario m2 shows excellent performance in reproducing the larger times t 200 400 s and matching the peak of solute concentration at t 100 s even as it fails in capturing the exact profile shape at early times i e t 100 s and t 50 s fig 8c the mismatch at early times can be attributed to a limitation of the continuum model which condenses the escape process from cavities with a single characteristic time scale te this simplifies implementation but only captures the average behavior of the cavities and not the complete distribution of transit times that may be present see e g wirner et al 2014 this limitation is highlighted when considering scenario s lv where the escape process is crucial for determining concentration evolution as discussed in section 5 1 soof is tailor made for this specific model and problem setting based on the sensitivity analysis in section 4 by investigating the sensitivity we can explain discrepancies and the reliability of parameter estimates obtained by using obf compared to soof we conclude our analysis by a close inspection of the shortcomings in the implementation of obf fig 9 shows that obf has its minimum in the region highlighted by the white rectangle criterion obf sharply varies with l close to the minimum but has negligible gradients along rd this observation suggests that obf is a strong criterion for estimating l indeed the estimated values of l from obf and soof are consistent and reinforce one another on the other hand the identification of an optimal value for rd is problematic through obf thereby backward tails are not matched by m1 this result is in apparent contrast with the observation that the skewness γ of the profile obtained for s hv is largely influenced by rd at t 100 s as indicated by the sobol indices si γ rd 0 43 see fig 6 which would suggest that these data are appropriate to properly estimate rd by looking at fig 9 we can note that the sensitivity of obf to rd is not uniform across the parameter space for values of l larger than 500 µm i e log l 3 3 this result agrees with previous observations that global sensitivity measures are effective in identifying general trends but may overlook local sensitivities which are eventually relevant in a parameter estimation context see also ceriotti et al 2018 6 conclusions the present work is devoted to the formulation calibration and validation of a double continuum model for solute transport in porous media which aims to embed characteristics of the pore scale geometry and velocity field as opposed to available non fickian transport models neuman and tartakovsky 2009 or those rigorously derived through volume averaging davit et al 2012 our model does not include any nonlocal term which makes the model implementation straightforward in spite of this simplification the method can reproduce features commonly observed in porous media with essentially disconnected micro and macro pores i e single peak to a double peak concentration profile see de vries et al 2017 the switch between different emerging behaviors is governed in our model by two effective parameters which are explicitly linked to the geometry and the velocity field of the porous medium supported by the efficient sensitivity oriented calibration our proposed model is able to capture many crucial features of the concentration profile evolution over time for all considered scenarios see fig 8 thus despite the simplicity of model structure and the absence of spatial and temporal non local terms that arise in rigorous upscaling approaches the model shows promising performances yielding good fits and predictive capabilities to the diverse solute transport scenarios considered here we are able to identify a unique combination of effective parameters that characterize well on average the exchange process based solely on the features of the porous medium and the velocity field however its identification is not trivial and depends on the type of calibration data available and the structure of the objective function to be optimized the use of classical mismatch between data and observations obf for model calibration provides parameter estimates that perform well in describing solute transport for the s hv scenario but these estimates were not exportable to other initial scenarios in our case study using a criterion driven by sensitivity analysis results soof for parameter estimation instead of obf leads to an improved characterization of the model effective parameters especially rd this result aligns with the idea that formulating an efficient objective function is a crucial aim along with the model development implementation depending on the data available and the reference scenario investigated this clearly suggests that the sensitivity analysis of an effective model can be an efficient tool to design ad hoc metrics for model calibration and circumvent the use of weakly sensitive objective functions for parameter estimation moreover investigating the role played by the different parameters by means of sensitivity analysis allows a better understanding of the solute transport phenomena itself our results demonstrate that the impact of the exchange process on the solute profile is significant and can lead to notably different shapes and spreading patterns even when starting from the same initial condition fig 4 modeling the access escape process of stagnant zones is crucial for capturing the complex patterns associated with complex real porous media structures e g such as those observed in carbonates our analysis on three different initial conditions clearly suggests that the mass exchange process does not always affect the solute profile evolution it is possible to observe a perfectly symmetric profile even in porous media characterized by extremely inaccessible cavities and dead end pores depending on the initial condition selected see fig 4b s hv dashed line this is clearly shown by the sobol indices results table 1 and fig 6 which indicate that the exchange mass process and model parameters have a different impact depending on the initial scenario considered we can conclude that tracer tests performed for a single initial condition may lead to incomplete knowledge of the porous medium structure and understanding of the impact of mass exchange processes acknowledgments g ceriotti and g m porta would like

663,heterogeneities in natural porous formations mainly manifested through the hydraulic conductivity k and to a lesser degree the porosity ϕ largely control subsurface flow and solute transport the influence of the heterogeneous structure of k on transport processes has been widely studied whereas less attention is dedicated to the joint heterogeneity of conductivity and porosity fields our study employs monte carlo simulations to investigate the coupled effect of k ϕ spatial variability on the transport behavior and uncertainty of conservative and reactive plumes within a 3d aquifer domain we explore multiple scenarios characterized by different levels of heterogeneity of the geological properties and compare the computational results from the joint k ϕ heterogeneous system with the results originating from generally adopted constant ϕ conditions in our study the spatially variable k ϕ fields are positively correlated we statistically analyze key environmental performance metrics first arrival times and peak mass fluxes for non reactive species and increased lifetime cancer risk for reactive chlorinated solvents the conservative transport simulations show that considering coupled k ϕ fields decreases the plume dispersion increases both the first arrival times of solutes and the peak mass fluxes at the observation planes a positive correlation between aquifer connectivity and peak mass fluxes is identified for both homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ our conservative transport results indicate that the relevance of ϕ variability can depend on the metric of interest the control plane source distance as well as the level of heterogeneity of the conductivity field the analysis on reactive transport shows that ϕ variability only slightly affects the mean increased lifetime cancer risk at the control planes but leads to a considerable reduction of the cancer risk uncertainty we also see that the sensitivity of cancer risk towards ϕ heterogeneity can be influenced by the level of variability of the conductivity field the source to control plane distance but is not affected by the manner in which the contaminant concentration is computed 1 introduction it is well established that heterogeneities in natural porous formations largely control subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport these heterogeneities are mainly manifested through the hydraulic conductivity k and to a lesser degree the porosity ϕ the influence of the heterogeneous k field on flow and solute transport processes has been widely studied see rubin 2003 and references therein whereas less attention is dedicated to the effect of heterogeneous ϕ hydraulic conductivity is commonly modeled as a random space function rsf in the stochastic hydrogeology community because of its erratic spatial variability and the large uncertainty associated with incomplete site characterization dagan 1986 gelhar 1986 ϕ variability is commonly regarded as a secondary factor when compared to k heterogeneity indeed most studies in the field of stochastic hydrogeology assume that aquifers are characterized by spatially heterogeneous k and homogeneous ϕ this is partially justified because k can vary in space by 3 4 orders of magnitude within small distances while the range of variability of ϕ in unconsolidated granular aquifers is generally between 0 1 and 0 55 atkins and mcbride 1992 freeze and cherry 1979 hu et al 2009 because of the limited availability of k and ϕ measurements it is difficult to establish a clear correlation between the two geological properties however in specific formations a level of correlation is likely to be present hassan et al 1998 the literature presents different studies exploring the relationship between k and ϕ archie 1950 and doyen 1988 found positive correlation between the variables additionally different authors investigating the estimation of k from ϕ and other measurable parameters e g grain size pore surface area pore dimension established positive correlation between k and ϕ for different types of soil e g aimrun et al 2004 fallico 2014 franzmeier 1991 nelson et al 1994 panda and lake 1994 riva et al 2014 scholz et al 2012 among them nelson et al 1994 analyzed different models to predict permeability in sedimentary rocks and concluded that in most cases the permeability is related to a power of ϕ and to the square of a measure of surface area or a characteristic length it is typically assumed that k and ϕ are positively correlated in unconsolidated aquifers hu et al 2009 however some studies observed negative correlation between the two properties under specific packing arrangements and grain size distributions morin 2006 only a small number of studies investigated the effects of spatially variable ϕ fields on transport predictions among them warren et al 1964 did not consider a correlation between k and ϕ and concluded that the impact of ϕ variations on macroscopic dispersion is minor with respect to the effect of k variability lin 1977 analyzed various porosity functions to represent ϕ spatial variability in porous media and indicated that the solute concentration predictions are within 15 of the concentration resulting from an average ϕ when a linear or slightly curved equation that expresses porosity as a function of the spatial coordinate is employed the author pointed out that the discrepancies of solute concentrations become very substantial as the deviation of the porosity function from linearity increases a few numerical modeling studies e g hassan 2001 hassan et al 1998 hu et al 2009 showed that the consideration of correlated heterogeneous k and ϕ fields significantly impacts contaminant transport for two dimensional domains hassan et al 1998 indicated that a positive correlation between ϕ and k decreases dispersion whereas a negative correlation enhances plume spreading particularly along the longitudinal direction hassan et al 1998 also considered reactive transport and indicated that reaction rates impact the relative importance of ϕ variability on concentration estimation which appears to be amplified in the presence of slow reactions along the same line of work hassan 2001 highlighted that ϕ spatial variability correlated to heterogeneous k impacts the longitudinal velocity covariance as well as its cross covariance with the head and the log conductivity y ln k fields riva et al 2006 studied the influence of k heterogeneities on solute transport with constant effective ϕ and later expanded their analysis in riva et al 2008 where both k and ϕ were considered random variables riva et al 2008 highlighted that considering the spatial distribution of ϕ is fundamental to mimic the early arrival of breakthrough curves btcs the studies of riva et al 2008 2006 showed that the site description of transport processes highly profits from the incorporation of the spatial variability of the ϕ field in light of the mentioned findings the influence of heterogeneous k coupled with spatially variable ϕ fields especially when the two properties are correlated as shown in most cases should be further investigated to increase the reliability of contaminant transport and associated human health risk predictions in this context our work aims to study the significance of spatial variability in the porous medium s ϕ to conservative and reactive solute transport predictions in the context of probabilistic risk analysis through the use of stochastic numerical simulations we systematically illustrate the impact of k ϕ spatial variability on key environmental performance metrics epms such as solute arrival times peak mass fluxes increased lifetime cancer risk and corresponding uncertainties at environmentally sensitive locations for our illustrations we consider three dimensional 3d heterogeneous aquifer systems in particular the objectives of this work are twofold first we systematically investigate the coupled influence of ϕ and k heterogeneity on the statistical characterization of non reactive transport second within an application oriented context we show the implications of these coupled effects when estimating adverse human health effects e g cancer risk due to exposure to chlorinated solvents in groundwater through extensive stochastic computational analysis we explore different scenarios that to the best of our knowledge have not been investigated with the goal of identifying conditions where the role of spatially variable ϕ correlated to heterogeneous k is relevant our analysis simulates contaminant transport through an unconsolidated sandy aquifer where given the likelihood hassan 2001 hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 positive k ϕ correlation is adopted together with different levels of heterogeneity of the k system our study addresses fundamental questions such as is the uncertainty associated with transport in the subsurface increased or decreased when variable ϕ fields are considered does the relative importance of variable ϕ depend on the level of heterogeneity of the k field what is the impact of this joint heterogeneity on the flow connectivity structure of the aquifer how are the effects of heterogeneity propagated to decision making metrics such as human health risk the paper is structured as follows we present the problem under investigation in section 2 in section 3 we illustrate the methodology employed in our study and provide details on the computational implementation next section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the results for conservative tracers section 4 1 and reactive contaminants section 4 2 we finally summarize our study and outline the key findings in section 5 2 problem statement in this work we consider a contaminated fully saturated 3d heterogeneous aquifer whose cartesian coordinate system is indicated by x x y z we are interested in understanding the impact of heterogeneity stemming from both k and ϕ on a series of epms de barros et al 2012 let ω denote a generic epm for example ω can represent solute arrival times or solute peak concentrations at an environmentally sensitive location if the contaminant is toxic then ω can denote for instance an adverse health effect due to incomplete characterization of the subsurface hydrogeological properties such as k and ϕ are modeled as spatially random as a consequence the quantity ω is subject to uncertainty and quantified through its statistical moments such as its mean ω where the angled brackets denote ensemble expectation its variance σ ω 2 and its probability density function pdf p ω or cumulative density function cdf p ω we are primarily interested in analyzing the effect of k ϕ variability on different epms with the goal of a improving our fundamental understanding of the significance of these variabilities to contaminant transport and b exploring how the latter variabilities propagate to decision making metrics relevant to human health risk analysis in this study we perform both conservative and reactive contaminant transport simulations and select the specific epms indicated below we statistically analyze the first arrival times and peak mass fluxes through control planes cps resulting from conservative tracer simulations the first arrival time is defined as the time of arrival of 5 of the initial injected mass i e t 5 at the cp of interest an accurate detection of t 5 is of fundamental importance for risk and water entities in charge of accurately planning aquifer remediation risk analysis and managing water resources moreover peak mass fluxes at an environmentally sensitive location can be viewed as an indicator of the risks associated with groundwater contamination and can also serve as a proxy for dilution fiori 2001 we then explore the increased lifetime cancer risk estimates associated with chronic exposure to chlorinated solvents that are the reactive contaminants of interest in our study the latter metric is of fundamental importance for public health authorities and its quantification provides useful insights for risk and remediation experts in order to characterize risk of real life operations 2 1 k ϕ model the interdependence between the heterogeneous k and ϕ fields is largely uncertain as explained in section 1 however a positive correlation is likely to be present in unconsolidated sandy aquifers e g hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 with the goal of systematically exploring the influence of spatially variable ϕ and k on the epms described before we model our aquifer system as being characterized by a spatially heterogeneous k and homogeneous ϕ and b spatially heterogeneous k correlated to spatially heterogeneous ϕ in order to illustrate the possible relationship between k and ϕ data we report in fig 1 permeability k and ϕ data for different formations data presented in purple refer to experimental measurements of a sequence of seven samples of fountainebleau sandstone doyen 1988 in blue light we show samples from a turbidite reservoir of late jurassic age located in the north sea grau 2000 nelson 2004 furthermore data from permian triassic sandstones from prudhoe bay field alaska usa are pictured in red atkinson et al 1990 nelson 2004 whereas core plug samples of cenozoic sediments from the southern netherlands luijendijk and gleeson 2015 are shown in green in fig 1 we recall that permeability k is directly proportional to k through k k ρ g μ bear 1979 where ρ indicates water density 1000 g m3 g is the gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water we adopted a value of μ equal to 8 84 10 4 pa s i e a temperature of 25 c note that k in fig 1 is expressed in md 1 md being equivalent to 9 87 10 16 m2 interpolation of ϕ and k data of fig 1 suggests a positive correlation for all the formations presented in our work we consider a porous formation composed by unconsolidated sandy material and we assume positive correlation between the heterogeneous k and ϕ fields for the purpose of illustration we estimate that the relationship among ϕ and k can be described by the well known kozeny carman kc empirical equation carman 1937 1956 kozeny 1927 1 k ρ g μ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 d e 2 180 where de indicates the representative diameter of grains and the remaining parameters have been previously defined the literature presents different interpretations for de e g koltermann and gorelick 1995 and we assume that the latter corresponds to d 10 i e the grain diameter at which 10 of the particles are smaller in our study the kc equation has been proven effective in predicting the permeability of sand from porosity data and generally gives good predictions of hydraulic conductivity when the value of d 10 is within the range 0 1 3 mm barahona palomo et al 2011 the kc formula has been employed in different studies e g barahona palomo et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 odong 2007 riva et al 2010 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 concluded that permeability of pure sand can be predicted with high confidence r 2 0 9 using the kc equation bianchi and zheng 2016 used the relationship to first estimate the k values of lithofacies during three dimensional stochastic flow and transport modeling at the made site odong 2007 tested the reliability of different empirical formulas to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of unconsolidated aquifers by particle size analysis and identified the kc equation as the overall best estimator other authors as barr 2005 and carrier iii 2003 also encouraged the use of the kc formula we point out that the scope of our work is to explore the influence of possible combinations of spatially variable ϕ and k on the transport of tracers and reactive contaminants our goal is to assess the impact of neglecting the joint variability of ϕ and k on the probabilistic assessment of the risks associated with groundwater contamination the estimation of the ϕ fields from k through the kc relationship is chosen for the purpose of illustration and given its suitability to unconsolidated sandy aquifers shown in different studies e g hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 however we point out the kc equation implies a full positive correlation between ϕ and k but in reality the correlation between the two hydrogeological properties is partial and nonlinear e g hu et al 2009 therefore the kc equation can be a reliable predictor of k from ϕ only for some cases and is used in this work for the purpose of illustration we emphasize that other empirical relationships between ϕ and k which are site specific for example obtained through borehole geophysics techniques can be utilized within the methodological framework adopted in this study 2 2 flow and transport model groundwater flow a steady state uniform in the mean base flow q 0 takes place along the longitudinal x direction within the 3d heterogeneous aquifer in the absence of sinks and sources constant head conditions are established at the west and east boundaries and no flow conditions are set at the remaining boundaries the steady state groundwater flow is governed by the following partial differential equation 2 q x 0 with 3 q x k x h x where q m d is the specific discharge vector and h m is the hydraulic head note that 3 is written in terms of q therefore the spatial variability of the ϕ field does not play a role in the solution of the groundwater flow problem after solving 3 groundwater velocity is obtained from v x k x h x ϕ x and used as input to the contaminant transport model the contaminant transport equation is then including the ϕ field variability for both conservative and reactive chemical species as previously mentioned to improve our understanding of the joint k ϕ heterogeneity on transport and its role in contaminated groundwater management we simulate contaminant transport for non reactive and reactive species the latter case will be linked to a dose response model to evaluate the adverse health effects associated with contaminant exposure reactive transport a contaminant is released along a vertical 2d plane of areal extent as contaminant mass fluxes or concentrations are measured at multiple control planes cps located at different longitudinal distances from the source zone fig 2 illustrates a sketch of the problem under investigation following the work of henri et al 2015 the aquifer is contaminated by tetrachloroethylene pce a dnapl product often identified in groundwater fay and mumtaz 1996 we assume that pce is entrapped in the source area and slowly dissolves in time originating a long term contamination that moves downgradient in the presence of an anaerobic environment pce undergoes chemical degradation that generates trichloroethylene tce a byproduct that in turn reacts and degrades into cis dichloroethylene dce dce degrates then into vinyl chloride vc which will finally produce ethene the us environmental protection agency epa classifies pce tce and dce as probable human carcinogenic products whereas categorizes vc as a human carcinogen u s environmental protection agency 1997 the reactive transport of pce and its daughter products can be described by the following system of equations where subscript i indicates a specific contaminant within the toxic pce degradation chain i e i 1 pce i 2 tce i 3 dce and i 4 vc 4 ϕ r i c i t ϕ d c i q c i y i k i 1 ϕ c i 1 k i ϕ c i s x t δ i 1 i 1 4 where ci g m3 is the resident contaminant concentration of the ith species d m2 d represents the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor whose components along the x y and z direction are respectively d x x α x v d y y α y v and d z z α z v with v m d indicating groundwater velocity of the grid block here αx αy and αz are respectively the longitudinal along x transverse horizontal along y and transverse vertical along z dispersivity coefficients assumed to be constant for all the contaminant species furthermore ri represents the retardation factor ki d 1 indicates the first order contaminant degradation rate and yi g g 1 symbolizes the effective yield coefficient for any reactant or product pair the latter represents the ratio between the generated mass of species i and the degraded mass of species i 1 we assume that biodegradation does not occur in the sorbed phase and that sorption reactions follow a linear sorption isotherm see henri et al 2015 and references therein δ i1 indicates the kronecker delta function note that in our study we account for the main characteristics of dnapl mass discharge by linking the dnapl source strength to the dnapl mass remaining in the source zone falta et al 2005 the source zone is then conceptualized as a control plane from which the temporal evolution of the contaminant fluxes is simulated using integrative parameters in line with the architecture of the dnapl we consider a time dependent dissolution rate s x t of pce leaving the areal source as starting from no contamination at initial time t 0 following the approach described in henri et al 2015 we employ the mass depletion model proposed in the literature parker and park 2004 rao et al 2001 5 c s t c 0 m t m 0 γ where cs is the flux averaged concentration of the dissolved dnapl species i e pce leaving as c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration at the source zone m is the mass of dnapl remaining in the source zone and γ represents the mass depletion constant accounting for changes of the interfacial surface area while the mass at the source diminishes the flux concentration of pce leaving the areal source is then expressed as in parker and park 2004 6 c s t c 0 m 0 γ q s c 0 λ s m 0 γ m 0 1 γ q s c 0 λ s m 0 γ e γ 1 λ s t γ 1 γ where m 0 is the initial contaminant mass at the source qs represents the groundwater volumetric discharge rate through the source zone while λs is the first order degradation constant of pce at the source henri et al 2015 the function s x t i e the time dependent dissolution rate at the source is given by 7 s x t q s c s t δ x x i n j ω x a s where q s q s a s and ω x a s is an indicator function equal to one if x as and equal to zero elsewhere in section 2 3 we present the dose response model employed to compute the adverse health risk caused by the reactive chemicals degradation chain i e pce tce dce vc non reactive transport with the goal of isolating the influence of heterogeneity in the aquifer geological properties k and ϕ on transport from the chemical reactions component we also simulate transport of a non reactive tracer in this case similarly to the reactive transport simulations groundwater flow is also governed by eqs 2 and 3 whereas contaminant transport through the porous media is expressed by 4 with chemical reactions set to zero during the conservative contaminant transport simulations the tracer is instantaneously and homogeneously released within as and we investigate the first arrival times and peak mass fluxes through the control planes and corresponding uncertainties 2 3 health risk model being the human health risk the epm of concern for the reactive transport case we follow the work of maxwell and kastenberg 1999 henri et al 2015 and zarlenga et al 2016 and adopt a poisson model u s environmental protection agency 1989 to evaluate the human incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr ri x associated to an exposure to the contaminant i at the cp location x 8 r i x 1 exp a d d i x c p f i where cpfi kg d mg indicates the metabolized cancer potency factor related to contaminant i and addi mg kg d is the average daily dose in this work risk is due to human exposure by direct ingestion and 9 a d d i x c i x i r b w e d e f a t in eq 9 ir is the water ingestion rate l d bw is the body weight kg ed symbolizes the exposure duration y ef is the daily exposure frequency d y and at indicates the expected lifetime d in our study c i x g m3 in 9 represents the flux averaged concentration kreft and zuber 1979 at a cp situated at a given longitudinal distance x this variable is identified both as a the peak flux averaged concentration and b the maximum exposure duration ed averaged flux averaged concentration the manner in which c i x is evaluated can lead to different groundwater management strategies de barros and rubin 2008 it is therefore important to evaluate both cases a and b above the first case being the worst scenario that can provide a conservative risk estimate in the second case b c i x is equal to the maximum running averaged concentration over the ed interval of the contaminant concentration btc at the cp henri et al 2015 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 and is mathematically given by 10 c i x max t 0 1 e d t t e d c i τ x d τ where ci τ x is the flux averaged concentration observed at the cp location given that we consider the degradation of pce into sub products parent and daughter species are likely to be present simultaneously in the aquifer the total risk of the chemical mixture denoted by rt in the presence of low concentrations less than 300 ppm can then be identified as the summation of the individual risks caused by each chemical product feron et al 1981 as follows 11 r t x i 1 4 r i x the health risk model parameters employed to compute the total ilcr i e rt 11 at the cps are listed in table 1 3 methodology general set up in order to analyze contaminant transport and corresponding uncertainties throughout the 3d aquifer we employ a stochastic monte carlo mc framework that accounts for uncertain k and ϕ distributions five hundred equally likely k and ϕ fields are generated and for each field the groundwater flow and contaminant transport equations are numerically solved results are then statistically analyzed over the ensemble of mc realizations the 3d computational domain is characterized by dimensions l x l y l z 700 m 400 m 100 m and discretized into 350 200 100 cells i e cells dimensions of δ x δ y 2 m and δ z 1 m a large number of particles 104 is uniformly injected within the source area a s l s y l s z 70 m 20 m located at x x inj 50 m and transversely centered within the aquifer domain note that the choice of the number of particles used in our simulations is based on a convergence analysis not shown in order to compute the btcs we employ a kernel density estimator method that allows the automatization of the btcs reconstruction process and provides a better quality of results for the same number of injected particles fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 a set of 7 cps are positioned at different distances along the x direction henceforth denoted by x cp 85 m 100 m 120 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 600 m the log conductivity field y ln k is spatially heterogeneous and represented by a multi gaussian rsf characterized by a gaussian covariance function of ranges λx λy and λz respectively along the x y and z direction mean y and variance σ y 2 for the computational analysis we set λx λy 35 m and λ z 10 m a sequential multi gaussian simulator remy et al 2009 is employed to produce the ensemble of y field realizations based on the data reported in section 2 1 we assume that the heterogeneous k field is positively correlated to the heterogeneous ϕ field and that the relationship between the two geological attributes can be described through the kc relationship 1 from each heterogeneous k field realization we then obtain the corresponding spatially variable ϕ field by applying the kc eq 1 to do so we invert the kc relationship by means of the matlab solver note that all the parameters of the kc relationship 1 are constant see table 2 and that the representative diameter of grains de in our case corresponding to d 10 is chosen within the range 0 1 3 mm given the suitability to obtain a good prediction of the permeability of sand from porosity data when d 10 is within this range barahona palomo et al 2011 we also point out that the possible k ϕ field combinations considered in our analysis are unconditional since we are not referring to a specific site we analyze the influence of heterogeneity on transport in the presence of a constant ϕ and heterogeneous k and b spatially variable ϕ positively correlated to heterogeneous k the outputs of scenarios a and b can be compared since the constant value of ϕ in case a coincides with the average value of the heterogeneous ϕ field realizations i e ϕ the average porosity ϕ is roughly constant for all the mc realizations and can therefore be obtained by applying the geometric mean of k indicated as kg in the kc equation above 1 this leads to a mean ϕ value of 0 23 in order to give a better idea of the range of ϕ values of our simulations we present in fig 3 the histogram of ϕ for one random realization of the k field the latter is characterized by σ y 2 1 and the mean value of ϕ obtained is 0 239 i e 23 9 furthermore different levels of heterogeneity of the y field are explored we consider both a mildly heterogeneous aquifer represented by σ y 2 1 and a more heterogeneous system characterized by σ y 2 3 for both the inert tracer and the reactive transport simulations in each case the variance of the ln ϕ field i e σ ln ϕ 2 is one order of magnitude less that σ y 2 which is in agreement with the work of hassan et al 1998 groundwater fluxes are computed by means of the widely tested numerical model finite difference modflow harbaugh 2005 conservative and multispecies reactive transport are simulated through the rw3d code fernàndez garcia et al 2005 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 using the random walk particle tracking method the rw3d method uses the velocity field to advectically move particles and disturbs the motion by adding a random displacement to simulate dispersion in order to obtain a continuous velocity field that fulfills the local solute mass balance a hybrid scheme based on bilinear interpolation to handle the dispersion terms and on linear interpolation for the advective term is applied to the rwpt method labolle et al 1996 showed that this scheme can solve solute transport quite accurately within heterogeneous systems salamon et al 2006 given that we are employing heterogenous ϕ fields the transport is also controlled by the spatially variable ϕ distribution see eq 4 and the values of the longitudinal transverse horizontal transverse vertical dispersivities which are appropriately selected to account for sub grid heterogeneity the main input parameters used in the numerical solution of the flow and transport models are reported in table 2 reactive transport as far as the chemical parameters chosen for the reactive transport simulations we employ constant values of biodegradation rates which we select accordingly to the range of observed values listed by the us epa u s environmental protection agency 1999 additionally the choice of the retardation factors is based on the expected differences in mobility between the chlorinated solvents species henri et al 2015 lu et al 2011 as explained in henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 the particle tracking algorithm represents the distribution of mass of each species by a different cloud of particles the challenge is to define from initial conditions the species and position that a given particle will be associated with after a given time to do so each particle is defined by its position and species state at a given time and we aim to define the condition of the particle at a later time the change in chemical state is determined from the species state transition probability matrix whereas the corresponding particle motion is given by the first and second spatial moments the motion of particles follows a standard random walk with time dependent effective retardation and dispersion parameters that depend on the initial and final chemical state of the particle basically the approach is based on the development of transition probabilities that describe the likelihood that particles belonging to a given species and location at a given time will be transformed into and moved to another species and location later on and these probabilities are derived from the solution matrix of the spatial moments governing equations henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 table 3 shows the chemical reaction parameters adopted in our study during the reactive transport simulations particles are instantaneously and uniformly released within as the first arrival time of the particles at the cps is recorded and cumulative concentration btcs are computed to obtain ci h t x the flux averaged concentration of any reacting species i ci t x caused by the time dependent injection described in 7 is computed through the principle of superposition as follows 12 c i t x 0 t c s τ c i δ t τ x d τ where c i δ τ x represents the dirac input solution i e instantaneous injection of the concentration associated with the ith species for numerical purposes the source concentration cs t can be discretized in step functions according to 13 c s t c s 0 h t j 1 δ c s j h t t j with h t indicating the heaviside step function and δ c s j c s j c s j 1 eq 12 is then given by 14 c i t x c s 0 c i h t x j 1 t j t δ c s j c i h t t j x in 14 c i h t x indicates the cumulative btc of the ith species computed from an unitary mass source henri et al 2015 table 4 presents the mass transfer parameters adopted in the reactive case study the contaminant concentration btcs recorded from the mc ensemble at the observation cps are then employed to compute c i x in the two ways previously illustrated see section 2 3 and to compute the associated increased lifetime cancer risk non reactive transport in the conservative tracer simulations we instantaneously inject 1 gr of contaminant mass uniformly within as and observe the contaminant mass flux indicated as m g d at the cps from which the epms under investigation are computed we recall that contaminant concentrations can then be obtained by the ratio between the contaminant mass flux measured at the control plane and the volumetric water flux through the cp the results of the conservative and reactive transport mc simulations are post processed to evaluate the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on risk statistics and illustrated in section 4 4 results 4 1 analysis for non reactive contaminants in this section we show the effect of k ϕ heterogeneity on the transport of an inert tracer over the ensemble of mc realizations we first present the cumulative distribution function cdf of early arrival times of contaminants and of peak contaminant mass fluxes at the cps we then quantify the relative difference between first and late arrival times of the tracer at the observation locations we finally show the impact of aquifer connectivity on peak contaminant mass fluxes in order to understand the importance of realistically accounting for heterogeneous ϕ we consider different scenarios heterogeneous ϕ fields correlated to spatially variable k characterized by σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 and corresponding spatially averaged homogeneous ϕ coupled with heterogeneous k with σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 4 1 1 cdf of first arrival times and peak mass fluxes we present in fig 4 the cdf of dimensionless first arrival times normalized by the mean advective time required to travel a distance of 1 range along the longitudinal direction i e t 5 u λx where u is the longitudinal mean velocity given by u k g j ϕ with j being the hydraulic head gradient for simplicity we only show the cdfs at two cps located respectively at x 200 m corresponding to dimensionless distance ζ 4 29 in green and x 600 m corresponding to ζ 15 71 in red with ζ x c p x i n j λ x results at the other cps are alike fig 4 a and b refers to σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 respectively dashed curves correspond to heterogeneous correlated k ϕ fields and solid curves indicate simplified homogeneous ϕ and heterogeneous k fig 4 clearly illustrates that spatially variable ϕ has a strong impact on the conservative tracer first arrival time statistics accounting for ϕ heterogeneity increases the probability of detecting larger t 5 at the cps for both levels of heterogeneity of the y field in particular the importance of including the spatial variability of ϕ increases as the cps distance from the contaminant injection source increases compare red curves versus green curves indeed as the distance between the source and cp grows the plume samples more heterogeneity of the system and the effect of considering variable ϕ strengthens we also notice that increasing the heterogeneity of y see fig 4 b generally decreases t 5 indeed larger σ y 2 increases the probability of occurrence of fast flow channels which leads to a decrease of first arrival times compare fig 4 a and b subsequent fig 5 pictures the cdf of dimensionless peak mass fluxes m p normalized by the initial injected mass m 0 over the time required to travel one range along x indicated as m p λ x m 0 u at the two cps located at dimensionless distances ζ 4 29 in green and ζ 15 71 in red fig 5 a refers to σ y 2 1 whereas fig 5 b to σ y 2 3 as before dashed curves correspond to heterogeneous ϕ while solid curves indicate the outcome of considering homogeneous ϕ results at the remaining cps show comparable outcomes from fig 5 we observe that the significance of accounting for coupled heterogeneous k ϕ fields on transport predictions decreases when the epm of interest is m p as compared to t 5 fig 4 this effect is more evident when the heterogeneity of the k field is higher compare fig 5 a with b we generally observe that the presence of heterogeneous ϕ fields increases the chance of observing higher peak mass fluxes as compared to homogeneous ϕ realizations for both observation locations and levels of heterogeneity of the y field in fact the positive correlation between the k ϕ fields decreases the macrodispersion of the plume along the longitudinal direction which produces higher peak mass fluxes at the observation locations the decrease of plume dispersion is a result of a diminished variance of the groundwater velocity field in the presence of a positive correlation between ϕ and k in fact lower velocity variance implies smaller velocity fluctuations which are the main factors driving dispersion lower plume dispersion along the longitudinal direction in the presence of positive k ϕ correlation is in line with the findings of hassan et al 1998 reduced longitudinal dispersion is also in agreement with the detection of later first arrival times when ϕ is modeled as heterogeneous and positively correlated to k see dashed curves in fig 4 hassan et al 1998 moreover the effect of porosity variability on m p increases for mildly heterogeneous aquifers i e σ y 2 1 as compared to an aquifer with higher y heterogeneity i e σ y 2 3 this is also in agreement with the work of hassan et al 1998 we also notice lower peak mass fluxes at the cp located further away from as i e at ζ 15 71 in red according to the fact that plume dispersion increases as the plume travels longer and samples more aquifer heterogeneity the results presented in figs 4 and 5 show the importance of incorporating the spatial variability in ϕ when predicting early arrival times and peak mass fluxes since the heterogeneity of the ϕ field impacts the plume macrodispersion we analyze the relative plume dispersion for the different scenarios investigated in the following section 4 1 2 4 1 2 relative plume dispersion the macro scale dispersive behavior of the solute plume under uniform or spatially random ϕ fields coupled with heterogeneous k realizations is additionally explored in fig 6 in the latter we present box plots of δτ defined as 15 δ τ t 95 t 5 t 95 t 95 is identified as the time of arrival of 95 of the initial injected mass m0 δτ can represent a measure of the relative plume dispersion since it quantifies the relative difference between the first i e t 5 and late arrival times i e t 95 of the tracer at the cps in fig 6 the green boxes indicate the results at the cp located at dimensionless distance ζ 4 29 whereas the red boxes refer to the outcomes at the cp situated at ζ 15 71 results at the additional cps being similar the thickness of the box plots equals the lag between the first and third quartiles of the probability distribution of δτ fig 6 a refers to σ y 2 1 whereas fig 6 b to σ y 2 3 when we compare the box plots of δτ for homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ for both cps locations and σ y 2 values we observe that δτ values are lower when ϕ is modeled as heterogeneous this is because as explained before the longitudinal dispersion of the plume decreases when ϕ is positively correlated to k leading to a smaller difference between first t 5 and late t 95 arrival times of the plume at the cps accordingly the range of δτ presents higher values for all scenarios homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ and different cps locations when σ y 2 3 i e under higher heterogeneity of the y field we observe a higher chance of fast flow channels which decrease t 5 as well as increased longitudinal dispersion finally in agreement with previous results the difference between the range of δτ values between the constant ϕ and heterogeneous ϕ cases increases for the cp located further away from the injection area red box plots for both levels of heterogeneity of y this confirms that the importance of modeling ϕ variability increases as the tracer travels longer through the heterogeneous aquifer domain 4 1 3 impact of connectivity on risk our analysis on the importance of accounting for ϕ spatial variability on the inert tracer transport statistics ends with analyzing the effect of aquifer connectivity on peak mass fluxes for the different scenarios considered previous results see figs 4 and 6 showed how heterogeneity in ϕ and k affected solute arrival times as a consequence these heterogeneities can be expected to impact flow connectivity we analyze here how k ϕ variability affects connectivity and its predictive capabilities on the peak mass flux at a given cp connectivity can be described by different metrics knudby and carrera 2005 rizzo and de barros 2017 and in line with the work of henri et al 2015 we employ a dynamic connectivity metric which depends on both groundwater flow and contaminant transport parameters knudby and carrera 2005 the selected connectivity metric indicated as ci is given by the ratio between the effective hydraulic conductivity keff and the geometric mean of k kg 16 c i k e f f k g 1 t 50 x c p x i n j ϕ k g j with t 50 being the time of arrival of 50 of the initial injected mass at the cp of interest the remaining parameters have been defined in table 2 note that the average ϕ value i e ϕ has been employed to compute ci for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ simulations in this analysis we identify the peak contaminant mass flux m p at the observation location i e cp as a measure of risk fig 7 shows scatter plots of dimensionless m p versus ci 16 every circle in fig 7 corresponds to a different mc realization and for simplicity only results at cps located at dimensionless distance ζ 1 in red and ζ 4 29 in green are reported as the observations at the remaining cps are similar full circles correspond to the outcome of considering homogeneous ϕ whereas empty circles indicate the output of more realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions fig 7 a refers to σ y 2 1 while fig 7 b reports the results of σ y 2 3 a linear regression between m p and ci is identified for both homogeneous full circles and heterogeneous empty circles ϕ fields cp location and σ y 2 value indeed under higher ci values corresponding to the presence of preferential flow channels ergo lower t 50 16 a higher chance of detecting higher m p values at the cps under investigation is identified we observe that the slope of the linear regression line whose equation is reported in gray for homogeneous ϕ and in black for heterogeneous ϕ is higher when ϕ is heterogeneous and positively correlated to k as compared to simplified homogeneous ϕ for both cps and for both levels of heterogeneity of y therefore under realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions and under the assumption that the k ϕ relationship can be described through the kc eq 1 an increased chance of observing higher m p i e having higher risk emerges as compared to constant ϕ conditions for the same ci value this could be attributed to the lower macro scale spreading dispersion of the contaminant plume under positive k ϕ correlation which results in higher m p at the sensitive location we also notice that a larger σ y 2 fig 6 b favors the formation of preferential channels hence higher ci values and corresponding m p values compare fig 7 a and b results at the remaining cps locations are similar and we generally observe a decrease of the coefficient of determination r 2 of the regression line between ci and m p values as the cp distance from as increases our results suggest that realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions are associated with higher values of m p corresponding to higher health risk at sensitive locations therefore considering simplified constant ϕ conditions could be misleading i e lead to underestimated risks we also foresee that the effects of incorporating porosity variability on transport observables could potentially be emphasized in the presence of non gaussian k fields which present higher probability of well connected zones of high k values gómez hernández and wen 1998 henri et al 2015 for example the work of libera et al 2017b showed that higher solute peak concentrations are detected at extraction wells as the departure of the non gaussian y fields from a gaussian structure increases 4 2 analysis for reactive contaminants implications in increased lifetime cancer risk results in this section refer to the reactive contaminant transport simulations i e to the degradation chain of chlorinated solvents pce tce dce vc we analyze the statistics of the total increased lifetime cancer risk rt x 11 for the scenarios under investigation we first present the spatial distribution of the low order moments i e the ensemble mean and the coefficient of variation of rt and we then show the complete statistical characterization of the pdf of rt the outcomes of accounting for heterogeneous ϕ are represented with dashed lines while the results of constant ϕ are illustrated with solid lines in figs 8 10 the results of considering σ y 2 1 are pictured in magenta and the outcomes for σ y 2 3 are illustrated in blue 4 2 1 low order moments of rt x fig 8 shows the spatial evolution of the mean value of rt 11 denoted as rt over the ensemble of mc simulations when the peak concentration of the contaminant i at the cp fig 8 a or the maximum running averaged concentration over the ed time 10 fig 8 b is adopted to compute rt x rt x quantifies the expected threat to the exposed community we first notice that for the current numerical set up the formula adopted to compute the flux averaged contaminant concentration in eq 9 has only a very minor influence on the spatial evolution of rt compare fig 8 a and b we indeed notice that rt is just slightly lower when we employ the maximum running averaged concentration to compute the risk fig 8 b according to the fact that adopting the peak concentration represents the most conservative approach we observe that rt increases with cp distance since more toxic species are produced with time along the chemical degradation chain of pce henri et al 2015 in fig 8 a and b in fact cancer potency factors cpfi increase during the degradation of pce until vc is produced see table 1 in general the influence of heterogeneity on the mean ilcr is almost unnoticeable in fig 8 see dashed lines versus solid lines the fact that accounting for ϕ heterogeneity has only a small impact on rt x confirms that also in the presence of reactive contaminants the influence of incorporating ϕ variability depends on the metric of interest increasing the heterogeneity of the y field i e σ y 2 3 blue lines decreases the magnitude of the mean ilcr along the longitudinal direction because of enhanced dispersion of the plume and subsequent dilution at cps henri et al 2015 fig 9 shows the spatial evolution of the coefficient of variation of the total ilcr i e c v r t x we recall that c v r t x σ r t x r t x with σ r t x indicating the standard deviation of the total ilcr fig 9 a refers to the computation of rt x by considering the maximum contaminant concentration whereas fig 9 b shows the same results when the maximum ed flux averaged concentration 10 is adopted to compute rt x the coefficient of variation c v r t x measures the uncertainty associated with the risk estimate in agreement with what observed in fig 9 we also point out that the approach adopted to compute the flux averaged concentration in eq 9 does not influence the risk uncertainty and the differences between fig 9 a and b are imperceptible we note that this remark is applicable to the current numerical set up we generally observe that the spatial evolution of c v r t presents an inverse correlation with rt x in agreement with henri et al 2015 therefore we identify lower mean total ilcr and more uncertain risk predictions close to the source while we observe higher mean risk and lower risk uncertainty further away for all the simulated scenarios larger risk uncertainty close to the source is expected since the plume is mainly controlled by advection at that stage de barros et al 2009 our results indicate that accounting for the heterogeneity in ϕ affects the risk uncertainty indeed the positive correlation between ϕ and k leads to a reduction of the sample to sample fluctuation of the risk and therefore to a reduction of c v r t x for both levels of heterogeneity of the y field see dashed lines versus solid lines in both fig 9 a and b this effect is emphasized when σ y 2 3 the results presented in figs 8 and 9 show that the influence of ϕ heterogeneity is higher on risk uncertainty i e c v r t x fig 9 than on the mean total ilcr rt x fig 8 this can be justified by the fact that mean mass fluxes at large cps are not significantly affected by local fluctuations of the flow field as explained in fiori et al 2002 on the other hand the first order analysis provided in fiori et al 2002 and andričević and cvetković 1998 shows that the variance of the mass flux over a control plane is sensitive to local heterogeneity 4 2 2 pdf of rt we conclude the discussion on the influence of ϕ spatial heterogeneity on reactive transport by presenting the pdf of the ilcr in fig 10 the results in fig 10 refer to the computation of rt x by employing the maximum running averaged concentration over ed 10 results at the cp located at ζ 10 are reported in fig 10 a while the outcomes at ζ 15 71 are presented in fig 10 b the pdfs of rt present a similar gaussian like shape under constant or random ϕ these results are consistent with the findings of henri et al 2015 2016 we observe that the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on the pdf of the ilcr described below is more pronounced when the cp is situated closer to the source for the case of σ y 2 3 compare fig 10 a with b in general accounting for ϕ heterogeneity dashed pdfs only slightly influences the mean value of rt but significantly affects the uncertainty of rt we indeed notice that the rt pdf is less spread when the heterogeneity of ϕ is modeled as compared to assuming constant ϕ dashed pdfs versus solid pdfs in particular the probability of observing values of rt around rt increases of more than 30 when the variability of ϕ is included in models predictions for all scenarios considered except for the case of σ y 2 3 at the cp located at ζ 15 71 where this probability is around 20 higher under heterogeneous ϕ moreover the full risk pdfs show the probability of observing extreme values of rt we observe that modeling the ϕ heterogeneity has influence on both the highest and lowest values of rt and the probability of detecting extreme values of rt decreases in the presence of spatially variable ϕ 5 conclusions in this study we analyze the impact of the coupled spatial variability of ϕ and k on contaminant transport and probabilistic risk analysis we employ a monte carlo framework to statistically analyze key epms detected at observation locations we analyze the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on contaminant arrival times and peak mass fluxes of tracers at control planes as well as on risk and on connectivity we then show the implications of accounting for ϕ variability in probabilistic human health cancer risk analysis by considering human exposure to chlorinated solvents through the ingestion pathway our work leads to the following main key conclusions the positive correlation between ϕ and k leads to a decrease of the plume macrodispersion with consequent higher peak mass fluxes later first arrival times and earlier late arrivals at control planes higher peak mass fluxes correspond to higher health risk therefore including the spatial variability of ϕ in models predictions is essential for risk assessment associated with aquifer contamination and remediation moreover a more accurate quantification of early and late arrival times is fundamental to respectively detect the potential hazard of a contaminant and to control the end point of remediation see e g andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and rubin 2008 the relevance of incorporating the spatial variability of the ϕ field can depend on the metric of interest for example our study shows that this relevance is emphasized when investigating contaminants arrival times over peak mass fluxes at the observation control planes this has important implications both to set up modeling studies and in decision making processes e g in risk assessment or aquifer remediation activities in the context of a better allocation of resources indeed available resources need to be prioritized and assigned in a defensible manner to ensure that unacceptable identified risks are reduced to acceptable levels modeling the ϕ field spatial variability as positively correlated to the heterogeneous k field significantly reduces the cancer risk uncertainty but only minorly influences the mean value of the total cancer risk at control planes our findings constitute then an important contribution for cancer risk uncertainty quantification however adoptng more simplified and conservative models which assume homogeneous porosity does not highly impact the mean value of the total cancer risk we finally noticed that the effect of considering ϕ heterogeneity can be affected by the level of heterogeneity of the k field and by the source to cp distance we recall that the results of our work are limited to positive correlation between ϕ and k expressed through the kc eq 1 other empirical models can be adopted to compute the k ϕ relationship and could potentially lead to different conclusions furthermore other factors such as pumping operations libera et al 2017a and solute mass release rates at the source zone de barros 2018 can impact the relative importance of hydrogeological heterogeneity on a final note we emphasize that our work represents a first step towards a more comprehensive global sensitivity analysis gsa that could lead to more general conclusions using polynomial chaos expansion pce within a gsa can reduce the computational burden associated with monte carlo simulations utilizing pce to perform gsa would allow to better understand the relevance of heterogeneous porosity with respect to heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity under the context of risk pce based gsa was employed by different authors e g ciriello et al 2013a 2013b oladyshkin et al 2012 ciriello et al 2013a employed gsa to identify the influence of uncertain hydrogeological parameters on the first two statistical moments of the peak concentration ciriello et al 2013b applied a gsa through pce to three transport models to identify the relative importance of model dependent parameters the space time locations where the models are more sensitive to these parameters and to assist with parameters estimation oladyshkin et al 2012 illustrated their gsa approach based on arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apc on a 3d groundwater quality and health risk problem in a heterogeneous aquifer incorporating a gsa through pce into the problem investigated in this work is topic of future research with the goal of reducing the computational burden normally associated with monte carlo simulations and to investigate the impact of considering different soil types on risk e g moore and doherty 2005 acknowledgments arianna

663,heterogeneities in natural porous formations mainly manifested through the hydraulic conductivity k and to a lesser degree the porosity ϕ largely control subsurface flow and solute transport the influence of the heterogeneous structure of k on transport processes has been widely studied whereas less attention is dedicated to the joint heterogeneity of conductivity and porosity fields our study employs monte carlo simulations to investigate the coupled effect of k ϕ spatial variability on the transport behavior and uncertainty of conservative and reactive plumes within a 3d aquifer domain we explore multiple scenarios characterized by different levels of heterogeneity of the geological properties and compare the computational results from the joint k ϕ heterogeneous system with the results originating from generally adopted constant ϕ conditions in our study the spatially variable k ϕ fields are positively correlated we statistically analyze key environmental performance metrics first arrival times and peak mass fluxes for non reactive species and increased lifetime cancer risk for reactive chlorinated solvents the conservative transport simulations show that considering coupled k ϕ fields decreases the plume dispersion increases both the first arrival times of solutes and the peak mass fluxes at the observation planes a positive correlation between aquifer connectivity and peak mass fluxes is identified for both homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ our conservative transport results indicate that the relevance of ϕ variability can depend on the metric of interest the control plane source distance as well as the level of heterogeneity of the conductivity field the analysis on reactive transport shows that ϕ variability only slightly affects the mean increased lifetime cancer risk at the control planes but leads to a considerable reduction of the cancer risk uncertainty we also see that the sensitivity of cancer risk towards ϕ heterogeneity can be influenced by the level of variability of the conductivity field the source to control plane distance but is not affected by the manner in which the contaminant concentration is computed 1 introduction it is well established that heterogeneities in natural porous formations largely control subsurface groundwater flow and contaminant transport these heterogeneities are mainly manifested through the hydraulic conductivity k and to a lesser degree the porosity ϕ the influence of the heterogeneous k field on flow and solute transport processes has been widely studied see rubin 2003 and references therein whereas less attention is dedicated to the effect of heterogeneous ϕ hydraulic conductivity is commonly modeled as a random space function rsf in the stochastic hydrogeology community because of its erratic spatial variability and the large uncertainty associated with incomplete site characterization dagan 1986 gelhar 1986 ϕ variability is commonly regarded as a secondary factor when compared to k heterogeneity indeed most studies in the field of stochastic hydrogeology assume that aquifers are characterized by spatially heterogeneous k and homogeneous ϕ this is partially justified because k can vary in space by 3 4 orders of magnitude within small distances while the range of variability of ϕ in unconsolidated granular aquifers is generally between 0 1 and 0 55 atkins and mcbride 1992 freeze and cherry 1979 hu et al 2009 because of the limited availability of k and ϕ measurements it is difficult to establish a clear correlation between the two geological properties however in specific formations a level of correlation is likely to be present hassan et al 1998 the literature presents different studies exploring the relationship between k and ϕ archie 1950 and doyen 1988 found positive correlation between the variables additionally different authors investigating the estimation of k from ϕ and other measurable parameters e g grain size pore surface area pore dimension established positive correlation between k and ϕ for different types of soil e g aimrun et al 2004 fallico 2014 franzmeier 1991 nelson et al 1994 panda and lake 1994 riva et al 2014 scholz et al 2012 among them nelson et al 1994 analyzed different models to predict permeability in sedimentary rocks and concluded that in most cases the permeability is related to a power of ϕ and to the square of a measure of surface area or a characteristic length it is typically assumed that k and ϕ are positively correlated in unconsolidated aquifers hu et al 2009 however some studies observed negative correlation between the two properties under specific packing arrangements and grain size distributions morin 2006 only a small number of studies investigated the effects of spatially variable ϕ fields on transport predictions among them warren et al 1964 did not consider a correlation between k and ϕ and concluded that the impact of ϕ variations on macroscopic dispersion is minor with respect to the effect of k variability lin 1977 analyzed various porosity functions to represent ϕ spatial variability in porous media and indicated that the solute concentration predictions are within 15 of the concentration resulting from an average ϕ when a linear or slightly curved equation that expresses porosity as a function of the spatial coordinate is employed the author pointed out that the discrepancies of solute concentrations become very substantial as the deviation of the porosity function from linearity increases a few numerical modeling studies e g hassan 2001 hassan et al 1998 hu et al 2009 showed that the consideration of correlated heterogeneous k and ϕ fields significantly impacts contaminant transport for two dimensional domains hassan et al 1998 indicated that a positive correlation between ϕ and k decreases dispersion whereas a negative correlation enhances plume spreading particularly along the longitudinal direction hassan et al 1998 also considered reactive transport and indicated that reaction rates impact the relative importance of ϕ variability on concentration estimation which appears to be amplified in the presence of slow reactions along the same line of work hassan 2001 highlighted that ϕ spatial variability correlated to heterogeneous k impacts the longitudinal velocity covariance as well as its cross covariance with the head and the log conductivity y ln k fields riva et al 2006 studied the influence of k heterogeneities on solute transport with constant effective ϕ and later expanded their analysis in riva et al 2008 where both k and ϕ were considered random variables riva et al 2008 highlighted that considering the spatial distribution of ϕ is fundamental to mimic the early arrival of breakthrough curves btcs the studies of riva et al 2008 2006 showed that the site description of transport processes highly profits from the incorporation of the spatial variability of the ϕ field in light of the mentioned findings the influence of heterogeneous k coupled with spatially variable ϕ fields especially when the two properties are correlated as shown in most cases should be further investigated to increase the reliability of contaminant transport and associated human health risk predictions in this context our work aims to study the significance of spatial variability in the porous medium s ϕ to conservative and reactive solute transport predictions in the context of probabilistic risk analysis through the use of stochastic numerical simulations we systematically illustrate the impact of k ϕ spatial variability on key environmental performance metrics epms such as solute arrival times peak mass fluxes increased lifetime cancer risk and corresponding uncertainties at environmentally sensitive locations for our illustrations we consider three dimensional 3d heterogeneous aquifer systems in particular the objectives of this work are twofold first we systematically investigate the coupled influence of ϕ and k heterogeneity on the statistical characterization of non reactive transport second within an application oriented context we show the implications of these coupled effects when estimating adverse human health effects e g cancer risk due to exposure to chlorinated solvents in groundwater through extensive stochastic computational analysis we explore different scenarios that to the best of our knowledge have not been investigated with the goal of identifying conditions where the role of spatially variable ϕ correlated to heterogeneous k is relevant our analysis simulates contaminant transport through an unconsolidated sandy aquifer where given the likelihood hassan 2001 hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 positive k ϕ correlation is adopted together with different levels of heterogeneity of the k system our study addresses fundamental questions such as is the uncertainty associated with transport in the subsurface increased or decreased when variable ϕ fields are considered does the relative importance of variable ϕ depend on the level of heterogeneity of the k field what is the impact of this joint heterogeneity on the flow connectivity structure of the aquifer how are the effects of heterogeneity propagated to decision making metrics such as human health risk the paper is structured as follows we present the problem under investigation in section 2 in section 3 we illustrate the methodology employed in our study and provide details on the computational implementation next section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the results for conservative tracers section 4 1 and reactive contaminants section 4 2 we finally summarize our study and outline the key findings in section 5 2 problem statement in this work we consider a contaminated fully saturated 3d heterogeneous aquifer whose cartesian coordinate system is indicated by x x y z we are interested in understanding the impact of heterogeneity stemming from both k and ϕ on a series of epms de barros et al 2012 let ω denote a generic epm for example ω can represent solute arrival times or solute peak concentrations at an environmentally sensitive location if the contaminant is toxic then ω can denote for instance an adverse health effect due to incomplete characterization of the subsurface hydrogeological properties such as k and ϕ are modeled as spatially random as a consequence the quantity ω is subject to uncertainty and quantified through its statistical moments such as its mean ω where the angled brackets denote ensemble expectation its variance σ ω 2 and its probability density function pdf p ω or cumulative density function cdf p ω we are primarily interested in analyzing the effect of k ϕ variability on different epms with the goal of a improving our fundamental understanding of the significance of these variabilities to contaminant transport and b exploring how the latter variabilities propagate to decision making metrics relevant to human health risk analysis in this study we perform both conservative and reactive contaminant transport simulations and select the specific epms indicated below we statistically analyze the first arrival times and peak mass fluxes through control planes cps resulting from conservative tracer simulations the first arrival time is defined as the time of arrival of 5 of the initial injected mass i e t 5 at the cp of interest an accurate detection of t 5 is of fundamental importance for risk and water entities in charge of accurately planning aquifer remediation risk analysis and managing water resources moreover peak mass fluxes at an environmentally sensitive location can be viewed as an indicator of the risks associated with groundwater contamination and can also serve as a proxy for dilution fiori 2001 we then explore the increased lifetime cancer risk estimates associated with chronic exposure to chlorinated solvents that are the reactive contaminants of interest in our study the latter metric is of fundamental importance for public health authorities and its quantification provides useful insights for risk and remediation experts in order to characterize risk of real life operations 2 1 k ϕ model the interdependence between the heterogeneous k and ϕ fields is largely uncertain as explained in section 1 however a positive correlation is likely to be present in unconsolidated sandy aquifers e g hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 with the goal of systematically exploring the influence of spatially variable ϕ and k on the epms described before we model our aquifer system as being characterized by a spatially heterogeneous k and homogeneous ϕ and b spatially heterogeneous k correlated to spatially heterogeneous ϕ in order to illustrate the possible relationship between k and ϕ data we report in fig 1 permeability k and ϕ data for different formations data presented in purple refer to experimental measurements of a sequence of seven samples of fountainebleau sandstone doyen 1988 in blue light we show samples from a turbidite reservoir of late jurassic age located in the north sea grau 2000 nelson 2004 furthermore data from permian triassic sandstones from prudhoe bay field alaska usa are pictured in red atkinson et al 1990 nelson 2004 whereas core plug samples of cenozoic sediments from the southern netherlands luijendijk and gleeson 2015 are shown in green in fig 1 we recall that permeability k is directly proportional to k through k k ρ g μ bear 1979 where ρ indicates water density 1000 g m3 g is the gravity acceleration 9 8 m s2 and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water we adopted a value of μ equal to 8 84 10 4 pa s i e a temperature of 25 c note that k in fig 1 is expressed in md 1 md being equivalent to 9 87 10 16 m2 interpolation of ϕ and k data of fig 1 suggests a positive correlation for all the formations presented in our work we consider a porous formation composed by unconsolidated sandy material and we assume positive correlation between the heterogeneous k and ϕ fields for the purpose of illustration we estimate that the relationship among ϕ and k can be described by the well known kozeny carman kc empirical equation carman 1937 1956 kozeny 1927 1 k ρ g μ ϕ 3 1 ϕ 2 d e 2 180 where de indicates the representative diameter of grains and the remaining parameters have been previously defined the literature presents different interpretations for de e g koltermann and gorelick 1995 and we assume that the latter corresponds to d 10 i e the grain diameter at which 10 of the particles are smaller in our study the kc equation has been proven effective in predicting the permeability of sand from porosity data and generally gives good predictions of hydraulic conductivity when the value of d 10 is within the range 0 1 3 mm barahona palomo et al 2011 the kc formula has been employed in different studies e g barahona palomo et al 2011 bianchi and zheng 2016 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 odong 2007 riva et al 2010 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 concluded that permeability of pure sand can be predicted with high confidence r 2 0 9 using the kc equation bianchi and zheng 2016 used the relationship to first estimate the k values of lithofacies during three dimensional stochastic flow and transport modeling at the made site odong 2007 tested the reliability of different empirical formulas to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of unconsolidated aquifers by particle size analysis and identified the kc equation as the overall best estimator other authors as barr 2005 and carrier iii 2003 also encouraged the use of the kc formula we point out that the scope of our work is to explore the influence of possible combinations of spatially variable ϕ and k on the transport of tracers and reactive contaminants our goal is to assess the impact of neglecting the joint variability of ϕ and k on the probabilistic assessment of the risks associated with groundwater contamination the estimation of the ϕ fields from k through the kc relationship is chosen for the purpose of illustration and given its suitability to unconsolidated sandy aquifers shown in different studies e g hu et al 2009 luijendijk and gleeson 2015 however we point out the kc equation implies a full positive correlation between ϕ and k but in reality the correlation between the two hydrogeological properties is partial and nonlinear e g hu et al 2009 therefore the kc equation can be a reliable predictor of k from ϕ only for some cases and is used in this work for the purpose of illustration we emphasize that other empirical relationships between ϕ and k which are site specific for example obtained through borehole geophysics techniques can be utilized within the methodological framework adopted in this study 2 2 flow and transport model groundwater flow a steady state uniform in the mean base flow q 0 takes place along the longitudinal x direction within the 3d heterogeneous aquifer in the absence of sinks and sources constant head conditions are established at the west and east boundaries and no flow conditions are set at the remaining boundaries the steady state groundwater flow is governed by the following partial differential equation 2 q x 0 with 3 q x k x h x where q m d is the specific discharge vector and h m is the hydraulic head note that 3 is written in terms of q therefore the spatial variability of the ϕ field does not play a role in the solution of the groundwater flow problem after solving 3 groundwater velocity is obtained from v x k x h x ϕ x and used as input to the contaminant transport model the contaminant transport equation is then including the ϕ field variability for both conservative and reactive chemical species as previously mentioned to improve our understanding of the joint k ϕ heterogeneity on transport and its role in contaminated groundwater management we simulate contaminant transport for non reactive and reactive species the latter case will be linked to a dose response model to evaluate the adverse health effects associated with contaminant exposure reactive transport a contaminant is released along a vertical 2d plane of areal extent as contaminant mass fluxes or concentrations are measured at multiple control planes cps located at different longitudinal distances from the source zone fig 2 illustrates a sketch of the problem under investigation following the work of henri et al 2015 the aquifer is contaminated by tetrachloroethylene pce a dnapl product often identified in groundwater fay and mumtaz 1996 we assume that pce is entrapped in the source area and slowly dissolves in time originating a long term contamination that moves downgradient in the presence of an anaerobic environment pce undergoes chemical degradation that generates trichloroethylene tce a byproduct that in turn reacts and degrades into cis dichloroethylene dce dce degrates then into vinyl chloride vc which will finally produce ethene the us environmental protection agency epa classifies pce tce and dce as probable human carcinogenic products whereas categorizes vc as a human carcinogen u s environmental protection agency 1997 the reactive transport of pce and its daughter products can be described by the following system of equations where subscript i indicates a specific contaminant within the toxic pce degradation chain i e i 1 pce i 2 tce i 3 dce and i 4 vc 4 ϕ r i c i t ϕ d c i q c i y i k i 1 ϕ c i 1 k i ϕ

respectively d x x α x v d y y α y v and d z z α z v with v m d indicating groundwater velocity of the grid block here αx αy and αz are respectively the longitudinal along x transverse horizontal along y and transverse vertical along z dispersivity coefficients assumed to be constant for all the contaminant species furthermore ri represents the retardation factor ki d 1 indicates the first order contaminant degradation rate and yi g g 1 symbolizes the effective yield coefficient for any reactant or product pair the latter represents the ratio between the generated mass of species i and the degraded mass of species i 1 we assume that biodegradation does not occur in the sorbed phase and that sorption reactions follow a linear sorption isotherm see henri et al 2015 and references therein δ i1 indicates the kronecker delta function note that in our study we account for the main characteristics of dnapl mass discharge by linking the dnapl source strength to the dnapl mass remaining in the source zone falta et al 2005 the source zone is then conceptualized as a control plane from which the temporal evolution of the contaminant fluxes is simulated using integrative parameters in line with the architecture of the dnapl we consider a time dependent dissolution rate s x t of pce leaving the areal source as starting from no contamination at initial time t 0 following the approach described in henri et al 2015 we employ the mass depletion model proposed in the literature parker and park 2004 rao et al 2001 5 c s t c 0 m t m 0 γ where cs is the flux averaged concentration of the dissolved dnapl species i e pce leaving as c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration at the source zone m is the mass of dnapl remaining in the source zone and γ represents the mass depletion constant accounting for changes of the interfacial surface area while the mass at the source diminishes the flux concentration of pce leaving the areal source is then expressed as in parker and park 2004 6 c s t c 0 m 0 γ q s c 0 λ s m 0 γ m 0 1 γ q s c 0 λ s m 0 γ e γ 1 λ s t γ 1 γ where m 0 is the initial contaminant mass at the source qs represents the groundwater volumetric discharge rate through the source zone while λs is the first order degradation constant of pce at the source henri et al 2015 the function s x t i e the time dependent dissolution rate at the source is given by 7 s x t q s c s t δ x x i n j ω x a s where q s q s a s and ω x a s is an indicator function equal to one if x as and equal to zero elsewhere in section 2 3 we present the dose response model employed to compute the adverse health risk caused by the reactive chemicals degradation chain i e pce tce dce vc non reactive transport with the goal of isolating the influence of heterogeneity in the aquifer geological properties k and ϕ on transport from the chemical reactions component we also simulate transport of a non reactive tracer in this case similarly to the reactive transport simulations groundwater flow is also governed by eqs 2 and 3 whereas contaminant transport through the porous media is expressed by 4 with chemical reactions set to zero during the conservative contaminant transport simulations the tracer is instantaneously and homogeneously released within as and we investigate the first arrival times and peak mass fluxes through the control planes and corresponding uncertainties 2 3 health risk model being the human health risk the epm of concern for the reactive transport case we follow the work of maxwell and kastenberg 1999 henri et al 2015 and zarlenga et al 2016 and adopt a poisson model u s environmental protection agency 1989 to evaluate the human incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr ri x associated to an exposure to the contaminant i at the cp location x 8 r i x 1 exp a d d i x c p f i where cpfi kg d mg indicates the metabolized cancer potency factor related to contaminant i and addi mg kg d is

symbolizes the exposure duration y ef is the daily exposure frequency d y and at indicates the expected lifetime d in our study c i x g m3 in 9 represents the flux averaged concentration kreft and zuber 1979 at a cp situated at a given longitudinal distance x this variable is identified both as a the peak flux averaged concentration and b the maximum exposure duration ed averaged flux averaged concentration the manner in which c i x is evaluated can lead to different groundwater management strategies de barros and rubin 2008 it is therefore important to evaluate both cases a and b above the first case being the worst scenario that can provide a conservative risk estimate in the second case b c i x is equal to the maximum running averaged concentration over the ed interval of the contaminant concentration btc at the cp henri et al 2015 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 and is mathematically given by 10 c i x max t 0 1 e d t t e d c i τ x d τ where ci τ x is the flux averaged concentration observed at the cp location given that we consider the degradation of pce into sub products parent and daughter species are likely to be present simultaneously in the aquifer the total risk of the chemical mixture denoted by rt in the presence of low concentrations less than 300 ppm can then be identified as the summation of the individual risks caused by each chemical product feron et al 1981 as follows 11 r t x i 1 4 r i x the health risk model parameters employed to compute the total ilcr i e rt 11 at the cps are listed in table 1 3 methodology general set up in order to analyze contaminant transport and corresponding uncertainties throughout the 3d aquifer we employ a stochastic monte carlo mc framework that accounts for uncertain k and ϕ distributions five hundred equally likely k and ϕ fields are generated and for each field the groundwater flow and contaminant transport equations are numerically solved results are then statistically analyzed over the ensemble of mc realizations the 3d computational domain is characterized by dimensions l x l y l z 700 m 400 m 100 m and discretized into 350 200 100 cells i e cells dimensions of δ x δ y 2 m and δ z 1 m a large number of particles 104 is uniformly injected within the source area a s l s y l s z 70 m 20 m located at x x inj 50 m and transversely centered within the aquifer domain note that the choice of the number of particles used in our simulations is based on a convergence analysis not shown in order to compute the btcs we employ a kernel density estimator method that allows the automatization of the btcs reconstruction process and provides a better quality of results for the same number of injected particles fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 a set of 7 cps are positioned at different distances along the x direction henceforth denoted by x cp 85 m 100 m 120 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 600 m the log conductivity field y ln k is spatially heterogeneous and represented by a multi gaussian rsf characterized by a gaussian covariance function of ranges λx λy and λz respectively along the x y and z direction mean y and variance σ y 2 for the computational analysis we set λx λy 35 m and λ z 10 m a sequential multi gaussian simulator remy et al 2009 is employed to produce the ensemble of y field realizations based on the data reported in section 2 1 we assume that the heterogeneous k field is positively correlated to the heterogeneous ϕ field and that the relationship between the two geological attributes can be described through the kc relationship 1 from each heterogeneous k field realization we then obtain the corresponding spatially variable ϕ field by applying the kc eq 1 to do so we invert the kc relationship by means of the matlab solver note that all the parameters of the kc relationship 1 are constant see table 2 and that the representative diameter of grains de in our case corresponding to d 10 is chosen within the range 0 1 3 mm given the suitability to obtain a good prediction of the permeability of sand from porosity data when d 10 is within this range barahona palomo et al 2011 we also point out that the possible k ϕ field combinations considered in our analysis are unconditional since we are not referring to a specific site we analyze the influence of heterogeneity on transport in the presence of a constant ϕ and heterogeneous k and b spatially variable ϕ positively correlated to heterogeneous k the outputs of scenarios a and b can be compared since the constant value of ϕ in case a coincides with the average value of the heterogeneous ϕ field realizations i e ϕ the average porosity ϕ is roughly constant for all the mc realizations and can therefore be obtained by applying the geometric mean of k indicated as kg in the kc equation above 1 this leads to a mean ϕ value of 0 23 in order to give a better idea of the range of ϕ values of our simulations we present in fig 3 the histogram of ϕ for one random realization of the k field the latter is characterized by σ y 2 1 and the mean value of ϕ obtained is 0 239 i e 23 9 furthermore different levels of heterogeneity of the y field are explored we consider both a mildly heterogeneous aquifer represented by σ y 2 1 and a more heterogeneous system characterized by σ y 2 3 for both the inert tracer and the reactive transport simulations in each case the variance of the ln ϕ field i e σ ln ϕ 2 is one order of magnitude less that σ y 2 which is in agreement with the work of hassan et al 1998 groundwater fluxes are computed by means of the widely tested numerical model finite difference modflow harbaugh 2005 conservative and multispecies reactive transport are simulated through the rw3d code fernàndez garcia et al 2005 henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 using the random walk particle tracking method the rw3d method uses the velocity field to advectically move particles and disturbs the motion by adding a random displacement to simulate dispersion in order to obtain a continuous velocity field that fulfills the local solute mass balance a hybrid scheme based on bilinear interpolation to handle the dispersion terms and on linear interpolation for the advective term is applied to the rwpt method labolle et al 1996 showed that this scheme can solve solute transport quite accurately within heterogeneous systems salamon et al 2006 given that we are employing heterogenous ϕ fields the transport is also controlled by the spatially variable ϕ distribution see eq 4 and the values of the longitudinal transverse horizontal transverse vertical dispersivities which are appropriately selected to account for sub grid heterogeneity the main input parameters used in the numerical solution of the flow and transport models are reported in table 2 reactive transport as far as the chemical parameters chosen for the reactive transport simulations we employ constant values of biodegradation rates which we select accordingly to the range of observed values listed by the us epa u s environmental protection agency 1999 additionally the choice of the retardation factors is based on the expected differences in mobility between the chlorinated solvents species henri et al 2015 lu et al 2011 as explained in henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 the particle tracking algorithm represents the distribution of mass of each species by a different cloud of particles the challenge is to define from initial conditions the species and position that a given particle will be associated with after a given time to do so each particle is defined by its position and species state at a given time and we aim to define the condition of the particle at a later time the change in chemical state is determined from the species state transition probability matrix whereas the corresponding particle motion is given by the first and second spatial moments the motion of particles follows a standard random walk with time dependent effective retardation and dispersion parameters that depend on the initial and final chemical state of the particle basically the approach is based on the development of transition probabilities that describe the likelihood that particles belonging to a given species and location at a given time will be transformed into and moved to another species and location later on and these probabilities are derived from the solution matrix of the spatial moments governing equations henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 table 3 shows the chemical reaction parameters adopted in our study during the reactive transport simulations particles are instantaneously and uniformly released within as the first arrival time of the particles at the cps is recorded and cumulative concentration btcs are computed to obtain ci h t x the flux averaged concentration of any reacting species i ci t x caused by the time dependent injection described in 7 is computed through the principle of superposition as follows 12 c i t x 0 t c s τ c i δ t τ x d τ where c i δ τ x represents the dirac input solution i e instantaneous injection of the concentration associated with the ith species for numerical purposes the source concentration cs t can be discretized in step functions according to 13 c s t c s 0 h t j 1 δ c s j h t t j with h t indicating the heaviside step function and δ c s j c s j c s j 1 eq 12 is then given by 14 c i t x c s 0 c i h t x j 1 t j t δ c s j c i h t t j x in 14 c i h t x indicates the cumulative btc of the ith species computed from an unitary mass source henri et al 2015 table 4 presents the mass transfer parameters adopted in the reactive case study the contaminant concentration btcs recorded from the mc ensemble at the observation cps are then employed to compute c i x in the two ways previously illustrated see section 2 3 and to compute the associated increased lifetime cancer risk non reactive transport in the conservative tracer simulations we instantaneously inject 1 gr of contaminant mass uniformly within as and observe the contaminant mass flux indicated as m g d at the cps from which the epms under investigation are computed we recall that contaminant concentrations can then be obtained by the ratio between the contaminant mass flux measured at the control plane and the volumetric water flux through the cp the results of the conservative and reactive transport mc simulations are post processed to evaluate the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on risk statistics and illustrated in section 4 4 results 4 1 analysis for non reactive contaminants in this section we show the effect of k ϕ heterogeneity on the transport of an inert tracer over the ensemble of mc realizations we first present the cumulative distribution function cdf of early arrival times of contaminants and of peak contaminant mass fluxes at the cps we then quantify the relative difference between first and late arrival times of the tracer at the observation locations we finally show the impact of aquifer connectivity on peak contaminant mass fluxes in order to understand the importance of realistically accounting for heterogeneous ϕ we consider different scenarios heterogeneous ϕ fields correlated to spatially variable k characterized by σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 and corresponding spatially averaged homogeneous ϕ coupled with heterogeneous k with σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 4 1 1 cdf of first arrival times and peak mass fluxes we present in fig 4 the cdf of dimensionless first arrival times normalized by the mean advective time required to travel a distance of 1 range along the longitudinal direction i e t 5 u λx where u is the longitudinal mean velocity given by u k g j ϕ with j being the hydraulic head gradient for simplicity we only show the cdfs at two cps located respectively at x 200 m corresponding to dimensionless distance ζ 4 29 in green and x 600 m corresponding to ζ 15 71 in red with ζ x c p x i n j λ x results at the other cps are alike fig 4 a and b refers to σ y 2 1 and σ y 2 3 respectively dashed curves correspond to heterogeneous correlated k ϕ fields and solid curves indicate simplified homogeneous ϕ and heterogeneous k fig 4 clearly illustrates that spatially variable ϕ has a strong impact on the conservative tracer first arrival time statistics accounting for ϕ heterogeneity increases the probability of detecting larger t 5 at the cps for both levels of heterogeneity of the y field in particular the importance of including the spatial variability of ϕ increases as the cps distance from the contaminant injection source increases compare red curves versus green curves indeed as the distance between the source and cp grows the plume samples more heterogeneity of the system and the effect of considering variable ϕ strengthens we also notice that increasing the heterogeneity of y see fig 4 b generally decreases t 5 indeed larger σ y 2 increases the probability of occurrence of fast flow channels which leads to a decrease of first arrival times compare fig 4 a and b subsequent fig 5 pictures the cdf of dimensionless peak mass fluxes m p normalized by the initial injected mass m 0 over the time required to travel one range along x indicated as m p λ x m 0 u at the two cps located at dimensionless distances ζ 4 29 in green and ζ 15 71 in red fig 5 a refers to σ y 2 1 whereas fig 5 b to σ y 2 3 as before dashed curves correspond to heterogeneous ϕ while solid curves indicate the outcome of considering homogeneous ϕ results at the remaining cps show comparable outcomes from fig 5 we observe that the significance of accounting for coupled heterogeneous k ϕ fields on transport predictions decreases when the epm of interest is m p as compared to t 5 fig 4 this effect is more evident when the heterogeneity of the k field is higher compare fig 5 a with b we generally observe that the presence of heterogeneous ϕ fields increases the chance of observing higher peak mass fluxes as compared to homogeneous ϕ realizations for both observation locations and levels of heterogeneity of the y field in fact the positive correlation between the k ϕ fields decreases the macrodispersion of the plume along the longitudinal direction which produces higher peak mass fluxes at the observation locations the decrease of plume dispersion is a result of a diminished variance of the groundwater velocity field in the presence of a positive correlation between ϕ and k in fact lower velocity variance implies smaller velocity fluctuations which are the main factors driving dispersion lower plume dispersion along the longitudinal direction in the presence of positive k ϕ correlation is in line with the findings of hassan et al 1998 reduced longitudinal dispersion is also in agreement with the detection of later first arrival times when ϕ is modeled as heterogeneous and positively correlated to k see dashed curves in fig 4 hassan et al 1998 moreover the effect of porosity variability on m p increases for mildly heterogeneous aquifers i e σ y 2 1 as compared to an aquifer with higher y heterogeneity i e σ y 2 3 this is also in agreement with the work of hassan et al 1998 we also notice lower peak mass fluxes at the cp located further away from as i e at ζ 15 71 in red according to the fact that plume dispersion increases as the plume travels longer and samples more aquifer heterogeneity the results presented in figs 4 and 5 show the importance of incorporating the spatial variability in ϕ when predicting early arrival times and peak mass fluxes since the heterogeneity of the ϕ field impacts the plume macrodispersion we analyze the relative plume dispersion for the different scenarios investigated in the following section 4 1 2 4 1 2 relative plume dispersion the macro scale dispersive behavior of the solute plume under uniform or spatially random ϕ fields coupled with heterogeneous k realizations is additionally explored in fig 6 in the latter we present box plots of δτ defined as 15 δ τ t 95 t 5 t 95 t 95 is identified as the time of arrival of 95 of the initial injected mass m0 δτ can represent a measure of the relative plume dispersion since it quantifies the relative difference between the first i e t 5 and late arrival times i e t 95 of the tracer at the cps in fig 6 the green boxes indicate the results at the cp located at dimensionless distance ζ 4 29 whereas the red boxes refer to the outcomes at the cp situated at ζ 15 71 results at the additional cps being similar the thickness of the box plots equals the lag between the first and third quartiles of the probability distribution of δτ fig 6 a refers to σ y 2 1 whereas fig 6 b to σ y 2 3 when we compare the box plots of δτ for homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ for both cps locations and σ y 2 values we observe that δτ values are lower when ϕ is modeled as heterogeneous this is because as explained before the longitudinal dispersion of the plume decreases when ϕ is positively correlated to k leading to a smaller difference between first t 5 and late t 95 arrival times of the plume at the cps accordingly the range of δτ presents higher values for all scenarios homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ and different cps locations when σ y 2 3 i e under higher heterogeneity of the y field we observe a higher chance of fast flow channels which decrease t 5 as well as increased longitudinal dispersion finally in agreement with previous results the difference between the range of δτ values between the constant ϕ and heterogeneous ϕ cases increases for the cp located further away from the injection area red box plots for both levels of heterogeneity of y this confirms that the importance of modeling ϕ variability increases as the tracer travels longer through the heterogeneous aquifer domain 4 1 3 impact of connectivity on risk our analysis on the importance of accounting for ϕ spatial variability on the inert tracer transport statistics ends with analyzing the effect of aquifer connectivity on peak mass fluxes for the different scenarios considered previous results see figs 4 and 6 showed how heterogeneity in ϕ and k affected solute arrival times as a consequence these heterogeneities can be expected to impact flow connectivity we analyze here how k ϕ variability affects connectivity and its predictive capabilities on the peak mass flux at a given cp connectivity can be described by different metrics knudby and carrera 2005 rizzo and de barros 2017 and in line with the work of henri et al 2015 we employ a dynamic connectivity metric which depends on both groundwater flow and contaminant transport parameters knudby and carrera 2005 the selected connectivity metric indicated as ci is given by the ratio between the effective hydraulic conductivity keff and the geometric mean of k kg 16 c i k e f f k g 1 t 50 x c p x i n j ϕ k g j with t 50 being the time of arrival of 50 of the initial injected mass at the cp of interest the remaining parameters have been defined in table 2 note that the average ϕ value i e ϕ has been employed to compute ci for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous ϕ simulations in this analysis we identify the peak contaminant mass flux m p at the observation location i e cp as a measure of risk fig 7 shows scatter plots of dimensionless m p versus ci 16 every circle in fig 7 corresponds to a different mc realization and for simplicity only results at cps located at dimensionless distance ζ 1 in red and ζ 4 29 in green are reported as the observations at the remaining cps are similar full circles correspond to the outcome of considering homogeneous ϕ whereas empty circles indicate the output of more realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions fig 7 a refers to σ y 2 1 while fig 7 b reports the results of σ y 2 3 a linear regression between m p and ci is identified for both homogeneous full circles and heterogeneous empty circles ϕ fields cp location and σ y 2 value indeed under higher ci values corresponding to the presence of preferential flow channels ergo lower t 50 16 a higher chance of detecting higher m p values at the cps under investigation is identified we observe that the slope of the linear regression line whose equation is reported in gray for homogeneous ϕ and in black for heterogeneous ϕ is higher when ϕ is heterogeneous and positively correlated to k as compared to simplified homogeneous ϕ for both cps and for both levels of heterogeneity of y therefore under realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions and under the assumption that the k ϕ relationship can be described through the kc eq 1 an increased chance of observing higher m p i e having higher risk emerges as compared to constant ϕ conditions for the same ci value this could be attributed to the lower macro scale spreading dispersion of the contaminant plume under positive k ϕ correlation which results in higher m p at the sensitive location we also notice that a larger σ y 2 fig 6 b favors the formation of preferential channels hence higher ci values and corresponding m p values compare fig 7 a and b results at the remaining cps locations are similar and we generally observe a decrease of the coefficient of determination r 2 of the regression line between ci and m p values as the cp distance from as increases our results suggest that realistic heterogeneous ϕ conditions are associated with higher values of m p corresponding to higher health risk at sensitive locations therefore considering simplified constant ϕ conditions could be misleading i e lead to underestimated risks we also foresee that the effects of incorporating porosity variability on transport observables could potentially be emphasized in the presence of non gaussian k fields which present higher probability of well connected zones of high k values gómez hernández and wen 1998 henri et al 2015 for example the work of libera et al 2017b showed that higher solute peak concentrations are detected at extraction wells as the departure of the non gaussian y fields from a gaussian structure increases 4 2 analysis for reactive contaminants implications in increased lifetime cancer risk results in this section refer to the reactive contaminant transport simulations i e to the degradation chain of chlorinated solvents pce tce dce vc we analyze the statistics of the total increased lifetime cancer risk rt x 11 for the scenarios under investigation we first present the spatial distribution of the low order moments i e the ensemble mean and the coefficient of variation of rt and we then show the complete statistical characterization of the pdf of rt the outcomes of accounting for heterogeneous ϕ are represented with dashed lines while the results of constant ϕ are illustrated with solid lines in figs 8 10 the results of considering σ y 2 1 are pictured in magenta and the outcomes for σ y 2 3 are illustrated in blue 4 2 1 low order moments of rt x fig 8 shows the spatial evolution of the mean value of rt 11 denoted as rt over the ensemble of mc simulations when the peak concentration of the contaminant i at the cp fig 8 a or the maximum running averaged concentration over the ed time 10 fig 8 b is adopted to compute rt x rt x quantifies the expected threat to the exposed community we first notice that for the current numerical set up the formula adopted to compute the flux averaged contaminant concentration in eq 9 has only a very minor influence on the spatial evolution of rt compare fig 8 a and b we indeed notice that rt is just slightly lower when we employ the maximum running averaged concentration to compute the risk fig 8 b according to the fact that adopting the peak concentration represents the most conservative approach we observe that rt increases with cp distance since more toxic species are produced with time along the chemical degradation chain of pce henri et al 2015 in fig 8 a and b in fact cancer potency factors cpfi increase during the degradation of pce until vc is produced see table 1 in general the influence of heterogeneity on the mean ilcr is almost unnoticeable in fig 8 see dashed lines versus solid lines the fact that accounting for ϕ heterogeneity has only a small impact on rt x confirms that also in the presence of reactive contaminants the influence of incorporating ϕ variability depends on the metric of interest increasing the heterogeneity of the y field i e σ y 2 3 blue lines decreases the magnitude of the mean ilcr along the longitudinal direction because of enhanced dispersion of the plume and subsequent dilution at cps henri et al 2015 fig 9 shows the spatial evolution of the coefficient of variation of the total ilcr i e c v r t x we recall that c v r t x σ r t x r t x with σ r t x indicating the standard deviation of the total ilcr fig 9 a refers to the computation of rt x by considering the maximum contaminant concentration whereas fig 9 b shows the same results when the maximum ed flux averaged concentration 10 is adopted to compute rt x the coefficient of variation c v r t x measures the uncertainty associated with the risk estimate in agreement with what observed in fig 9 we also point out that the approach adopted to compute the flux averaged concentration in eq 9 does not influence the risk uncertainty and the differences between fig 9 a and b are imperceptible we note that this remark is applicable to the current numerical set up we generally observe that the spatial evolution of c v r t presents an inverse correlation with rt x in agreement with henri et al 2015 therefore we identify lower mean total ilcr and more uncertain risk predictions close to the source while we observe higher mean risk and lower risk uncertainty further away for all the simulated scenarios larger risk uncertainty close to the source is expected since the plume is mainly controlled by advection at that stage de barros et al 2009 our results indicate that accounting for the heterogeneity in ϕ affects the risk uncertainty indeed the positive correlation between ϕ and k leads to a reduction of the sample to sample fluctuation of the risk and therefore to a reduction of c v r t x for both levels of heterogeneity of the y field see dashed lines versus solid lines in both fig 9 a and b this effect is emphasized when σ y 2 3 the results presented in figs 8 and 9 show that the influence of ϕ heterogeneity is higher on risk uncertainty i e c v r t x fig 9 than on the mean total ilcr rt x fig 8 this can be justified by the fact that mean mass fluxes at large cps are not significantly affected by local fluctuations of the flow field as explained in fiori et al 2002 on the other hand the first order analysis provided in fiori et al 2002 and andričević and cvetković 1998 shows that the variance of the mass flux over a control plane is sensitive to local heterogeneity 4 2 2 pdf of rt we conclude the discussion on the influence of ϕ spatial heterogeneity on reactive transport by presenting the pdf of the ilcr in fig 10 the results in fig 10 refer to the computation of rt x by employing the maximum running averaged concentration over ed 10 results at the cp located at ζ 10 are reported in fig 10 a while the outcomes at ζ 15 71 are presented in fig 10 b the pdfs of rt present a similar gaussian like shape under constant or random ϕ these results are consistent with the findings of henri et al 2015 2016 we observe that the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on the pdf of the ilcr described below is more pronounced when the cp is situated closer to the source for the case of σ y 2 3 compare fig 10 a with b in general accounting for ϕ heterogeneity dashed pdfs only slightly influences the mean value of rt but significantly affects the uncertainty of rt we indeed notice that the rt pdf is less spread when the heterogeneity of ϕ is modeled as compared to assuming constant ϕ dashed pdfs versus solid pdfs in particular the probability of observing values of rt around rt increases of more than 30 when the variability of ϕ is included in models predictions for all scenarios considered except for the case of σ y 2 3 at the cp located at ζ 15 71 where this probability is around 20 higher under heterogeneous ϕ moreover the full risk pdfs show the probability of observing extreme values of rt we observe that modeling the ϕ heterogeneity has influence on both the highest and lowest values of rt and the probability of detecting extreme values of rt decreases in the presence of spatially variable ϕ 5 conclusions in this study we analyze the impact of the coupled spatial variability of ϕ and k on contaminant transport and probabilistic risk analysis we employ a monte carlo framework to statistically analyze key epms detected at observation locations we analyze the impact of ϕ heterogeneity on contaminant arrival times and peak mass fluxes of tracers at control planes as well as on risk and on connectivity we then show the implications of accounting for ϕ variability in probabilistic human health cancer risk analysis by considering human exposure to chlorinated solvents through the ingestion pathway our work leads to the following main key conclusions the positive correlation between ϕ and k leads to a decrease of the plume macrodispersion with consequent higher peak mass fluxes later first arrival times and earlier late arrivals at control planes higher peak mass fluxes correspond to higher health risk therefore including the spatial variability of ϕ in models predictions is essential for risk assessment associated with aquifer contamination and remediation moreover a more accurate quantification of early and late arrival times is fundamental to respectively detect the potential hazard of a contaminant and to control the end point of remediation see e g andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and rubin 2008 the relevance of incorporating the spatial variability of the ϕ field can depend on the metric of interest for example our study shows that this relevance is emphasized when investigating contaminants arrival times over peak mass fluxes at the observation control planes this has important implications both to set up modeling studies and in decision making processes e g in risk assessment or aquifer remediation activities in the context of a better allocation of resources indeed available resources need to be prioritized and assigned in a defensible manner to ensure that unacceptable identified risks are reduced to acceptable levels modeling the ϕ field spatial variability as positively correlated to the heterogeneous k field significantly reduces the cancer risk uncertainty but only minorly influences the mean value of the total cancer risk at control planes our findings constitute then an important contribution for cancer risk uncertainty quantification however adoptng more simplified and conservative models which assume homogeneous porosity does not highly impact the mean value of the total cancer risk we finally noticed that the effect of considering ϕ heterogeneity can be affected by the level of heterogeneity of the k field and by the source to cp distance we recall that the results of our work are limited to positive correlation between ϕ and k expressed through the kc eq 1 other empirical models can be adopted to compute the k ϕ relationship and could potentially lead to different conclusions furthermore other factors such as pumping operations libera et al 2017a and solute mass release rates at the source zone de barros 2018 can impact the relative importance of hydrogeological heterogeneity on a final note we emphasize that our work represents a first step towards a more comprehensive global sensitivity analysis gsa that could lead to more general conclusions using polynomial chaos expansion pce within a gsa can reduce the computational burden associated with monte carlo simulations utilizing pce to perform gsa would allow to better understand the relevance of heterogeneous porosity with respect to heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity under the context of risk pce based gsa was employed by different authors e g ciriello et al 2013a 2013b oladyshkin et al 2012 ciriello et al 2013a employed gsa to identify the influence of uncertain hydrogeological parameters on the first two statistical moments of the peak concentration ciriello et al 2013b applied a gsa through pce to three transport models to identify the relative importance of model dependent parameters the space time locations where the models are more sensitive to these parameters and to assist with parameters estimation oladyshkin et al 2012 illustrated their gsa approach based on arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion apc on a 3d groundwater quality and health risk problem in a heterogeneous aquifer incorporating a gsa through pce into the problem investigated in this work is topic of future research with the goal of reducing the computational burden normally associated with monte carlo simulations and to investigate the impact of considering different soil types on risk e g moore and doherty 2005 acknowledgments arianna

664,a hybrid local time step global maximum time step lts gmats method is proposed for computationally efficient modeling of hydro sediment morphodynamic processes the governing equations are numerically solved on unstructured triangular meshes using a well balanced shock capturing finite volume method with the hllc approximate riemann solver high computational efficiency is achieved by implementing the lts to solve equations governing sediment laden flows i e the hydro sediment part and implementing the gmats to solve equations governing bed materials i e the morphodynamic part two benchmark experimental dam break flows over erodible beds and one field case of the taipingkou waterway middle yangtze river are simulated to demonstrate the high computational efficiency and the satisfactory quantitative accuracy it is shown that the computational efficiency of the new model can be faster by an order of magnitude than a traditional model of similar type but implementing the global minimum time step gmits the satisfactory quantitative accuracy of the new model for the present cases is demonstrated by the negligible l2 norms of water level and bed elevation between the new model and the traditional model as compared to the l2 norms between the traditional model and the measured data keywords local time step global maximum time step computational efficiency hydro sediment morphological modeling finite volume method 1 introduction computationally efficient hydro sediment morphodynamic modeling is very important its development is essentially a balance between physical rigor and computational efficiency in the 1970s 1980s implicit numerical schemes such as the preissmann scheme cunge et al 1980 were adopted for relatively long term and large scale simulations approximately at the end of the 1980s the shock capturing finite volume methods which were originally developed for computational aerodynamics were extended to shallow water flow modeling e g tan 1999 toro 2001 afterward shock capturing finite volume shallow water models were extended from 1d to 2d from clear water to scalar transport or sediment laden flows from uniform to graded sediments from partial to full coupling hydro sediment morphodynamic interactions and from open channel flows to subaqueous turbidity currents e g borthwick and barber 1992 cao et al 2004 2006 2011 2016 begnudelli and sanders 2006 canestrelli et al 2009 heng et al 2009 hu and cao 2009 li and duffy 2011 li et al 2013 hu et al 2012 2014 2015 guan et al 2016 he et al 2017 qian et al 2017 however applications of hydro sediment morphodynamic models of this type are mostly constrained to relatively short term simulations or experimental conditions due to the high computational cost for example in a recent attempt to simulate the one year morphodynamic evolutional process of a meandering reach guan et al 2016 simulated only those flow discharges exceeding 30 m3 s and ignore effects of flow discharges below 30 m3 s in order to save computational cost pursuit for high efficiency computation has promoted parallel computing technology e g open mp open multi processing mpi message passing

2006 or masspeed carraro et al 2018 were proposed an alternative way is to design smarter strategies for variable updating using techniques such as the local time stepping e g osher and sanders 1983 dawson and kirby 2001 tan et al 2004 muller and stiriba 2007 crossley et al 2003 crossley and wright 2005 kesserwani and liang 2015 taking the advantages of the lts this paper aims to present a computationally efficient hydro sediment morphodynamic model for the purpose of relatively long term months to several years morphodynamic simulations due to the explicit feature of the shock capturing numerical scheme the time step is subject to constraints among those constraints the most challenging one is the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition it requires that the allowable time step for each computational cell be computed as δtami crri ci where cr is the courant number less than unity ri is a characteristic length of the cell i and c i max u i g h i u i u i g h i is the maximum wave celerity the subscript i indicates the sequence of the cell and nc represents the total number of computational cells ui and hi are water velocity and water depth of the cell i respectively g 9 8 m s2 is the gravitational acceleration a common practice in existing shock capturing hydro sediment morphodynamic models is to use a sufficiently small time step that ensures satisfaction of the cfl condition for all computational cells that is the global minimum value gδtgmi i e global minimum time step gmits 1 δ t g m i min δ t a m i min c r r i c i i 1 2 n c by gmits numerical solutions of those cells that have a larger δtami are updated with the global minimum time step δtgmi this is particularly time demanding when local refinement of the computational mesh is necessary by the idea of the local time stepping lts each cell are updated at their own allowable maximum time step which can save considerable computational cost crossley et al 2003 implemented a graded lts approach for solving one dimensional 1d shallow water equations sanders 2008 applied the graded local time step approach for solving two dimensional 2d shallow water equations the term graded means that the ratio between the local time step of an arbitrary cell and gmits is 2 a where the exponent a is an integer sanders 2008 recommended a graded level of four for idealized and practical applications as the lts may cause instability and deteriorate conservation at dam break flood wave tips dazzi et al 2016 applied the lts approach to 1d mixed flows in closed conduits using non uniform grids kesserwani and liang 2015 linked the graded level to the scales of spatial discretization and obtained satisfactory agreement between gmits and lts when the graded level is not large nevertheless these works are limited to clear water flow modeling a hydro sediment morphodynamic system differs from the hydrodynamic system in two aspects firstly more equations are to be solved including the mass conservation equations for sediment carried by the flow and the mass conservation equations for sediments static in the bed i e the bed deformation equation and the sediment gradation equation secondly interactions among the water flow sediment transport and bed morphological changes need to be considered this paper represents an extension of the lts technique to hydro sediment morphodynamic modeling specifically we propose a hybrid method that combines lts for the hydrodynamics with use of a global maximum time step gmats for the bed topography this combination is proposed due to potential numerical difficulties encounterd when the lts is applied to update bed topography for example the bed slope estimation of an arbitrary cell requires bed elevations of all neighboring cells at exactly the same time level which cannot be satisfied for the lts scheme the hybrid lts gmats is allowed due to the recognized opportunity to update bed topography less frequently than the hydrodynamics e g hudson et al 2005 cunge et al 1980 other basic features of the present model include the governing equations are discretized on unstructured triangular meshes by the finite volume method the intercell numerical fluxes are estimated by the hllc harten lax van leer contact approximate riemann solver such that the model is shock capturing toro 2001 the bed slope terms are estimated using the slope flux method proposed by hou et al 2013 to be well balanced with the hydrostatic pressure gradient the bed friction terms are estimated by the splitting point implicit method liang and marche 2009 section 2 presents the mathematical model section 3 gives numerical tests and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 governing equations from the perspective of sediment adaptation to capacity regime there are two modeling frameworks the capacity modeling framework that assumes sediment transport adapts to the capacity regime sufficiently rapidly and the non capacity modeling framework that appreciates the potential temporal and spatial lag between sediment transport and hydrodynamics that essentially determines the capacity regime recent theoretical and numerical comparisons have indicated that the non capacity modeling or the non equilibrium modeling as mentioned by wu 2007 which is physically more appealing may better represent the natural process cao et al 2011 2016 this paper chooses the non capacity modeling framework from the perspective of interactions between sediment transport and hydrodynamics the present paper chooses the increasingly recognized set of governing equations that fully account for the feedback impacts of bed deformation on flow evolution cao et al 2004 2006 2011 2016 hu et al 2014 the

internal triangular cells a triangular cell has three nodes three face edges and three neighboring cells fig 1a around a given node there are several cells of which the number is denoted by i n max fig 1b a face edge has two nodes and two neighboring cells fig 1c bed elevations are defined at nodes the arithmetic average bed elevation of the three constituent nodes is used for bed elevation at a given cell other physical variables are defined at the cell center the inverse distance interpolation method is applied to obtain physical variables at nodes if necessary physical parameters shown in fig 1 will be introduced when they appears in the mathematical formulations below 2 4 time step estimation for the hybrid lts gmats one firstly computes the locally allowable maximum time step δtami as follows 9 δ t a m i c r min j 1 2 3 r i j u i j 2 v i j 2 g h i where uij vij hi are the depth averaged flow velocities of jth edge and water depth at the cell i rij is the distance from cell i center to its jth edge by eq 9 δtami may become infinity for cells with static and very shallow water i e u 0 v 0 and h 0 if the water depth of a specific cell is smaller than 10 6 m δtami is set to the maximum value of those cells with water depth larger than 10 6 m secondly the potential graded lts level of each cell is computed sanders 2008 10 m i min int log δ t a m i δ t g m i log 2 m u s e r with the gmits δ t g m i min δ t a m i i 1 2 n c where muser is a user defined upper limit value setting muser 0 means the graded level of all cells are zero which will make the model equivalent to a gmits model thirdly the actual graded level mfj for cell faces and m i for cells are computed as follows 11a m f j min m j l m j r j 1 2 3 n f 11b m i min m i m i 1 m i 2 m i 3 i 1 2 3 n c where mjl and mjr represent the potential grade exponents of the two neighboring cells around the face j nf indicates the total number of faces m i1 m i2 m i3 represent the potential graded levels of the three neighboring cells of the cell i see fig 1a fourthly the model further modifies the lts level of neighboring cells that are characterized by abrupt flow regime changes i e the wet dry front the static dynamic front for such neighboring cells differences of m i may be larger than unity and correct propagation of waves may not be ensured hu et al 2019 specifically lts level of such neighboring cells are set to a locally minimum value crossley and wright 2005 proposed to modify the lts levels of neighboring cells once the differences of m i is larger than unity which is a more conservative treatment note the present model only modifies those areas featuring flow regime transitions such as a wet dry front or a static dynamic front the larger the differences of the lts levels of the neighboring cells the larger the number of cells has to be modified crossley and wright 2005 both the present modification and the more conservative modification by crossley and wright 2005 are tested and negligible influences on the numerical efficiency and accuracy were observed for the test cases presented in this paper finally the graded lts is computed as a power of two multiplied by the gmits 12a δ t l i 2 m i δ t g m i i 1 2 3 n c the gmats is computed as 12b δ t max δ t l i i 1 n c in presenting solutions a parameter m max is used to represent the maximum m i in the computational domain

the cell i with j 1 2 3 δlij is the length of the jth edge of the cell i the vector s s i of the source term for sediment erosion deposition are evaluated directly using empirical relations with flow variables at the time level as input the bed slope source term s b i is evaluated using the slope flux method hou et al 2013 with flow variables at the time level but bed elevations at the initial synchronized time level t 0 as input this is based on an assumption that the change in bed slopes is negligible within the global maximum time step such that the bed elevations are updated only once within δt therefore the two elements in the vector for bed slope are evaluated as follows 14a g h s b x i j 1 3 n x i j g h m j l h i z b m j z b i δ l i j 14b g h s b y i j 1 3 n y i j g h m j l h i z b m j z b i δ l i j where z b m j min z b m j w m j l and w h zb is the water level the bed friction source term is estimated using the splitting point implicit method liang and marche 2009 based on which the two elements in the vector of the friction source terms are evaluated as 15a s f x i c d h u h u 2 h v 2 h 2 δ t l i c d 2 h u 2 h v 2 h u 2 h v 2 15b s f y i c d h v h u 2 h v 2 h 2 δ t l i

immediately at the left and right side of the edge take the estimation of the outward normal advective numerical flux e nm at the edge m see fig 1c as an example it can be written as 17 e n m f h l l c u m l u m r where u m l u m r are the two riemann states of the physical variables at the left and right side of the edge m in the present model the first order method is used by setting u m l u m r equal to the values of the conserved variables at the cell center the specific expressions of the hllc solver can be found in many literatures toro 2001 and thus are not repeated here to ensure non negative water depth reconstruction the following modifications on the left and right riemann stages must be implemented before calling the hllc subroutine audusse et al 2004 he et al 2017 firstly the bed elevations at two sides are computed as follows 18a b z b m l w m l h m l z b m r w m r h m r secondly the water depth at two sides are modified as 19a b h m l max 0 w m l z b m h m r max 0 w m r z b m where z b m max z b m l z b m m for numerical fluxes e nij at external edges that coincide with the boundary of the computational domain i e boundary edges they are estimated by the definition i e e nij f nx g ny ij using values of the physical variables i e eqs 3 b c for the subcritical inflowing boundary edge the unit discharge and unit width sediment transport rate or the sediment concentration must be given the tangential velocity tangential to the edge is set to zero the water depth and the normal flow velocities are estimated by the method of characteristics for subcritical outlet boundary edge the water level or the stage discharge relation must be given the velocity tangential to the edge is also set to zero all other physical variables are computed by the method of characteristics for supercritical outlet boundary edge and a wall boundary edge all physical variables at the edge are set equal to values at the neighboring cell from eq 13 the mass conservation equations for sediments carried by the flow have been embedded into the approach of the lts one may propose to treat eqs 4 5 in a way exactly the same as the mass conservation equations for sediments carried by the flow this however may result in neighboring cells updating their bed elevations at different time steps this is contradictive to the requirement that the bed slope source terms eqs 14a 14b must be estimated using bed elevations of neighboring cells at the same time it is therefore assumed that the change in bed slopes is negligible within the global maximum time step such that the bed elevations are updated only once within δt it may be acceptable because advection terms are not involved in eqs 4 5 indicating that their numerical integrations are not subject to the cfl constraint this assumption is supported by the high quantitative accuracy of the present model shown later as well as previous understandings on the possibilities of updating hydrodynamics and bed topography with different time steps cunge et al 1980 hudson et al 2005 nevertheless it should be noted that near quasi steady and critical flow conditions there might be strong coupling between the sediment bed and the flows lyn and altinakar 2002 castro et al 2008 canestrelli et al 2009 for such conditions a systematic test of the present hybird lts gmats is reserved for future study in this paper very unsteady flow processes are tested the resultant numerical discretizations are as follows 20a z b t 0 δ t z b t 0 δ t l i s c 1 n p d t s c e t s c 1 p o 20b δ f a k t 0 δ t δ f a k t 0 δ t

corresponding sub cycles of the hydro sediment updating see fig 2 this is important to ensure mass conservation of the model the net sediment flux entering into the flow must be exactly equal to the net sediment flux leaving the bed in case for a cell at an arbitrary sub cycle there is no need to compute the hydro sediment equations i e m i l s s c see fig 2 the corresponding entrainment and deposition fluxes would take the default value of zero 2 6 numerical structure a numerical structure is provided in fig 2 starting from t 0 a full cycle of the hybrid lts gmats comprise three steps time step estimation the hydro sediment updating using lts and the morphodynamic updating using gmats in the time step estimation eqs 9 12 are implemented in the morphodynamic updating eqs 20a 20b are

new model that uses the hybrid lts gmats as compared to a traditional model of similar type but using the gmits two classical benchmark cases of experimental dam break flows over erodible and dry beds and one field case are considered including case 1 experimental full dam break flow in an abruptly widening channel case 2 experimental partial dam break flow in a straight channel and case 3 sediment laden flows and morphological changes in the taipingkou waterway middle reach of the yangtze river the computational cost of the new model is scaled by that of the traditional model leading to a parameter of the relative computational time tr the traditional model can be obtained by setting m u s e r 0 in the code of the new model the computational cost of a such traditional model may be slightly different from a standard gmits model due to the computational overhead of those codes related to lts numerical tests show that this computational overhead only accounts for 1 2 moreover a speeding up factor is also presented which is computed as 1 tr for convenience in presentation a summary of the computational efficiency of the new model is given in table 1 it is obvious that the application of the new model leads to significant reductions in the computational cost generally larger m max leads to more reduction for case 1 cell size 0 01 0 03 m a reduction as high as 77 equivalent to a four times speedup tr 0 23 was obtained for m max 3 further increase of the graded level leads to only mild reduction in the computational cost for case 2 cell size 0 05 0 14 m a reduction as high as 85 equivalent to a speeding up factor of 6 7 tr 0 15 have been obtained for m max 6 for case 3 cell size 17 3 167 m a reduction as high as 82 equivalent to a speeding up factor of 5 6 tr 0 18 have been obtained for m max 6 practically the maximum extent of reduction in the computational cost depends on the nonuniformities of both the cell sizes and the flow strengths this is supported by case 2 with locally refined grids and case 3 with locally refined mesh around bridge piers table 1 descriptions about the reductions in the computational cost will not be repeated below

variations of the l2 norms for the water level and bed elevation the following are observed firstly the new model reproduces numerical solutions of negligible difference as compared to the traditional model figs 4 7 in particular the magnitudes of the l2 norms between the new model and the traditional model which represents the relative errors introduced by using larger time steps are about 10 5 10

traditional model and the measured data about 5 10 3 m see fig 7b secondly numerical solutions agree reasonably well with the measured data this is not surprising at all because empirical parameters have been well calibrated in previous studies spinewine and zech 2007 wu et al 2012 li et al 2013 as the dam break flow bore propagates downstream water depths at gauges p1 p2 p3 p4 and p6 undergoes a

downstream of the lock gate and round the right side of the enlargement cross section downstream of which a stripe of deposition can be seen fig 5 there are also some differences between the numerical solutions and the measured data such differences should be attributed to uncertainties of empirical parameters limitations of and assumptions involved in the depth averaged modeling method which is

new model the l2 norm for the water level is below 10 3 m and that for the bed elevation is less than 10 4 m such discrepancies are negligible as compared to the magnitude of water depth approximately 0 18 m in average fig 9 and bed deformation depth approximately in the magnitude of centimeters fig 10 in fig 10 two sets of measured data are presented the same experiment was done twice the difference between the two sets of measured data indicate uncertianties of experiment as compared to the measured data the new model achieves the same extent of reliability as the traditional models that use gmits 3 3 case 3 sediment laden flows and morphological changes in taipingkou waterway the taipingkou waterway which is a reach of about 18 km long and 1 5 km wide in the middle yangtze river fig 12 a was experiencing very poor navigational conditions in the last decade figuring out what may have caused the poor navigational condition requires means of relatively long term 1 2 years simulations of hydro sediment morphodynamic processes the present new model with the hybrid lts gmats has been applied to this waterway for a systematic numerical study here we choose the simulation of the 2012 process to demonstrate the advantage of the present model bed elevations measured in february of 2012 are used as the initial bed topography fig 12a shown in fig 12 b is the unstructured triangular mesh which includes 14 598 cells and 7574 nodes with the cell sizes ranges from 17 3 167 3 m initial bed material gradations considering six sediment sizes i e nsps 6 are linearly interpolated from the measured data at five cross sections i e 1 2 1 sw5 sw6 5 see fig 12a the resultant spatial distribution of the d 50 is shown in fig 12 c shown in fig 12 d are the measured water discharge and sediment concentrations from february 17th to october 5th of 2012 at shashi station about 3 km upstream of the outlet boundary which are specified as upstream boundary condition it is physically reasonable for flow discharge because it varies little along the distance nevertheless using the measured sediment concentrations from shashi station at the inlet may introduce some extent of uncertainty because sediment transport rates may vary appreciably along the distance there is no second choice and one has to assume that effects of sediment erosion deposition on sediment transport rates are not significant along this short distance shown in fig 12 e is the downstream stage discharge relation curve the manning roughness n is calibrated to be 0 02 in the computation by comparisons between computed and measured cross sectional velocity water level profiles along the distance the size specific sediment transport capacity is computed by the zhang 1961 formula 23 c e k

35 m above sea level of the taipingkou waterway a the measured data and b c the computed results at august 4th 2012 and at the end of the simulation contours of bed elevation 29 35 m above sea level at different times indicate evolutional trend of main central and point bars fig 14 illustrates the computed and measured bed deformation depth between february and october of 2012 a the measured data and b c the computed results fig 15 gives the time variations of the l2 norms for water level water depth and bed deformation depth between the new model with m max 7 and the traditional model also included is the l2 norm between the measured and computed bed elevation the following are observed firstly the new model fig 13 c fig 14 c again produces numerical solutions of negligible differences as compared to the traditional model fig 13b fig 14b for this field scale case specifically the l2 norm for water depth between the new and traditional models is around 10 4 m and the l2 norm for bed elevation between the new and traditional models is around 10 3 m secondly as compared to the measured data the numerical model can reproduce well the main spatial patterns of erosion and deposition to elaborate such patterns clearly a series of symbols have been placed in figs 13 and 14 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 p1 and p2 c1 indicates the taipingkou central bar c2 indicates the sanba central bar e1 and d1 indicates the erosion and deposition areas of the left bank point bar p1 i e the yanglinji point bar e2 and d2 indicates the erosion and deposition areas of the right bank point bar p2 i e the lalinzhou point bar the main evolutional trend of the central point bars of this reach can be observed from figs 13 and 14 the first trend is the downstream movement of the left bank yanglinji point bar fig 13 which is due to sediment erosion at its upstream part e1 region fig 14 and deposition at its downstream part d1 region fig 14 the second trend is the flattening of the right bank lalinzhou point bar which is due to sediment erosion at its upstream left part e2 region fig 14 and deposition at its immediate downstream part d2 region fig 14 these two trends play important roles in shaping the navigation conditions of this waterway on the one hand the downstream movement of the left side yanglinji point bar narrows the inlet width of the north branch on the other hand the flattening of the right bank lalinzhou point bar facilitates water flushing in the south branch these two consequences together have led to deterioration of the navigation conditions of the north branch since 2012 it can be seen from figs 13 and 14 that the numerical model have reasonably well reproduced the above mentioned phenomena thirdly there are some discrepancies between the computed and measured data for example the evolutional trend of the upstream central bar c1 i e the taipingkou central bar is not reproduced well on the one hand the measured data show that there are erosion in the north trough and deposition in the south trough of the taipingkou central bar figs 13a 14a on the other hand the computed results show an opposite trend fig 13 b c figs 14 b c this is understandable because this region is close to the inlet boundary and thus subject to high sensitivity to inlet boundary condition for the yangtze river of over 6300 km long it is impossible at least for nowadays to arrange gauge stations at every cross sections to measure the daily discharge and sediment transport rates field case studies will encounter such situations of insufficient data abundance nevertheless the present numerical case studies of the taipingkou waterway indicates that with the present data availability i e existence of a gauge within the reach though not exactly at the inlet boundary it is likely to have these main patterns and trends captured well by numerical models 4 conclusions a numerical method is presented for computationally efficient shock capturing solutions of relatively long term two dimensional hydro sediment morphodynamic equations on an unstructured grid the numerical method combines a local time stepping scheme lts for the hydrodynamic equations with a globally maximum time stepping scheme gmats for the bed evolution equations and the hybrid lts gmats method is shown to significantly reduce run times compared to a model that uses a globally minimum time step gmits for both the hydrodynamic and bed evolution equations without loss of accuracy for the test cases presented in this paper the degree of run time reductions varies with applications and depends on the amount of gradation in the computational grid as well as variability in the flow and morphodynamics in this study an order of magnitude reduction in run time was achieved based on the test cases considered it is expected that the present hybrid lts gmats method if combined with parallel computing strategy e g mpi gpu can give even more reductions in the computational cost

664,a hybrid local time step global maximum time step lts gmats method is proposed for computationally efficient modeling of hydro sediment morphodynamic processes the governing equations are numerically solved on unstructured triangular meshes using a well balanced shock capturing finite volume method with the hllc approximate riemann solver high computational efficiency is achieved by implementing the lts to solve equations governing sediment laden flows i e the hydro sediment part and implementing the gmats to solve equations governing bed materials i e the morphodynamic part two benchmark experimental dam break flows over erodible beds and one field case of the taipingkou waterway middle yangtze river are simulated to demonstrate the high computational efficiency and the satisfactory quantitative accuracy it is shown that the computational efficiency of the new model can be faster by an order of magnitude than a traditional model of similar type but implementing the global minimum time step gmits the satisfactory quantitative accuracy of the new model for the present cases is demonstrated by the negligible l2 norms of water level and bed elevation between the new model and the traditional model as compared to the l2 norms between the traditional model and the measured data keywords local time step global maximum time step computational efficiency hydro sediment morphological modeling finite volume method 1 introduction computationally efficient hydro sediment morphodynamic modeling is very important its development is essentially a balance between physical rigor and computational efficiency in the 1970s 1980s implicit numerical schemes such as the preissmann scheme cunge et al 1980 were adopted for relatively long term and large scale simulations approximately at the end of the 1980s the shock capturing finite volume methods which were originally developed for computational aerodynamics were extended to shallow water flow modeling e g tan 1999 toro 2001 afterward shock capturing finite volume shallow water models were extended from 1d to 2d from clear water to scalar transport or sediment laden flows from uniform to graded sediments from partial to full coupling hydro sediment morphodynamic interactions and from open channel flows to subaqueous turbidity currents e g borthwick and barber 1992 cao et al 2004 2006 2011

applications of hydro sediment morphodynamic models of this type are mostly constrained to relatively short term simulations or experimental conditions due to the high computational cost for example in a recent attempt to simulate the one year morphodynamic evolutional process of a meandering reach guan et al 2016 simulated only those flow discharges exceeding 30 m3 s and ignore effects of flow

dawson and kirby 2001 tan et al 2004 muller and stiriba 2007 crossley et al 2003 crossley and wright 2005 kesserwani and liang 2015 taking the advantages of the lts this paper aims to present a computationally efficient hydro sediment morphodynamic model for the purpose of relatively long term months to several years morphodynamic simulations due to the explicit feature of the shock capturing numerical scheme the time step is subject to constraints among those constraints the most challenging one is the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition it requires that the allowable time

numerical solutions of those cells that have a larger δtami are updated with the global minimum time step δtgmi this is particularly time demanding when local refinement of the computational mesh is necessary by the idea of the local time stepping lts each cell are updated at their own allowable maximum time step which can save considerable computational cost crossley et al 2003 implemented a graded lts approach for solving one dimensional 1d shallow water equations sanders 2008 applied the graded local time step approach for solving two dimensional 2d shallow water equations the term graded means that the ratio between the local time step of an arbitrary cell and gmits is 2 a where the exponent a is an integer sanders 2008 recommended a graded level of four for idealized and practical applications as the lts may cause instability and deteriorate conservation at dam break flood wave tips dazzi et al 2016 applied the lts approach to 1d mixed flows in closed conduits using non uniform grids kesserwani and liang 2015 linked the graded level to the scales of spatial discretization and obtained satisfactory agreement between gmits and lts when the graded level is not large nevertheless these works are limited to clear water flow modeling a hydro sediment morphodynamic system differs from the hydrodynamic system in two aspects firstly more equations are to be solved including the mass conservation equations for sediment carried by the flow and the mass conservation equations for sediments static in the bed i e the bed deformation equation and the sediment gradation equation secondly interactions among the water flow sediment transport and bed morphological changes need to be considered this paper represents an extension of the lts technique to hydro sediment morphodynamic modeling specifically we propose a hybrid method that combines lts for the hydrodynamics with use of a global maximum time step gmats for the bed topography this combination is proposed due to potential numerical difficulties encounterd when the lts is applied to update bed topography for example the bed slope estimation of an arbitrary cell requires bed elevations of all neighboring cells at exactly the same time level which cannot be satisfied for the lts scheme the hybrid lts gmats is allowed due to the recognized opportunity to update bed topography less frequently than the hydrodynamics e g hudson et al 2005 cunge et al 1980 other basic features of the present model include the governing equations are discretized on unstructured triangular meshes by the finite volume method the intercell numerical fluxes are estimated by the hllc harten lax van leer contact approximate riemann solver such that the model is shock capturing toro 2001 the bed slope terms are estimated using the slope flux method proposed by hou et al 2013 to be well balanced with the hydrostatic pressure gradient the bed friction terms are estimated by the splitting point implicit method liang and marche 2009 section 2 presents the mathematical model section 3 gives numerical tests and conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 mathematical formulations 2 1 governing equations from the perspective of sediment adaptation to capacity regime there are two modeling frameworks the capacity modeling framework that assumes sediment transport adapts to the capacity regime sufficiently rapidly and the non capacity modeling framework that appreciates the potential temporal and spatial lag between sediment transport and hydrodynamics that essentially determines the capacity regime recent theoretical and numerical comparisons have indicated that the non capacity modeling or the non equilibrium modeling as mentioned by wu 2007 which is physically more appealing may better represent the natural process cao et al 2011 2016 this paper chooses the non capacity modeling framework from the perspective of interactions between sediment transport and hydrodynamics the present paper chooses the increasingly recognized set of governing equations that fully account for the feedback impacts of bed deformation on flow evolution cao et al 2004 2006 2011 2016 hu et al 2014 the depth averaged 2d governing equations for sediment laden flows over mobile beds are presented as follows 2 u t f x g y s s s b s f 3a b c u h h u h v h c k f h u h u 2 g h 2 2 h u v h u c k g h v h u

internal triangular cells a triangular cell has three nodes three face edges and three neighboring cells fig 1a around a given node there are several cells of which the number is denoted by i n max fig 1b a face edge has two nodes and two neighboring cells fig 1c bed elevations are defined at nodes the arithmetic average bed elevation of the three constituent nodes is used for bed elevation at a given cell other physical variables are defined at the cell center the inverse distance interpolation method is applied to obtain physical variables at nodes if necessary physical parameters shown in fig 1 will be introduced when they appears in the mathematical formulations below 2 4 time step estimation for the hybrid lts gmats one firstly computes the locally allowable maximum time step δtami as follows 9 δ t a m i c r min j 1 2 3 r i j u i j 2 v i j 2 g h i where uij vij hi are the depth averaged flow velocities of jth edge and water depth at the cell i rij is the distance from cell i center to its jth edge by eq 9 δtami may become infinity for cells with static and very shallow water i e u 0 v 0 and h 0 if the water depth of a specific cell is smaller than 10 6 m δtami is set to the maximum value of those cells with water depth larger than 10 6 m secondly the potential graded lts level of each cell is computed sanders 2008 10 m i min int log δ t a m i δ t g m i log 2 m u s e r with the gmits δ t g m i min δ t a m i i 1 2 n c where muser is a user defined upper limit value setting muser 0 means the graded level of all cells are zero which will make the model equivalent to a gmits model thirdly the actual graded level mfj for cell faces and m i for cells are computed as follows 11a m f j min m j l m j r j 1 2 3 n f 11b m i min m i m i 1 m i 2 m i 3 i 1 2 3 n c where mjl and mjr represent the potential grade exponents of the two neighboring cells around the face j nf indicates the total number of faces m i1 m i2 m i3 represent the potential graded levels of the three neighboring cells of the cell i see fig 1a fourthly the model further modifies the lts level of neighboring cells that are characterized by abrupt flow regime changes i e the wet dry front the static dynamic front for such neighboring cells differences of m i may be larger than unity and correct propagation of waves may not be ensured hu et al 2019 specifically lts level of such neighboring cells are set to a locally minimum value crossley and wright 2005 proposed to modify the lts levels of neighboring cells once the differences of m i is larger than unity which is a more conservative treatment note the present model only modifies those areas featuring flow regime transitions such as a wet dry front or a static dynamic front the larger the differences of the lts levels of the neighboring cells the larger the number of cells has to be modified crossley and wright 2005 both the present modification and the more conservative modification by crossley and wright 2005 are tested and negligible influences on the numerical efficiency and accuracy were observed for the test cases presented in this paper finally the graded lts is computed as a power of two multiplied by the gmits 12a δ t l i 2 m i δ t g m i i 1 2 3 n c the gmats is computed as 12b δ t max δ t l i i 1 n c in presenting solutions a parameter m max is used to represent the maximum m i in the computational domain and throughout the simulation time m max max m i i 1 n c t 0 t max where t max is the simulation time 2 5 finite volume discretization using the hybrid lts gmats a finite volume discretization of eqs 2 3 using the lts on the triangular cell i gives 13 u i u i δ t l i a i j 1 3 e n i j δ l i j δ t l i s s i s b i s f i where the superscripts and represents two consecutive sub time levels between t 0 and t 0 δt ai is the area of the cell i e nij f nx g ny ij is the numerical flux crossing the j th face edge of the cell i n ij nx ny ij represents the normal outward direction of the jth edge of the cell i with j 1 2 3 δlij is the length of the jth edge of the cell i the vector s s i of the source term for sediment erosion deposition are evaluated directly using empirical relations with flow variables at the time level as input the bed slope source term s b i is evaluated using the slope flux method hou et al 2013 with flow variables at the time level but bed elevations at the initial synchronized time level t 0 as input this is based on an assumption that the change in bed slopes is negligible within the global maximum time step such that the bed elevations are updated only once within δt therefore the two elements in the vector for bed slope are evaluated as follows 14a g h s b x i j 1 3 n x i j g h m j l h i z b m j z b i δ l i j 14b g h s b y i j 1 3 n y i j g h m j l h i z b m j z b i δ l i j where z b m j min z b m j w m j l and w h zb is the water level the bed friction source term is estimated using the splitting point implicit method liang and marche 2009 based on which the two elements in the vector of the friction source terms are evaluated as 15a s f x i c d h u h u 2 h v 2 h 2 δ t l i c d 2 h u 2 h v 2 h u 2 h v 2 15b s f y i c d h v h u 2 h v 2 h 2 δ t l i

y i h v δ t l i v 0 min s f y i h v δ t l i v 0 for numerical fluxes e nij at internal edges between two neighboring cells the hllc approximate riemann solver is adopted using physical variables immediately at the left and right side of the edge take the estimation of the outward normal advective numerical flux e nm at the edge m see fig 1c as an example it can be written as 17 e n m f h l l c u m l u m r where u m l u m r are the two riemann states of the physical variables at the left and right side of the edge m in the present model the first order method is used by setting u m l u m r equal to the values of the conserved variables at the cell center the specific expressions of the hllc solver can be found in many literatures toro 2001 and thus are not repeated here to ensure non negative water depth reconstruction the following modifications on the left and right riemann stages must be implemented before calling the hllc subroutine audusse et al 2004 he et al 2017 firstly the bed elevations at two sides are computed as follows 18a b z b m l w m l h m l z b m r w m r h m r secondly the water depth at two sides are modified as 19a b h m l max 0 w m l z b m h m r max 0 w m r z b m where z b m max z b m l z b m m for numerical fluxes e nij at external edges that coincide with the boundary of the computational domain i e boundary edges they are estimated by the definition i e e nij f nx g ny ij using values of the physical variables i e eqs 3 b c for the subcritical inflowing boundary edge the unit discharge and unit width sediment transport rate or the sediment concentration must be given the tangential velocity tangential to the edge is set to zero the water depth and the normal flow velocities are estimated by the method of characteristics for subcritical outlet boundary edge the water level or the stage discharge relation must be given the velocity tangential to the edge is also set to zero all other physical variables are computed by the method of characteristics for supercritical outlet boundary edge and a wall boundary edge all physical variables at the edge are set equal to values at the neighboring cell from eq 13 the mass conservation equations for sediments carried by the flow have been embedded into the approach of the lts one may propose to treat eqs 4 5 in a way exactly the same as the mass conservation equations for sediments carried by the flow this however may result in neighboring cells updating their bed elevations at different time steps this is contradictive to the requirement that the bed slope source terms eqs 14a 14b must be estimated using bed elevations of neighboring cells at the same time it is therefore assumed that the change in bed slopes is negligible within the global maximum time step such that the bed elevations are updated only once within δt it may be acceptable because advection terms are not involved in eqs 4 5 indicating that their numerical integrations are not subject to the cfl constraint this assumption is supported by the high quantitative accuracy of the present model shown later as well as previous understandings on the possibilities of updating hydrodynamics and bed topography with different time steps cunge et al 1980 hudson et al 2005 nevertheless it should be noted that near quasi steady and critical flow conditions there might be strong coupling between the sediment bed and the flows lyn and altinakar 2002 castro et al 2008 canestrelli et al 2009 for such conditions a systematic test of the present hybird lts gmats is reserved for future study in this paper very unsteady flow processes are tested the resultant numerical discretizations are as follows 20a z b t 0 δ t z b t 0 δ t l i s c 1 n p d t s c e t s c 1 p o 20b δ f a k t 0 δ t δ f a k t 0 δ t l i s c 1 n p d k s c e k s c 1 p o δ t l i f s k s c 1 n p d t s c e t s c 1 p o the additional subscript sc indicates that the values of the entrainment and deposition fluxes are computed at the corresponding sub cycles of the hydro sediment updating see fig 2 this is important to ensure mass conservation of the model the net sediment flux entering into the flow must be exactly equal to the net sediment flux leaving the bed in case for a cell at an arbitrary sub cycle there is no need to compute the hydro sediment equations i e m i l s s c see fig 2 the corresponding entrainment and deposition fluxes would take the default value of zero 2 6 numerical structure a numerical structure is provided in fig 2 starting from t 0 a full cycle of the hybrid lts gmats comprise three steps time step estimation the hydro sediment updating using lts and the morphodynamic updating using gmats in the time step estimation eqs 9 12 are implemented in the morphodynamic updating eqs 20a 20b are implemented in the hydro sediment updating the gmats is divided into np δt δtgmi sub cycles and the symbol sc indicates the sequence where s c 1 2 n p the key lies in the judgment of whether flux estimation and solution updating of a specific cell are necessary in a given sub cycle sanders 2008 provided simple and convenient criterions whether flux estimation is necessary depends on whether the ratio s c 1 2 m j is an integer whether solution updating is necessary depends on the condition of m i l s s c where ls sc depends on both the sequence of the cycle sc and the value of m i 21 l s

new model that uses the hybrid lts gmats as compared to a traditional model of similar type but using the gmits two classical benchmark cases of experimental dam break flows over erodible and dry beds and one field case are considered including case 1 experimental full dam break flow in an abruptly widening channel case 2 experimental partial dam break flow in a straight channel and case 3 sediment laden flows and morphological changes in the taipingkou waterway middle reach of the yangtze river the computational cost of the new model is scaled by that of the traditional model leading to a parameter of the relative computational time tr the traditional model can be obtained by setting m u s e r 0 in the code of the new model the computational cost of a such traditional model may be slightly different from a standard gmits model due to the computational overhead of those codes related to lts numerical tests show that this computational overhead only accounts for 1 2 moreover a speeding up factor is also presented which is computed as 1 tr for convenience in presentation a summary of the computational efficiency of the new model is given in table 1 it is obvious that the application of the new model leads to significant reductions in the computational cost generally larger m max leads to more reduction for case 1 cell size 0 01 0 03 m a reduction as high as 77 equivalent to a four times speedup tr 0 23 was obtained for m max 3 further increase of the graded level leads to only mild reduction in the computational cost for case 2 cell size 0 05 0 14 m a reduction as high as 85 equivalent to a speeding up factor of 6 7 tr 0 15 have been obtained for m max 6 for case 3 cell size 17 3 167 m a reduction as high as 82 equivalent to a speeding up factor of 5 6 tr 0 18 have been obtained for m max 6 practically the maximum extent of reduction in the computational cost depends on the nonuniformities of both the cell sizes and the flow strengths this is supported by case 2 with locally refined grids and case 3 with locally refined mesh around bridge piers table 1 descriptions about the reductions in the computational cost will not be repeated below

variations of the l2 norms for the water level and bed elevation the following are observed firstly the new model reproduces numerical solutions of negligible difference as compared to the traditional model figs 4 7 in particular the magnitudes of the l2 norms between the new model and the traditional model which represents the relative errors introduced by using larger time steps are about 10 5 10 4 m such magnitudes are negligible as compared to 1 the magnitude of water depth approximately 0 1 m fig 4 and bed deformation depth approximately 0 01 m figs 5 and 6 and 2 the l2 norms between the traditional model and the measured data about 5 10 3 m see fig 7b secondly numerical solutions agree reasonably well with the measured data this is not surprising at all because empirical parameters have been well calibrated in previous studies spinewine and zech 2007 wu et al 2012 li et al 2013 as the dam break flow bore propagates downstream water depths at gauges p1 p2 p3 p4 and p6 undergoes a rapid increase firstly and decreases gradually for the gauge p5 at the corner of the enlarged cross section increase of the water depth experiences a relatively long duration intense erosion occurs downstream of the lock gate and round the right side of the enlargement cross section downstream of which a stripe of deposition can be seen fig 5 there are also some differences between the numerical solutions and the measured data such differences should be attributed to uncertainties of empirical parameters limitations of and assumptions involved in the depth averaged modeling method which is not the focus of the present paper 3 2 case 2 partial dam break 2d flow in a straight channel as seen in fig 8 the flume is 3 6 m wide and about 36 m long the initial water level on the left is 0 47 m

new model the l2 norm for the water level is below 10 3 m and that for the bed elevation is less than 10 4 m such discrepancies are negligible as compared to the magnitude of water depth approximately 0 18 m in average fig 9 and bed deformation depth approximately in the magnitude of centimeters fig 10 in fig 10 two sets of measured data are presented the same experiment was done twice the difference between the two sets of measured data indicate uncertianties of experiment as compared to the measured data the new model achieves the same extent of reliability as the traditional models that use gmits 3 3 case 3 sediment laden flows and morphological changes in taipingkou waterway the taipingkou waterway which is a reach of about 18 km long and 1 5 km wide in the middle yangtze river fig 12 a was experiencing very poor navigational conditions in the last decade figuring out what may have caused the poor navigational condition requires means of relatively long term 1 2 years simulations of hydro sediment morphodynamic processes the present new model with the hybrid lts gmats has been applied to this waterway for a systematic numerical study here we choose the simulation of the 2012 process to demonstrate the advantage of the present model bed elevations measured in february of 2012 are used as the initial bed topography fig 12a shown in fig 12 b is the unstructured triangular mesh which includes 14 598 cells and 7574 nodes with the cell sizes ranges from 17 3 167 3 m initial bed material gradations considering six sediment sizes i e nsps 6 are linearly interpolated from the measured data at five cross sections i e 1 2 1 sw5 sw6 5 see fig 12a the resultant spatial distribution of the d 50 is shown in fig 12 c shown in fig 12 d are the measured water discharge and sediment concentrations from february 17th to october 5th of 2012 at shashi station about 3 km upstream of the outlet boundary which are specified as upstream boundary condition it is physically reasonable for flow discharge because it varies little along the distance nevertheless using the measured sediment concentrations from shashi station at the inlet may introduce some extent of uncertainty because sediment transport rates may vary appreciably along the distance there is no second choice and one has to assume that effects of sediment erosion deposition on sediment transport rates are not significant along this short distance shown in fig 12 e is the downstream stage discharge relation curve the manning roughness n is calibrated to be 0 02 in the computation by comparisons between computed and measured cross sectional velocity water level profiles along the distance the size specific sediment transport capacity is computed by the zhang 1961 formula 23 c e k 0 12 u 2 v 2 1 5 g h ω k 0 92 a systematic study on uncertainties of empirical parameters and the extent of data abundance is not the focus of this paper fig 13 presents contours of bed elevation 29 35 m above sea level of the taipingkou waterway a the measured data and b c the computed results at august 4th 2012 and at the end of the simulation contours of bed elevation 29 35 m above sea level at different times indicate evolutional trend of main central and point bars fig 14 illustrates the computed and measured bed deformation depth between february and october of 2012 a the measured data and b c the computed results fig 15 gives the time variations of the l2 norms for water level water depth and bed deformation depth between the new model with m max 7 and the traditional model also included is the l2 norm between the measured and computed bed elevation the following are observed firstly the new model fig 13 c fig 14 c again produces numerical solutions of negligible differences as compared to the traditional model fig 13b fig 14b for this field scale case specifically the l2 norm for water depth between the new and traditional models is around 10 4 m and the l2 norm for bed elevation between the new and traditional models is around 10 3 m secondly as compared to the measured data the numerical model can reproduce well the main spatial patterns of erosion and deposition to elaborate such patterns clearly a series of symbols have been placed in figs 13 and 14 c1 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2 p1 and p2 c1 indicates the taipingkou central bar c2 indicates the sanba central bar e1 and d1 indicates the erosion and deposition areas of the left bank point bar p1 i e the yanglinji point bar e2 and d2 indicates the erosion and deposition areas of the right bank point bar p2 i e the lalinzhou point bar the main evolutional trend of the central point bars of this reach can be observed from figs 13 and 14 the first trend is the downstream movement of the left bank yanglinji point bar fig 13 which is due to sediment erosion at its upstream part e1 region fig 14 and deposition at its downstream part d1 region fig 14 the second trend is the flattening of the right bank lalinzhou point bar which is due to sediment erosion at its upstream left part e2 region fig 14 and deposition at its immediate downstream part d2 region fig 14 these two trends play important roles in shaping the navigation conditions of this waterway on the one hand the downstream movement of the left side yanglinji point bar narrows the inlet width of the north branch on the other hand the flattening of the right bank lalinzhou point bar facilitates water flushing in the south branch these two consequences together have led to deterioration of the navigation conditions of the north branch since 2012 it can be seen from figs 13 and 14 that the numerical model have reasonably well reproduced the above mentioned phenomena thirdly there are some discrepancies between the computed and measured data for example the evolutional trend of the upstream central bar c1 i e the taipingkou central bar is not reproduced well on the one hand the measured data show that there are erosion in the north trough and deposition in the south trough of the taipingkou central bar figs 13a 14a on the other hand the computed results show an opposite trend fig 13 b c figs 14 b c this is understandable because this region is close to the inlet boundary and thus subject to high sensitivity to inlet boundary condition for the yangtze river of over 6300 km long it is impossible at least for nowadays to arrange gauge stations at every cross sections to measure the daily discharge and sediment transport rates field case studies will encounter such situations of insufficient data abundance nevertheless the present numerical case studies of the taipingkou waterway indicates that with the present data availability i e existence of a gauge within the reach though not exactly at the inlet boundary it is likely to have these main patterns and trends captured well by numerical models 4 conclusions a numerical method is presented for computationally efficient shock capturing solutions of relatively long term two dimensional hydro sediment morphodynamic equations on an unstructured grid the numerical method combines a local time stepping scheme lts for the hydrodynamic equations with a globally maximum time stepping scheme gmats for the bed evolution equations and the hybrid lts gmats method is shown to significantly reduce run times compared to a model that uses a globally minimum time step gmits for both the hydrodynamic and bed evolution equations without loss of accuracy for the test cases presented in this paper the degree of run time reductions varies with applications and depends on the amount of gradation in the computational grid as well as variability in the flow and morphodynamics in this study an order of magnitude reduction in run time was achieved based on the test cases considered it is expected that the present hybrid lts gmats method if combined with parallel computing strategy e g mpi gpu can give even more reductions in the computational cost
