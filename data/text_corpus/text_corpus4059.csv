20295,in this study a finite time velocity free position consensus tracking control method is investigated for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle auv systems with heterogeneous uncertain dynamics first two distributed finite time observers are developed for each follower auv to estimate the state information of the leader and follower auvs own subsequently via the sliding mode control technique a consensus tracking control algorithm based on the estimated information is designed such that each follower auv can track the leader s position trajectory within a finite time even in the absence of velocity measurement second for the situation involving uncertain model parameters a parameter adaptive sliding mode based control algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the closed loop auv system the two controllers only require the position information of the auvs finally two numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed control protocols keywords distributed finite time control heterogeneous uncertain auvs velocity free measurement distributed observer adaptive sliding mode control 1 introduction in recent years multiple autonomous underwater vehicle auv systems have received significant research attention owing to their broad applications in mapping inspections of the sea floor and marine biology explorations gao et al 2016 cui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 when compared with the control of single auv systems the distributed coordination control of multiple auv systems has several advantages such as high robustness greater efficiency extensive task areas hou and cheah 2011 yang and gu 2007 li et al 2019 in a complex task environment in recent decades researchers have developed a series of coordination control strategies for multiple autonomous agents including auvs when the agent dynamics is described by a second order linear time invariant system leonard and fiorelli 2001 proposed a distributed coordination control using artificial potentials and virtual leaders since then with the help of the artificial potential function method olfati saber 2006 studied flocking behavior olfati saber and murray 2002 analyzed formation stability and ogren et al 2004 investigated the coordination problem of mobile sensor networks when the agent dynamics is described by a first order affine nonlinear system in the port hamiltonian framework fabiani et al 2016a b developed a distributed passivity method for multi agent systems with communication delays and fading moreover fabiani et al 2018 presented a general framework for coordination management of a group of agents it is noticed that second order nonlinear dynamic models play a more important role in practical applications to this end fossen 2002 build a second order nonlinear model for auvs based on the auv model many coordination control strategies have been developed by using neural networks yuan et al 2018 elhaki and khoshnam 2018 back stepping control peng et al 2020 adaptive control hou and cheah 2011 yu et al 2020 and sliding mode control taha et al 2016 cui et al 2016 zakeri et al 2016 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2018 taha et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the sliding mode based control method is critical and practical for the coordination control research of multiple auv systems owing to superior characteristics such as fast response facile physical implementation and independence from parameters and disturbances thus far the sliding mode control technique has been widely employed in the fields of attitude control cui et al 2016 formation control wang et al 2020 sun et al 2018 containment control qin et al 2019 and trajectory tracking control taha et al 2016 zakeri et al 2016 taha et al 2017 yan et al 2019 of auv systems and significant research results have been obtained in this regard for the trajectory tracking problem of auv systems taha et al 2016 designed a control algorithm based on a sliding mode control technique to improve the robustness of the model against bounded disturbances and also the lateral motion control of auvs taha et al 2017 cui et al 2016 proposed a sliding mode based adaptive control law to address the unknown disturbances and input nonlinearities these sliding mode control laws were originally designed for single auv systems but they can be extended to multiple auv systems therefore wang et al 2020 designed a sliding mode based adaptive robust control protocol to address the formation control of leader follower auv systems however this protocol did not consider the uncertainty of system model parameters sun et al 2018 subsequently proposed a back stepping technique based sliding mode control protocol to solve the parameter uncertain problem in multiple auv systems yan et al 2019 designed an adaptive integral sliding mode control protocol to solve the trajectory tracking problem of a class of auv systems with uncertainties and disturbances zakeri et al 2016 established a dynamic model of a micro auv and determined its model parameters from the perspective of a simulation experiment subsequently a sliding mode based control law was designed to achieve the tracking of the desired trajectory of auv systems however the tracking accuracy in this case was reduced when the sign function term in the sliding mode surface was replaced by a sigmoid function note that the aforementioned distributed coordination control methods can only guarantee asymptotic stability however consensus tracking in finite time is more preferable for auvs in real scenarios from this standpoint liu et al 2017 proposed a sliding mode controller based on the disturbance observer and back stepping method to achieve trajectory tracking control of uncertain auv systems with time varying disturbances in finite time for auv systems with uncertain parts and external disturbances yang et al 2021 developed a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller based on the parameter linearization method and a robust differentiator to address the trajectory tracking control of the systems in finite time however they did not address the uncertainties of specific parameters in the model considering that auv systems have external disturbances and uncertain hydrodynamic parameters ali et al 2020 designed an extended state observer based nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of the system in finite time however the above results were based only on single auv systems notably it is of great significance to extend the relevant results of finite time control to the collaborative control of multiple auv systems therefore gao and guo 2020 developed a formation controller based on the nussbaum gain to achieve formation tracking control of multiple auv systems with unknown control directions in finite time qin et al 2019 designed a containment controller with fault tolerant constraints to achieve the containment control of multiple auv systems with model uncertainties thruster faults and external disturbances in finite time li and wang 2013 proposed a consensus controller to achieve the consensus control of leaderless and leader follower multiple auv systems in finite time however they did not consider the parameter uncertainties and model heterogeneity it should be noted that almost all the aforementioned coordination control strategies for each auv depend on the velocity information of its neighbor auvs however in practical applications the velocity information required for controller design may not be accurately obtained owing to the influence of the complex task environment and limitations of the auv s own communication and measurement equipment to this end it is more desirable to develop a distributed coordination control protocol independent of velocity information for each auv that can achieve finite time consensus tracking control for multiple auv systems accordingly in this study a two layer control strategy based on a velocity free distributed observer is designed to address the finite time position consensus tracking control problem for heterogeneous leader follower multiple auv systems the major contributions of this paper are as follows first two finite time velocity free distributed observers are developed to estimate the states of the leader and follower second a novel finite time consensus tracking control protocol is developed based on the observers and a novel sliding mode surface third the finite time adaptive laws are designed to estimate the uncertain parameters in the dynamic model of auvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the notation and preliminaries are presented in section

a set of edges and a a i j r n n is the weighted adjacency matrix it is noted that v j v i e if and only if there is a directed edge starting from v j to v i in graph g then node v j is called the parent node and node v i is called the child node then a i j 0 if v j v i e otherwise a i j 0 moreover a i i 0 v i v let d d i a g d 1 d 2 d n denote the degree matrix whose diagonal elements are represented by d i v j n i a i j where n i v j v v j v i e is the set of in neighbors of agent v i v j n i implies that agent v i can receive the information of agent v j a path in a digraph is a sequence v i 0 v i 1 v i l of distinct nodes such that v i s 1 v i s e s 1 2 l the laplacian matrix of the weighted digraph g is defined as l d a a directed tree is a digraph wherein every node has exactly one parent except for the root which has no parent and the root has a directed path to every other node a directed spanning tree of a digraph is a directed tree formed by graph edges that connects all the nodes of the graph in this study assume that there are n follower auvs denoted by v 1 v 2 v n and a leader denoted by v 0 whose state is the time varying reference signal for leader follower multiple auv systems the communication topology graph for all the auvs is denoted by g v e a with the node set at v v 0 the edge weights between the leader and the i th follower auv are denoted by b i if the i th follower auv is connected to the leader then b i 0 otherwise b i 0 assumption 1 the topology graph g contains a directed spanning tree with the leader node v 0 as its root define b d i a g b 1 b 2 b n we then have lemma 7 hong et al 2006b under assumption 1 all the eigenvalues of the matrix l b have positive real parts 3 problem formulation in this study consider a heterogeneous system with a leader and n follower auvs each follower auv is equipped with a sensor suite that can only measure position information and send it to its neighbors similar as in fossen 2002 the kinematics and dynamics of the i th underwater vehicles is considered as follows 7 p i j i θ i v i m i v i d i v i v i g i θ i τ i h i p i where p i x i y i z i t θ i ϕ i θ i ψ i t and h i denote the position attitudes i e roll ϕ i pitch θ i and yaw ψ i as illustrated in fig 1 and measurement output vectors in the inertial reference frame respectively v i u i v i w i t represents the velocity vector in the body fixed reference frame additionally τ i f u f v f w t denotes the generalized thrust force and m i d i a g m u i m v i m w i represents the inertia matrix including the added mass for any angle α r s α sin α and c α cos α then the transformation matrix j i θ i is described as follows j i θ i c ψ i c θ i s ψ i c ϕ i s ϕ i s θ i c ψ i s ψ i s ϕ i s θ i c ψ i c ϕ i s ψ i c θ i c ψ i c ϕ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ψ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ϕ i s θ i s ϕ i c θ i c ϕ i c θ i the damping matrix is represented as d i v i d i a g x u i y v i z w i d i a g d u u i d v v i d w w i where x u i d u y v i d v and z w i d w represent linear and nonlinear damping coefficients respectively the restoring force is denoted as g i θ i w i b i sin θ i w i b i cos θ i sin ϕ i w i b i cos θ i cos ϕ i t where w i and b i represents the gravitational and buoyancy forces respectively for brevity denote j i j i θ i d i d i v i g i g i θ i note that the transformation matrix j i satisfies j i j i t i 3 li and wang 2013 assumption 2 the inertia matrix m i is symmetric positive definite assumption 3 for each follower auv the position p i and velocity v i are assumed to be bounded for all t 0 that is there exist σ i ρ i 0 i 1 2 n such that p i σ i and v i ρ i i 1 2 n remark 1 assumption 3 is applicable in some real applications in practice owing to the limitations of communications and thrusters complex ocean environments and the resistance of water the auv cannot move at high speeds and function remotely therefore it is reasonable to expect that the positions and velocities of each auv will not exceed certain priori moreover this assumption is recurrent in the literature such as in xian et al 2004 and nicosia and tomei 1990 for the kinematics model in 7 the attitude angles are generally time varying however in this case controller design and stability analysis of such time varying system are still very challenging additionally it is also noted that the auv may be required to have a relatively fixed attitude angle in some specific application scenarios such as docking with a fixed target or real time detection of a specific directional area where the attitude angle of an auv only changes within a very small range and its influence on trajectory tracking is almost negligible thus we assume that the attitude angles of all follower auvs are time invariant then the dynamics of the i th auv can be further simplified to 8 p i j i v i m i v i c i v i d i v i v i g i τ i h i p i where c i d i a g x u i y v i z w i d i d i a g d u d v d w and v i v i u i u i v i v i w i w i t remark 2 in this study the attitude angles of all follower auvs are assumed to be time invariant that is θ i ϕ i θ i ψ i t is a constant vector then the kinematics equation becomes a linear time invariant system this constraint leads to a rotation error in practical application and will be handled in the future research work for the position trajectory tracking control of leader follower multiple auv systems without velocity measurement consider the following leader dynamics to generate the tracking reference signal 9 x 0 a 0 x 0 where x 0 p 0 t v 0 t t with p 0 r 3 and v 0 r 3 are the states of the leader which are only available to the leaders neighboring auv agents in this study the following assumption is given on the leader dynamics assumption 4 for the leader the states p 0 and v 0 are uniformly bounded that is x 0 a 0 in this study the main objective is to design a distributed control law τ i to achieve consensus tracking control specifically all follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in finite time even in the absence of velocity measurement this means that there exists a constant t 0 such that the measurement output of all follower auvs satisfies h i p 0 0 i 1 n for t t 0 4 main results in this section the main results of this study for multiple auv systems are presented under the condition that only the position information of each auv can be measured and that only a few follower auvs can obtain the leader s information directly a distributed finite time coordination control scheme is proposed for multiple auv systems based on the distributed finite time observer and sliding mode control method the designed distributed coordination control protocol can enable all follower auvs to track the trajectory of the leader in finite time even without the measurement of velocity when the leader s information is not available to all follower auvs this necessitates the interaction among follower auvs to collaboratively estimate the position information of the leader to this end the following distributed observer is designed for each follower auv to estimate the leader s position p 0 p ˆ i 0 denotes the estimate of p 0 with respect to the i th follower lemma 8 consider the following distributed finite time observer for the i th follower auv 10 p ˆ i 0 l 1 sig α j 1 n a i j p ˆ i 0 p ˆ j 0 b i p ˆ i 0 p 0 l 2 sgn j 1 n a i j p ˆ i 0 p ˆ j 0 b i p ˆ i 0 p 0 where l 1 0 l 2 p 0 and 0 α 1 if assumptions 3 and 4 hold then the observer 10 is globally finite time convergent i e p ˆ i 0 p 0 converges to zero in finite time proof of lemma 8 let p i 0 p ˆ i 0 p 0 p l 1 n p 0 p p i 0 t p n 0 t t and ξ l b i 3 p then the error dynamics of the overall multiple auv system are expressed as 11 p l 1 sig α ξ l 2 sgn ξ p l in addition the lyapunov candidate function is expressed as 12 v 1 2 p t l b i 3 p from lemma 7 v is positive definite and satisfies v 1 2 λ m a x l b p 2 2 thus the time derivative of eq 12 is written as 13 v ξ t p l 1 ξ t sig α ξ l 2 ξ t sgn ξ ξ t p l from lemma 4 upon consideration of p 1 1 α p 2 1 α α it follows that 14 ξ 1 i 1 3 n 1 ξ i 1 i 1 3 n 1 ξ i 1 α 1 1 α i 1 3 n 1 1 1 α α α 1 α ξ t sig α ξ 1 1 α 3 n 1 α 1 α taking p 1 1 p 2 ξ t p l ξ t 1 p l also holds on the basis of the two inequalities from 13 and the fact that x 2 x 1 one has 15 v l 1 3 n α ξ 2 1 α l 2 p l ξ 2 l 1 3 n α λ m i n 1 α l b p 2 1 α l 2 p l λ m i n l b p 2 since v 1 2 λ m a x l b p 2 2 thus it can be determined that 16 v l 1 3 n α λ m i n 1 α l b 2 1 α 2 λ m a x 1 α 2 l b v 1 α 2 l 2 p l λ m i n l b 2 λ m a x 1 2 l b v 1 2 from 16 and lemma 1 p ˆ i 0 p 0 converges to zero in finite time this means that each follower auv can adequately estimate the leader s position with the distributed adaptive observer 10 remark 3 with the distributed observer 10 the i th follower auv can estimate the position of the leader in finite time t 01 satisfying t 01 m i n 3 n α λ m a x 1 α 2 l b 2 1 α 2 v 1 α 2 0 1 α l 1 λ m i n 1 α l b 2 λ m a x 1 2 l b v 1 2 0 l 2 p l λ m i n l b that is p ˆ i 0 p 0 for t t 01 in this study it is considered that the velocity of each follower auv in the system is unmeasurable therefore the following finite time observer is introduced to obtain an accurate estimation of the velocity for each follower auv lemma 9 for system 8 design the following observer 17 p ˆ i j i v ˆ i β sig α 1 h i p ˆ i v ˆ i m i 1 τ i m i 1 c i v ˆ i d i v ˆ i v ˆ i g i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 h i p ˆ i where α 1 1 2 1 and β are positive constants p ˆ i and v ˆ i are the estimations of h i and v i respectively for a given constant δ 0 if v ˆ i satisfies v ˆ i δ then the observer 17 with a sufficiently large gain β is semi global finite time convergent proof of lemma 9 let e 1 i h i p ˆ i e 2 i v i v ˆ i and the dilation be δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i λ e 1 i λ α 1 e 2 i then we have 18 e 1 i j i e 2 i β sig α 1 e 1 i e 2 i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 e 1 i m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i let e 1 i e 1 i e 2 i sig 1 α 1 e 2 i and e i e 1 i t e 2 i t t moreover choose the following lyapunov function 19 v i e i e i t e i where e i e 1 i t e 2 i t t first consider the case wherein m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i 0 then system 18 becomes 20 e 1 i j i e 2 i β sig α 1 e 1 i e 2 i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 e 1 i from definition 3 it can easily be verified that 20 has a negative homogeneous degree α 1 1 0 with respect to the dilation δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i additionally v i e i and l f i v i e i are homogeneous of degree 2 and α 1 1 respectively in terms of the dilation δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i from lemma 4 2 bhat and bernstein 2005 it follows that 21 c 1 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i l f i v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i where c 1 i α 1 β m i n z v i z 1 l f i v i e i and c 2 i α 1 β m a x z v i z 1 l f i v i e i from shen and xia 2008 it can be verified that lim α 1 1 c 2 i α 1 β β the time derivative of v i e i along with 18 is 22 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i 2 e i t 0 d i a g e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 ξ α 1 where d i a g e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 d i a g e 21 1 α 1 α 1 e 22 1 α 1 α 1 e 23 1 α 1 α 1 and ξ m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i under the condition v ˆ i δ and assumption 2 as in shen and xia 2008 there exists a positive constant γ such that m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i γ e i from 22 one has 23 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i 2 γ e i i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i α 1 1 by using lemma 6 we have 24 e 2 j 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 e 2 j 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 where j 1 2 3 subsequently it follows that 25 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i i 1 3 e 2 i 2 α 1 1 3 e 2 i 3 e i therefore 23 becomes 26 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i c 3 i v i e i where c 3 i 2 3 γ α 1 is a positive constant from lemma 2 the set ω is represented as 27 ω e i v i e i c 2 i c 3 i 2 1 α 1 from the above proof of the lemma it can be seen that the size of ω is determined by parameter β with v i e i e i t e i one has 28 ω e i e i c 2 i c 3 i 2 1 α 1 therefore a sufficiently large parameter β can be chosen such that e i 0 ω u from lemma 2 it can be concluded that the distributed observer 17 is semi global finite time convergent i e for any given constant δ 0 the estimation errors p i p ˆ i and v i v ˆ i converge to zero in finite time remark 4 the distributed observer for the i th follower auv is presented by 17 which only depends on the position and its related information rather than the velocity information with the observer 17 the i th follower auv can estimate the state itself in finite time t 02 satisfying t 02 l n 1 c 3 i c 2 i v 1 α 1 2 e i 0 c 3 i α 1 1 2 that is the state of the i th follower auv is such that p i p ˆ i v i v ˆ i for t t 02 4 1 finite time velocity free position consensus for the trajectory tracking control of multiple auv systems a lower layer controller is developed for each follower auv to track the leader in finite time without the velocity measurement from lemmas 8 and 9 the state estimates p ˆ i 0 and p ˆ i can be the true states p 0 and p i respectively in order to ensure that the actual position trajectories of auv can track the leader s trajectories in finite time the following sliding mode surface is defined for the i th follower auv as 29 s i ϵ ˆ i k 1 i sig α 2 ϵ ˆ i β sig α 1 e 1 i where k 1 i 0 α 2 0 1 ϵ ˆ i p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 and e 1 i h i p ˆ i represent the tracking and estimation errors respectively it is noted that when the term e 1 i converges to zero in finite time using lemma 9 the term k 1 i sig α 2 ϵ ˆ i plays dominant role in the fast convergence rate of the error ϵ ˆ i once the surface s i 0 from lemma 8 the positions p ˆ i or p i of the follower auvs will be the same with that of the leader the derivative of eq 29 is 30 s i j i v ˆ i p ˆ i 0 k 1 i α 2 p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 α 2 1 j i v ˆ i β sig α 1 e 1 i p ˆ i 0 then the distributed finite time velocity free control law for the i th follower auv is designed as 31 τ i m i j i 1 k 2 i sig α 3 s i k 3 i sgn s i j i m i 1 c i v ˆ i j i m i 1 d i v ˆ i v ˆ i j i m

the following theorem summarizing the result of the overall system s stability and tracking control performance theorem 1 under assumptions 1 and 3 the semi global finite time stability of the systems 8 and 9 can be achieved using the sliding mode surface 29 and the control strategy 31 where 1 2 α 1 1 0 α 2 α 3 1 and k 1 i k 2 i k 3 i 0 specifically all the follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in finite time proof of theorem 1 consider the following lyapunov candidate function as v t i 1 n v i t where 33 v i 1 2 s i t s i it is clear that v v i is positive definite and satisfies

out on multiple auv system models to validate the effectiveness of the two distributed consensus tracking control protocols designed in the above section without loss of generality a system with four follower auvs and a leader is considered in these simulation examples the communication topology of all auvs including the leader is illustrated in fig 2 the leader s dynamics is expressed as follows p 0 v 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 p 0 v 0 p 0 0 v 0 0 25 20 25 1 5 2 1 5 t in the communication network assume that a i j 1 if and only if j n i otherwise a i j 0 subsequently the laplacian matrix l and h l b can be expressed as follows l 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 h 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 example 1 in this example the system is considered in the standard inertial reference and body fixed reference frames all follower auvs are assumed to have the same structure and the model parameters are given in table 1 the parameter values of this controller are given in table 2 the initial states of all follower auvs are given in table 3 the simulation results are shown in figs 3 6 the estimation results of the leader with the distributed observer 10 for each follower auv are shown in fig 3 which indicate that the states p ˆ i 0 of the observers have a perfect estimate to the position state p 0 of the leader figs 3 a 3 b and 3 c show the estimated results along the x axis y axis and z axis directions respectively the estimation errors of position and velocity of each follower auv with a distributed observer 17 are shown in fig 4 which suggest that the observer states p ˆ i and v ˆ i can estimate the position measurement output h i and velocity v i of each follower auv figs 4 a and 4 b show the estimation errors of position and velocity respectively under the observer 17 one can observe that the estimation errors can converge to zero in finite time the sliding mode surface evolution is shown in fig 5 the position evolution of all the follower auvs with the controller 31 are displayed in fig 6 it can clearly be seen that all the follower auvs can track the leader figs 6 a 6 b and 6 c show the position evolution along three directions example 2 in this example the situation that the communication topology graph and dynamic models of multiple auv systems are the same as for example 1 but the model parameters are uncertain is considered for this problem we employ a control protocol 44 based on the adaptive sliding mode control technique and the adaptation laws are denoted by from theorem 2 the consensus of multiple auv systems can be achieved in finite time under a controller 44 the parameter values of this controller are given in table 4 assume all follower auvs in this example have the same initial states as example 1 the simulation results can be found in figs 7 9 the estimation errors of position and velocity of each follower auv under controller 44 are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the observer states p ˆ i and v ˆ i can track the true position measurement output h i and velocity v i of each follower auv note that the observer 17 takes more time to track the real states of the system under the action of this controller than that action of controller 31 the adaptive sliding mode surface evolution under controller 44 is shown in fig 8 showing that it can converge to zero in about the same time as example 1 the position evolution of all the follower auvs within the adaptive sliding mode based controller 44 are displayed in fig 9 clearly demonstrating that all the follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in less time compared with the output under controller 31 the position of the follower auvs under controller 44 will not deviate far from the leader s position trajectory this is demonstrated by the position trajectory of the 3 th auv along the x axis and y axis directions as shown in figs 6 a and 6 b 6 conclusions in this study the finite time velocity free position consensus tracking control problem was investigated for heterogeneous uncertain multiple auv systems a two layer control strategy was developed for the auv system with two cases known model parameters and unknown model parameters in the upper layer two distributed finite time observers were developed for each follower auv to estimate the state information of the leader and the auv own since the leader s position information was not directly available to all follower auvs and the velocity of each auv cannot be measured the first distributed finite time observer provided an estimate of the leader s position information for each follower auv while the second distributed finite time observer provided a velocity estimate of the follower auv s own in the lower layer two consensus tracking control algorithms were designed for each follower auv together with the finite time observers for the case with known parameters a consensus tracking control algorithm was designed based on a novel sliding mode surface in the absence of velocity measurement a rough upper bound was obtained for the convergence time of the closed loop auv system for the case with unknown parameters adaptive laws were designed to estimate the unknown parameters and then a parameter adaptive sliding mode based control algorithm was developed to improve the control performance of the auv system it is noted that both of these two kinds of consensus tracking controls only relied on the auvs position information in future research a trajectory tracking problem will be considered for multiple auv systems with time varying attitude angles and random disturbances credit authorship contribution statement bo chen methodology software investigation writing original draft writing editing jiangping hu

20295,in this study a finite time velocity free position consensus tracking control method is investigated for multiple autonomous underwater vehicle auv systems with heterogeneous uncertain dynamics first two distributed finite time observers are developed for each follower auv to estimate the state information of the leader and follower auvs own subsequently via the sliding mode control technique a consensus tracking control algorithm based on the estimated information is designed such that each follower auv can track the leader s position trajectory within a finite time even in the absence of velocity measurement second for the situation involving uncertain model parameters a parameter adaptive sliding mode based control algorithm is proposed to improve the performance of the closed loop auv system the two controllers only require the position information of the auvs finally two numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed control protocols keywords distributed finite time control heterogeneous uncertain auvs velocity free measurement distributed observer adaptive sliding mode control 1 introduction in recent years multiple autonomous underwater vehicle auv systems have received significant research attention owing to their broad applications in mapping inspections of the sea floor and marine biology explorations gao et al 2016 cui et al 2017 liu et al 2019 when compared with the control of single auv systems the distributed coordination control of multiple auv systems has several advantages such as high robustness greater efficiency extensive task areas hou and cheah 2011 yang and gu 2007 li et al 2019 in a complex task environment in recent decades researchers have developed a series of coordination control strategies for multiple autonomous agents including auvs when the agent dynamics is described by a second order linear time invariant system leonard and fiorelli 2001 proposed a distributed coordination control using artificial potentials and virtual leaders since then with the help of the artificial potential function method olfati saber 2006 studied flocking behavior olfati saber and murray 2002 analyzed formation stability and ogren et al 2004 investigated the coordination problem of mobile sensor networks when the agent dynamics is described by a first order affine nonlinear system in the port hamiltonian framework fabiani et al 2016a b developed a distributed passivity method for multi agent systems with communication delays and fading moreover fabiani et al 2018 presented a general framework for coordination management of a group of agents it is noticed that second order nonlinear dynamic models play a more important role in practical applications to this end fossen 2002 build a second order nonlinear model for auvs based on the auv model many coordination control strategies have been developed by using neural networks yuan et al 2018 elhaki and khoshnam 2018 back stepping control peng et al 2020 adaptive control hou and cheah 2011 yu et al 2020 and sliding mode control taha et al 2016 cui et al 2016 zakeri et al 2016 wang et al 2020 sun et al 2018 taha et al 2017 yan et al 2019 the sliding mode based control method is critical and practical for the coordination control research of multiple auv systems owing to superior characteristics such as fast response facile physical implementation and independence from parameters and disturbances thus far the sliding mode control technique has been widely employed in the fields of attitude control cui et al 2016 formation control wang et al 2020 sun et al 2018 containment control qin et al 2019 and trajectory tracking control taha et al 2016 zakeri et al 2016 taha et al 2017 yan et al 2019 of auv systems and significant research results have been obtained in this regard for the trajectory tracking problem of auv systems taha et al 2016 designed a control algorithm based on a sliding mode control technique to improve the robustness of the model against bounded disturbances and also the lateral motion control of auvs taha et al 2017 cui et al 2016 proposed a sliding mode based adaptive control law to address the unknown disturbances and input nonlinearities these sliding mode control laws were originally designed for single auv systems but they can be extended to multiple auv systems therefore wang et al 2020 designed a sliding mode based adaptive robust control protocol to address the formation control of leader follower auv systems however this protocol did not consider the uncertainty of system model parameters sun et al 2018 subsequently proposed a back stepping technique based sliding mode control protocol to solve the parameter uncertain problem in multiple auv systems yan et al 2019 designed an adaptive integral sliding mode control protocol to solve the trajectory tracking problem of a class of auv systems with uncertainties and disturbances zakeri et al 2016 established a dynamic model of a micro auv and determined its model parameters from the perspective of a simulation experiment subsequently a sliding mode based control law was designed to achieve the tracking of the desired trajectory of auv systems however the tracking accuracy in this case was reduced when the sign function term in the sliding mode surface was replaced by a sigmoid function note that the aforementioned distributed coordination control methods can only guarantee asymptotic stability however consensus tracking in finite time is more preferable for auvs in real scenarios from this standpoint liu et al 2017 proposed a sliding mode controller based on the disturbance observer and back stepping method to achieve trajectory tracking control of uncertain auv systems with time varying disturbances in finite time for auv systems with uncertain parts and external disturbances yang et al 2021 developed a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller based on the parameter linearization method and a robust differentiator to address the trajectory tracking control of the systems in finite time however they did not address the uncertainties of specific parameters in the model considering that auv systems have external disturbances and uncertain hydrodynamic parameters ali et al 2020 designed an extended state observer based nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller to solve the trajectory tracking control problem of the system in finite time however the above results were based only on single auv systems notably it is of great significance to extend the relevant results of finite time control to the collaborative control of multiple auv systems therefore gao and guo 2020 developed a formation controller based on the nussbaum gain to achieve formation tracking control of multiple auv systems with unknown control directions in finite time qin et al 2019 designed a containment controller with fault tolerant constraints to achieve the containment control of multiple auv systems with model uncertainties thruster faults and external disturbances in finite time li and wang 2013 proposed a consensus controller to achieve the consensus control of leaderless and leader follower multiple auv systems in finite time however they did not consider the parameter uncertainties and model heterogeneity it should be noted that almost all the aforementioned coordination control strategies for each auv depend on the velocity information of its neighbor auvs however in practical applications the velocity information required for controller design may not be accurately obtained owing to the influence of the complex task environment and limitations of the auv s own communication and measurement equipment to this end it is more desirable to develop a distributed coordination control protocol independent of velocity information for each auv that can achieve finite time consensus tracking control for multiple auv systems accordingly in this study a two layer control strategy based on a velocity free distributed observer is designed to address the finite time position consensus tracking control problem for heterogeneous leader follower multiple auv systems the major contributions of this paper are as follows first two finite time velocity free distributed observers are developed to estimate the states of the leader and follower second a novel finite time consensus tracking control protocol is developed based on the observers and a novel sliding mode surface third the finite time adaptive laws are designed to estimate the uncertain parameters in the dynamic model of auvs the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the notation and preliminaries are presented in section

a set of edges and a a i j r n n is the weighted adjacency matrix it is noted that v j v i e if and only if there is a directed edge starting from v j to v i in graph g then node v j is called the parent node and node v i is called the child node then a i j 0 if v j v i e otherwise a i j 0 moreover a i i 0 v i v let d d i a g d 1 d 2 d n denote the degree matrix whose diagonal elements are represented by d i v j n i a i j where n i v j v v j v i e is the set of in neighbors of agent v i v j n i implies that agent v i can receive the information of agent v j a path in a digraph is a sequence v i 0 v i 1 v i l of distinct nodes such that v i s 1 v i s e s 1 2 l the laplacian matrix of the weighted digraph g is defined as l d a a directed tree is a digraph wherein every node has exactly one parent except for the root which has no parent and the root has a directed path to every other node a directed spanning tree of a digraph is a directed tree formed by graph edges that connects all the nodes of the graph in this study assume that there are n follower auvs denoted by v 1 v 2 v n and a leader denoted by v 0 whose state is the time varying reference signal for leader follower multiple auv systems the communication topology graph for all the auvs is denoted by g v e a with the node set at v v 0 the edge weights between the leader and the i th follower auv are denoted by b i if the i th follower auv is connected to the leader then b i 0 otherwise b i 0 assumption 1 the topology graph g contains a directed spanning tree with the leader node v 0 as its root define b d i a g b 1 b 2 b n we then have lemma 7 hong et al 2006b under assumption 1 all the eigenvalues of the matrix l b have positive real parts 3 problem formulation in this study consider a heterogeneous system with a leader and n follower auvs each follower auv is equipped with a sensor suite that can only measure position information and send it to its neighbors similar as in fossen 2002 the kinematics and dynamics of the i th underwater vehicles is considered as follows 7 p i j i θ i v i m i v i d i v i v i g i θ i τ i h i p i where p i x i y i z i t θ i ϕ i θ i ψ i t and h i denote the position attitudes i e roll ϕ i pitch θ i and yaw ψ i as illustrated in fig 1 and measurement output vectors in the inertial reference frame respectively v i u i v i w i t represents the velocity vector in the body fixed reference frame additionally τ i f u f v f w t denotes the generalized thrust force and m i d i a g m u i m v i m w i represents the inertia matrix including the added mass for any angle α r s α sin α and c α cos α then the transformation matrix j i θ i is described as follows j i θ i c ψ i c θ i s ψ i c ϕ i s ϕ i s θ i c ψ i s ψ i s ϕ i s θ i c ψ i c ϕ i s ψ i c θ i c ψ i c ϕ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ψ i s ϕ i s θ i s ψ i c ϕ i s θ i s ϕ i c θ i c ϕ i c θ i the damping matrix is represented as d i v i d i a g x u i y v i z w i d i a g d u u i d v v i d w w i where x u i d u y v i d v and z w i d w represent linear and nonlinear damping coefficients respectively the restoring force is denoted as g i θ i w i b i sin θ i w i b i cos θ i sin ϕ i w i b i cos θ i cos ϕ i t where w i and b i represents the gravitational and buoyancy forces respectively for brevity denote j i j i θ i d i d i v i g i g i θ i note that the transformation matrix j i satisfies j i j i t i 3 li and wang 2013 assumption 2 the inertia matrix m i is symmetric positive definite assumption 3 for each follower auv the position p i and velocity v i are assumed to be bounded for all t 0 that is there exist σ i ρ i 0 i 1 2 n such that p i σ i and v i ρ i i 1 2 n remark 1 assumption 3 is applicable in some real applications in practice owing to the limitations of communications and thrusters complex ocean environments and the resistance of water the auv cannot move at high speeds and function remotely therefore it is reasonable to expect that the positions and velocities of each auv will not exceed certain priori moreover this assumption is recurrent in the literature such as in xian et al 2004 and nicosia and tomei 1990 for the kinematics model in 7 the attitude angles are generally time varying however in this case controller design and stability analysis of such time varying system are still very challenging additionally it is also noted that the auv may be required to have a relatively fixed attitude angle in some specific application scenarios such as docking with a fixed target or real time detection of a specific directional area where the attitude angle of an auv only changes within a very small range and its influence on trajectory tracking is almost negligible thus we assume that the attitude angles of all follower auvs are time invariant then the dynamics of the i th auv can be further simplified to 8 p i j i v i m i v i c i v i d i v i v i g i τ i h i p i where c i d i a g x u i y v i z w i d i d i a g d u d v d w and v i v i u i u i v i v i w i w i t remark 2 in this study the attitude angles of all follower auvs are assumed to be time invariant that is θ i ϕ i θ i ψ i t is a constant vector then the kinematics equation becomes a linear time invariant system this constraint leads to a rotation error in practical application and will be handled in the future research work for the position trajectory tracking control of leader follower multiple auv systems without velocity measurement consider the following leader dynamics to generate the tracking reference signal 9 x 0 a 0 x 0 where x 0 p 0 t v 0 t t with p 0 r 3 and v 0 r 3 are the states of the leader which are only available to the leaders neighboring auv agents in this study the following assumption is given on the leader dynamics assumption 4 for the leader the states p 0 and v 0 are uniformly bounded that is x 0 a 0 in this study the main objective is to design a distributed control law τ i to achieve consensus tracking control specifically all follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in finite time even in the absence of velocity measurement this means that there exists a constant t 0 such that the measurement output of all follower auvs satisfies h i p 0 0 i 1 n for t t 0 4 main results in this section the main results of this study for multiple auv systems are presented under the condition that only the position information of each auv can be measured and that only a few follower auvs can obtain the leader s information directly a distributed finite time coordination control scheme is proposed for multiple auv systems based on the distributed finite time observer and sliding mode control method the designed distributed coordination control protocol can enable all follower auvs to track the trajectory of the leader in finite time even without the measurement of velocity when the leader s information is not available to all follower auvs this necessitates the interaction among follower auvs to collaboratively estimate the position information of the leader to this end the following distributed observer is designed for each follower auv to estimate the leader s position p 0 p ˆ i 0 denotes the estimate of p 0 with respect to the i th follower lemma 8 consider the following distributed finite time observer for the i th follower auv 10 p ˆ i 0 l 1 sig α j 1 n a i j p ˆ i 0 p ˆ j 0 b i p ˆ i 0 p 0 l 2 sgn j 1 n a

proof of lemma 8 let p i 0 p ˆ i 0 p 0 p l 1 n p 0 p p i 0 t p n 0 t t and ξ l b i 3 p then the error dynamics of the overall multiple auv system are expressed as 11 p l 1 sig α ξ l 2 sgn ξ p l in addition the lyapunov candidate function is expressed as 12 v 1 2 p t l b i 3 p from lemma 7 v is positive definite and satisfies v 1 2 λ m a x l b p 2 2 thus the time derivative of eq 12 is written as 13 v ξ t p l 1 ξ t sig α ξ l 2 ξ t sgn ξ ξ t p l from lemma 4 upon consideration of p 1 1 α p 2 1 α α it follows that 14 ξ 1 i 1 3 n 1 ξ i 1 i 1 3 n 1 ξ i 1 α 1 1 α i 1 3 n 1 1 1 α α α 1 α ξ t sig α ξ 1 1 α 3 n 1 α 1 α taking p 1 1 p 2 ξ t p l ξ t 1 p l also holds on the basis of the two inequalities from 13 and the fact that x 2 x 1 one has 15 v l 1 3 n α ξ 2 1 α l 2 p l ξ 2 l 1 3 n α λ m i n 1 α l b p 2 1 α l 2 p l λ m i n l b p 2 since v 1 2 λ m a x l b p 2 2 thus it can be determined that 16 v l 1 3 n α λ m i n 1 α l b 2 1 α 2 λ m a x 1 α 2 l b v 1 α 2 l 2 p l λ m i n l b 2 λ m a x 1 2 l b v 1 2 from 16 and lemma 1 p ˆ i 0 p 0 converges to zero in finite time this means that each follower auv can adequately estimate the leader s position with the distributed adaptive observer 10 remark 3 with the distributed observer 10 the i th follower auv can estimate the position of the leader in finite time t 01 satisfying t 01 m i n 3 n α λ m a x 1 α 2 l b 2 1 α 2 v 1 α 2 0 1 α l 1 λ m

the following finite time observer is introduced to obtain an accurate estimation of the velocity for each follower auv lemma 9 for system 8 design the following observer 17 p ˆ i j i v ˆ i β sig α 1 h i p ˆ i v ˆ i m i 1 τ i m i 1 c i v ˆ i d i v ˆ i v ˆ i g i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 h i p ˆ i where α 1 1 2 1 and β are positive constants p ˆ i and v ˆ i are the estimations of h i and v i respectively for a given constant δ 0 if v ˆ i satisfies v ˆ i δ then the observer 17 with a sufficiently large gain β is semi global finite time convergent proof of lemma 9 let e 1 i h i p ˆ i e 2 i v i v ˆ i and the dilation be δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i λ e 1 i λ α 1 e 2 i then we have 18 e 1 i j i e 2 i β sig α 1 e 1 i e 2 i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 e 1 i m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i let e 1 i e 1 i e 2 i sig 1 α 1 e 2 i and e i e 1 i t e 2 i t t moreover choose the following lyapunov function 19 v i e i e i t e i where e i e 1 i t e 2 i t t first consider the case wherein m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i 0 then system 18 becomes 20 e 1 i j i e 2 i β sig α 1 e 1 i e 2 i β 2 sig 2 α 1 1 e 1 i from definition 3 it can easily be verified that 20 has a negative homogeneous degree α 1 1 0 with respect to the dilation δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i additionally v i e i and l f i v i e i are homogeneous of degree 2 and α 1 1 respectively in terms of the dilation δ λ r e 1 i e 2 i from lemma 4 2 bhat and bernstein 2005 it follows that 21 c 1 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i l f i v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i where c 1 i α 1 β m i n z v i z 1 l f i v i e i and c 2 i α 1 β m a x z v i z 1 l f i v i e i from shen and xia 2008 it can be verified that lim α 1 1 c 2 i α 1 β β the time derivative of v i e i along with 18 is 22 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i 2 e i t 0 d i a g e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 ξ α 1 where d i a g e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 d i a g e 21 1 α 1 α 1 e 22 1 α 1 α 1 e 23 1 α 1 α 1 and ξ m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i under the condition v ˆ i δ and assumption 2 as in shen and xia 2008 there exists a positive constant γ such that m i 1 c i e 2 i d i v i v i v ˆ i v ˆ i γ e i from 22 one has 23 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i 2 γ e i i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i α 1 1 by using lemma 6 we have 24 e 2 j 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 e 2 j 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 where j 1 2 3 subsequently it follows that 25 i 1 3 e 2 i 1 α 1 α 1 i 1 3 e 2 i i 1 3 e 2 i 2 α 1 1 3 e 2 i 3 e i therefore 23 becomes 26 v i e i c 2 i α 1 β v i α 1 1 2 e i c 3 i v i e i where c 3 i 2 3 γ α 1 is a positive constant from lemma 2 the set ω is represented as 27 ω e i v i e i c 2 i c 3 i 2 1 α 1 from the above proof of the lemma it can be seen that the size of ω is determined by parameter β with v i e i e i t e i one has 28 ω e i e i c 2 i c 3 i 2 1 α 1 therefore a sufficiently large parameter β can be chosen such that e i 0 ω u from lemma 2 it can be concluded that the distributed observer 17 is semi global finite time convergent i e for any given constant δ 0 the estimation errors p i p ˆ i and v i v ˆ i converge to zero in finite time remark 4 the distributed observer for the i th follower auv is presented by 17 which only depends on the position and its related information rather than the velocity information with the observer 17 the i th follower auv can estimate the state itself in finite time t 02 satisfying t 02 l n 1 c 3 i c 2 i v 1 α 1 2 e i 0 c 3 i α 1 1 2 that is the state of the i th follower auv is such that p i p ˆ i v i v ˆ i for t t 02 4 1 finite time velocity free position consensus for the trajectory tracking control of multiple auv systems a lower layer controller is developed for each follower auv to track the leader in finite time without the velocity measurement from lemmas 8 and 9 the state estimates p ˆ i 0 and p ˆ i can be the true states p 0 and p i respectively in order to ensure that the actual position trajectories of auv can track the leader s trajectories in finite time the following sliding mode surface is defined for the i th follower auv as 29 s i ϵ ˆ i k 1 i sig α 2 ϵ ˆ i β sig α 1 e 1 i where k 1 i 0 α 2 0 1 ϵ ˆ i p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 and e 1 i h i p ˆ i represent the tracking and estimation errors respectively it is noted that when the term e 1 i converges to zero in finite time using lemma 9 the term k 1 i sig α 2 ϵ ˆ i plays dominant role in the fast convergence rate of the error ϵ ˆ i once the surface s i 0 from lemma 8 the positions p ˆ i or p i of the follower auvs will be the same with that of the leader the derivative of eq 29 is 30 s i j i v ˆ i p ˆ i 0 k 1 i α 2 p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 α 2 1 j i v ˆ i β sig α 1 e 1 i p ˆ i 0 then the distributed finite time velocity free control law for the i th follower auv is designed as 31 τ i m i j i 1 k 2 i sig α 3 s i k 3 i sgn s i j i m i 1 c i v ˆ i j i m i 1 d i v ˆ i v ˆ i j i m

the following theorem summarizing the result of the overall system s stability and tracking control performance theorem 1 under assumptions 1 and 3 the semi global finite time stability of the systems 8 and 9 can be achieved using the sliding mode surface 29 and the control strategy 31 where 1 2 α 1 1 0 α 2 α 3 1 and k 1 i k 2 i k 3 i 0 specifically all the follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in finite time proof of theorem 1 consider the following lyapunov candidate function as v t i 1 n v i t where 33 v i 1 2 s i t s i it is clear that v v i is positive definite and satisfies v i 1 2 s i 2 2 the time derivative of v is written as 34 v i 1 n s i t s i substituting 32 into 34 we obtain 35 v i 1 n k 2 i s i t sig α 3 s i k 3 i s i t sgn s i i 1 n k 2 i s i t sig α 3 s i k 3 i s i 1 if p 1 1 α 3 p 2 1 α 3 α 3 are taken in lemma 4 it follows that 36 s i 1 i 1 3 s i 1 i 1 3 s i 1 α 3 1 1 α 3 i 1 3 1 1 α 3 α 3 α 3 1 α 3 3 α 3 1 α 3 s i t sig α 3 s i 1 1 α 3 with inequality 36 and the fact that x 2 x 1 it can be determined from eq 35 that 37 v i 1 n 3 α 3 k 2 i s i 2 1 α 3 k 3 i s i 2 since v i 1 2 s i 2 2 thus it can also be determined that 38 v i 1 n 3 α 3 2 1 α 3 2 k 2 i v i 1 α 3 2 2 k 3 i v i 1 2 from eq 30 we have 39 v 3 α 3 2 1 α 3 2 k 2 i 1 n v i 1 α 3 2 2 k 3 i 1 n v i 1 2 where k 2 m i n k 21 k 22 k 2 n and k 3 m i n k 31 k 32 k 3 n by using lemma 5 we can obtain 40 v 3 α 3 2 1 α 3 2 k 2 i 1 n v i 1 α 3 2 2 k 3 i 1 n v i 1 2 from 40 and lemma 1 it can be seen that the systems will converge to the sliding mode surface s i 0 in finite time t 03 satisfying

become ϵ ˆ i k 1 i sig α 2 ϵ ˆ i another lyapunov function is considered as v 1 t i 1 n v 1 i t where v 1 i 1 2 ϵ ˆ i t ϵ ˆ i the time derivative of v 1 is 41 v 1 i 1 n ϵ ˆ i t ϵ ˆ i i 1 n ϵ ˆ i t k 1

the boundedness of p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 for t 0 t 02 and finite time convergence of ϵ ˆ i step1 when 0 t t 02 using lemmas 8 and 9 it can be determined that the errors p i 0 and e 1 i i 1 2 n are bounded under assumptions 2 and 4 it can be determined that p ˆ i p ˆ i 0 for t 0 t 02 are bounded step2 when t t 02 the estimation error e 1 i becomes e 1 i 0 then choose the same lyapunov function v as in

out on multiple auv system models to validate the effectiveness of the two distributed consensus tracking control protocols designed in the above section without loss of generality a system with four follower auvs and a leader is considered in these simulation examples the communication topology of all auvs including the leader is illustrated in fig 2 the leader s dynamics is expressed as follows p 0 v 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 p 0 v 0 p 0 0 v 0 0 25 20 25 1 5 2 1 5 t in the communication network assume that a i j 1 if and only if j n i otherwise a i j 0 subsequently the laplacian matrix l and h l b can be expressed as follows l 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 h 2 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 example 1 in this example the system is considered in the standard inertial reference and body fixed reference frames all follower auvs are assumed to have the same structure and the model parameters are given in table 1 the parameter values of this controller are given in table 2 the initial states of all follower auvs are given in table 3 the simulation results are shown in figs 3 6 the estimation results of the leader with the distributed observer 10 for each follower auv are shown in fig 3 which indicate that the states p ˆ i 0 of the observers have a perfect estimate to the position state p 0 of the leader figs 3 a 3 b and 3 c show the estimated results along the x axis y axis and z axis directions respectively the estimation errors of position and velocity of each follower auv with a distributed observer 17 are shown in fig 4 which suggest that the observer states p ˆ i and v ˆ i can estimate the position measurement output h i and velocity v i of each follower auv figs 4 a and 4 b show the estimation errors of position and velocity respectively under the observer 17 one can observe that the estimation errors can converge to zero in finite time the sliding mode surface evolution is shown in fig 5 the position evolution of all the follower auvs with the controller 31 are displayed in fig 6 it can clearly be seen that all the follower auvs can track the leader figs 6 a 6 b and 6 c show the position evolution along three directions example 2 in this example the situation that the communication topology graph and dynamic models of multiple auv systems are the same as for example 1 but the model parameters are uncertain is considered for this problem we employ a control protocol 44 based on the adaptive sliding mode control technique and the adaptation laws are denoted by from theorem 2 the consensus of multiple auv systems can be achieved in finite time under a controller 44 the parameter values of this controller are given in table 4 assume all follower auvs in this example have the same initial states as example 1 the simulation results can be found in figs 7 9 the estimation errors of position and velocity of each follower auv under controller 44 are shown in fig 7 it can be seen that the observer states p ˆ i and v ˆ i can track the true position measurement output h i and velocity v i of each follower auv note that the observer 17 takes more time to track the real states of the system under the action of this controller than that action of controller 31 the adaptive sliding mode surface evolution under controller 44 is shown in fig 8 showing that it can converge to zero in about the same time as example 1 the position evolution of all the follower auvs within the adaptive sliding mode based controller 44 are displayed in fig 9 clearly demonstrating that all the follower auvs can track the trajectory of the leader in less time compared with the output under controller 31 the position of the follower auvs under controller 44 will not deviate far from the leader s position trajectory this is demonstrated by the position trajectory of the 3 th auv along the x axis and y axis directions as shown in figs 6 a and 6 b 6 conclusions in this study the finite time velocity free position consensus tracking control problem was investigated for heterogeneous uncertain multiple auv systems a two layer control strategy was developed for the auv system with two cases known model parameters and unknown model parameters in the upper layer two distributed finite time observers were developed for each follower auv to estimate the state information of the leader and the auv own since the leader s position information was not directly available to all follower auvs and the velocity of each auv cannot be measured the first distributed finite time observer provided an estimate of the leader s position information for each follower auv while the second distributed finite time observer provided a velocity estimate of the follower auv s own in the lower layer two consensus tracking control algorithms were designed for each follower auv together with the finite time observers for the case with known parameters a consensus tracking control algorithm was designed based on a novel sliding mode surface in the absence of velocity measurement a rough upper bound was obtained for the convergence time of the closed loop auv system for the case with unknown parameters adaptive laws were designed to estimate the unknown parameters and then a parameter adaptive sliding mode based control algorithm was developed to improve the control performance of the auv system it is noted that both of these two kinds of consensus tracking controls only relied on the auvs position information in future research a trajectory tracking problem will be considered for multiple auv systems with

20296,self propulsion free running ship simulation is most closely similar to the running ship for different operating condition without any simplification of the ship hull and appendages accurate evaluations of self propulsion performance are vitally important in the design of hull propeller systems this paper describes unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations to determine the self propulsion performance of a full scale container ship with a kp505 propeller an inhouse code is used to solve the rans equations with a discretized propeller descriptive body force oum osaka university method and modified oum body force methods selected as the propulsion models the modified oum body force method couples blade element momentum theory considering the three dimensional viscous effects with the rans solver before the full scale self propulsion simulations uncertainty analyses are performed on the full scale hull and the propeller the effect of roughness on the full scale simulations is also studied we discuss how the modified oum body force method can be used for full scale self propulsion simulations and show that the model scale body force can be substituted into the full scale rough propeller in the self propulsion simulations the body force results are compared with extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and simulation results with the discretized propeller in this paper the modified oum shows higher accuracy for full scale self propulsion simulation than other two body forces for inhouse urans solver moreover the scale effect is discussed by comparing open water resistance and self propulsion simulations at different scales the open water and resistance results show that the propeller scale effect can be ignored whereas both the wake flow and skin friction correction have large scale effects the self propulsion scale effect is mainly reflected in the wake factor thrust deduction factor and rotation speed for the container ship considered herein the full scale wake fraction is smaller than the model scale prediction whereas the rotational speed and thrust deduction factor are greater keywords full scale self propulsion discretized propeller body force model scale effect 1 introduction the accurate evaluation of full scale ship self propulsion performance is important in the design of hull propeller systems traditionally the results of scaled model tests are used to predict full scale performance in recent years an increasing number of scholars have used computational fluid dynamics cfd to predict the ship self propulsion performance cfd is a high fidelity method based on physical principles and yields results that are typically highly accurate with almost no need for empirical inputs guo et al 2018 cfd simulations of ship self propulsion not only reduce the testing time and cost but also provide more information about ship flow ship waves and other details related to a ship s hydrodynamic performance feng et al 2020a therefore cfd is an effective approach for predicting and assessing the self propulsion performance shen and korpus 2015 conducted self propulsion simulations for a japan bulk carrier and course keeping simulations for the office of naval research tumblehome ship using an overset grid technique developed for openfoam the results were found to be in good agreement with experimental results machado and augusto 2018 performed self propulsion simulations using the british and continental methods the british method was found to have higher accuracy whereas the continental method required less computation time kinaci et al 2018 selected one submarine darpa suboff and two vessels korea research institute of ships and ocean container ship kcs and duisburg test case dtc on the free surface to obtain their self propulsion points using cfd they found that the simulation results were in accordance with experimental fluid dynamics efd data and numerical results from other studies wang et al 2019 investigated submarine flow and propeller wake for darpa suboff near free surface using efd and cfd approaches the propeller model is a key component in the correct prediction of hull propeller interactions broglia et al 2013 a body force model and a discretized propeller model are the two most common approaches for self propulsion simulations a discretized propeller can easily capture the detailed flow features around propeller blades however to ensure continuities in space and reliable simulation results a higher mesh resolution and smaller time step is required which leads to complex meshes and longer simulation times the body force method makes self propulsion simulations easier and quicker when the detailed propeller flow is not essential such as in the interaction of propeller hull rudder systems feng et al 2020b guo et al 2020 proposed a new method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations combined with a boundary element method bem iterative body force to calculate the self propulsion point the calculation results were in good agreement with model test results showing that self propulsion simulations could be used in the early stages of ship design su 2018 used three methods to implement the coupled bem rans formulation unsteady time averaged non axisymmetric and time averaged axisymmetric methods these methods were validated by several simple cases and then applied to the hull propeller rudder interactions and contra rotating propeller simulations the unsteady bem rans scheme reduced the mesh preparation cost by 50 and increased the calculation speed by a factor of six enabling rapid performance assessments of propeller design and multiple changes during the design period generally most self propulsion simulations are based on scale models and remain the same as experimental systems the results of scale models are then used to predict the full scale self propulsion performance the scale effect results in differences between the full scale prediction and reality because of different reynolds numbers to enhance the prediction accuracy full scale ship simulations using accurate and reliable viscous flow solvers are necessary visonneau 2005 in addition the treatment of the grid and the free surface as well as the roughness and the wall function are important factors in full scale simulations to encourage cfd full scale simulations peric 2019 had analyzed wall boundary layer requirements and reynolds number effects full scale simulations are proven to be no more computationally expensive than at model scale also the accuracy of the full scale simulation results is no lower than the efd extrapolation in many cases full scale prediction is even more reliable than scaling up model experiments especially at subcritical reynolds numbers baltazar et al 2019 predicted the propeller performance at different reynolds numbers and discussed the propeller scale effects and the influence of the turbulence and transition models on the performance prediction sun et al 2019 2020 performed numerical study on hull propeller and free surface interaction for model and full scale and then the scale effect was analyzed by comparing the overall performance with local flow fields and detailed vortex identification using the rans method with a double model and a volume of fluid model considering roughness and free surface effects the full scale ship self propulsion simulation results were in excellent agreement with sea trial results mikkelsen and walther 2020 modified the wall functions and included roughness into the cfd model to perform full scale cfd self propulsion simulations of a ro ro vessel and a general cargo vessel by comparing the simulation results using the new roughness inclusion method and empirical formulas with speed trial measurements they found that the inclusion of the roughness model in the cfd simulations improved the accuracy of full scale ship self propulsion simulations kok et al 2020 undertook a cfd based study of the unsteady rans urans formulation to investigate the scale effect in self propelled dtc squat the benchmark efd data and the landweber empirical predictions were used to validate the model and full scale simulations by comparing the model full scale cfd and model scale benchmark efd squat results it was shown that the scale effect was negligible jasak et al 2019 selected two full scale ships to conduct cfd validation and grid sensitivity studies of full scale ship self propulsion comparisons with sea trial data showed that direct numerical simulations of full scale ship performance were feasible nobuaki et al 2020 investigated the capability of viscous cfd to estimate full scale stern wake by conducting viscous cfd analysis for two merchant ships the surface roughness was found to affect powering estimation nominal and total wake distributions finally several common practices were suggested for predicting stern flow using full scale viscous cfd simulation based on the ittc procedures currently there are few examples of the body force method being used for full scale self propulsion simulations as it is not clear whether this approach is applicable to different scales or how it should be applied to full scale simulations this paper describes simulations of the full scale kcs self propulsion using two methods a discretized propeller and the modified oum body force model feng et al 2020b firstly uncertainty analysis is separately applied to the full scale kcs hull and the kp505 propeller then we discuss how the modified oum body force model could be used for full scale self propulsion simulations and compare the body force results with extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and the simulation results using the discretized propeller moreover the scale effect is discussed by comparing open water resistance and self propulsion simulation results at different scales all computations are carried out using an inhouse cfd code to solve the rans equations coupled with two degree of freedom 2dof solid body motion equations including heave and pitch the rans equations are solved using a finite difference method and pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso arithmetic the computations use a structured grid with overset technology the full scale simulations include the effect of roughness in the multi layer wall function 2 computational method the cfd simulations considered resistance propeller open water and self propulsion scenarios for both model and full scale cases the simulations were conducted using our inhouse cfd code which has been validated by numerous simulations for various propellers ships and underwater vehicles guo et al 2018 feng et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 the urans approach with a two equation eddy viscosity model namely the shear stress transport k ω model menter 1994 was selected for turbulence modeling the viscous flow with a free surface was solved by the single phase level set method the inhouse cfd code discretizes the governing equations using a structured finite difference method in self propulsion computations a proportional integral pi speed controller carrica et al 2010 is used to match the propeller rotation speed n to the target speed 1 n p e i 0 t e d t where e u t a r g e t u s h i p is the difference between the ship speed u s h i p and the target speed u t a r g e t p and i are the proportional and integral constants generally estimated by the empirical formula p i n δ t 500 feng et al 2020b 2 1 governing equations and propulsion models the rans equations can be obtained by time averaging the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equation 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f b i where u i is the component of reynolds averaged speed in the x i direction of the independent coordinates p is the dynamic pressure ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress tensor μ is the dynamic viscosity for the discretized propeller model geometric models of the hull and propeller are directly created and then discretized into the mesh models as shown in fig 1 a different mesh models for the hull propeller refinements and numerical tank are handled by the structured dynamic overset grid technique to obtain the final computational model this model is solved by rans coupled with a 2dof motion equation to give the overall motion of the hull and propeller in iterative steps after the hull and propeller grids have moved to their new position and attitude the next iterative step is solved to ensure spatial continuity of the discretized propeller model the propeller rotates 2 per time step δ t 2 360 n ittc 2014 for the body force model the rans solution for the propeller is omitted the body force source term f b i is added in the momentum equation to replace the propeller the different body forces are determined by obtaining the body force source term the field of descriptive body force are distributed over the cylindrical virtual disk following the goldstein optimum along the propeller radius and the body force source term is computed from the thrust and torque coefficients k t and k q generally described to polynomials about j v a n d p 4 k t o r k q a j 3 b j 2 c j d in this paper the coefficients for kp505 are tabulated in table 1 based on blade element momentum theory the blade thrust and torque of each element can be calculated in oum tokgoz 2015 5 d l 0 5 c l u r 2 c r d r 6 d d 0 5 c d u r 2 c r d r 7 d t d l cos β i d d sin β i 8 d q d l sin β i d d cos β i r where β i a r c t a n u 2 π n r u t is hydrodynamic pitch angle u r is the propeller resultant speed u and u t are the axial and tangential local instantaneous velocity n is the rotation speed c r is the chord length at radius r and the overall thrust t and torque q are obtained by integrating the individual contribution of each element dt and dq traditionally oum obtained c l and c d from two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects the modified oum body force model feng et al 2020b follows oum with however an important modified regarding acquisition of c l and c d to obtain the distribution of c l and c d both the propeller blade and the propeller plane are divided into 10 parts from open water cases using discretized propeller discretizing blade is to obtain the average force dt and moment dq on each part and discretizing propeller plane is to obtain the average axial speed on each part as shown in fig 2 the average tangential velocity on each part is also obtained in a similar way then using equation 5 8 the average c l and c d of equivalent airfoil of each part can be gotten velocity component chord length dt and dq are known with this way as seen in fig 1 b the modified oum body force model is based on blade element momentum theory and considers the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller in the modified oum body force model c l and c d can be written as equation 9 11 9 c l k α s i n α c α 10 c d k 1 c l 2 k 2 11 k α c α k 1 k 2 1 152 5 723 0 047 0 216 9 267 5 944 0 278 0 170 0 199 0 972 0 009 0 032 1 589 0 323 0 037 0 177 c r 3 c r 2 c r 1 where k α c α k 1 k 2 determine the performance of the propeller the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d and are related to the propeller parameters α is the angle of attack feng et al 2020b in addition the vessel velocity or modified vessel velocity using nominal wake fraction in calm water is usually used for the descriptive body force as the advance velocity while the local instantaneous velocity is used for oum and modified oum body force in every iteration step 2 2 wall function model the flow in the boundary layer consists of a viscous sublayer log layer and outer region in the viscous sublayer the dimensionless speed u varies linearly with the dimensionless distance from the wall y 12 u y for a smooth wall u and l n y have a linear relationship in the log layer 13 u ln e y κ where u u u τ y y u τ μ u τ τ ω ρ is the friction velocity κ is von karman s constant e is a constant and τ ω is the shear stress on the wall this relation is called the law of the wall in the numerical method if the flow in the boundary layer can be captured the initial thickness of the grid is assumed to be smaller than the viscous sublayer usually y 5 is required because the viscous sublayer is very thin the thickness of the boundary layer for full scale simulations will be thinner than that of the model scale case because the full scale reynolds number r e 10 9 is much higher than that of the model scale case r e 10 6 10 7 in inhouse cfd code the near wall grid spacing δ s can be calculated by ittc 2011 14 δ s 8 6 y l r e 13 14 thus the near wall grid spacing δ s in the full scale case should be two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the model scale simulations for the same y to obtain accurate numerical results the aspect ratio of the grid cannot be too large thus the surface grid spacing of the wall in the full scale simulations is very small and this method is sensitive to the grid spacing this significantly increases the computational cost to solve this problem the wall function is used as this allows the initial thickness of the grid to be less than the log layer where 30 y 200 this greatly reduces the resolution near the wall and improves the stability and convergence of the calculations in this study a multi layer wall function model bhushan et al 2009 is used relationship of u and y can be written as 15 u y a 0 a 1 y a 2 y 2 a 3 y 3 a 4 y 4 δ b 1 κ ln y b δ b 0 y 5 5 y 30 y 30 16 δ b κ 1 ln 1 k 3 5 where the multi layer model is developed using curve fitting fourth order polynomial as adopted by tsan hsing et al 2003 and a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 equal to 1 875736 1 8158144 0 102066044 0 00295224178 and 0 000033144178 respectively are the fourth order polynomial coefficients for the buffer layer bhushan et al 2009 we fix κ 0 41 b 5 1 and use δ b to account for the effect of wall roughness resulting in the downshift of the log layer region knobloch and fernholz 2004 k u τ k s v is the dimensionless surface roughness based on the roughness length k s in this study k s 32 μm for the hull and propeller castro et al 2011 y 1 for the model scale simulations and y 80 for the full scale simulations 2 3 skin friction correction when model scale simulations are extrapolated to the full scale case the skin friction correction sfc factor must be added to the thrust sfc accounts for the reduced resistance of friction in full scale scenarios with respect to the model scale ittc 2014 17 s f c 1 k c f m c f s δ c f where the model and full scale friction factors c f m and c f s are calculated using the ittc 57 method c f 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 u m and s m are the model scale ship velocity and static wetted area respectively k is the form factor which corrects for the fact that c f is actually the friction coefficient for a flat plate and the experimental form factor 1 k 1 1 is used in the simulations the roughness allowance δ c f 0 00027 corresponds to a roughness length of k s 32 μm thus s f c 1 3294 10 3 for the model scale propulsion simulations tokyo cfd workshop 2015 3 computational domain and grids the computational ship and propeller models are kcs and kp505 with scale ratios of 1 31 6 and 1 1 respectively the open water resistance and self propulsion experimental data associated with these models are available from the tokyo cfd workshop 2015 for the resistance and self propulsion simulations the inlet boundary should be located 1 2 l p p away from the hull and the outlet should be placed 3 5 l p p downstream ittc 2011 according to the previous studies feng et al 2020a ittc 2011 the side boundary is supposed to set about 1 l p p from centreplane while the bottom boundary is set at least 1 l p p from baseplane in addition to prevent the water depth from affecting the simulations the underwater depth of the computational domain should be sufficient for open water it is also necessary to avoid the influence of the free surface on the propeller simulations according to previous studies using inhouse cfd code the computational domain and the boundary conditions for open water and self propulsion simulations using a discretized propeller are set as shown in figs 3 and 4 in this study the front end of the computational domain along the x axis direction is set to the inlet boundary condition while the rear end is an exit boundary the top is assigned the zero pressure condition and the bottom is set to the zero pressure gradient condition the two side boundaries are assigned zero gradient conditions these boundary conditions are selected with reference to the most accurate and fastest solution in similar simulations using inhouse cfd code the zero gradient boundary condition is used to avoid a velocity gradient between the fluid and the wall for zero pressure the dynamic pressure p ˆ 0 and for zero pressure gradient the pressure gradient p n 0 which represents infinite water depth and infinite air conditions respectively the structured dynamic overset grid technology was used for all simulations reported in this paper the structured dynamic overset grids are used for all simulations in this paper which are dealt with by the self developed code in house overset grid code is based on the grid point overset of structured grid and consists of three steps hole cutting identiﬁcation of the interpolation points and identiﬁcation of the donor cells the hole mapping method based on cartesian coordinate grid of uniform structured grid is adopted for hole cutting the donors of interpolation points are found using adt an alternative digital tree based on the data structure while the relationship between the donor points and interpolation points is obtained by trilinear interpolation method li and yan 2005 zhang et al 2020 as the near wall grid spacing δ s in the full scale case should be two orders of magnitude smaller than for the model scale case at the same y a value of y 1 was selected for the model scale simulations and a value of y 80 was used in the full scale simulations thus the initial grid relative thickness of the full scale model was about 3 4 times thinner than for the model scale simulations as shown in fig 5 to ensure the appropriate aspect ratio of the grid the full scale case requires a finer surface grid as shown in fig 6 to capture the detailed flow around the hull and the propeller the refinements shown in figs 7 9 were used in the simulations the ability to freely refine the mesh according to the specific case is a major advantage of overset grids 4 validation and verification uncertainty analyses of the model scale hull propeller and body force have been implemented in previous studies feng et al 2020a before the full scale self propulsion simulations the present computational method was verified and validated to improve the computational efficiency the verification and validation study was conducted separately for the full scale hull and propeller the grid distributions of the hull and the propeller were then maintained in the self propulsion simulations 4 1 numerical uncertainty verification is defined as the process of assessing the numerical uncertainty u s n according to the various procedures stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 it is assumed that the numerical uncertainty u s n is composed of the iteration uncertainty u i grid space uncertainty u g time step uncertainty u t and an uncertainty term representing other parameters u p for inhouse cfd code u i and u p have been verified by numerous computations and can be neglected hence u g and u t are of most concern for inhouse cfd code simulations the numerical uncertainty u s n can be estimated as 18 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 in this paper the propeller thrust and torque are analyzed to verify and validate the propeller model whereas the total resistance is selected for the kcs hull model richardson s extrapolation method can be used to carry out a systematic analysis of the grid spacing and the time step first the uniform parameter refinement ratio r k between solutions is calculated as 19 r k δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 where δ x 1 δ x 2 and δ x 3 are the coarse medium and fine grid spacings or time steps respectively we set s 1 s 2 and s 3 to be the results of the coarse medium and fine grid spacings or time steps respectively then ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 reflect the changes when moving from medium fine and from coarse medium solutions the convergence ratio r is defined as 20 r ε 32 ε 21 there are three convergence situations that can be judged by the r value 1 monotonic convergence mc 0 r 1 2 oscillatory convergence oc r 0 4 2 divergence d 1 r when monotonic convergence is achieved richardson s extrapolation method can be used the estimated numerical error δ r e and order of accuracy p r e can be calculated as 21 δ r e ε 32 r k p r e 1 22 p r e ln ε 21 ε 32 l n r k 4 3 the correction factor c g is defined as 23 c g r k p r e 1 r k p t h 1 where p t h is an estimated value for the limiting order of accuracy as the spacing size goes to zero generally p t h 2 the numerical error δ s n benchmark result s c and uncertainty u g t can be estimated as 24 δ s n c g δ r e 25 s c s δ s n 26 u g t 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 25 1 c g δ r e 1 c g 0 25 27 u g t 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 125 fig 10 shows the three grid cases used for the grid uncertainty study of the full scale smooth kp505 propeller the surface grid density volume growth rate and number of grid layers vary between the coarse medium and fine grids according to a grid refinement ratio of 2 the specific dimensions of the three grid cases are listed in table 2 for the hull model the same method is used with a grid refinement ratio of 2 3 feng et al 2020c working conditions of j 0 8 for the propeller and f r 0 26 for the hull were selected for the numerical uncertainty analysis for the time step sensitivity analysis 2 propeller rotation per time step was selected for the medium time step with a refinement ratio of 2 while 0 005 l p p u 0 was set for the medium time step for the hull with a refinement ratio of 2 the results of the full scale kp505 and kcs simulations with the different grids and time steps are listed in tables 3 and 4 the grid sensitivity study is based on the medium time step for both the grid spacing and time step analyses the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 indicating that monotonic convergence was achieved and richardson s extrapolation method could be used from table 5 it can be observed that the uncertainties for the propeller thrust were 2 173 d grid spacing and 0 071 d time step while those for the torque were 0 559 d grid spacing and 2 264 d time step where d denotes the experimental data the uncertainties for the hull were 4 926 d grid spacing and 0 924 d time step the results indicate that the force is more sensitive to the grid spacing while the torque is more sensitive to the time step 4 4 validation based on extrapolation of efd data the comparison error e is defined as the difference between the experimental data d and the numerical result s in the full scale case d is the extrapolation castro et al 2011 of the efd data 28 e d s to determine whether the model has been validated e is compared to the validation uncertainty u v given by 29 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 the results of the validation study are presented in table 6 validation requires the uncertainty of the experimental data u d but this is not known for full scale kcs and kp505 simulations therefore u d for the kcs model scale test was used for the full scale uncertainty and u d for the propeller was assumed to be 1 00 d the results of this validation study show that all the comparison errors e are less than the validation uncertainty u v which validates the computation results at the u v level 5 results and discussion of different propulsion models 5 1 model and full scale kcs resistance resistance simulations were conducted for model and full scale smooth hulls and a full scale rough hull as shown in fig 11 the free surfaces of the model and full scale kcs are very similar although some differences can be observed at the tail the results of for the model and full scale smooth kcs hull at f r 0 26 are compared in table 7 both sets of results are in good agreement with the experimental values table 8 compares the full scale rough hull with the extrapolated model test data the sfc obtained by direct cfd simulations is much smaller than the experimental value which will have a significant impact on the self propulsion predictions the wake flow in the propeller plane is very important fig 12 shows that the wake fraction for the full scale ship is smaller than that from the model scale simulations where the plane locates at the propeller plane the plane center at x l p p 0 9825 z l p p 0 02913 to describe the wake flow in detail the circular probe shown in fig 13 was used the circle was divided into 120 parts with equal intervals of 3 fig 14 shows the axial velocity distributions of the model and full scale simulations the wake flow is in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 15 30 w n 1 u a u 31 u a 0 3 r 1 0 r 0 2 π u d θ d r a u 32 u w 0 3 r 1 0 r 0 2 π u u d θ d r a u where w n is the wake factor u a is the advance speed u is the ship velocity a is the area of the propeller plane u is the velocity of each probe point u is the average velocity over a radius and u w is the wake nonuniformity factor fig 16 shows the wake and wake nonuniformity distributions of the model and full scale simulations along a radius the wake factors of the model and full scale cases were calculated to be 0 269 and 0 151 respectively whereas the wake nonuniformity factors were 0 223 and 0 115 respectively the main reason for the difference in the wake flow between the model and full scale simulations is the different boundary layers caused by different reynolds numbers as shown in fig 17 the full scale boundary layer is obviously thinner than that in the model scale case u a u 0 9 is defined as the boundary layer in this paper the thinner boundary layer enhances the velocity gradient and leads to greater axial velocities although the flow separation decreases and the wake field becomes more uniform 5 2 model and full scale open water computations of different propulsion models we define the following coefficients advance coefficient 33 j v a n d thrust coefficient 34 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 torque coefficient 35 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 open water efficiency 36 η k t k q j 2 π where v a is the advance speed of the propeller n is the rotation speed d is the propeller diameter t is the thrust and q is the torque similar to the resistance simulations open water simulations were conducted using the model and full scale smooth propeller and the full scale rough propeller open water for modified oum body force has been simulated in a previous study feng et al 2020a according to model tests tokyo cfd workshop 2015 values of 3 5 j m s and 14 r s were selected as the incoming flow velocity and rotation speed respectively assuming that the advance velocity coefficient and froude number are the same in the full and model scale cases the full scale open water working conditions can be obtained as shown in table 9 the simulated open water characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental data the performance of the propeller can be accurately simulated by the modified oum body force method fig 18 shows open water characteristics of model and full scale kp505 while fig 19 gives the differences between model scale results calculated by discretized propeller and modified oum body force and full scale smooth rough results k t and k q are larger and smaller respectively in the full scale smooth results than at the model scale discretized propeller as shown in figs 18 and 19 however the differences are less than 1 84 and 2 37 for the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient respectively the rough surface will decrease the thrust of the propeller increase the torque and reduce the efficiency which together act to make the performance of the model scale propeller closer to that of the full scale rough propeller as seen in fig 19 the differences of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient between full scale rough propeller and body force are less than 1 54 and 3 01 respectively a comparison of the model scale modified oum body force method and the full scale rough propeller shows that it is reasonable for the model scale body force to be used in full scale rough self propulsion simulations in addition the pressure distributions of the model and full scale propellers are very similar as shown in figs 20 and 21 thus the scale effects on the propeller characteristics can be ignored 5 3 model and full scale self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models the thrust deduction factor can be written as 37 t m t m r t m s f c t m for the model scale simulations and as 38 t s t s r t s t s for the full scale case the self propulsion wake factor is calculated as 39 w t 1 j n d u where t and r t denote the thrust of the propeller and the resistance of the ship respectively j is the advance velocity coefficient which is generally obtained by interpolation using the thrust identity method ittc 2014 n is the rotation speed of the propeller d is the diameter of propeller and u is the ship velocity in the self propulsion simulations the pi control method was used to match the propeller rotation speed at f r 0 26 where the target velocities for the model and full scale cases were 2 2 m s and 24 kn according to the model tests s f c 1 3294 10 3 was used to compensate the reduced resistance in the model scale simulations the discretized propeller model and different body force models were adopted for the full scale simulations upon comparing the ship speeds and propeller rotational speeds of discretized propeller model and the modified oum body force the body force was found to reach the self propulsion point fastest as shown in fig 22 the non dimensionalized time t t u l the controlled target was vessel velocity according to mathematical model of typical second order system in controls logic the shape of the speed curves of fig 22 showed that the system damping ratios of the model scale the full scale discretized propeller and body force method were sequentially reduced and the full scale body force system seemed to be near the optimal damping ratio which might be caused by different propulsion models and time steps of course it s possible for discretized propeller model to reach of the optimal damping ratio and converge faster by adjusting pid values the self propulsion simulation and experimental extrapolated results were made dimensionless to enable comparison see tables 10 and 11 where table 10 showed the comparison between this study using discretized propeller the literature and the experimental extrapolated and table 11 showed the comparison of full scale kcs self propulsion computation results using different propulsion models the dimensionless rotation speed is given by n n u l in table 10 both the experimental extrapolation and simulated results from the literature were used to confirm the credibility of full scale data using inhouse cfd code as shown in table 10 the simulation results using discretized propeller for inhouse urans code were almost identical to those given by cfdship iowa 4 5 castro et al 2011 moreover the differences between the efd model scale and full scale predictions are less than 5 therefore it is reasonable to extrapolate the model scale self propulsion results to full scale ships and it is credible to simulate full scale ship self propulsion using inhouse cfd code by comparing the model scale simulation predictions with the full scale results it can be found that the scale effect is mainly reflected in the self propulsion wake factor thrust deduction factor and rotation speed the sfc obtained by direct cfd simulations s f c 1 1380 10 3 was much smaller than the experimental value s f c 1 3294 10 3 a larger value of sfc means that for model scale simulations the predicted thrust t and the rotation speed will be smaller taking j v a n d the model scale value of v a is 11 56 smaller than in the full scale simulations and the rotation speed is 4 19 smaller thus the model scale j and k t are smaller and larger respectively than in the full scale case from the expression 1 t m r t m s f c t m r t m s f c is 5 52 smaller because of the larger sfc and t k t ρ n 2 d 4 is 7 9 smaller thus 1 t m is larger the open water characteristics and ship resistance show that the propeller performances of model and full scale are almost same since various aspects including laminar or turbulent flow reynolds scaling effects and roughness counteract each other but the wake flow scale effect is large in self propulsion simulations assuming that resistance reduction can be compensated by sfc the thrust coefficients of model and full scale ships are the same so the advance coefficients obtained using the thrust identity method will be equal however because of the smaller wake factor the full scale rotation speed will be larger the same conclusion can be obtained from w t 1 j n d p u 0 that is the rotation speed and the advance speed are larger in the full scale case and thus the wake factor will be smaller for a specific solver the discretized propeller is generally considered to be the most reliable and the comparison of different body force models are supposed to be based on the discretized propeller results as seen in table 11 the descriptive body force is difficult to obtain correct self propulsion parameters because of the approximate advance velocity the vessel velocity was taken here oum used the local instantaneous velocity thus results using oum is a lot better than descriptive body force however c l and c d from two dimensional airfoils without considering viscous effects were used in oum while modified oum used the actual ones considering the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller therefore it s more accurate for modified oum body force method to predict self propulsion parameters by comparing the body force results with the discretized propeller see table 11 it can be found that all the self propulsion factors of the body force simulations are smaller except for 1 t s the smaller value of 1 w t in the body force simulations indicates that the acceleration effect of the discretized propeller is greater as shown in fig 23 according to bernoulli s principle for the body force model the pressure at the tail of the hull is larger so the resistance is lower and the rotation speed decreases the advance velocity v a v 1 w t of the body force model is 2 01 less than with the discretized propeller and the rotation speed is 0 94 lower therefore the advance velocity coefficient j v a n d will be smaller however all the differences are less than 2 which demonstrates the reliability of the modified oum body force model for full scale self propulsion predictions in addition propeller thrust of full scale body force and discretized propeller within one rotation period had been compared in fig 24 and radial blade thrust distributions for discretized propeller at 0 90 180 a n d 270 were given in fig 25 the body force is a kind of average concept and the thrust distribution remained almost unchanged after convergence which was very similar to the time averaged thrust distribution of discretized propeller as seen in fig 25 fig 26 shows fft analysis of propeller thrust for full scale discretized propeller peaks of thrust take place at 1st 2nd and 3rd blade frequency bf at high frequency range blade frequency 8 865 hz rps 1 773 rps number of propeller blades 5 the other peak frequencies may be caused by ship wake or coupling effect the body force is a kind of average concept and the discrete body of body force is a steady cylinder which makes it impossible to discover 5 periodic signals caused by 5 blades as shown in fig 24 fig 27 depicts the vortex structure of the wake flow measured by the second invariant of the iso surface at q 300 feng et al 2020a and colored according to relative helicity the body force method averages the velocity and flow field and the discretized propeller captures the detailed propeller flow features for body force methods where it is not necessary to consider the space continuity of the propeller model the time step δ t 0 005 l p p u 0 of the resistance computations in calm water is considered while 2 propeller rotation per time step for discretized propeller ittc 2011 in addition the body force model 12 5 wall clock hours were taken with δ t 0 09 s and 48 parallel processes reduces the computation time by a factor of 50 562 wall clock hours were taken with time step δ t 0 003 s and 72 parallel processes for discretized propeller 6 conclusions in the present study urans simulations were carried out to determine the full scale self propulsion performance using inhouse cfd code the discretized propeller and modified oum body force model were selected to simulate the model full scale self propulsion of the kcs model before the full scale self propulsion simulations uncertainty analysis was performed on the full scale kcs hull and kp505 propeller additionally the effect of roughness on the full scale simulation was examined we discussed how the modified oum body force model could be used for full scale self propulsion simulations the body force results were compared with the extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and the discretized propeller simulation results moreover the scale effect was discussed by comparing the open water resistance and self propulsion simulation results at different scales by analyzing and comparing the simulated self propulsion indexes against efd predictions the following conclusions were obtained 1 the differences of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient for open water simulations are less than 1 54 and 3 01 which indicated that the performance of the model scale modified oum body force method is close to that of the full scale discretized propeller which the roughness was considered according to the literature castro et al 2011 the model scale body force coefficients can be substituted into the full scale propeller for self propulsion simulations 2 results of full scale self propulsion simulation using the modified oum are closer to extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and simulation results with the discretized propeller 3 the self propulsion parameters of efd model scale and full scale predictions are in good agreement with each other whose differences are less than 4 the simulation results using both the body force method and the discretized propeller are almost identical to those given by cfdship iowa 4 5 thus using modified oum body force to predict full scale self propulsion performance is reliable in this paper the modified oum shows higher accuracy for full scale self propulsion simulation than other two body forces for inhouse urans solver 4 the greater acceleration effect of the discretized propeller affecting the stern wake and pressure distribution result in 2 higher wake factor 0 72 lower thrust deduction and 0 82 higher rotation speed than the modified oum body force the differences of the self propulsion parameters due to the slightly different wake caused by different propulsions are less than 2 5 comparing with the discretized propulsion model modified oum body force can greatly reduce the computation time at about 1 50 data availability

20296,self propulsion free running ship simulation is most closely similar to the running ship for different operating condition without any simplification of the ship hull and appendages accurate evaluations of self propulsion performance are vitally important in the design of hull propeller systems this paper describes unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations to determine the self propulsion performance of a full scale container ship with a kp505 propeller an inhouse code is used to solve the rans equations with a discretized propeller descriptive body force oum osaka university method and modified oum body force methods selected as the propulsion models the modified oum body force method couples blade element momentum theory considering the three dimensional viscous effects with the rans solver before the full scale self propulsion simulations uncertainty analyses are performed on the full scale hull and the propeller the effect of roughness on the full scale simulations is also studied we discuss how the modified oum body force method can be used for full scale self propulsion simulations and show that the model scale body force can be substituted into the full scale rough propeller in the self propulsion simulations the body force results are compared with extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and simulation results with the discretized propeller in this paper the modified oum shows higher accuracy for full scale self propulsion simulation than other two body forces for inhouse urans solver moreover the scale effect is discussed by comparing open water resistance and self propulsion simulations at different scales the open water and resistance results show that the propeller scale effect can be ignored whereas both the wake flow and skin friction correction have large scale effects the self propulsion scale effect is mainly reflected in the wake factor thrust deduction factor and rotation speed for the container ship considered herein the full scale wake fraction is smaller than the model scale prediction whereas the rotational speed and thrust deduction factor are greater keywords full scale self propulsion discretized propeller body force model scale effect 1 introduction the accurate evaluation of full scale ship self propulsion performance is important in the design of hull propeller systems traditionally the results of scaled model tests are used to predict full scale performance in recent years an increasing number of scholars have used computational fluid dynamics cfd to predict the ship self propulsion performance cfd is a high fidelity method based on physical principles and yields results that are typically highly accurate with almost no need for empirical inputs guo et al 2018 cfd simulations of ship self propulsion not only reduce the testing time and cost but also provide more information about ship flow ship waves and other details related to a ship s hydrodynamic performance feng et al 2020a therefore cfd is an effective approach for predicting and assessing the self propulsion performance shen and korpus 2015 conducted self propulsion simulations for a japan bulk carrier and course keeping simulations for the office of naval research tumblehome ship using an overset grid technique developed for openfoam the results were found to be in good agreement with experimental results machado and augusto 2018 performed self propulsion simulations using the british and continental methods the british method was found to have higher accuracy whereas the continental method required less computation time kinaci et al 2018 selected one submarine darpa suboff and two vessels korea research institute of ships and ocean container ship kcs and duisburg test case dtc on the free surface to obtain their self propulsion points using cfd they found that the simulation results were in accordance with experimental fluid dynamics efd data and numerical results from other studies wang et al 2019 investigated submarine flow and propeller wake for darpa suboff near free surface using efd and cfd approaches the propeller model is a key component in the correct prediction of hull propeller interactions broglia et al 2013 a body force model and a discretized propeller model are the two most common approaches for self propulsion simulations a discretized propeller can easily capture the detailed flow features around propeller blades however to ensure continuities in space and reliable simulation results a higher mesh resolution and smaller time step is required which leads to complex meshes and longer simulation times the body force method makes self propulsion simulations easier and quicker when the detailed propeller flow is not essential such as in the interaction of propeller hull rudder systems feng et al 2020b guo et al 2020 proposed a new method based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations combined with a boundary element method bem iterative body force to calculate the self propulsion point the calculation results were in good agreement with model test results showing that self propulsion simulations could be used in the early stages of ship design su 2018 used three methods to implement the coupled bem rans formulation unsteady time averaged non axisymmetric and time averaged axisymmetric methods these methods were validated by several simple cases and then applied to the hull propeller rudder interactions and contra rotating propeller simulations the unsteady bem rans scheme reduced the mesh preparation cost by 50 and increased the calculation speed by a factor of six enabling rapid performance assessments of propeller design and multiple changes during the design period generally most self propulsion simulations are based on scale models and remain the same as experimental systems the results of scale models are then used to predict the full scale self propulsion performance the scale effect results in differences between the full scale prediction and reality because of different reynolds numbers to enhance the prediction accuracy full scale ship simulations using accurate and reliable viscous flow solvers are necessary visonneau 2005 in addition the treatment of the grid and the free surface as well as the roughness and the wall function are important factors in full scale simulations to encourage cfd full scale simulations peric 2019 had analyzed wall boundary layer requirements and reynolds number effects full scale simulations are proven to be no more computationally expensive than at model scale also the accuracy of the full scale simulation results is no lower than the efd extrapolation in many cases full scale prediction is even more reliable than scaling up model experiments especially at subcritical reynolds numbers baltazar et al 2019 predicted the propeller performance at different reynolds numbers and discussed the propeller scale effects and the influence of the turbulence and transition models on the performance prediction sun et al 2019 2020 performed numerical study on hull propeller and free surface interaction for model and full scale and then the scale effect was analyzed by comparing the overall performance with local flow fields and detailed vortex identification using the rans method with a double model and a volume of fluid model considering roughness and free surface effects the full scale ship self propulsion simulation results were in excellent agreement with sea trial results mikkelsen and walther 2020 modified the wall functions and included roughness into the cfd model to perform full scale cfd self propulsion simulations of a ro ro vessel and a general cargo vessel by comparing the simulation results using the new roughness inclusion method and empirical formulas with speed trial measurements they found that the inclusion of the roughness model in the cfd simulations improved the accuracy of full scale ship self propulsion simulations kok et al 2020 undertook a cfd based study of the unsteady rans urans formulation to investigate the scale effect in self propelled dtc squat the benchmark efd data and the landweber empirical predictions were used to validate the model and full scale simulations by comparing the model full scale cfd and model scale benchmark efd squat results it was shown that the scale effect was negligible jasak et al 2019 selected two full scale ships to conduct cfd validation and grid sensitivity studies of full scale ship self propulsion comparisons with sea trial data showed that direct numerical simulations of full scale ship performance were feasible nobuaki et al 2020 investigated the capability of viscous cfd to estimate full scale stern wake by conducting viscous cfd analysis for two merchant ships the surface roughness was found to affect powering estimation nominal and total wake distributions finally several common practices were suggested for predicting stern flow using full scale viscous cfd simulation based on the ittc procedures currently there are few examples of the body force method being used for full scale self propulsion simulations as it is not clear whether this approach is applicable to different scales or how it should be applied to full scale simulations this paper describes simulations of the full scale kcs self propulsion using two methods a discretized propeller and the modified oum body force model feng et al 2020b firstly uncertainty analysis is separately applied to the full scale kcs hull and the kp505 propeller then we discuss how the modified oum body force model could be used for full scale self propulsion simulations and compare the body force results with extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and the simulation results using the discretized propeller moreover the scale effect is discussed by comparing open water resistance and self propulsion simulation results at different scales all computations are carried out using an inhouse cfd code to solve the rans equations coupled with two degree of freedom 2dof solid body motion equations including heave and pitch the rans equations are solved using a finite difference method and pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso arithmetic the computations use a structured grid with overset technology the full scale simulations include the effect of roughness in the multi layer wall function 2 computational method the cfd simulations considered resistance propeller open water and self propulsion scenarios for both model and full scale cases the simulations were conducted using our inhouse cfd code which has been validated by numerous simulations for various propellers ships and underwater vehicles guo et al 2018 feng et al 2020a 2020b zhang et al 2020 the urans approach with a two equation eddy viscosity model namely the shear stress transport k ω model menter 1994 was selected for turbulence modeling the viscous flow with a free surface was solved by the single phase level set method the inhouse cfd code discretizes

proportional and integral constants generally estimated by the empirical formula p i n δ t 500 feng et al 2020b 2 1 governing equations and propulsion models the rans equations can be obtained by time averaging the continuity equation and the momentum conservation equation 2 u i x i 0 3 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 1 ρ x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j f b i where u i is the component of reynolds averaged

models of the hull and propeller are directly created and then discretized into the mesh models as shown in fig 1 a different mesh models for the hull propeller refinements and numerical tank are handled by the structured dynamic overset grid technique to obtain the final computational model this model is solved by rans coupled with a 2dof motion equation to give the overall motion of the hull and propeller in iterative steps after the hull and propeller grids have moved to their new position and attitude the next iterative step is solved to ensure spatial continuity of the discretized propeller model the propeller rotates 2 per time step δ t 2 360 n ittc 2014 for the body force model the rans solution for the propeller is omitted the body force source term f b i is added in the momentum equation to replace the propeller the different body forces are determined by obtaining the body force source term the field of descriptive body force are distributed over the cylindrical virtual disk following the goldstein optimum along the propeller radius and the body force source term is computed from the thrust and torque coefficients k t and k q generally described to polynomials about j v a n d p 4 k t o r k q a j 3 b j 2 c j d in this paper the coefficients for kp505 are tabulated in table 1 based on blade element momentum theory the blade thrust and torque of

the overall thrust t and torque q are obtained by integrating the individual contribution of each element dt and dq traditionally oum obtained c l and c d from two dimensional airfoils using empirical formulas or potential flow methods without considering viscous effects the modified oum body force model feng et al 2020b follows oum with however an important modified regarding acquisition of c l and c d to obtain the distribution of c l and c d both the propeller blade and the propeller plane are divided into 10 parts from open water cases using discretized propeller discretizing blade is to obtain the average force dt and moment dq on each part and discretizing propeller plane is to obtain the average axial speed on each part as shown in fig 2 the average tangential velocity on each part is also obtained in a similar way then using equation 5 8 the average c l and c d of equivalent airfoil of each part can be gotten velocity component chord length dt and dq are known with this way as seen in fig 1 b the modified oum body force model is based on blade element momentum theory and considers the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller in the modified oum body force model c l and c d can be written as equation 9 11 9 c l k α s i n α c α 10 c d k 1 c l 2 k 2 11 k α c α k 1 k 2 1 152 5 723 0 047 0 216 9 267 5 944 0 278 0 170 0 199 0 972 0 009 0 032 1 589 0 323 0 037 0 177 c r 3 c r 2 c r 1 where k α c α k 1 k 2 determine the performance of the propeller the lift coefficient c l and the drag coefficient c d and are related to the propeller parameters α is the angle of attack feng et al 2020b in addition the vessel velocity or modified vessel velocity using nominal wake fraction in calm water is usually used for the descriptive body force as the advance velocity while the local instantaneous velocity is used for oum and modified oum body force in every iteration step 2 2 wall function model the flow in the boundary layer consists of a viscous sublayer log layer and outer region in the viscous sublayer the dimensionless speed u varies linearly with the dimensionless distance from the wall y 12 u y for a smooth wall u and l n y have a linear relationship in the log layer 13 u ln e y κ where u u u τ y y u τ μ u τ τ ω ρ is the friction velocity κ is von karman s constant e is a constant and τ ω is the shear stress on the wall this relation is called the law of the wall in the numerical method if the flow in the boundary layer can be captured the initial thickness of the grid is assumed to be smaller than the viscous sublayer usually y 5 is required because the viscous sublayer is very thin the thickness of the boundary layer for full scale simulations will be thinner than that of the model scale case because the full scale reynolds number r e 10 9 is much higher than that of the model scale case r e 10 6 10 7 in inhouse cfd code the near wall grid spacing δ s can be calculated by ittc 2011 14 δ s 8 6 y l r e 13 14 thus the near wall grid spacing δ s in the full scale case should be two orders of magnitude smaller than that in the model scale simulations for the same y to obtain accurate numerical results the aspect ratio of the grid cannot be too large thus the surface grid spacing of the wall in the full scale simulations is very small and this method is sensitive to the grid spacing this significantly increases the computational cost to solve this problem the wall function is used as this allows the initial thickness of the grid to be less than the log layer where 30 y 200 this greatly reduces the resolution near the wall and improves the stability and convergence of the calculations in this study a multi layer wall function model bhushan et al 2009 is used relationship of u and y can be written as 15 u y a 0 a 1 y a 2 y 2 a 3 y 3 a 4 y 4 δ b 1 κ ln y b δ b 0 y 5 5 y 30 y 30 16 δ b κ 1 ln 1 k 3 5 where the multi layer model is developed using curve fitting fourth order polynomial as adopted by tsan hsing et al 2003 and a 0 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 equal to 1 875736 1 8158144 0 102066044 0 00295224178 and 0 000033144178 respectively are the fourth order polynomial coefficients for the buffer layer bhushan et al 2009 we fix κ 0 41 b 5 1 and use δ b to account for the effect of wall roughness resulting in the downshift of the log layer region knobloch and fernholz 2004 k u τ k s v is the dimensionless surface roughness based on the roughness length k s in this study k s 32 μm for the hull and propeller castro et al 2011 y 1 for the model scale simulations and y 80 for the full scale simulations 2 3 skin friction correction when model scale simulations are extrapolated to the full scale case the skin friction correction sfc factor must be added to the thrust sfc accounts for the reduced resistance of friction in full scale scenarios with respect to the model scale ittc 2014 17 s f c 1 k c f m c f s δ c f where the model and full scale friction factors c f m and c f s are calculated using the ittc 57 method c f 0 075 l o g 10 r e 2 2 u m and s m are the model scale ship velocity and static wetted area respectively k is the form factor which corrects for the fact that c f is actually the friction coefficient for a flat plate and the experimental form factor 1 k 1 1 is used in the simulations the roughness allowance δ c f 0 00027 corresponds to a roughness length of k s 32 μm thus s f c 1 3294 10 3 for the model scale propulsion simulations tokyo cfd workshop 2015 3 computational domain and grids the computational ship and propeller models are kcs and kp505 with scale ratios of 1 31 6 and 1 1 respectively the open water resistance and self propulsion experimental data associated with these models are available from the tokyo cfd workshop 2015 for the resistance and self propulsion simulations the inlet boundary should be located 1 2 l p p away from the hull and the outlet should be placed 3 5 l p p downstream ittc 2011 according to the previous studies feng et al 2020a ittc 2011 the side boundary is supposed to set about 1 l p p from centreplane while the bottom boundary is set at least 1 l p p from baseplane in addition to prevent the water depth from affecting the simulations the underwater depth of the computational domain should be sufficient for open water it is also necessary to avoid the influence of the free surface on the propeller simulations according to previous studies using inhouse cfd code the computational domain and the boundary conditions for open water and self propulsion simulations using a discretized propeller are set as shown in figs 3 and 4 in this study the front end of the computational domain along the x axis direction is set to the inlet boundary condition while the rear end is an exit boundary the top is assigned the zero pressure condition and the bottom is set to the zero pressure gradient condition the two side boundaries are assigned zero gradient conditions these boundary conditions are selected with reference to the most accurate and fastest solution in similar simulations using inhouse cfd code the zero gradient boundary condition is used to avoid a velocity gradient between the fluid and the wall for zero pressure the dynamic pressure p ˆ 0 and for zero pressure gradient the pressure gradient p n 0 which represents infinite water depth and infinite air conditions respectively the structured dynamic overset grid technology was used for all simulations reported in this paper the structured dynamic overset grids are used for all simulations in this paper which are dealt with by the self developed code in house overset grid code is based on the grid point overset of structured grid and consists of three steps hole cutting identiﬁcation of the interpolation points and identiﬁcation of the donor cells the hole mapping method based on cartesian coordinate grid of uniform structured grid is adopted for hole cutting the donors of interpolation points are found using adt an alternative digital tree based on the data structure while the relationship between the donor points and interpolation points is obtained by trilinear interpolation method li and yan 2005 zhang et al 2020 as the near wall grid spacing δ s in the full scale case should be two orders of magnitude smaller than for the model scale case at the same y a value of y 1 was selected for the model scale simulations and a value of y 80 was used in the full scale simulations thus the initial grid relative thickness of the full scale model was about 3 4 times thinner than for the model scale simulations as shown in fig 5 to ensure the appropriate aspect ratio of the grid the full scale case requires a finer surface grid as shown in fig 6 to capture the detailed flow around the hull and the propeller the refinements shown in figs 7 9 were used in the simulations the ability to freely refine the mesh according to the specific case is a major advantage of overset grids 4 validation and verification uncertainty analyses of the model scale hull propeller and body force have been implemented in previous studies feng et al 2020a before the full scale self propulsion simulations the present computational method was verified and validated to improve the computational efficiency the verification and validation study was conducted separately for the full scale hull and propeller the grid distributions of the hull and the propeller were then maintained in the self propulsion simulations 4 1 numerical uncertainty verification is defined as the process of assessing the numerical uncertainty u s n according to the various procedures stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 it is assumed that the numerical uncertainty u s n is composed of the iteration uncertainty u i grid space uncertainty u g time step uncertainty u t and an uncertainty term representing other parameters u p for inhouse cfd code u i and u p have been verified by numerous computations and can be neglected hence u g and u t are of most concern for inhouse cfd code simulations the numerical uncertainty u s n can be estimated as 18 u s n 2 u g 2 u t 2 in this paper the propeller thrust and torque are analyzed to verify and validate the propeller model whereas the total resistance is selected for the kcs hull model richardson s extrapolation method can be used to carry out a systematic analysis of the grid spacing and the time step first the uniform parameter refinement ratio r k between solutions is calculated as 19 r k δ x 2 δ x 1 δ x 3 δ x 2 where δ x 1 δ x 2 and δ x 3 are the coarse medium and fine grid spacings or time steps respectively we set s 1 s 2 and s 3 to be the results of the coarse medium and fine grid spacings or time steps respectively then ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 reflect the changes when moving from medium fine and from coarse medium solutions the convergence ratio r is defined as 20 r ε 32 ε 21 there are three convergence situations that can be judged by the r value 1 monotonic convergence mc 0 r 1 2 oscillatory convergence oc r 0 4 2 divergence d 1 r when monotonic convergence is achieved richardson s extrapolation method can be used the estimated numerical error δ r e and order of accuracy p r e can be calculated as 21 δ r e ε 32 r k p r e 1 22 p r e ln ε 21 ε 32 l n r k 4 3 the correction factor c g is defined as 23 c g r k p r e 1 r k p t h 1 where p t h is an estimated value for the limiting order of accuracy as the spacing size goes to zero generally p t h 2 the numerical error δ s n benchmark result s c and uncertainty u g t can be estimated as 24 δ s n c g δ r e 25 s c s δ s n 26 u g t 2 4 1 c g 2 0 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 25 1 c g δ r e 1 c g 0 25 27 u g t 9 6 1 c g 2 1 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 125 2 1 c g 1 δ r e 1 c g 0 125 fig 10 shows the three grid cases used for the grid uncertainty study of the full scale smooth kp505 propeller the surface grid density volume growth rate and number of grid layers vary between the coarse medium and fine grids according to a grid refinement ratio of 2 the specific dimensions of the three grid cases are listed in table 2 for the hull model the same method is used with a grid refinement ratio of 2 3 feng et al 2020c working conditions of j 0 8 for the propeller and f r 0 26 for the hull were selected for the numerical uncertainty analysis for the time step sensitivity analysis 2 propeller rotation per time step was selected for the medium time step with a refinement ratio of 2 while 0 005 l p p u 0 was set for the medium time step for the hull with a refinement ratio of 2 the results of the full scale kp505 and kcs simulations with the different grids and time steps are listed in tables 3 and 4 the grid sensitivity study is based on the medium time step for both the grid spacing and time step analyses the convergence factor r was between 0 and 1 indicating that monotonic convergence was achieved and richardson s extrapolation method could be used from table 5 it can be observed that the uncertainties for the propeller thrust were 2 173 d grid spacing and 0 071 d time step while those for the torque were 0 559 d grid spacing and 2 264 d time step where d denotes the experimental data the uncertainties for the hull were 4 926 d grid spacing and 0 924 d time step the results indicate that the force is more sensitive to the grid spacing while the torque is more sensitive to the time step 4 4 validation based on extrapolation of efd data the comparison error e is defined as the difference between the experimental data d and the numerical result s in the full scale case d is the extrapolation castro et al 2011 of the efd data 28 e d s to determine whether the model has been validated e is compared to the validation uncertainty u v given by 29 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 the results of the validation study are presented in table 6 validation requires the uncertainty of the experimental data u d but this is not known for full scale kcs and kp505 simulations therefore u d for the kcs model scale test was used for the full scale uncertainty and u d for the propeller was assumed to be 1 00 d the results of this validation study show that all the comparison errors e are less than the validation uncertainty u v which validates the computation results at the u v level 5 results and discussion of different propulsion models 5 1 model and full scale kcs resistance resistance simulations were conducted for model and full scale smooth hulls and a full scale rough hull as shown in fig 11 the free surfaces of the model and full scale kcs are very similar although some differences can be observed at the tail the results of for the model and full scale smooth kcs hull at f r 0 26 are compared in table 7 both sets of results are in good agreement with the experimental values table 8 compares the full scale rough hull with the extrapolated model test data the sfc obtained by direct cfd simulations is much smaller than the experimental value which will have a significant impact on the self propulsion predictions the wake flow in the propeller plane is very important fig 12 shows that the wake fraction for the full scale ship is smaller than that from the model scale simulations where the plane locates at the propeller plane the plane center at x l p p 0 9825 z l p p 0 02913 to describe the wake flow in detail the circular probe shown in fig 13 was used the circle was divided into 120 parts with equal intervals of 3 fig 14 shows the axial velocity distributions of the model and full scale simulations the wake flow is in good agreement with the experimental data as shown in fig 15 30 w n 1 u a u 31 u a 0 3 r 1 0 r 0 2 π u d θ d r a u 32 u w 0 3 r 1 0 r 0 2 π u u d θ d r a u where w n is the wake factor u a is the advance speed u is the ship velocity a is the area of the propeller plane u is the velocity of each probe point u is the average velocity over a radius and u w is the wake nonuniformity factor fig 16 shows the wake and wake nonuniformity distributions of the model and full scale simulations along a radius the wake factors of the model and full scale cases were calculated to be 0 269 and 0 151 respectively whereas the wake nonuniformity factors were 0 223 and 0 115 respectively the main reason for the difference in the wake flow between the model and full scale simulations is the different boundary layers caused by different reynolds numbers as shown in fig 17 the full scale boundary layer is obviously thinner than that in the model scale case u a u 0 9 is defined as the boundary layer in this paper the thinner boundary layer enhances the velocity gradient and leads to greater axial velocities although the flow separation decreases and the wake field becomes more uniform 5 2 model and full scale open water computations of different propulsion models we define the following coefficients advance coefficient 33 j v a n d thrust coefficient 34 k t t ρ n 2 d 4 torque coefficient 35 k q q ρ n 2 d 5 open water efficiency 36 η k t k q j 2 π where v a is the advance speed of the propeller n is the rotation speed d is the propeller diameter t is the thrust and q is the torque similar to the resistance simulations open water simulations were conducted using the model and full scale smooth propeller and the full scale rough propeller open water for modified oum body force has been simulated in a previous study feng et al 2020a according to model tests tokyo cfd workshop 2015 values of 3 5 j m s and 14 r s were selected as the incoming flow velocity and rotation speed respectively assuming that the advance velocity coefficient and froude number are the same in the full and model scale cases the full scale open water working conditions can be obtained as shown in table 9 the simulated open water characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental data the performance of the propeller can be accurately simulated by the modified oum body force method fig 18 shows open water characteristics of model and full scale kp505 while fig 19 gives the differences between model scale results calculated by discretized propeller and modified oum body force and full scale smooth rough results k t and k q are larger and smaller respectively in the full scale smooth results than at the model scale discretized propeller as shown in figs 18 and 19 however the differences are less than 1 84 and 2 37 for the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient respectively the rough surface will decrease the thrust of the propeller increase the torque and reduce the efficiency which together act to make the performance of the model scale propeller closer to that of the full scale rough propeller as seen in fig 19 the differences of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient between full scale rough propeller and body force are less than 1 54 and 3 01 respectively a comparison of the model scale modified oum body force method and the full scale rough propeller shows that it is reasonable for the model scale body force to be used in full scale rough self propulsion simulations in addition the pressure distributions of the model and full scale propellers are very similar as shown in figs 20 and 21 thus the scale effects on the propeller characteristics can be ignored 5 3 model and full scale self propulsion computations of kcs with different propulsion models the thrust deduction factor can be written as 37 t m t m r t m s f c t m for the model scale simulations and as 38 t s t s r t s t s for the full scale case the self propulsion wake factor is calculated as 39 w t 1 j n d u where t and r t denote the thrust of the propeller and the resistance of the ship respectively j is the advance velocity coefficient which is generally obtained by interpolation using the thrust identity method ittc 2014 n is the rotation speed of the propeller d is the diameter of propeller and u is the ship velocity in the self propulsion simulations the pi control method was used to match the propeller rotation speed at f r 0 26 where the target velocities for the model and full scale cases were 2 2 m s and 24 kn according to the model tests s f c 1 3294 10 3 was used to compensate the reduced resistance in the model scale simulations the discretized propeller model and different body force models were adopted for the full scale simulations upon comparing the ship speeds and propeller rotational speeds of discretized propeller model and the modified oum body force the body force was found to reach the self propulsion point fastest as shown in fig 22 the non dimensionalized time t t u l the controlled target was vessel velocity according to mathematical model of typical second order system in controls logic the shape of the speed curves of fig 22 showed that the system damping ratios of the model scale the full scale discretized propeller and body force method were sequentially reduced and the full scale body force system seemed to be near the optimal damping ratio which might be caused by different propulsion models and time steps of course it s possible for discretized propeller model to reach of the optimal damping ratio and converge faster by adjusting pid values the self propulsion simulation and experimental extrapolated results were made dimensionless to enable comparison see tables 10 and 11 where table 10 showed the comparison between this study using discretized propeller the literature and the experimental extrapolated and table 11 showed the comparison of full scale kcs self propulsion computation results using different propulsion models the dimensionless rotation speed is given by n n u l in table 10 both the experimental extrapolation and simulated results from the literature were used to confirm the credibility of full scale data using inhouse cfd code as shown in table 10 the simulation results using discretized propeller for inhouse urans code were almost identical to those given by cfdship iowa 4 5 castro et al 2011 moreover the differences between the efd model scale and full scale predictions are less than 5 therefore it is reasonable to extrapolate the model scale self propulsion results to full scale ships and it is credible to simulate full scale ship self propulsion using inhouse cfd code by comparing the model scale simulation predictions with the full scale results it can be found that the scale effect is mainly reflected in the self propulsion wake factor thrust deduction factor and rotation speed the sfc obtained by direct cfd simulations s f c 1 1380 10 3 was much smaller than the experimental value s f c 1 3294 10 3 a larger value of sfc means that for model scale simulations the predicted thrust t and the rotation speed will be smaller taking j v a n d the model scale value of v a is 11 56 smaller than in the full scale simulations and the rotation speed is 4 19 smaller thus the model scale j and k t are smaller and larger respectively than in the full scale case from the expression 1 t m r t m s f c t m r t m s f c is 5 52 smaller because of the larger sfc and t k t ρ n 2 d 4 is 7 9 smaller thus 1 t m is larger the open water characteristics and ship resistance show that the propeller performances of model and full scale are almost same since various aspects including laminar or turbulent flow reynolds scaling effects and roughness counteract each other but the wake flow scale effect is large in self propulsion simulations assuming that resistance reduction can be compensated by sfc the thrust coefficients of model and full scale ships are the same so the advance coefficients obtained using the thrust identity method will be equal however because of the smaller wake factor the full scale rotation speed will be larger the same conclusion can be obtained from w t 1 j n d p u 0 that is the rotation speed and the advance speed are larger in the full scale case and thus the wake factor will be smaller for a specific solver the discretized propeller is generally considered to be the most reliable and the comparison of different body force models are supposed to be based on the discretized propeller results as seen in table 11 the descriptive body force is difficult to obtain correct self propulsion parameters because of the approximate advance velocity the vessel velocity was taken here oum used the local instantaneous velocity thus results using oum is a lot better than descriptive body force however c l and c d from two dimensional airfoils without considering viscous effects were used in oum while modified oum used the actual ones considering the three dimensional viscous effect of the propeller therefore it s more accurate for modified oum body force method to predict self propulsion parameters by comparing the body force results with the discretized propeller see table 11 it can be found that all the self propulsion factors of the body force simulations are smaller except for 1 t s the smaller value of 1 w t in the body force simulations indicates that the acceleration effect of the discretized propeller is greater as shown in fig 23 according to bernoulli s principle for the body force model the pressure at the tail of the hull is larger so the resistance is lower and the rotation speed decreases the advance velocity v a v 1 w t of the body force model is 2 01 less than with the discretized propeller and the rotation speed is 0 94 lower therefore the advance velocity coefficient j v a n d will be smaller however all the differences are less than 2 which demonstrates the reliability of the modified oum body force model for full scale self propulsion predictions in addition propeller thrust of full scale body force and discretized propeller within one rotation period had been compared in fig 24 and radial blade thrust distributions for discretized propeller at 0 90 180 a n d 270 were given in fig 25 the body force is a kind of average concept and the thrust distribution remained almost unchanged after convergence which was very similar to the time averaged thrust distribution of discretized propeller as seen in fig 25 fig 26 shows fft analysis of propeller thrust for full scale discretized propeller peaks of thrust take place at 1st 2nd and 3rd blade frequency bf at high frequency range blade frequency 8 865 hz rps 1 773 rps number of propeller blades 5 the other peak frequencies may be caused by ship wake or coupling effect the body force is a kind of average concept and the discrete body of body force is a steady cylinder which makes it impossible to discover 5 periodic signals caused by 5 blades as shown in fig 24 fig 27 depicts the vortex structure of the wake flow measured by the second invariant of the iso surface at q 300 feng et al 2020a and colored according to relative helicity the body force method averages the velocity and flow field and the discretized propeller captures the detailed propeller flow features for body force methods where it is not necessary to consider the space continuity of the propeller model the time step δ t 0 005 l p p u 0 of the resistance computations in calm water is considered while 2 propeller rotation per time step for discretized propeller ittc 2011 in addition the body force model 12 5 wall clock hours were taken with δ t 0 09 s and 48 parallel processes reduces the computation time by a factor of 50 562 wall clock hours were taken with time step δ t 0 003 s and 72 parallel processes for discretized propeller 6 conclusions in the present study urans simulations were carried out to determine the full scale self propulsion performance using inhouse cfd code the discretized propeller and modified oum body force model were selected to simulate the model full scale self propulsion of the kcs model before the full scale self propulsion simulations uncertainty analysis was performed on the full scale kcs hull and kp505 propeller additionally the effect of roughness on the full scale simulation was examined we discussed how the modified oum body force model could be used for full scale self propulsion simulations the body force results were compared with the extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and the discretized propeller simulation results moreover the scale effect was discussed by comparing the open water resistance and self propulsion simulation results at different scales by analyzing and comparing the simulated self propulsion indexes against efd predictions the following conclusions were obtained 1 the differences of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient for open water simulations are less than 1 54 and 3 01 which indicated that the performance of the model scale modified oum body force method is close to that of the full scale discretized propeller which the roughness was considered according to the literature castro et al 2011 the model scale body force coefficients can be substituted into the full scale propeller for self propulsion simulations 2 results of full scale self propulsion simulation using the modified oum are closer to extrapolated experimental data full scale simulation results from the literature and simulation results with the discretized propeller 3 the self propulsion parameters of efd model scale and full scale predictions are in good agreement with each other whose differences are less than 4 the simulation results using both the body force method and the discretized propeller are almost identical to those given by cfdship iowa 4 5 thus using modified oum body force to predict full scale self propulsion performance is reliable in this paper the modified oum shows higher accuracy for full scale self propulsion simulation than other two body forces for inhouse urans solver 4 the greater acceleration effect of the discretized propeller affecting the stern wake and pressure distribution result in 2 higher wake factor 0 72 lower thrust deduction and 0 82 higher rotation speed than the modified oum body force the differences of the self propulsion parameters due to the slightly different wake caused by different propulsions are less than 2 5 comparing with the discretized propulsion model modified oum body force can greatly reduce the computation time at about 1 50 data availability

20297,a flexible fishtail like fairing adopted as a flow induced vibration fiv suppressor was studied in a wind tunnel at reynolds number 4000 42000 it is shown the vortex induced vibration can be practically eliminated by using ftf the effect of the flexible plate length ratio l d d is the diameter of the cylinder and the fish hull angle α are investigated systematically a fish hull with small α could extend the synchronisation range but the effect is negligible with l prolonging the response patterns and peak amplitudes of the cylinder are closely related to l as well as the motion of the plate viv is found for l d 0 3 0 8 with mild deflection of the plate fiv can be suppressed up to 94 98 with l d 0 9 1 3 flow visualization shows the nearfield vortex shedding is suppressed by the deflected plate for l d 1 4 2 4 however galloping like instability is erupted when the vortex shedding frequency matches the 2f n f n the natural frequency of the system in air harmonic component in the flow field together with the dramatic flapping of the plate besides it seems that galloping like response is sustained by the vortex shedding controlled by the motion of the flexible plate keywords flow induced vibration wind tunnel experiment galloping like viv suppression flow visualization fishtail like fairing 1 introduction flow induced vibration fiv occurs when a cylinder or bluff structure immersed in steady cross flow velocity as the alternate vortex shedding from the structure may produce serious fluctuating pressure on the structure in ocean engineering this kind of fiv is in fact called as vortex induced vibration viv generally for an isolated circular cylinder if internal flow is not considered wang et al 2020 extensive fundamental studies about fiv have been performed in recent decades illustrated in the comprehensive review literatures of bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 sarpkaya 2004 and wang et al 2020 as the relatively large motion and fluid force due to fiv can be hazardous and cause severe damage to structures the suppression of fiv is of paramount importance to many engineering applications many studies focused on this topic have been performed various strategies have been proposed for the suppression of fiv via control of the unsteadiness of flow and communication of separated layers two kinds of suppression methods can be grouped active and passive based on whether requiring external energy input active suppression strategies require external energy for example blowing or suction of boundary layers min and choi 1999 steady rotation of the body mittal 2001 and heating of the structure wan and patnaik 2016 passive control methods are widely applied in engineering without external energy input they mainly focus on the modification of surface shape or property of the body and the use of additional bodies including fairing helical strakes control rod and splitter plates etc fairing devices and splitter plates based on the prior studies are known to stabilize the near wake or eliminate the vortex shedding with long characteristic length however fairing devices and splitter plates may induce severe galloping like vibrations under certain conditions assi et al 2009 2014 liang et al 2018a zhu and liu 2020 visualization of the flow field around the splitter plates l d 1 performed with piv revealed that the reattachment of the free shear layers on the tip of the plate is the hydrodynamic mechanism driving the severe excitation assi et al 2009 2014 assi and bearman 2015 according to the numerical study of zheng and wang 2017 fairing devices with long characteristic lengths is also prone to trigger galloping like vibration although the rigid attached splitter plate is capable of suppressing fiv at l d 2 8 stappenbelt 2010 shorter and simpler structures should be considered for engineering application therefore permeable splitter plates cardell 1993 free to rotate splitter plates cimbala and garg 1991 gu et al 2012 hinged rigid splitter plates assi et al 2009 and free to rotate short tail fairing assi et al 2014 have been proposed by some researchers suppressors for hinged rigid splitter plates or free to rotate splitter plates have the advantages of being omnidirectional realigning their orientation as the incoming flow angle changes however the dynamics of the free to rotate plate can be complicated as the splitter plate can rotate about the cylinder due to the unsteady fluid forces acting on it and it will certainly interfere with the wake for example using water channel experiments in r e 800 10000 shukla et al 2009 investigated the effect of two non dimensional parameters reynolds number r e and l d the measurements of tip amplitude shows that the vibration of splitter plate increases with reynolds numbers at low r e and reaches a saturation amplitude level at r e 4000 periodic vibrations occur for splitter plates l d 3 0 while there is a sharp reduction in tip amplitude with the vibration becoming aperiodic at l d 3 0 in the experiments of cimbala and garg 1991 assi et al 2009 gu et al 2012 the splitter plate would rotate to an off axis equilibrium angle the flow visualization of assi et al 2009 showed that the deflected plate could stabilize the near wake flow but an unwanted steady lift is found towards the side to which the plate has deflected for long free to rotate splitter plates the near field vortex shedding for the cylinder could also be eliminated as for fiv control assi et al 2009 found that the level of friction between the hinged or free to rotate splitter plate and the cylinder plays a key role in fiv suppression of elastically mounted cylinders with proper hinge friction the fiv of the cylinder is effectively suppressed with significant drag reduction as well but if the friction below a critical value vibrations of the cylinder would develop and if it increases above a limiting threshold galloping vibration is initiated assi et al 2014 also observed a galloping response of a circular cylinder when attached fixed splitter plates at plate length ratio of l d equals to 0 5 and 1 0 respectively wu et al 2014a performed the numerical investigation of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with a hinged flat plate l d 0 2 at r e 200 they found that if the vortex from the cylinder interacts with the vortex from the plate destructively fiv could be suppressed flexible devices have drawn much attention in recent years as an extension of hinged rigid splitter plates some pioneer work has been down on the effects of flexible devices in flow and fiv control of bluff structures and show a number of interesting features in the early water tunnel experiments of kwon et al 2002 drag reduction is found of a fixed cylinder attached with three flexible ribbons distributed uniformly the reduction of drag and lift is also found in the numerical work of xiao et al 2012 shukla et al 2013 studied a fully flexible splitter plate attached at the base of a fixed cylinder at r e 1800 10000 in a water channel two regimes of periodic vibrations are identified with r e increasing the normalized frequency of plate vibration in both periodic modes is found to be close to 0 2 which is close to the normalized vortex shedding frequency of a fixed cylinder they found that the vibration amplitude of the plate tip at a given length is determined by the non dimensional bending stiffness k wu et al 2014b numerically investigated the flow characters of an undulatory plate behind a fixed cylinder two different vortex interaction modes are found known as constructive interaction and destructive interaction the drag reduction is attributed to the vortex destructive interaction the effect of flexible plate length and flexibility are investigated in some numerical work lee and you 2013 and wang et al 2018 sahu et al 2019 found two deflection modes corresponding to the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate and the peak amplitude emerges when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first or second mode natural frequency lee and you 2013 pointed that the unsteady pressure core due to the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder arouses the vibration of the flexible plate but the vortex impingement from the upstream cylinder is believed to excite the first mode deflection of the plate while the second mode deflection is excited by high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow near the turn up part of the plate wang et al 2018 based on the review of this part k and the character length l of the flexible plate are found to be the key parameters in the study of a flexible plate located behind a fixed bluff body but what is the situation when it comes to an elastically mounted cylinder firmly attached with a flexible suppressor little work has been down on this topic as fiv of an elastically mounted cylinder attached with a flexible device is complicated either the numerical simulation or the experiment is difficult to be performed wu et al 2015 investigated the response of a cylinder attached with a flexible plate at a fixed reduced velocity 5 at r e 200 fiv suppression is achieved at a relatively long plate l 2 0 with medium flexibility latterly the numerical work of sahu et al 2019 with plate length mainly fixed at l d 3 5 in their study with r e 150 found that for low flexibility viv could be well suppressed while the cylinder and the plate tip vibrates in phase but galloping can be trigged at high flow velocity due to the reattachment of shear layers as illustrated in above very few studies have been down yet on the topic of fiv control using flexible devices and the computational studies are all at low r e in this paper an elastically cylinder attached with a fishtail like fairing ftf see fig 1 a simplification of a fish tail consists of a rigid hull and a flexible plate was studied using wind tunnel experiments the structure of ftf inspired by the locomotion of fishtail is a flexible device which is invented by wang and gu 2013 firstly and proved to be capable of reducing the drag force in the flow control experiments using a wind tunnel in this paper ftf is investigated deeply and we are trying to address the following questions what are the response characteristics of a cylinder attached with ftf how does the response characteristics are affected by the structure parameters such as the fish hull angle α and flexible fishtail length l or the overall length of the suppressor what are the underlying mechanisms of different response characteristics here we address above issues and with two structural parameters fish hull angle α 60 120 and fishtail length l d 0 to 2 4 respectively the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental set up is described experimental methodology validation for a single cylinder are given in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussion for the cylinder attached with ftf the conclusion of the work is drawn in section 5 2 experimental details the experiments were performed in the low speed wind tunnel at key laboratory of power machinery and engineering ministry of education shanghai jiao tong university the turbulent strength scale is less than 0 2 with a test section of 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in height and 2 0 m in length further details of the wind tunnel were introduced by gu et al 2012 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018a fig 2 shows a schematic of current experimental set up the cylinder model with d 50 mm was elastically mounted at both sides in the horizontal plane by two pairs of springs each consists of two identical springs made of stainless steel the springs were stretched long enough to overcome the influence of gravity and allow the model to vibrate in the transverse direction only the cylinder was made of plexiglass to keep low mass and excellent smoothness and the cylinder length l 540 mm with aspect ratio of 10 8 and blockage of 7 5 approximately ftf was firmly attached at the base of the cylinder fig 1 the rigid hull of ftf was made of a rigid aluminum sheet with thickness of 0 02d which is stiff enough to resist the bending moment of the flexible plate the aluminum sheet was firmly attached to the cylinder wall by thin double sides tape indicated by the red in the web version line in fig 1 and to make the cylinder wall smooth sellotape is covered to the cylinder wall where the fairing touches the cylinder indicated by the green in the web version line it should be mentioned that the influence of the fish hull angle was mainly concerned on present investigation hence b was fixed at 0 5d while the fish hull angle varied from 60 to 120 and the flexible fishtail is thin and light litmus paper sheets with thickness of about 0 1 mm which is proper here to make sure it being two dimensional deflection according to the experiments of liang et al 2018a the flexible fishtail length varied from 0 to 2 4d in present study the free stream velocity was in the range of 1 19 m s 12 47 m s in the current tests corresponding to the reynolds number r e 4000 42000 and the reduce velocity u r 2 4 25 0 according to the previous investigations about the dynamics of flexible plates stiffness ei mass density ρ s and thickness h of the flexible plate are the key parameters to understand its dynamics in the near wake behind a bluff body shukla et al 2013 hyeonseong et al 2017 yu et al 2017 liang et al 2018b in our experiments the stiffness of the flexible plate is found to be ei 8 6 10 5nm by measuring the deflection of the sheet under its own self weight the method for determining the flexural rigidity of the sheet has been widely adopted in the investigations of its dynamics shukla et al 2013 virot et al 2013 liang et al 2018b finally the mass density is also measured to be ρ s 1 386 103 kg m3 the vibration displacement y of the cylinder model was measured by a laser sensor il 300 keyence see fig 1 with a resolution of 0 1 mm the data acquisition was automated via customized labview programs and for each data set the signal was acquired at a sampling frequency of 1024 hz for 30 s the natural frequency f n and structural damping ζ of the system were measured by conducting a series of free decay tests in air in present study the mass ratio m s of the model the bare cylinder with rigid hull was 328 while f n 10 42hz the vibration amplitude a of the model was acquired by averaging the 10 peaks of the stable time series y while the vibration frequency f 0 was achieved through fast fourier transform fft of the time series y besides streamwise fluctuating velocities were measured through a hot wire probe dantec 55p11 which was placed behind the cylinder as shown in fig 2 the horizontal and vertical distances between the hot wire probe and cylinder remain unchanged 5d in horizontal and 0 75d in vertical sampling rate was set to be 1024hz and sampling duration was 20s for each record other parameters shown in the present study are summarized in table 1 to gain better insight into flow dynamics flow visualization by smoke wire technology was adopted the test section was illuminated in the middle x z plane fig 2 by a laser generator mw gl 532anm 8w 141402 a smoke generator was placed in front of the settling chamber of the wind tunnel a high speed imaging system photron fastcam ultima apx i2 was used to obtain clear images of the turbulent wake full 1024 1024 pixels image resolution and 6 14 fps imaging speed were chosen in the experiments 3 experimental methodology validation and viv of a bare cylinder to validate the present experimental methodology viv of a bare cylinder was tested preliminarily the non dimensional amplitude response a d of the present cylinder versus reduced velocity is shown in fig 3 a meanwhile several classical results of bare cylinders are also shown for comparison firstly it should be clarified that three or two response branches could be found depending on low in water see khalak and williamson 1999 or high in air see feng 1968 values of m in present experiment m is 308 which is commonly seen in the experiments performed in wind tunnels such as feng 1968 liang et al 2018a hence only the initial and lower branches can be found in present result as the wind velocity increases the amplitude of vibration increases monotonically and reaches the peak value 0 72d around u r 6 6 after that the vibration amplitude decreases continually and ceases at last as clarified by the previous study the response amplitude of a bare cylinder is closely related to the value of m ζ williamson and govardhan 2004 a higher m ζ often accompanied with a lower amplitude response in fig 3a the response amplitude of present cylinder is 0 72d with m ζ 0 164 which is close to the result of liang et al 2018 with m ζ 0 188 since the present value of m ζ is much lower than feng 1968 zhou et al 2011 the peak value of present result is higher than feng 1968 and zhou et al 2011 as well in fig 3b the maximum amplitude a max is displayed as a function of m ζ containing several experimental data performed by earlier investigators the green in the web version line represents a curve fit to the results of a large number of researchers compiled originally by griffin 1980 and updated by skop and balasubramanian 1997 as can be seen the current result can fit the curve very well the non dimensional vortex shedding frequencies f s f n for a bare cylinder is shown in fig 4 and f s is determined by the fft method based on the streamwise fluctuating velocities behind the suppressor devices a change from blue to red in the web version on the left graph of f s f n implies the dominant peaks of normalized power spectral density psd of the vortex shedding frequency the brighter the red in the web version represents the larger peaks of psd and the offset stack diagrams of the specifically corresponding variation of f s f n in the psd for each u r are shown on the right hand according to fig 4 the so called lock in emerges in u r 4 10 during lock in region the vortex shedding frequency f s is locked to the system natural frequency f n here the vortex shedding frequency f s was calculated by performing fft to the data measured through the hot wire probe then normalized at each reduced velocity the vortex shedding frequency f s remains equal to natural frequency f n in the lock in regime and once beyond the regime it is varying monotonically following strouhal number s t 0 17 very close to 0 2 bold line in white fig 4a when the cylinder is stationary in fig 4b we can see that for u r 4 89 in the initial branch only a 1 f n component equal to the natural frequency f n can be observed while 2f n component 3f n component and 4f n component are found for u r 5 76 and 7 49 and 2f n component 3f n component and 4f n component are related to different vortex shedding patterns belloli et al 2012 at the initial branch of the lock in region the cylinder oscillates at a small amplitude corresponding to 2s vortex shedding mode while the 2f n component and 4f n component emerges at the peak vibration amplitude which is related to 2p or p s shedding patterns 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall response amplitudes and patterns experiments were carried out with flexible plates length l d varying from 0 4 to 2 0 and fish hull α from 60 to 120 with an interval 15 response amplitudes versus u r for different combination of l d and α 60 90 120 are presented together with results for the bare cylinder in fig 5 in fact the response tendency for cases α 75 105 are not very different vigorous viv is observed for l d 0 4 0 5 and show a steeper response curve compared with the bare cylinder and two response branches are identified the initial and lower branch compared to a bare cylinder the initial branch is elongated while the lower branch is almost absent then the response amplitude is consecutively lowered down with l d increasing for l d 0 9 1 3 the oscillation is suppressed by 94 98 which demonstrates very high efficiency in controlling viv using the fishtail like fairing in fig 8 a the oscillation is almost eliminated for the medium plate length beyond this range however viv or galloping like response is observed in fact galloping like response is found for all fish hull angles with the further increase of plate length l d 1 3 and different from viv galloping like response persists with the dramatic flapping of flexible plates considering the literature of rigid suppressors the overall length of the rigid suppressor plays a key role in determining the response patterns it is naturally crucial to find out whether it is the same situation for current study as the fishtail like fairing consists of a rigid fish hull and the flexible plate the overall length for current suppressor can be defined as l o l h l l h is the distance from the cylinder base to the peak of the rigid hull l is the length of the flexible plate shown in fig 1 assi et al 2014 presents comparable results of a short tail fairing with overall length l o 0 5d as presented in fig 5g both the fishtail like fairing and the short tail fairing at l o 0 5d presents vigorous transverse oscillation that with increasing reduced velocity would apparently increase and halt suddenly at u r 17 but the peak amplitude for the short tail fairing is 2 1d while for fishtail like fairing the peak amplitude is 0 8d the much higher response amplitude in assi et al 2014 can be attributed to the much lower mass damping ratio mass damping ratios are 0 0051 0 175 in assi et al 2014 and present firstly to improve the understanding of the relationship between peak amplitudes and l d the peak amplitudes a max d versus the flexible plate length l d is shown below fig 6 the red in the web version line in fig 6 represents the peak amplitude of the bare cylinder it seems that the peak amplitudes for different fairing angles α can be collapsed in a black curve except for l d 0 4 for l d 0 8 the peak amplitudes of viv consecutively lowers down as l d prolonging and the suppression of viv is achieved in l d 0 9 1 3 however vigorous oscillation erupts with peak amplitudes larger than the bare cylinder with the further increase of l 1 3d it seems that the response amplitude is closely related to the length of the flexible plate l fig 7 presents the peak amplitudes versus the overall length l o d a max d can be very different indicated by the orange area for various fish hull angle α even at the same value of l o d this huge difference lies in the discrepancy of flexible plate length l in our experiments l h the characteristic length of rigid hull varied from 0 4d 0 06d with α 60 120 hence with the same value of l o d the difference of l can be as large as around 0 4d for different α from fig 6 the peak amplitudes of the cylinder changes significantly with l 0 4d this is reasonable as different vibration patterns happen for the flexible plate in different lengths when suffering from the wake flow as we will present in the next section while the rigid one is unable to give feedback and the different vibration patterns of the flexible plate will certainly interfere with the wake and produce different responses that is a fundamental difference between the flexible suppressor and the rigid one at l o 1 6d for example the flexible plate length is l 1 2d for α 60 while for α 105 the plate length is l 1 5d the oscillation is almost eliminated for l 1 2d α 60 and the flexible plate deflects to one side however galloping like response erupts at high u r for α 105 with the flexible plate flapping vigorously but it should be pointed out that the peak amplitudes for l d 0 4 are controlled by the overall length of the suppressor as the flexible plate is stiff enough to overcome the flow unsteadiness for l d 0 4 which means the flexible plate is similar to a rigid one based on discussion above it is reasonable to conclude that the response amplitudes are controlled by the flexible plate length rather than the overall length of the suppressor to better understand the suppression effect of ftf the contours of maximum response amplitudes versus fishtail length l and fish hull angle α are plotted in fig 8b the sketches of the three vibration patterns are also presented in fig 8d and three patterns of response could be roughly divided depending on combinations of l and α in detail pattern ⅰ locates within short flexible length l 0 9d in pattern ⅰ as the vortex shedding frequency f s matches the natural frequency f n the vibration is trigged and persists in limited velocities hence the vibration in pattern ⅰ is clarified as viv the maximum response amplitudes within this pattern are at the same level or higher than that of a bare cylinder and in present study in pattern ⅱ with l d 0 9 1 3 the vibration is suppressed by 94 98 the fish hull angle α makes little difference for l d 1 4 in pattern ⅲ the cylinder starts to oscillate again with the response amplitude persists at a high value which is classified as galloping like vibration herein and will be talked in detail in section 4 2 besides a direct comparison of peak amplitudes for a cylinder attached with ftf and a flexible splitter plate fsp is given in fig 8c the experimental results performed in the same wind tunnel of liang et al 2018 a cylinder attached with a flexible plate is presented for comparison in the experiments of liang et al 2018 fiv reduction is achieved for l d 0 8 1 0 however the efficient suppression length of ftf for fiv suppression is l d 0 9 1 3 and the broader range of l d is of great importance for practical engineering which means convenient construction and reliability 4 2 effects of flexible plate length l d in this section the effect of flexible plate length is investigated in detail as can be seen in fig 8b three typical response patterns are identified with the flexible plate length l varying from 0 to 2 0d similar results are found for α 60 120 as has been elaborated that the response amplitudes are controlled by the flexible plate length rather than the overall length of the suppressor to clearly gate the effect of l fig 9 shows the division of viv suppressed and galloping like patterns for α 90 with l varying from 0 to 2 4d besides the response patterns of the cylinder can be affected apparently by the vibration mode of plate four kinds of vibration modes of the flexible plate are identified according to our observation seen in fig 9 in mode i the flexible plate is rigid enough no obvious deflection could be found then the mild flapping of the plate tail is observed in mode ii both modes of i and ii are related to viv in mode iii the flexible plate deflects to an off axis equilibrium angle behaves similar to a free to rotate splitter plate which is related to the suppressed pattern with l d increasing further however dramatic vibration of the flexible plate is found in mode iv which always comes along with the galloping like pattern 4 2 1 viv pattern viv is found for l d 0 3 0 8 seen in fig 9 although the vibrations all persist within limited u r range the peak amplitudes vary with l d vigorous vibration is observed for l d 0 3 0 5 as shown in fig 10 the vibration starts at around u r 7 where the vortex shedding frequency f s gets close to f n the natural frequency of the system in air then the vibration frequency locks to f n during the lock in region and higher vortex shedding components are also found in the flow field fig 10c e besides the response amplitude increases gradually versus wind velocity during the initial branch then the vibration halts swiftly and there is almost no lower branch this sudden halt has been reported frequently in the viv investigation of noncircular sections feng 1968 seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 liang et al 2018a fig 11 in fact the flexible plate is rigid enough and no obvious deflection could be found i e vibrated in mode i for l d 0 3 0 5 it is pointed already by liang et al 2018a that shear layers are susceptible to reattach to the section with long afterbodies due to the large attack angle during viv and this scenario would result in a much larger fluctuating force which feeds the vigorous response for l d 0 6 0 8 there is still viv such that the onset of vibration corresponding to the matching of f s and f n besides during the limited lock in range the vibration frequency f o locks to the natural frequency f n however the response amplitudes are partly weakened for l d 0 6 0 8 and the initial branch lower branch both can be found fig 12 a which is completely absent or very narrow for l d 0 3 0 5 the difference may be related to the presence of mild flapping of the flexible plate i e mode ii fig 9 as we all know the severe vibration of a cylinder attached with a rigid splitter plate is attributed to the shear layer reattachment assi et al 2014 and the phase angel between the cylinder s displacement and the lift remains almost zero but this is not the situation for a flexible plate with low flow speeds the flow unsteadiness is not strong enough to overcome the rigidity of the flexible plate hence the deflection of the splitter plate is negligible i e in mode i and the communication of two shear layers which has been proved already is almost prohibited which results in the further delay of the onset of viv however when the flow velocity increases above a critical value the compromise between the unsteady pressure of the fluid and the bending stiffness of the plate is broken the vibration mode of the flexible plate turns into mode ii i e the plate tip vibrates with small amplitudes in fact the vibration of a flexible plate is such a procedure that the turbulence energy of the fluid is transformed to the mechanical energy of the flexible plate the mild flapping of the flexible plate is also reported in the numerical investigations of an elastically cylinder firmly attached a flexible plate wu et al 2014c sahu et al 2019 and they find that the in phase motion of the cylinder and the tip of the splitter plate can alleviate the vibration of the cylinder and the vortex from the plate could destructively interact with a cylinder vortex which could decrease the lift force and is also beneficial to the suppression of viv wu et al 2014a 2014c hence the partly suppressed vibration of present study may arise from the decreased lift force due to the mild flapping of the plate 4 2 2 suppressed pattern the vibration is suppressed successfully for l d 0 9 1 3 as shown in fig 9 in this region the flexible plate length and fish hull angle make little difference it is striking to find the flexible fishtail does not vibrate from side to side as we expected due to the high flexibility according to our observation the flexible fishtail deflects at a stable angular position about the center of the cylinder wake and the tip of the flexible fishtail vibrates with a small amplitude i e mode iii the deflected plates give rise to the investigations of the free to rotate splitter plates for flow control or viv suppression of a cylinder assi et al 2009 gu et al 2012 in this length range of ftf no obvious vortex shedding frequency is found in the frequency spectrum of the velocity fluctuation fig 13 to better explore the suppression mechanism of ftf flow visualization for l d 1 0 is presented in fig 14 for comparison the piv result an elastically mounted cylinder attached with a free to rotate rigid splitter plate at l d 1 0 of assi et al 2009 carried out in a water channel experiment and the smoke flow visualization a fixed cylinder with a free to rotate rigid splitter plate gu et al 2012 performed in a wind tunnel are presented it can be found that the vortex formation length is prolonged greatly and the flow reattaches to the tip of the plate on the side to which the plate deflects and it is known that the reattachment of the flow will result in a low pressure region between the separating shear layer and the plate which leads to low pressure acting on the cylinder on the side to which the plate deflects besides the nearfield flow communication is prevented by the slant plate and no obvious vortex shedding is found fig 14 although vortex shedding is formed downstream far from the flexible plate it has no feedback to the vibration of the system 4 2 3 galloping like pattern the response bounds back and is elevated sharply with further lengthening of l for l d 1 4 2 4 response amplitudes versus u r for the galloping like region are shown in fig 15 a and dramatic vibration of the plate i e mode iv is found the cylinder experiences vigorous vibration which is postponed and erupts at large wind velocities and the vibration frequency is locked the natural frequency f n of the system due to the high m s adopted in present work it is proved that the larger the m s the closer the frequency of galloping response gets to f n sen and mittal 2015 liang et al 2018a to differentiate the viv pattern and the galloping like pattern here the response amplitudes vibration frequency and power spectral density psd contours of the velocity fluctuation for l d 0 6 1 4 1 5 are presented in fig 15b d for l d 0 6 viv the onset of vibration corresponds to the matching of f s and f n and the vibrational frequency is locked to f n for cases l d 1 4 1 5 fig 15c d however the vibration is not induced when f s passes through f n which means that viv is fully eliminated with the further increase of f s it is interesting to find that the cylinder starts to vibrate when f s 2f n it seems that the oscillation occurs abruptly when f s 2f n and the response amplitude builds up quickly which is most apparent for l d 1 8 2 2 2 4 fig 17 therefore the oscillation in the cases of l d 1 4 2 4 is classified as galloping like pattern in fact the onset of galloping like response related to the higher components of shedding frequency is also found in the experiments of a triangular cylinder seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 in their experiments at large angle of attack 35 there exists a limited range of reduced velocities where the prism experiences viv followed by another range of almost zero amplitude response then galloping are triggered as they stated when the strouhal frequency reaches a value three times the natural frequency of the system besides liang et al 2018b also found that galloping occurs for vortex shedding frequency far beyond the system natural frequency in the experiment of a cylinder firmly attached a flexible plate the vortex shedding from a flexible plate has been investigated by many researchers in the early experiment of a flexible plate attached at the base of a forced heaving cylinder hu et al 2014 the new trailing edge vortex is found due to the plate deformation and the trailing vortex and the wake from the upstream cylinder will interact with each other different interaction mechanisms are found between the vortex shedding from the cylinder and the trailing edge vortices shed from the flexible tail according to literatures wu and shu 2011 indicated that there are two vortex interaction mechanisms the destructive interaction and the constructive interaction which would result in the formation of strengthened vortex and in the numerical investigation of a flexible plate with fixed l d 2 5 behind a cylinder wu et al 2014c the asymmetric flapping with small amplitudes which is similar to mode iii in our experiments was found for low flexibility while the vigorous symmetric flapping returned with increasing flexibility moreover lift force fluctuations and response increased greatly for the flapping plate flow visualization of a flexible plate at l d 1 5 u r 10 27 where galloping like happens shows that the vortex formation is completely controlled by the dramatic motion of the plate fig 16 the higher harmonic components such as 2f n 3f n even 5f n are also found in the flow field as shown in the psd contours of the velocity fluctuation for l d 1 4 2 4 figs 15 and 17 apparently the vortex shedding behind the cylinder is modulated due to the dramatic vibration of the flexible plate in mode iv hence the galloping like response herein may be related to the constructive interaction between the vortex shedding of the cylinder and the flapping of the flexible plate another difference should be pointed here is that the galloping like response only persists at limited velocities for l d 1 4 1 8 while for l d 2 2 2 4 the vibration will persist to the end of the tested velocities the difference lies in the vibration mode of the flexible plate for l d 1 8 as shown in fig 17a the galloping like response erupts when f s 2f n and persists in u r 10 1 23 1 among this range the flexible tail vibrates dramatically accompanying the cylinder i e mode iv and higher harmonic components are found in the flow field however as u r increasing beyond 23 1 the vibration of the flexible tail could not last i e vibrates in mode iii based on the discussion above the complex vortex shedding of the cylinder attaching a flexible plate is controlled by the locomotion of the plate hence the higher components disappear in the flow filed for u r 23 1 together with the vibration of the cylinder to compare present results with those available in the literature for a similar problem the main dynamical parameters of the flexible plate including the structure to fluid mass ratio m and the non dimensional bending stiffness k connell and yue 2007 alben shelley 2008 shukla et al 2013 are defined below 1 m ρ s h ρ f l k 2 e i ρ f u 2 l 3 where ei is flexural rigidity of the plate and ρ s ρ f u h represent structural density fluid density flow velocity and thickness of the plate respectively apparently the expression of k indicates the ratio of the bending rigidity of the flexible plate to the dynamic pressure of the fluid there are few investigations in the past to investigate the dynamics of the flexible plate behind a bluff body or the fiv control by flexible suppressors besides the structural characteristics of the flexible plate vary among the studies hence the corresponding m and k in previous literatures as well as present study are calculated using eq 1 and the dramatic flapping onset k for flexible plates with different l d is shown in fig 18 it should be noted that the experimental study of shukla et al 2013 was performed in a water tunnel and the flexible plate was made using thin plastic sheets although the structural density is not given in their study m is estimated to very low ο 10 3 water according to open literatures for present study however m in air varies from 0 92 to 1 7 the behavior for the leading fixed flexible plate can be different for high mass ratio ο 10 air and low mass ratio ο 10 3 water it has been proved already that the flapping of a leading fixed flexible plate is more commonly seen in air than in water with high density kim et al 2017 because damping by the fluid of high density prevents the flexible plate in low mass ratio from being unstable shelley et al 2005 to further demonstrate the influence of m previous results in literatures with high or low mass ratio are also shown in fig 18 allen and smith 2001 studied the dynamics of a flexible plate behind a rectangular plate in a water channel with m 0 0021 and it can be seen that the flapping onset k is very small which is close to the result of shukla et al 2013 the studies by lee et al 2013 kim et al 2017 and sahu et al 2019 are similar to present study in mass ratio and plate lengths as expected the results are in reasonable agreement yellow in the web version region in fig 18 the influence of mass ratio should be concerned for the application of flexible suppressors in practical engineering as the flexible plate in high mass ratio is more easily to flutter which may induce galloping like vibration 4 3 effects of fish hull angle α to investigate the effect of fish hull angle α response amplitudes of a cylinder for α 60 90 120 at l 0 i e the fish hull only together with results for the bare cylinder are presented in fig 19 lock in phenomenon are found at all cases the vortex shedding frequency increased continuously with u r and the cylinder starts to oscillate when f s approaches f n instantaneous flow visualization of ftf at l d 0 means only fish hull for the cylinder reaches the maximum deviation are shown in fig 20 a and fig 20b periodic vortex shedding could also be seen in far field and during the lock in region the vibration frequency corresponds to f n although the 2f n component 3f n component and even 4 f n component i e with twice three and four times the frequency of f n are observed during the lock in region in fig 19c e this could be attributed to the large m s adopted herein it is illustrated clearly already by williamson and govardhan 2004 that the vibration frequency of viv system with large m s will collapse to the natural frequency of the system as present mass of displaced fluid air is small compared to the cylinder the added mass effect is negligible here response amplitudes are quite different for α 60 90 120 at l 0 compared to a bare cylinder vigorous vibration is found at α 60 with a d 0 94 while for α 90 120 the vibration is wakened little where the response amplitudes are 0 70d 0 58d respectively in present study b is fixed to 0 5d which means that the characteristic length of the fish hull increases with α decreasing although a fairing behind a cylinder could steady the nearfield flow which means the lift fluctuation are wakened anderson and szewczyk 1997 shear layers are easy to reattach to the structure with long afterbody in viv zheng and wang 2017 therefore zheng and wang found the fairing with smallest characteristic length 0 33d perform best in suppressing viv while a long one could induce vigorous vibration in their study the variation of response amplitudes is also this situation for current study the synchronisation range increases with α decreasing for l d 0 indicated by the dotted yellow in the web version line in fig 19c e and this phenomenon continues for l d 0 5 as show in fig 21 although the onset of viv is postponed little with little difference in response amplitudes different phenomenon however is found for l d 0 7 unlike the cases of l d 0 0 0 5 the resonance ranges all initiates at u r 7 0 and ended at u r 20 fig 22 c e fig 23 shows the synchronisation range for different combination of l d and α the onset of viv u star varies little with fish hull angel when l d remains constant but the end of the range u end shrinks apparently for l d 0 4 0 6 when it comes to l d 0 7 the u end varies little it seems that the resonance range can be extended apparently due to the characteristic length of the rigid fish hull for l d 0 7 but the influence of the rigid fish hull is negligible for l d 0 7 as the flexible plate starts to play a key role 5 conclusions the flow induced vibration fiv of an elastically cylinder attached with a fishtail like fairing ftf was investigated at r e 4000 42000 by a series of wind tunnel experiments response displacements and velocity fluctuation were measured the smoke visualization technique was adopted to analyze the vortex structure the influence of fish hull angle α and the flexible plate length l d were investigated based on the results and discussion several conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 configuration l d 0 9 1 3 reduces the peak amplitude of response in about 94 98 compared with a bare cylinder and the fishtail like fairing is proved to be effective in viv suppression within this range the flexible plate deflects at a stable angular position about the center of the cylinder wake flow visualization shows the vortex shedding of nearfield is suppressed 2 the length of flexible plate plays a fundamentally important role three response patterns can be identified with the increase of flexible plate length l viv l d 0 0 8 suppressed l d 0 9 1 3 galloping like l d 1 4 2 4 different from the rigid suppressor four vibration patterns happen for the flexible plate in different lengths when suffering from the wake flow and the vortex shedding from the cylinder is modulated due to the vibration patterns of the flexible plate which produces different responses in turn 3 the fish hull angle α has little effect to the response characteristics for l d 0 7 with small α the onset of vortex induced vibration is delayed to some extent and the resonance range is extended apparently due to the characteristic length of the rigid fish hull however the effect of the fish hull is negligible with prolonging of l and the flexible plate starts to play a key role 4 galloping like response is found for l d 1 4 2 4 which is erupted when the vortex shedding frequency matches the 2f n harmonic component in the flow field together with the dramatic wave motion of the plate flow visualization shows the vortex shedding from the cylinder are completely controlled by flexible splitter plates 5 future studies need to concentrate on optimizing the device in respect of the mass ratio m of the flexible plate according to literatures m is usually higher in air than in water the influence of mass ratio should be concerned for the application of flexible suppressors in practical engineering as the flexible plate in high mass ratio is more easily to lose stability which may induce galloping like vibration credit authorship contribution

20297,a flexible fishtail like fairing adopted as a flow induced vibration fiv suppressor was studied in a wind tunnel at reynolds number 4000 42000 it is shown the vortex induced vibration can be practically eliminated by using ftf the effect of the flexible plate length ratio l d d is the diameter of the cylinder and the fish hull angle α are investigated systematically a fish hull with small α could extend the synchronisation range but the effect is negligible with l prolonging the response patterns and peak amplitudes of the cylinder are closely related to l as well as the motion of the plate viv is found for l d 0 3 0 8 with mild deflection of the plate fiv can be suppressed up to 94 98 with l d 0 9 1 3 flow visualization shows the nearfield vortex shedding is suppressed by the deflected plate for l d 1 4 2 4 however galloping like instability is erupted when the vortex shedding frequency matches the 2f n f n the natural frequency of the system in air harmonic component in the flow field together with the dramatic flapping of the plate besides it seems that galloping like response is sustained by the vortex shedding controlled by the motion of the flexible plate keywords flow induced vibration wind tunnel experiment galloping like viv suppression flow visualization fishtail like fairing 1 introduction flow induced vibration fiv occurs when a cylinder or bluff structure immersed in steady cross flow velocity as the alternate vortex shedding from the structure may produce serious fluctuating pressure on the structure in ocean engineering this kind of fiv is in fact called as vortex induced vibration viv generally for an isolated circular cylinder if internal flow is not considered wang et al 2020 extensive fundamental studies about fiv have been performed in recent decades illustrated in the comprehensive review literatures of bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 sarpkaya 2004 and wang et al 2020 as the relatively large motion and fluid force due to fiv can be hazardous and cause severe damage to structures the suppression of fiv is of paramount importance to many engineering applications many studies focused on this topic have been performed various strategies have been proposed for the suppression of fiv via control of the unsteadiness of flow and communication of separated layers two kinds of suppression methods can be grouped active and passive based on whether requiring external energy input active suppression strategies require external energy for example blowing or suction of boundary layers min and choi 1999 steady rotation of the body mittal 2001 and heating of the structure wan and patnaik 2016 passive control methods are widely applied in engineering without external energy input they mainly focus on the modification of surface shape or property of the body and the use of additional bodies including fairing helical strakes control rod and splitter plates etc fairing devices and splitter plates based on the prior studies are known to stabilize the near wake or eliminate the vortex shedding with long characteristic length however fairing devices and splitter plates may induce severe galloping like vibrations under certain conditions assi et al 2009 2014 liang et al 2018a zhu and liu 2020 visualization of the flow field around the splitter plates l d 1 performed with piv revealed that the reattachment of the free shear layers on the tip of the plate is the hydrodynamic mechanism driving the severe excitation assi et al 2009 2014 assi and bearman 2015 according to the numerical study of zheng and wang 2017 fairing devices with long characteristic lengths is also prone to trigger galloping like vibration although the rigid attached splitter plate is capable of suppressing fiv at l d 2 8 stappenbelt 2010 shorter and simpler structures should be considered for engineering application therefore permeable splitter plates cardell 1993 free to rotate splitter plates cimbala and garg 1991 gu et al 2012 hinged rigid splitter plates assi et al 2009 and free to rotate short tail fairing assi et al 2014 have been proposed by some researchers suppressors for hinged rigid splitter plates or free to rotate splitter plates have the advantages of being omnidirectional realigning their orientation as the incoming flow angle changes however the dynamics of the free to rotate plate can be complicated as the splitter plate can rotate about the cylinder due to the unsteady fluid forces acting on it and it will certainly interfere with the wake for example using water channel experiments in r e 800 10000 shukla et al 2009 investigated the effect of two non dimensional parameters reynolds number r e and l d the measurements of tip amplitude shows that the vibration of splitter plate increases with reynolds numbers at low r e and reaches a saturation amplitude level at r e 4000 periodic vibrations occur for splitter plates l d 3 0 while there is a sharp reduction in tip amplitude with the vibration becoming aperiodic at l d 3 0 in the experiments of cimbala and garg 1991 assi et al 2009 gu et al 2012 the splitter plate would rotate to an off axis equilibrium angle the flow visualization of assi et al 2009 showed that the deflected plate could stabilize the near wake flow but an unwanted steady lift is found towards the side to which the plate has deflected for long free to rotate splitter plates the near field vortex shedding for the cylinder could also be eliminated as for fiv control assi et al 2009 found that the level of friction between the hinged or free to rotate splitter plate and the cylinder plays a key role in fiv suppression of elastically mounted cylinders with proper hinge friction the fiv of the cylinder is effectively suppressed with significant drag reduction as well but if the friction below a critical value vibrations of the cylinder would develop and if it increases above a limiting threshold galloping vibration is initiated assi et al 2014 also observed a galloping response of a circular cylinder when attached fixed splitter plates at plate length ratio of l d equals to 0 5 and 1 0 respectively wu et al 2014a performed the numerical investigation of an elastically mounted circular cylinder with a hinged flat plate l d 0 2 at r e 200 they found that if the vortex from the cylinder interacts with the vortex from the plate destructively fiv could be suppressed flexible devices have drawn much attention in recent years as an extension of hinged rigid splitter plates some pioneer work has been down on the effects of flexible devices in flow and fiv control of bluff structures and show a number of interesting features in the early water tunnel experiments of kwon et al 2002 drag reduction is found of a fixed cylinder attached with three flexible ribbons distributed uniformly the reduction of drag and lift is also found in the numerical work of xiao et al 2012 shukla et al 2013 studied a fully flexible splitter plate attached at the base of a fixed cylinder at r e 1800 10000 in a water channel two regimes of periodic vibrations are identified with r e increasing the normalized frequency of plate vibration in both periodic modes is found to be close to 0 2 which is close to the normalized vortex shedding frequency of a fixed cylinder they found that the vibration amplitude of the plate tip at a given length is determined by the non dimensional bending stiffness k wu et al 2014b numerically investigated the flow characters of an undulatory plate behind a fixed cylinder two different vortex interaction modes are found known as constructive interaction and destructive interaction the drag reduction is attributed to the vortex destructive interaction the effect of flexible plate length and flexibility are investigated in some numerical work lee and you 2013 and wang et al 2018 sahu et al 2019 found two deflection modes corresponding to the first and second mode natural frequencies of the plate and the peak amplitude emerges when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the first or second mode natural frequency lee and you 2013 pointed that the unsteady pressure core due to the vortex shedding from the upstream cylinder arouses the vibration of the flexible plate but the vortex impingement from the upstream cylinder is believed to excite the first mode deflection of the plate while the second mode deflection is excited by high pressure region induced by the stagnation of flow near the turn up part of the plate wang et al 2018 based on the review of this part k and the character length l of the flexible plate are found to be the key parameters in the study of a flexible plate located behind a fixed bluff body but what is the situation when it comes to an elastically mounted cylinder firmly attached with a flexible suppressor little work has been down on this topic as fiv of an elastically mounted cylinder attached with a flexible device is complicated either the numerical simulation or the experiment is difficult to be performed wu et al 2015 investigated the response of a cylinder attached with a flexible plate at a fixed reduced velocity 5 at r e 200 fiv suppression is achieved at a relatively long plate l 2 0 with medium flexibility latterly the numerical work of sahu et al 2019 with plate length mainly fixed at l d 3 5 in their study with r e 150 found that for low flexibility viv could be well suppressed while the cylinder and the plate tip vibrates in phase but galloping can be trigged at high flow velocity due to the reattachment of shear layers as illustrated in above very few studies have been down yet on the topic of fiv control using flexible devices and the computational studies are all at low r e in this paper an elastically cylinder attached with a fishtail like fairing ftf see fig 1 a simplification of a fish tail consists of a rigid hull and a flexible plate was studied using wind tunnel experiments the structure of ftf inspired by the locomotion of fishtail is a flexible device which is invented by wang and gu 2013 firstly and proved to be capable of reducing the drag force in the flow control experiments using a wind tunnel in this paper ftf is investigated deeply and we are trying to address the following questions what are the response characteristics of a cylinder attached with ftf how does the response characteristics are affected by the structure parameters such as the fish hull angle α and flexible fishtail length l or the overall length of the suppressor what are the underlying mechanisms of different response characteristics here we address above issues and with two structural parameters fish hull angle α 60 120 and fishtail length l d 0 to 2 4 respectively the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the experimental set up is described experimental methodology validation for a single cylinder are given in section 3 section 4 presents the results and discussion for the cylinder attached with ftf the conclusion of the work is drawn in section 5 2 experimental details the experiments were performed in the low speed wind tunnel at key laboratory of power machinery and engineering ministry of education shanghai jiao tong university the turbulent strength scale is less than 0 2 with a test section of 0 6 m in width 0 6 m in height and 2 0 m in length further details of the wind tunnel were introduced by gu et al 2012 sui et al 2016 and liang et al 2018a fig 2 shows a schematic of current experimental set up the cylinder model with d 50 mm was elastically mounted at both sides in the horizontal plane by two pairs of springs each consists of two identical springs made of stainless steel the springs were stretched long enough to overcome the influence of gravity and allow the model to vibrate in the transverse direction only the cylinder was made of plexiglass to keep low mass and excellent smoothness and the cylinder length l 540 mm with aspect ratio of 10 8 and blockage of 7 5 approximately ftf was firmly attached at the base of the cylinder fig 1 the rigid hull of ftf was made of a rigid aluminum sheet with thickness of 0 02d which is stiff enough to resist the bending moment of the flexible plate the aluminum sheet was firmly attached to the cylinder wall by thin double sides tape indicated by the red in the web version line in fig 1 and to make the cylinder wall smooth sellotape is covered to the cylinder wall where the fairing touches the cylinder indicated by the green in the web version line it should be mentioned that the influence of the fish hull angle was mainly concerned on present investigation hence b was fixed at 0 5d while the fish hull angle varied from 60 to 120 and the flexible fishtail is thin and light litmus paper sheets with thickness of about 0 1 mm which is proper here to make sure it being two dimensional deflection according to the experiments of liang et al 2018a the flexible fishtail length varied from 0 to 2 4d in present study the free stream velocity was in the range of 1 19 m s 12 47 m s in the current tests corresponding to the reynolds number r e 4000 42000 and the reduce velocity u r 2 4 25 0 according to the previous investigations about the dynamics of flexible plates stiffness ei mass density ρ s and thickness h of the flexible plate are the key parameters to understand its dynamics in the near wake behind a bluff body shukla et al 2013 hyeonseong et al 2017 yu et al 2017 liang et al 2018b in our experiments the stiffness of the flexible plate is found to be ei 8 6 10 5nm by measuring the deflection of the sheet under its own self weight the method for determining the flexural rigidity of the sheet has been widely adopted in the investigations of its dynamics shukla et al 2013 virot et al 2013 liang et al 2018b finally the mass density is also measured to be ρ s 1 386 103 kg m3 the vibration displacement y of the cylinder model was measured by a laser sensor il 300 keyence see fig 1 with a resolution of 0 1 mm the data acquisition was automated via customized labview programs and for each data set the signal was acquired at a sampling frequency of 1024 hz for 30 s the natural frequency f n and structural damping ζ of the system were measured by conducting a series of free decay tests in air in present study the mass ratio m s of the model the bare cylinder with rigid hull was 328 while f n 10 42hz the vibration amplitude a of the model was acquired by averaging the 10 peaks of the stable time series y while the vibration frequency f 0 was achieved through fast fourier transform fft of the time series y besides streamwise fluctuating velocities were measured through a hot wire probe dantec 55p11 which was placed behind the cylinder as shown in fig 2 the horizontal and vertical distances between the hot wire probe and cylinder remain unchanged 5d in horizontal and 0 75d in vertical sampling rate was set to be 1024hz and sampling duration was 20s for each record other parameters shown in the present study are summarized in table 1 to gain better insight into flow dynamics flow visualization by smoke wire technology was adopted the test section was illuminated in the middle x z plane fig 2 by a laser generator mw gl 532anm 8w 141402 a smoke generator was placed in front of the settling chamber of the wind tunnel a high speed imaging system photron fastcam ultima apx i2 was used to obtain clear images of the turbulent wake full 1024 1024 pixels image resolution and 6 14 fps imaging speed were chosen in the experiments 3 experimental methodology validation and viv of a bare cylinder to validate the present experimental methodology viv of a bare cylinder was tested preliminarily the non dimensional amplitude response a d of the present cylinder versus reduced velocity is shown in fig 3 a meanwhile several classical results of bare cylinders are also shown for comparison firstly it should be clarified that three or two response branches could be found depending on low in water see khalak and williamson 1999 or high in air see feng 1968 values of m in present experiment m is 308 which is commonly seen in the experiments performed in wind tunnels such as feng 1968 liang et al 2018a hence only the initial and lower branches can be found in present result as the wind velocity increases the amplitude of vibration increases monotonically and reaches the peak value 0 72d around u r 6 6 after that the vibration amplitude decreases continually and ceases at last as clarified by the previous study the response amplitude of a bare cylinder is closely related to the value of m ζ williamson and govardhan 2004 a higher m ζ often accompanied with a lower amplitude response in fig 3a the response amplitude of present cylinder is 0 72d with m ζ 0 164 which is close to the result of liang et al 2018 with m ζ 0 188 since the present value of m ζ is much lower than feng 1968 zhou et al 2011 the peak value of present result is higher than feng 1968 and zhou et al 2011 as well in fig 3b the maximum amplitude a max is displayed as a function of m ζ containing several experimental data performed by earlier investigators the green in the web version line represents a curve fit to the results of a large number of researchers compiled originally by griffin 1980 and updated by skop and balasubramanian 1997 as can be seen the current result can fit the curve very well the non dimensional vortex shedding frequencies f s f n for a bare cylinder is shown in fig 4 and f s is determined by the fft method based on the streamwise fluctuating velocities behind the suppressor devices a change from blue to red in the web version on the left graph of f s f n implies the dominant peaks of normalized power spectral density psd of the vortex shedding frequency the brighter the red in the web version represents the larger peaks of psd and the offset stack diagrams of the specifically corresponding variation of f s f n in the psd for each u r are shown on the right hand according to fig 4 the so called lock in emerges in u r 4 10 during lock in region the vortex shedding frequency f s is locked to the system natural frequency f n here the vortex shedding frequency f s was calculated by performing fft to the data measured through the hot wire probe then normalized at each reduced velocity the vortex shedding frequency f s remains equal to natural frequency f n in the lock in regime and once beyond the regime it is varying monotonically following strouhal number s t 0 17 very close to 0 2 bold line in white fig 4a when the cylinder is stationary in fig 4b we can see that for u r 4 89 in the initial branch only a 1 f n component equal to the natural frequency f n can be observed while 2f n component 3f n component and 4f n component are found for u r 5 76 and 7 49 and 2f n component 3f n component and 4f n component are related to different vortex shedding patterns belloli et al 2012 at the initial branch of the lock in region the cylinder oscillates at a small amplitude corresponding to 2s vortex shedding mode while the 2f n component and 4f n component emerges at the peak vibration amplitude which is related to 2p or p s shedding patterns 4 results and discussion 4 1 overall response amplitudes and patterns experiments were carried out with flexible plates length l d varying from 0 4 to 2 0 and fish hull α from 60 to 120 with an interval 15 response amplitudes versus u r for different combination of l d and α 60 90 120 are presented together with results for the bare cylinder in fig 5 in fact the response tendency for cases α 75 105 are not very different vigorous viv is observed for l d 0 4 0 5 and show a steeper response curve compared with the bare cylinder and two response branches are identified the initial and lower branch compared to a bare cylinder the initial branch is elongated while the lower branch is almost absent then the response amplitude is consecutively lowered down with l d increasing for l d 0 9 1 3 the oscillation is suppressed by 94 98 which demonstrates very high efficiency in controlling viv using the fishtail like fairing in fig 8 a the oscillation is almost eliminated for the medium plate length beyond this range however viv or galloping like response is observed in fact galloping like response is found for all fish hull angles with the further increase of plate length l d 1 3 and different from viv galloping like response persists with the dramatic flapping of flexible plates considering the literature of rigid suppressors the overall length of the rigid suppressor plays a key role in determining the response patterns it is naturally crucial to find out whether it is the same situation for current study as the fishtail like fairing consists of a rigid fish hull and the flexible plate the overall length for current suppressor can be defined as l o l h l l h is the distance from the cylinder base to the peak of the rigid hull l is the length of the flexible plate shown in fig 1 assi et al 2014 presents comparable results of a short tail fairing with overall length l o 0 5d as presented in fig 5g both the fishtail like fairing and the short tail fairing at l o 0 5d presents vigorous transverse oscillation that with increasing reduced velocity would apparently increase and halt suddenly at u r 17 but the peak amplitude for the short tail fairing is 2 1d while for fishtail like fairing the peak amplitude is 0 8d the much higher response amplitude in assi et al 2014 can be attributed to the much lower mass damping ratio mass damping ratios are 0 0051 0 175 in assi et al 2014 and present firstly to improve the understanding of the relationship between peak amplitudes and l d the peak amplitudes a max d versus the flexible plate length l d is shown below fig 6 the red in the web version line in fig 6 represents the peak amplitude of the bare cylinder it seems that the peak amplitudes for different fairing angles α can be collapsed in a black curve except for l d 0 4 for l d 0 8 the peak amplitudes of viv consecutively lowers down as l d prolonging and the suppression of viv is achieved in l d 0 9 1 3 however vigorous oscillation erupts with peak amplitudes larger than the bare cylinder with the further increase of l 1 3d it seems that the response amplitude is closely related to the length of the flexible plate l fig 7 presents the peak amplitudes versus the overall length l o d a max d can be very different indicated by the orange area for various fish hull angle α even at the same value of l o d this huge difference lies in the discrepancy of flexible plate length l in our experiments l h the characteristic length of rigid hull varied from 0 4d 0 06d with α 60 120 hence with the same value of l o d the difference of l can be as large as around 0 4d for different α from fig 6 the peak amplitudes of the cylinder changes significantly with l 0 4d this is reasonable as different vibration patterns happen for the flexible plate in different lengths when suffering from the wake flow as we will present in the next section while the rigid one is unable to give feedback and the different vibration patterns of the flexible plate will certainly interfere with the wake and produce different responses that is a fundamental difference between the flexible suppressor and the rigid one at l o 1 6d for example the flexible plate length is l 1 2d for α 60 while for α 105 the plate length is l 1 5d the oscillation is almost eliminated for l 1 2d α 60 and the flexible plate deflects to one side however galloping like response erupts at high u r for α 105 with the flexible plate flapping vigorously but it should be pointed out that the peak amplitudes for l d 0 4 are controlled by the overall length of the suppressor as the flexible plate is stiff enough to overcome the flow unsteadiness for l d 0 4 which means the flexible plate is similar to a rigid one based on discussion above it is reasonable to conclude that the response amplitudes are controlled by the flexible plate length rather than the overall length of the suppressor to better understand the suppression effect of ftf the contours of maximum response amplitudes versus fishtail length l and fish hull angle α are plotted in fig 8b the sketches of the three vibration patterns are also presented in fig 8d and three patterns of response could be roughly divided depending on combinations of l and α in detail pattern ⅰ locates within short flexible length l 0 9d in pattern ⅰ as the vortex shedding frequency f s matches the natural frequency f n the vibration is trigged and persists in limited velocities hence the vibration in pattern ⅰ is clarified as viv the maximum response amplitudes within this pattern are at the same level or higher than that of a bare cylinder and in present study in pattern ⅱ with l d 0 9 1 3 the vibration is suppressed by 94 98 the fish hull angle α makes little difference for l d 1 4 in pattern ⅲ the cylinder starts to oscillate again with the response amplitude persists at a high value which is classified as galloping like vibration herein and will be talked in detail in section 4 2 besides a direct comparison of peak amplitudes for a cylinder attached with ftf and a flexible splitter plate fsp is given in fig 8c the experimental results performed in the same wind tunnel of liang et al 2018 a cylinder attached with a flexible plate is presented for comparison in the experiments of liang et al 2018 fiv reduction is achieved for l d 0 8 1 0 however the efficient suppression length of ftf for fiv suppression is l d 0 9 1 3 and the broader range of l d is of great importance for practical engineering which means convenient construction and reliability 4 2 effects of flexible plate length l d in this section the effect of flexible plate length is investigated in detail as can be seen in fig 8b three typical response patterns are identified with the flexible plate length l varying from 0 to 2 0d similar results are found for α 60 120 as has been elaborated that the response amplitudes are controlled by the flexible plate length rather than the overall length of the suppressor to clearly gate the effect of l fig 9 shows the division of viv suppressed and galloping like patterns for α 90 with l varying from 0 to 2 4d besides the response patterns of the cylinder can be affected apparently by the vibration mode of plate four kinds of vibration modes of the flexible plate are identified according to our observation seen in fig 9 in mode i the flexible plate is rigid enough no obvious deflection could be found then the mild flapping of the plate tail is observed in mode ii both modes of i and ii are related to viv in mode iii the flexible plate deflects to an off axis equilibrium angle behaves similar to a free to rotate splitter plate which is related to the suppressed pattern with l d increasing further however dramatic vibration of the flexible plate is found in mode iv which always comes along with the galloping like pattern 4 2 1 viv pattern viv is found for l d 0 3 0 8 seen in fig 9 although the vibrations all persist within limited u r range the peak amplitudes vary with l d vigorous vibration is observed for l d 0 3 0 5 as shown in fig 10 the vibration starts at around u r 7 where the vortex shedding frequency f s gets close to f n the natural frequency of the system in air then the vibration frequency locks to f n during the lock in region and higher vortex shedding components are also found in the flow field fig 10c e besides the response amplitude increases gradually versus wind velocity during the initial branch then the vibration halts swiftly and there is almost no lower branch this sudden halt has been reported frequently in the viv investigation of noncircular sections feng 1968 seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 liang et al 2018a fig 11 in fact the flexible plate is rigid enough and no obvious deflection could be found i e vibrated in mode i for l d 0 3 0 5 it is pointed already by liang et al 2018a that shear layers are susceptible to reattach to the section with long afterbodies due to the large attack angle during viv and this scenario would result in a much larger fluctuating force which feeds the vigorous response for l d 0 6 0 8 there is still viv such that the onset of vibration corresponding to the matching of f s and f n besides during the limited lock in range the vibration frequency f o locks to the natural frequency f n however the response amplitudes are partly weakened for l d 0 6 0 8 and the initial branch lower branch both can be found fig 12 a which is completely absent or very narrow for l d 0 3 0 5 the difference may be related to the presence of mild flapping of the flexible plate i e mode ii fig 9 as we all know the severe vibration of a cylinder attached with a rigid splitter plate is attributed to the shear layer reattachment assi et al 2014 and the phase angel between the cylinder s displacement and the lift remains almost zero but this is not the situation for a flexible plate with low flow speeds the flow unsteadiness is not strong enough to overcome the rigidity of the flexible plate hence the deflection of the splitter plate is negligible i e in mode i and the communication of two shear layers which has been proved already is almost prohibited which results in the further delay of the onset of viv however when the flow velocity increases above a critical value the compromise between the unsteady pressure of the fluid and the bending stiffness of the plate is broken the vibration mode of the flexible plate turns into mode ii i e the plate tip vibrates with small amplitudes in fact the vibration of a flexible plate is such a procedure that the turbulence energy of the fluid is transformed to the mechanical energy of the flexible plate the mild flapping of the flexible plate is also reported in the numerical investigations of an elastically cylinder firmly attached a flexible plate wu et al 2014c sahu et al 2019 and they find that the in phase motion of the cylinder and the tip of the splitter plate can alleviate the vibration of the cylinder and the vortex from the plate could destructively interact with a cylinder vortex which could decrease the lift force and is also beneficial to the suppression of viv wu et al 2014a 2014c hence the partly suppressed vibration of present study may arise from the decreased lift force due to the mild flapping of the plate 4 2 2 suppressed pattern the vibration is suppressed successfully for l d 0 9 1 3 as shown in fig 9 in this region the flexible plate length and fish hull angle make little difference it is striking to find the flexible fishtail does not vibrate from side to side as we expected due to the high flexibility according to our observation the flexible fishtail deflects at a stable angular position about the center of the cylinder wake and the tip of the flexible fishtail vibrates with a small amplitude i e mode iii the deflected plates give rise to the investigations of the free to rotate splitter plates for flow control or viv suppression of a cylinder assi et al 2009 gu et al 2012 in this length range of ftf no obvious vortex shedding frequency is found in the frequency spectrum of the velocity fluctuation fig 13 to better explore the suppression mechanism of ftf flow visualization for l d 1 0 is presented in fig 14 for comparison the piv result an elastically mounted cylinder attached with a free to rotate rigid splitter plate at l d 1 0 of assi et al 2009 carried out in a water channel experiment and the smoke flow visualization a fixed cylinder with a free to rotate rigid splitter plate gu et al 2012 performed in a wind tunnel are presented it can be found that the vortex formation length is prolonged greatly and the flow reattaches to the tip of the plate on the side to which the plate deflects and it is known that the reattachment of the flow will result in a low pressure region between the separating shear layer and the plate which leads to low pressure acting on the cylinder on the side to which the plate deflects besides the nearfield flow communication is prevented by the slant plate and no obvious vortex shedding is found fig 14 although vortex shedding is formed downstream far from the flexible plate it has no feedback to the vibration of the system 4 2 3 galloping like pattern the response bounds back and is elevated sharply with further lengthening of l for l d 1 4 2 4 response amplitudes versus u r for the galloping like region are shown in fig 15 a and dramatic vibration of the plate i e mode iv is found the cylinder experiences vigorous vibration which is postponed and erupts at large wind velocities and the vibration frequency is locked the natural frequency f n of the system due to the high m s adopted in present work it is proved that the larger the m s the closer the frequency of galloping response gets to f n sen and mittal 2015 liang et al 2018a to differentiate the viv pattern and the galloping like pattern here the response amplitudes vibration frequency and power spectral density psd contours of the velocity fluctuation for l d 0 6 1 4 1 5 are presented in fig 15b d for l d 0 6 viv the onset of vibration corresponds to the matching of f s and f n and the vibrational frequency is locked to f n for cases l d 1 4 1 5 fig 15c d however the vibration is not induced when f s passes through f n which means that viv is fully eliminated with the further increase of f s it is interesting to find that the cylinder starts to vibrate when f s 2f n it seems that the oscillation occurs abruptly when f s 2f n and the response amplitude builds up quickly which is most apparent for l d 1 8 2 2 2 4 fig 17 therefore the oscillation in the cases of l d 1 4 2 4 is classified as galloping like pattern in fact the onset of galloping like response related to the higher components of shedding frequency is also found in the experiments of a triangular cylinder seyed aghazadeh et al 2017 in their experiments at large angle of attack 35 there exists a limited range of reduced velocities where the prism experiences viv followed by another range of almost zero amplitude response then galloping are triggered as they stated when the strouhal frequency reaches a value three times the natural frequency of the system besides liang et al 2018b also found that galloping occurs for vortex shedding frequency far beyond the system natural frequency in the experiment of a cylinder firmly attached a flexible plate the vortex shedding from a flexible plate has been investigated by many researchers in the early experiment of a flexible plate attached at the base of a forced heaving cylinder hu et al 2014 the new trailing edge vortex is found due to the plate deformation and the trailing vortex and the wake from the upstream cylinder will interact with each other different interaction mechanisms are found between the vortex shedding from the cylinder and the trailing edge vortices shed from the flexible tail according to literatures wu and shu 2011 indicated that there are two vortex interaction mechanisms the destructive interaction and the constructive interaction which would result in the formation of strengthened vortex and in the numerical investigation of a flexible plate with fixed l d 2 5 behind a cylinder wu et al 2014c the asymmetric flapping with small amplitudes which is similar to mode iii in our experiments was found for low flexibility while the vigorous symmetric flapping returned with increasing flexibility moreover lift force fluctuations and response increased greatly for the flapping plate flow visualization of a flexible plate at l d 1 5 u r 10 27 where galloping like happens shows that the vortex formation is completely controlled by the dramatic motion of the plate fig 16 the higher harmonic components such as 2f n 3f n even 5f n are also found in the flow field as shown in the psd contours of the velocity fluctuation for l d 1 4 2 4 figs 15 and 17 apparently the vortex shedding behind the cylinder is modulated due to the dramatic vibration of the flexible plate in mode iv hence the galloping like response herein may be related to the constructive interaction between the vortex shedding of the cylinder and the flapping of the flexible plate another difference should be pointed here is that the galloping like response only persists at limited velocities for l d 1 4 1 8 while for l d 2 2 2 4 the vibration will persist to the end of the tested velocities the difference lies in the vibration mode of the flexible plate for l d 1 8 as shown in fig 17a the galloping like response erupts when f s 2f n and persists in u r 10 1 23 1 among this range the flexible tail vibrates dramatically accompanying the cylinder i e mode iv and higher harmonic components are found in the flow field however as u r increasing beyond 23 1 the vibration of the flexible tail could not last i e vibrates in mode iii based on the discussion above the complex vortex shedding of the cylinder attaching a flexible plate is controlled by the locomotion of the plate hence the higher components disappear in the flow filed for u r 23 1 together with the vibration of the cylinder to compare present results with those available in the literature for a similar problem the main dynamical parameters of the flexible plate including the structure to fluid mass ratio m and the non dimensional bending stiffness k connell and yue 2007 alben shelley 2008 shukla et al 2013 are defined below 1 m ρ s h ρ f l k 2 e i ρ f u 2 l 3 where ei is flexural rigidity of the plate and ρ s ρ f u h represent structural density fluid density flow velocity and thickness of the plate respectively apparently the expression of k indicates the ratio of the bending rigidity of the flexible plate to the dynamic pressure of the fluid there are few investigations in the past to investigate the dynamics of the flexible plate behind a bluff body or the fiv control by flexible suppressors besides the structural characteristics of the flexible plate vary among the studies hence the corresponding m and k in previous literatures as well as present study are calculated using eq 1 and the dramatic flapping onset k for flexible plates with different l d is shown in fig 18 it should be noted that the experimental study of shukla et al 2013 was performed in a water tunnel and the flexible plate was made using thin plastic sheets although the structural density is not given in their study m is estimated to very low ο 10 3 water according to open literatures for present study however m in air varies from 0 92 to 1 7 the behavior for the leading fixed flexible plate can be different for high mass ratio ο 10 air and low mass ratio ο 10 3 water it has been proved already that the flapping of a leading fixed flexible plate is more commonly seen in air than in water with high density kim et al 2017 because damping by the fluid of high density prevents the flexible plate in low mass ratio from being unstable shelley et al 2005 to further demonstrate the influence of m previous results in literatures with high or low mass ratio are also shown in fig 18 allen and smith 2001 studied the dynamics of a flexible plate behind a rectangular plate in a water channel with m 0 0021 and it can be seen that the flapping onset k is very small which is close to the result of shukla et al 2013 the studies by lee et al 2013 kim et al 2017 and sahu et al 2019 are similar to present study in mass ratio and plate lengths as expected the results are in reasonable agreement yellow in the web version region in fig 18 the influence of mass ratio should be concerned for the application of flexible suppressors in practical engineering as the flexible plate in high mass ratio is more easily to flutter which may induce galloping like vibration 4 3 effects of fish hull angle α to investigate the effect of fish hull angle α response amplitudes of a cylinder for α 60 90 120 at l 0 i e the fish hull only together with results for the bare cylinder are presented in fig 19 lock in phenomenon are found at all cases the vortex shedding frequency increased continuously with u r and the cylinder starts to oscillate when f s approaches f n instantaneous flow visualization of ftf at l d 0 means only fish hull for the cylinder reaches the maximum deviation are shown in fig 20 a and fig 20b periodic vortex shedding could also be seen in far field and during the lock in region the vibration frequency corresponds to f n although the 2f n component 3f n component and even 4 f n component i e with twice three and four times the frequency of f n are observed during the lock in region in fig 19c e this could be attributed to the large m s adopted herein it is illustrated clearly already by williamson and govardhan 2004 that the vibration frequency of viv system with large m s will collapse to the natural frequency of the system as present mass of displaced fluid air is small compared to the cylinder the added mass effect is negligible here response amplitudes are quite different for α 60 90 120 at l 0 compared to a bare cylinder vigorous vibration is found at α 60 with a d 0 94 while for α 90 120 the vibration is wakened little where the response amplitudes are 0 70d 0 58d respectively in present study b is fixed to 0 5d which means that the characteristic length of the fish hull increases with α decreasing although a fairing behind a cylinder could steady the nearfield flow which means the lift fluctuation are wakened anderson and szewczyk 1997 shear layers are easy to reattach to the structure with long afterbody in viv zheng and wang 2017 therefore zheng and wang found the fairing with smallest characteristic length 0 33d perform best in suppressing viv while a long one could induce vigorous vibration in their study the variation of response amplitudes is also this situation for current study the synchronisation range increases with α decreasing for l d 0 indicated by the dotted yellow in the web version line in fig 19c e and this phenomenon continues for l d 0 5 as show in fig 21 although the onset of viv is postponed little with little difference in response amplitudes different phenomenon however is found for l d 0 7 unlike the cases of l d 0 0 0 5 the resonance ranges all initiates at u r 7 0 and ended at u r 20 fig 22 c e fig 23 shows the synchronisation range for different combination of l d and α the onset of viv u star varies little with fish hull angel when l d remains constant but the end of the range u end shrinks apparently for l d 0 4 0 6 when it comes to l d 0 7 the u end varies little it seems that the resonance range can be extended apparently due to the characteristic length of the rigid fish hull for l d 0 7 but the influence of the rigid fish hull is negligible for l d 0 7 as the flexible plate starts to play a key role 5 conclusions the flow induced vibration fiv of an elastically cylinder attached with a fishtail like fairing ftf was investigated at r e 4000 42000 by a series of wind tunnel experiments response displacements and velocity fluctuation were measured the smoke visualization technique was adopted to analyze the vortex structure the influence of fish hull angle α and the flexible plate length l d were investigated based on the results and discussion several conclusions can be summarized as follows 1 configuration l d 0 9 1 3 reduces the peak amplitude of response in about 94 98 compared with a bare cylinder and the fishtail like fairing is proved to be effective in viv suppression within this range the flexible plate deflects at a stable angular position about the center of the cylinder wake flow visualization shows the vortex shedding of nearfield is suppressed 2 the length of flexible plate plays a fundamentally important role three response patterns can be identified with the increase of flexible plate length l viv l d 0 0 8 suppressed l d 0 9 1 3 galloping like l d 1 4 2 4 different from the rigid suppressor four vibration patterns happen for the flexible plate in different lengths when suffering from the wake flow and the vortex shedding from the cylinder is modulated due to the vibration patterns of the flexible plate which produces different responses in turn 3 the fish hull angle α has little effect to the response characteristics for l d 0 7 with small α the onset of vortex induced vibration is delayed to some extent and the resonance range is extended apparently due to the characteristic length of the rigid fish hull however the effect of the fish hull is negligible with prolonging of l and the flexible plate starts to play a key role 4 galloping like response is found for l d 1 4 2 4 which is erupted when the vortex shedding frequency matches the 2f n harmonic component in the flow field together with the dramatic wave motion of the plate flow visualization shows the vortex shedding from the cylinder are completely controlled by flexible splitter plates 5 future studies need to concentrate on optimizing the device in respect of the mass ratio m of the flexible plate according to literatures m is usually higher in air than in water the influence of mass ratio should be concerned for the application of flexible suppressors in practical engineering as the flexible plate in high mass ratio is more easily to lose stability which may induce galloping like vibration credit authorship contribution

20298,this paper devotes to tackling the saturated approximation free tracking control problem for unmanned marine surface vehicles with prescribed performance metrics firstly a smooth dead zone based model is introduced herein to address the saturation nonlinearity then the tracking error dynamics in presence of saturation constraints and uncertainties are formulated accordingly after that the capability to preset the evolution range of tracking errors is guaranteed by means of the prescribed performance technology it follows that a saturated approximation free control scheme is developed based on the sliding mode control notably the lumped uncertainties and the saturation nonlinearity are well handled totally free of the online estimations such that the control scheme is simple and intuitiveness for implementation it is theoretically verified that the controller can achieve the stabilization of the system finally simulation results are presented to illustrate the controller s efficacy keywords approximation free input saturation prescribed performance control unmanned marine surface vehicle 1 introduction during the past decades unmanned marine surface vehicles msvs have attracted a continuously growing interest from the academic community due to their broad ocean application prospects such as inspection surveillance and oceanography study to effectively complete these missions the msvs are usually expected to perform a sequence of accurate and steady trajectory tracking maneuvers however it is challenging to design a controller that can satisfy such a requirement on account of the harsh working environment and inherent uncertainties so far extensive efforts have been devoted to this topic aiming at endowing controllers with the ability to resist disturbances some advanced control design tools have been deeply researched such as sliding mode control smc 1 3 33 43 45 and backstepping control bp lu et al 2018a hu et al 2020a 2020b particularly smc has received wide attention due to its excellent anti disturbance capacity however a drawback of smc is also well known that is the chattering phenomenon typically wang et al 2017 wang and li 2012 addressed this issue by resorting to boundary function considering that the chattering can only be attenuated but cannot be eliminated in such a solution the discontinuous robust term was replaced with the adaptation technique in yao 2020 such that the controller is globally smooth it is worth noting that the literature yao 2020 wang et al 2017 wang and li 2012 considered not only chattering reduction but also finite time stability here although finite time stability endows the system with faster convergence rates the settling time of finite time stability is heavily dependent on the initial condition as stated in li and cai 2017 such a dependence leaves the acquirement of settling time difficult in practical applications regarding this different fixed time tracking control schemes were proposed in zhang et al 2020a 2020b through a combination of the extended state observer and the terminal sliding mode manifold where the settling time was independent of initial states and can be set in advance although the previous work of the msvs tracking control problem 1 3 33 43 44 effectively addressed uncertainties and have been widely accepted some related model parameters such as part information of inertial matrix still are required and thus resulting in restriction of their practical applications in practice it is unrealistic to obtain precise information on msvs dynamics as a consequence approximator based methods like neural network nn dai et al 2018 shen et al 2020 lu et al 2018b dong et al 2020 and fuzzy control strategies hai et al 2017 wang and he 2019 cao et al 2019 were adopted to reduce the negative influence of model parameter variations specifically the fuzzy logic system fls and the radial basis function neural network rbfnn were introduced to estimate the unknown dynamic perturbation in wang and he 2019 and dong et al 2020 respectively to improve the estimation accuracy a petri based recurrent type 2 fuzzy nn was built in hai et al 2017 besides the enormous neural network weights computational burden was effectively reduced in shen et al 2020 by means of the minimum learning parameter method mlp in lu et al 2018b a similar mlp based control algorithm was further proposed to tackle the formation control problem of msvs it is well known that the selections of fuzzy rules and neural networks render the control design process somehow tedious gao et al 2019 on the contrary data driven based controllers could be designed merely relying on the i o measurement data and thus largely simplifying the design procedure nowadays such control algorithms also have been profound in works weng and wang 2020 gao et al 2019 ferri et al 2018 han et al 2019 liao et al 2019 he et al 2020 for instance weng and wang 2020 successfully applied the data driven based controller to the practical underwater vehicle experiment however such a strategy was only designed suitable for the specific vehicle a mixed control structure containing the backstepping philosophy and sliding mode control was presented in ferri et al 2018 to improve the flexibility of the data driven controller besides the discrete i o driven controllers were developed in han et al 2019 liao et al 2019 where the pseudo partial derivative technology is utilized to dynamically linearize the nonlinear system along the dynamic operation points nevertheless most of the data driven controllers are used to collecting system states at the current scenario and adjusting control gains accordingly it may lead to control performance deterioration since the complex working environment means frequent changing of scenarios to this end one aim of this study is to develop an approximation free controller to deal with uncertainties apart from system uncertainties and ocean perturbances the prescribed control performance also has attracted considerable attention from the control community recently guaranteeing both transient and steady state performance of the system output response has the considerable significance of safely achieving marine missions liu et al 2020 nevertheless it is difficult to theoretically establish the formulation of transient performance i e the convergence rate and overshoot during the controller design process due to its complex engineering characteristics hu et al 2017 taking this challenge into account bechlioulis and rovithakis creatively visualized the prescribed performance as tracking error constraints by prescribed performance function ppf and then transformed the constrained system into an equivalent unconstrained one via an error transformation method bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 later this control framework was widely utilized in various fields involving spacecrafts hu et al 2017 shao et al 2020 autonomous ground vehicles hu et al 2019 and unmanned marine vehicles liu et al 2020 it is well known that the parameters of traditional ppf should be carefully selected according to the initial state errors to avert singularity bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 in practical applications nevertheless there may be significant measurement errors of the initial system state due to the unknown sensor noise or draft in consideration of this a novel ppf that does not require accurate initial errors was proposed in hu et al 2019 improving the ppf as well appointed time ppfs were proposed in yin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 such that the system errors can be forced to the predefined tolerance within preassigned time on the other hand recognizing that input saturation will severely degrade performance different solutions to such an issue were presented in shao et al 2018 yong et al 2020 wang et al 2019b although the previous works hu et al 2019 bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 shao et al 2018 2020 can successfully guarantee system signals evolving in a preselected region prior knowledge of model parameters is required for actual implementation motivated by the above discussions a saturated approximation free control scheme with the satisfaction of prescribed performance metrics is proposed in this paper to achieve msvs trajectory tracking missions the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 an approximation free control scheme is developed by virtue of the sliding mode control and the prescribed performance technology leaving the stability of the closed loop system isolating from uncertainties compared with the existing model free works ferri et al 2018 liao et al 2019 the transient and steady state behavior of tracking errors can be characterized quantitatively and be adjusted by a user defined performance function in advance 2 unlike the previous approximation free control schemes gao et al 2020 chen et al 2021 that assumes the saturation constraints to be large enough with scarce impact to the control performance the input saturation problem is explicitly considered in this paper specifically a smooth dead zone model which is used as a filter to confine command control signals is imposed on the control frame to endow the system with anti saturation property 3 the estimation mechanism either for uncertainties or saturation nonlinearity is removed from the control system such that the proposed control scheme has less computation burden and simpler architecture additionally the control performance is dominated by the intuitional performance function in this way the tedious and repeat parameter regulations guaranteeing error evolution to be acceptable is omitted thus the proposed control scheme is user designer friendly the remainder of this article is structured as follows in section 2 the problem formulation is presented in section 3 the saturated approximation free control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking of msvs numerical simulations are conducted in section 4 finally the main conclusion of this work is drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section the kinematic and dynamic models of the msv considering input saturation constraints and uncertainties are formulated as first then a smooth dead zone based model is given to approximate the input saturation nonlinearity adequately finally the tracking error dynamics are derived under the above models 2 1 kinematics and dynamics model of msv as depicted in fig 1 we define η x y ψ t comprising of msvs position x y and yaw angle ψ in the earth fixed frame ϑ u v r t comprising of msv s velocities u in surge v in sway and r in yaw angular with respect to body fixed frame within this context the nonlinear msv model subject to completely unknown dynamics and input saturation constraints can be described as wang and deng 2019 1 η r ψ ϑ m ϑ f t ϑ τ d s a t τ ϑ where m r 3 3 is the system inertia matrix f t ϑ r 3 1 denotes unknown nonlinear function encapsulating hydrodynamic forces and model parameter perturbations τ d denotes the external disturbances sat τ ϑ sat τ ϑ 1 sat τ ϑ 2 sat τ ϑ 3 t is the limited actual control input with τ ϑ being the command control input the jacobian transformation matrix r ψ is defined as 2 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 by referring to wang and deng 2019 we obtain that the equation r t ψ r 1 ψ holds and the derivative of r ψ can be written as r ψ r ψ w ψ with 3 w ψ 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 0 it is worth emphasizing that the proposed control algorithm is totally independent of model parameters as a consequence the term m presented in eq 1 would not be regarded as an accessible parameter in what follows assumption 1 zhang et al 2019 the inertia matrix m is positive definite and invertible remark 1 assumption 1 is satisfied as long as the hull of the msv has port starboard symmetry and force aft symmetry zhang et al 2019 since the application object of the proposed control scheme is the msvs with such symmetry assumption 1 is tenable 2 2 actuator saturation model due to physical restrictions such as hardware mass fuel the magnitude of the control input signals should be constrained wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 thus a discrepancy between the command control input τ ϑ and the actual control input sat τ ϑ would emerge once τ ϑ exceeds the maximum allowable value as stated in lu et al 2020 neglecting such an issue may lead to slower response to trajectory variation and even the divergence of the system regarding this similar to wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 lu et al 2020 a hard limited saturation model eq 4 is extra imposed on the system dynamics for problem formulation here 4 sat τ ϑ i sign τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i f τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i τ ϑ i i f τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 where the notation sign is the standard sign function and τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 represent the maximum allowable values of the corresponding control input signals an inspection of eq 4 reveals that such a model will give rise to a discontinuous signal when the control input approaches the saturated value and thus complicates the control design process on account of this we introduce a smooth dead zone based model o τ ϑ o τ ϑ 1 o τ ϑ 2 o τ ϑ 3 t to approximate the evolution of eq 4 such that the closed loop system is continuous wang and ji 2020 specifically we have 5 o τ ϑ i c i τ ϑ i d i i 1 2 3 6 d i 0 α i ℓ i β z τ ϑ i β d β i 1 2 3 where c i 0 α i ℓ i β d β i 1 2 3 are positive constants with α i 0 being a finite horizon related to τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 ℓ i β i 1 2 3 signify density functions satisfying ℓ i β 0 and vanishing at α i provided that β 0 z τ ϑ i β max τ ϑ i β min 0 τ ϑ i β is the dead zone operator a caveat here is that d i is bounded and it will be confirmed in the proof of lemma 1 based on eqs 4 6 we can eventually formulate the actuator dynamics as follows 7 sat τ ϑ c τ ϑ d δ where c diag c 1 c 2 c 3 d d 1 d 2 d 3 t δ t τ ϑ o τ ϑ lemma 1 wang and ji 2020 for any given maximum allowable force τ ϑ max i there is a density function ℓ i β such that 8 τ ϑ max i lim τ ϑ i o τ ϑ i 0 α i β ℓ i β d β proof according to the definition of z τ ϑ i β one can derive 9 lim τ ϑ i z τ ϑ i β τ ϑ i β substituting eqs 6 and 9 into eq 5 it yields 10 lim τ ϑ i o τ ϑ i c i τ ϑ i 0 α i τ ϑ i ℓ i β d β 0 α i β ℓ i β d β in light of the definition of c i we can thereby derive eq 8 meanwhile since o τ ϑ i is a continuous function wang and ji 2020 mousavi and khayatian 2016 the boundedness of o τ ϑ i is ensured as well which in turn implies that d i is bounded this completes the proof of lemma 1 remark 2 as stated in wang and ji 2020 this dead zone based model has the advantage that it is flexible enough to model multifarious saturation constraints either for soft limited or hard limited situations benefitting from its linearization feature the available robust and adaptive control techniques could be applied for this method as an instance fig 2 is given to show the validity of lemma 1 in fig 2 the density function is chosen as ℓ β max ζ sign α β 0 with ζ being a constant gain 2 3 tracking error dynamics model to proceed one can define the desired trajectory as 11 η d r ψ d ϑ d ϑ d f d t where η d x d y d ψ d t and ϑ d u d v d r d t are the desired kinematic and kinetic signals respectively f d t ℜ 3 1 denotes the desired dynamics vector accordingly one can obtain that the kinematics error vector as η e η η d and the kinetics error vector as ϑ e r ψ ϑ r ψ d ϑ d further the tracking error dynamics can be derived as 12 η e ϑ e ϑ e r ψ ϑ r ψ ϑ r ψ d ϑ d r ψ d ϑ d for the sake of brevity we define r r ψ r d r ψ d w w ψ w d w ψ d then according to eqs 1 and 7 together with the properties of r ψ mentioned above one can rewrite eq 12 as 13 η e ϑ e ϑ e p ϑ e ℱ d r m 1 c τ ϑ here p r w r t and ℱ p r d r d w d ϑ d r d f d t are known nonlinear terms whose relevant variables could be captured from onboard sensors or defined by the user d r m 1 f t ϑ τ d d δ denotes the lumped uncertainties assumption 2 qiao and zhang 2018 for the complex unknowns d pertaining to the msv there is an unknown positive constant d ℜ such that d d remark 3 in practice control forces are inevitably constrained owing to physical restrictions peng et al 2019 it implies that the velocities of msvs are bounded and thus guarantees the boundedness of f t ϑ in view of lemma 1 one can derive that δ d is bounded moreover the external environment always keeps changing with finite energies which means that τ d is bounded lu et al 2020 hence we can conclude that assumption 2 is tenable lemma 2 sontag 2013 for the initial value problem of the nonlinear system eq 14 14 x t f t x t x 0 ω x where f t x t r ω x r n with ω x r n being a nonempty open set if f t x t is locally lipschitz on x t and is continuous on t for each fixed x ω x then x t has a unique maximum solution 15 x t ω x t 0 t max on the time interval t 0 t max with t max ℜ corollary 1 sontag 2013 suppose that the hypotheses of lemma 2 hold for a maximal solution x 0 t max ω x if t max ℜ then there exists a time instant t 0 t max such that x t ω x hold for any compact set ω x ω x lemma3 ma et al 2014 suppose that there is a continuous and positive defined function v x satisfying k 1 x v x k 2 x and v x α v x β where k 1 k 2 ℜ n ℜ are class k functions α β are positive constants then x t would be semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub provided that x 0 is bounded 3 controller design and stability analysis in this section the introduction of the prescribed performance technology is given first based on this theoretical foundation the control objective of this paper is then constructed after that we present the controller design and stability analysis part 3 1 prescribed performance technology the crucial idea of prescribed performance technology is to impose a proper time varying prescribed performance function ppf ρ t as a constraint on the tracking error η e inspired by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 2014 we construct the ppf as follows 16 ρ i t ρ 0 i ρ i exp l i t ρ i i 1 2 3 where ρ 0 i 0 is the initial value of ρ i t selected to satisfy ρ 0 i η e i 0 ρ i 0 is the maximum admissible value of the tracking error and should be adjusted according to the mission s requirements l i 0 is the convergence rate of the ppf whose value dominates the convergence rate of η e i it can be seen that all these three parameters possess intuitive selection regulations then similar to bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 2014 a transformed error ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t is designed as 17 ξ i η e i ρ i i 1 2 3 here ρ t ρ 1 t ρ 2 t ρ 3 t t and η e η e 1 η e 2 η e 3 t apparently η e would evolve in the predefined region ρ t as long as ξ i i 1 2 3 are forced to γ 1 1 for all t 0 further it means that the desired transient and steady state behavior of tracking error η e can be characterized a priori quantitatively by selecting design parameters ρ 0 i ρ i and l i since the extra state constraint imposed on the control system would complicate the controller design a mapping function s ε s ε 1 s ε 2 s ε 3 t is used to transform the constrained system into a constraint free one bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 18 ξ i s ε i exp ε i exp ε i exp ε i exp ε i i 1 2 3 where ε i i 1 2 3 are the transformed error s ε i is a smooth and strictly increasing function satisfying 1 lim ε i 0 s ε i 0 2 1 s ε i 1 the inverse transformation of s ε i can be given by 19 ε i s 1 ξ i 1 2 ln 1 ξ i 1 ξ i as we can see ε i 1 1 ℜ also is a smooth and strictly increasing function as well an inspection of eq 18 reveals that η e i ρ i t t 0 would hold as long as s ε i is well define one can further infer from eq 19 that the above requirement is a direct consequence of the boundedness of ε i in order to endow η e with a priori guaranteed evolution region it can thereby just concern with stabilizing the unconstrained error ε i to intuitively explain the behavior of prescribed tracking error and the transformation function s ε i the graphical illustration is shown in fig 3 3 2 saturated approximation free prescribed performance control derivation this subsection focuses on designing an approximation free prescribed performance control scheme for msvs subject to uncertainties and input saturation constraints firstly the control objective is given as control objective this paper aims to develop a trajectory tracking controller τ ϑ such that the following mission requirements could be achieved r1 all signals of the resulting closed loop system are sguub for all t 0 r2 the tracking error η e could always be confined to a prespecified tolerance i e η e i ρ i t holds for all t 0 to achieve this one can define the error metric as 20 s ε k ε where k d i a g k 1 k 2 k 3 is a designed constant matrix with the satisfaction of k i 0 as we can see the error metric s s 1 s 2 s 3 t is designed as a combination of ε and its derivative ε such an auxiliary state is capable of guaranteeing both ε and ε to be sguub as long as the controller is properly designed such that s could be drived to a residual set recalling the statement below eq 19 we can further infer that r2 could be achieved once the boundedness of s is confirmed in light of the above presentation we differentiate s along with eq 13 to obtain the dynamic of the error metric as follows 21 s i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i 2 t η e i 2 k i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i k i η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 2 k i ρ i t η e i η e i 2 ρ

element of the given corresponding matrix vector to facilitate the following analysis the stack form of eq 21 is given by 24 s k l p η e ℱ d 2 g l η e k l r m 1 c τ ϑ where l diag l 1 l 2 l 3 g g 1 g 2 g 3 t at this point the achievement of r2 is ultimately transformed into a problem of stabilizing the dynamic system eq 24 in summary we have the following steps to endow the system with prescribed performance i imposing a proper ppf on the tracking error η e such that the transient and steady state performance indicators can be characterized a priori quantitatively for this purpose a constrained error ξ is designed ii transforming the constrained error ξ into an unconstrained one such that the complexity of control design can be reduced for this purpose a mapping function s ε ξ is given iii stabilizing the unconstrained error ε and its derivative simultaneously such that tracking error can strictly evolve inside the predefined region for this purpose an error metric s is constructed remark 4 in some existing works wang and hu 2020 wang et al 2019a the above design procedure is the opposite that is the error manifold is designed in advance and then the transformed error is defined although such a procedure would further simplify the control design process the ppf cannot be directly imposed on η e see theorem 1 of wang and hu 2020 as a result the parameter selection would not be as intuitive as in this paper in general both processes have their own benefits and designers can switch between the different frames if they would like with the above statement in mind the approximation free controller is designed as 25 τ ϑ k 1 s t θ s c 1 r l t θ s where k is a strictly positive control gain θ d i a g θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 is a user defined matrix with θ i 0 i 1 2 3 for the related parameters regulations please refer to section 4 3 and one caveat is that these gains affect control performance only within the preset range besides to intuitively illustrate the designing process the schematic diagram of the proposed control scheme is given in fig 4 remark 5 in the proposed control scheme eq 25 terms 1 s t θ s 1 and θ s are utilized to guarantee that the closed loop system is sguub even the occurrences of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties in order to endow the controller with prescribed performance metrics the term l t is embedded such that the tracking error η e can evolve strictly inside the predefined performance envelope the term c 1 is introduced herein to compensate for the effect of the saturation nonlinearity remark 6 as we can see from eq 25 that the proposed control scheme does not incorporate any prior knowledge of system nonlinearities furthermore there is no approximation structures such as adaptive laws estimation methods neural networks and fuzzy systems being employed to acquire such knowledge i e the controller is approximation free besides one can notice that no complex calculations neither analytic nor numerical are required to generate the control signals these factors can result in a low complexity architecture and less computation burden as for the detailed explanation of solving uncertainties one can refer to stability analysis and remark 7 remark 7 as stated in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 driving the tracking error strictly inside the predefined performance envelop means that the control performance specifications are solely determined by specific ppf ρ i t i 1 2 3 since ρ i t i 1 2 3 possess the intuitive parameter regulations together with the fact that auxiliary estimation structures containing extra gains are omitted the selection process of control gains is significantly simplified one can deduce from the above statement and remark 6 that the controller is user designer friendly 3 3 stability analysis the main results of this section are summarized in the following theorem where the controller eq 25 is utilized to guaranteed the boundedness of s and thus ensures that the tracking error η e can evolve inside its preset performance envelope theorem 1 consider the tracking error system eq 13 obeying assumptions 1 2 if the proposed control scheme eq 25 is applied with design parameters satisfying eqs 26 and 27 then it is ensured that r1 and r2 could be achieved 26 η e i 0 ρ 0 i i 1 2 3 27 s t 0 θ s 0 1 proof two steps are required for the illustration of theorem 1 firstly by means of lemma 2 the existence of a unique maximal solution ξ i γ i 1 1 i 1 2 3 on the time interval 0 t max is confirmed secondly we aim to illustrate from corollary 1 that t max would hold under the effort of the controller the above conclusion together with lemma 3 can eventually verify theorem 1 step 1 since ρ 0 i is selected to satisfy ρ 0 i η e i 0 i 1 2 3 it holds that ξ i 0 1 in this setting the time derivative of ξ i satisfies 28 ξ i ρ i 2 t η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t an inspection of eq 28 reveals that ξ i is continuous and locally integrable on t and locally lipschitz on ξ i besides we can ensure from eq 18 that ε i i 1 2 3 is well defined and continuous over the set γ i 1 1 thus according to lemma 2 there exists a unique maximal solution ξ i 0 t max γ i on the time interval 0 t max it means ξ i γ i t 0 t max holds with t max ℜ step 2 from the conclusion of step 1 one can ensure that ε i t 0 t max is well defined furthermore it can be inferred that s is continuously differentiable for all t 0 t max based on the above analysis we construct a lyapunov function as 29 v 1 4 s t θ s 2 its time derivative along with eq 24 is given by 30 v s t θ s s t θ s s t θ s k l p η e ℱ d 2 g l η e k l r m 1 c τ ϑ t θ s s t θ s p η e ℱ d 2 g k 1 η e r m 1 c τ ϑ t l t k t θ s due to the constraint imposed on the control input it makes sense that p is bounded since the reference trajectory η d ϑ d is defined by designers and r 1 holds it is easy to verify the boundedness of ℱ by virtue of assumptions 1 2 there is no doubt that d m 1 is bounded as well on the other hand from the conclusion of step 1 we can deduce that η e η e are both bounded on the time interval 0 t max further we have 31 l i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 a i i 1 2 3 32 g i η e i η e i 2 ρ i 2 t η e i η e i ρ i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t 2 ρ i t b i i 1 2 3 where a i b i i 1 2 3 are unknown positive constants hence the following inequality can be derived 33 ℱ p k 1 η e d 2 g q 1 34 l t k t θ s q 2 where q 1 0 q 2 0 are unknown constants on caveat here is that eqs 33 and 34 hold on the time interval 0 t max with t max ℜ rather than t max in what follows we will make sure that t max hold for this purpose defining ξ s t θ s and substituting the controller eq 25 into eq 30 yield 35 v ξ q 1 q 2 τ ϑ t c t m t r l t k t θ s ξ q 1 q 2 k 1 ξ s t θ t l r t m t r l t k t θ s ξ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 1 ξ ξ ξ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 1 ξ here λ 1 0 λ 2 0 are the minimum eigenvalue of matrix k k θ t and l r t m t r l t respectively to avoid overlength mathematical expressions we define μ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 such that eq 35 can be rewritten as 36 v ξ μ ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 1 ξ μ ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 μ ξ a v b where a 4 μ 1 ξ 1 b q 1 q 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 owing to the fact that μ 1 q 1 q 2 satisfies the inequality 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 and that 0 ξ 0 1 can be obtained by choosing proper θ to satisfy eq 27 the following two situations are discussed 1 if 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 ξ 0 1 holds ture it can be concluded via eq 35 that v 0 0 which means that ξ would keep decreasing until it satisfies the condition ξ μ 1 q 1 q 2 that is ξ will be forced to a residual set ω ξ 0 ξ μ 1 q 1 q 2 2 if 0 ξ 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 holds ture one can derive that ξ 4 v 4 b a 1 q 1 q 2 μ 1 due to a 0 and b 0 thus ξ still would drive to the residual set ω on the basis of the above analysis we can obtain that ξ would evolve in a small region ξ 0 δ for all t t max with δ max ξ 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 according to the definition of ξ one can further obtain the following inequality 37 δ θ i s i δ θ i i 1 2 3 t 0 t max then it is easy to argue from eqs 18 20 that 38 η e i ρ i t ξ i γ i i 1 2 3 t 0 t max where γ i γ i 1 1 according to corollary 1 if t max ℜ then for any compact subset γ i γ i there is a time instant t 0 t max such that ξ i t γ i however one can observe from eq 38 that ξ i t remains in a compact subset γ i for all t 0 t max such a contradiction implies that t max holds recalling eq 19 we can ensure that η e i would evolve strictly inside the constraint η e i ρ i t for all t 0 which in turn means that eqs 33 and 34 hold for all t 0 in view of this conclusion together with lemma 3 we can further ensure from eqs 35 and 36 that all closed loop system signals are sguub bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 chen et al 2021 at this point the proof of theorem 1 is completed remark 8 from the proof of theorem 1 it is observed that one can render the linear manifold s bounded to endow the resulting closed loop system with prescribed performance ability and guarantee the stability of the system simultaneously this means that the proposed control scheme can achieve its goals without the requirement of driving s to an arbitrarily small region which is different from previous sliding like methods qiao and zhang 2018 yao 2020 in this spirit the lumped uncertainties d can be compensated without any auxiliary control signals since they only affect the size of s but leave unaltered the achieved stability properties in other words the tracking performance which is solely determined by ρ i t i 1 2 3 becomes isolated against the model uncertainties thus extending the robustness of the proposed control scheme greatly remark 9 to endow the controller with anti saturation propery in the previous works wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 the estimation methods are used to compensate for the discrepancy between the command and actual control input on the contrary this paper imposed a smooth dead zone model eqs 5 6 on the control frame as shown in fig 4 such a model act as a filter confining the magnitude of control signals to counteract the effect of this model the term c 1 is added in the control scheme see eq 35 it is worth noting that one can obtain the maximal allowable values of control input signals by practical trials thus the value of c 1 can be easily derived remark 10 in this paper we mainly focus on the safety and portability of the system specifically the prescribed evolution of tracking error makes the system more secure since the occurrence of exceeding error is inhibited meanwhile the simple architecture low computation burden and intuitive parameter regulations render the controller portability such a controller will be suitable for many scenarios however as shown in eq 36 one drawback of the proposed controller is that only the asymptotic convergence rate is guaranteed which means that it will be unsuitable for time oriented missions to extend the application scope of the controller we will devote to improving the convergence rate of the closed loop system in the future 4 simulations and comparison results in this section some numerical simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm more specifically the external disturbance and model perturbance are imposed on the system to show the feasibility and robustness of the proposed control scheme at first then the comparative simulation results are presented for exhibiting the advantages of the proposed controller finally we focus on the performance variations under different design parameters throughout section 4 we perform numerical simulation experiments on the system described as eqs 39 and 40 the hydrodynamic parameters of this system are taken from skjetne et al 2005 it is notable that the model parameters are set to be unavailable for the proposed control scheme 39 η r ψ ϑ 40 m ϑ c ϑ ϑ d ϑ ϑ g f t ϑ sat τ ϑ τ d here c ϑ ℜ 3 3 denotes the centripetal and coriolis matrix d ϑ ℜ 3 3 denotes the hydrodynamic damping matrix g ℜ 3 denotes the model perturbation τ d ℜ 3 is the external disturbance all these three terms mentioned above are expressed in the body fixed frame the other parameters definitions are the same as that in eq 1 to clarify the input saturation model we assume that the maximum allowable control input signal is τ ϑ max i 300 i 1 2 3 in this context the control parameters that would be utilized in following experiments are selected as table 1 where the density function of dead zone model is chosen as ℓ β max ζ sign α β 0 with ζ being a constant 4 1 comparative results under different external disturbance in this subsection the desired trajectories are defined as eq 41 with initial states being η d 0 0 0 t and ϑ d 1 0 0 t as for the initial condition of the msv we select η 0 0 4 0 5 π 18 t and ϑ 0 0 8 0 1 0 05 t then two scenarios involving model perturbation and external disturbance are considered to demonstrate the robustness 41 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 05 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 01 cos 0 02 π t scenario i by referring to the literature lu et al 2018b we take the model perturbation g and the external disturbance τ d as follows 42 g 0 0279 v 2 0 0 0342 v 2 0 0 0912 u 2 0 0 0156 r 2 0 0 0278 u v 3 u v r 43 τ d 2 cos 0 5 t cos t 0 3 cos 0 5 t sin 0 5 t 3 0 1 sin 0 1 t 0 6 sin 1 1 t cos 0 3 t scenario ii the model perturbation g is given as the same as that in scenario i to imitate more practical external disturbance the second order gauss markov process z 1 is extra added to external disturbance formulation specifically we have wang and deng 2019 44 z 1 z 2 z 2 q t q z 1 2 n q z 2 λ ω τ d z 1 τ d where q diag 3 3 3 n diag 1 1 1 and λ diag 100 100 100 are positive definite matrixes ω ℜ 3 is zero mean gaussian white noises the time responses of tracking trajectories are presented in fig 5 from which it can be observed that the desired trajectory is successfully tracked with remarkable control performance fig 6 a b c depict the position errors η e i i 1 2 3 along with the corresponding performance envelopes thus we can ensure that the proposed controller can guarantee desired performance metrics and possess desirable robustness against uncertainties fig 6 d e f show the time responses of control input signals as we can see the control signals are indeed confined to τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 together with fig 6 a b c one can infer that the influence of input saturation constraints is significantly suppressed from figs 5 7 we can obtain that uncertainties appear to have less effect on the closed loop system which implies that the proposed controller has a good disturbance cancellation capability 4 2 comparative results under different control schemes to sufficiently verify the performance of the proposed control scheme we call it mfppc here comparative studies are conducted here in the following simulations the initial states of the msv and desired trajectories are set as η 0 0 5 0 7 π 36 t ϑ 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 t η d 1 0 5 π 18 t and ϑ d 0 3 0 0 t model perturbations and external disturbances are chosen the same as that in section 4 1 scenario i at first we aim to highlight the robustness of the proposed controller for this purpose a traditional model based prescribed performance controller considering input saturation constraint mbppc is given by 45 τ ϑ m r k c 1 η e m r c 1 u m r l k c 1 ω s 46 u e η e ℱ 2 g r m 1 f t ϑ 47 ω s i s i ς i f s i ς 1 s i g n s i ς o t h e r w i s e i 1 2 3 where ς is chosen as ς 0 01 and the other gains are chosen as table 1 the desired trajectory of this group simulation is selected as follows 48 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 01 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 001 sin 0 02 π t based on the above a comparative result shown in figs 7 8 is obtained specifically fig 7 shows that both controllers possess satisfactory trajectory tracking performance it must be mentioned that the mbppc requires the exact model parameter information even though its control accuracy seems similar to mfppc as illustrated in fig 8 a c additionally fig 8 d f depicted the control input signals of these two controllers are indeed constrained in maximum allowable magnitude τ ϑ max i 300 secondly we aim to exhibit the simplicity of the proposed controller for this purpose an nn based dynamic surface control scheme ndsc in hu et al 2020b is utilized as a comparative object the desired trajectory is chosen as eq 49 while the other settings are the same as that in the first group simulation of this subsection 49 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 05 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 002 cos 0 01 π t the time responses of tracking errors and control input signals are shown in figs 9 10 while a quantitative comparison of computation burden is given by table 2 it can be observed from fig 9 and fig 10 a c that ndsc possesses satisfactory control performance as well since the input saturation problem is left in the basket ndsc cannot guarantee the control input signals to be evolved in the desired constraint as illustrated in fig 10 d f to make a tradeoff between the magnitudes of control input signals and control performance we have conducted many trials to select the proper gains of ndsc in contrast the gains selection of mfppc is easily made for the detailed parameter regulations of ndsc please refer to hu et al 2020b to obtain the data in table 2 we select the ram of the computer as 8 gb and the platform of this experiment as matlab simulink apparently mfppc has less computational burden due to the fact that the online estimation process is ignored although the above comparisons demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control scheme there still exist two issues that deserved mention 1 the slower convergence rate an inspection of fig 8 a c and fig 10 a c reveals that the mfppc tracks trajectory slower than the other two methods as stated in remark 9 mfppc may be unsuitable for time oriented missions 2 the occurrence of the chattering phenomenon as shown in fig 8 d f and fig 10 d f such a phenomenon will harm actuators to some extend for sliding mode control large switching gain is often required to eliminate the effect arising from uncertainties and external disturbance which is a source of chattering lee and utkin 2007 besides an inspection of 1 s t θ s 1 s reveals that a large command signal would be generated once the tracking error is close to the predefined boundary when the variation of the reference trajectory becomes large we can think it as an additional disturbance in the closed loop system the hysteresis of the control response leaves the system suddenly moved away from the manifold i e the tracking error approaches the predefined boundary it follows that the control scheme generates a large command control signal to force the system to the manifold and thus leads to chattering phenomenon to eliminate the chattering the chattering free sliding mode surface may be an appropriate solution moreover a proper switching gain possessing chattering reduction can be used to replace 1 s t θ s 1 s the above problems are interesting and it is worth to be solved in our future work 4 3 exploration of the parameter space since the effect of parameters of ppf ρ t ρ 0 ρ exp κ t ρ has been detailed discussed in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 this subsection only aims to explore the sensitivity of the control performance to the selections of k and k here two groups of experiments are conducted with different parameters case 1 k is selected as k diag 1 1 1 and 1 k is selected as k 100 2 k is selected as k 800 case 2 k is selected as k 400 and 1 k is selected as k diag 1 1 0 5 2 k is selected as k diag 2 2 1 fig 11 shows the comparative result of different k case1 and fig 12 demonstrates the comparative result of different k case 2 the partially enlarged details of these results present the difference of convergence rate tracking accuracy and magnitude of control input signals it can be observed that the control performance is adjusted within the preset range by tuning k k specifically larger k leads to slower convergence rate and higher control accuracy while larger k endows the closed loop system with better transient performance besides larger control input signals would be given rise if we increase k k in summary one can find that these results effectively examine the impact of parameters variation on the control performance 5 conclusion in this paper a saturated approximation free tracking control scheme is developed compared with the existing works the proposed controller is simple and intuitiveness for implementation the specific reasons lie in two aspects 1 the uncertainties are isolated from the closed loop system by the prescribed performance technology and the saturation constraint problem is addressed by imposing a smooth dead zone model based filter as a result there is no need of extra estimation mechanism to compensate for uncertainties and saturation nonlinearity 2 the control performance just depends on the user defined performance function such that the parameter selection can to be more intuitive the theoretical stability of the proposed control scheme is confirmed by transforming the constrained error system to a constrained free one numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness in the future we are dedicated to constructing the semi physical simulation platform further to verify the practical applicability of the proposed control scheme on the other hand accelerating the convergence rate and reducing the chattering effect will also become the focuses of our future work credit authorship contribution statement cheng zhu conceptualization

20298,this paper devotes to tackling the saturated approximation free tracking control problem for unmanned marine surface vehicles with prescribed performance metrics firstly a smooth dead zone based model is introduced herein to address the saturation nonlinearity then the tracking error dynamics in presence of saturation constraints and uncertainties are formulated accordingly after that the capability to preset the evolution range of tracking errors is guaranteed by means of the prescribed performance technology it follows that a saturated approximation free control scheme is developed based on the sliding mode control notably the lumped uncertainties and the saturation nonlinearity are well handled totally free of the online estimations such that the control scheme is simple and intuitiveness for implementation it is theoretically verified that the controller can achieve the stabilization of the system finally simulation results are presented to illustrate the controller s efficacy keywords approximation free input saturation prescribed performance control unmanned marine surface vehicle 1 introduction during the past decades unmanned marine surface vehicles msvs have attracted a continuously growing interest from the academic community due to their broad ocean application prospects such as inspection surveillance and oceanography study to effectively complete these missions the msvs are usually expected to perform a sequence of accurate and steady trajectory tracking maneuvers however it is challenging to design a controller that can satisfy such a requirement on account of the harsh working environment and inherent uncertainties so far extensive efforts have been devoted to this topic aiming at endowing controllers with the ability to resist disturbances some advanced control design tools have been deeply researched such as sliding mode control smc 1 3 33 43 45 and backstepping control bp lu et al 2018a hu et al 2020a 2020b particularly smc has received wide attention due to its excellent anti disturbance capacity however a drawback of smc is also well known that is the chattering phenomenon typically wang et al 2017 wang and li 2012 addressed this issue by resorting to boundary function considering that the chattering can only be attenuated but cannot be eliminated in such a solution the discontinuous robust term was replaced with the adaptation technique in yao 2020 such that the controller is globally smooth it is worth noting that the literature yao 2020 wang et al 2017 wang and li 2012 considered not only chattering reduction but also finite time stability here although finite time stability endows the system with faster convergence rates the settling time of finite time stability is heavily dependent on the initial condition as stated in li and cai 2017 such a dependence leaves the acquirement of settling time difficult in practical applications regarding this different fixed time tracking control schemes were proposed in zhang et al 2020a 2020b through a combination of the extended state observer and the terminal sliding mode manifold where the settling time was independent of initial states and can be set in advance although the previous work of the msvs tracking control problem 1 3 33 43 44 effectively addressed uncertainties and have been widely accepted some related model parameters such as part information of inertial matrix still are required and thus resulting in restriction of their practical applications in practice it is unrealistic to obtain precise information on msvs dynamics as a consequence approximator based methods like neural network nn dai et al 2018 shen et al 2020 lu et al 2018b dong et al 2020 and fuzzy control strategies hai et al 2017 wang and he 2019 cao et al 2019 were adopted to reduce the negative influence of model parameter variations specifically the fuzzy logic system fls and the radial basis function neural network rbfnn were introduced to estimate the unknown dynamic perturbation in wang and he 2019 and dong et al 2020 respectively to improve the estimation accuracy a petri based recurrent type 2 fuzzy nn was built in hai et al 2017 besides the enormous neural network weights computational burden was effectively reduced in shen et al 2020 by means of the minimum learning parameter method mlp in lu et al 2018b a similar mlp based control algorithm was further proposed to tackle the formation control problem of msvs it is well known that the selections of fuzzy rules and neural networks render the control design process somehow tedious gao et al 2019 on the contrary data driven based controllers could be designed merely relying on the i o measurement data and thus largely simplifying the design procedure nowadays such control algorithms also have been profound in works weng and wang 2020 gao et al 2019 ferri et al 2018 han et al 2019 liao et al 2019 he et al 2020 for instance weng and wang 2020 successfully applied the data driven based controller to the practical underwater vehicle experiment however such a strategy was only designed suitable for the specific vehicle a mixed control structure containing the backstepping philosophy and sliding mode control was presented in ferri et al 2018 to improve the flexibility of the data driven controller besides the discrete i o driven controllers were developed in han et al 2019 liao et al 2019 where the pseudo partial derivative technology is utilized to dynamically linearize the nonlinear system along the dynamic operation points nevertheless most of the data driven controllers are used to collecting system states at the current scenario and adjusting control gains accordingly it may lead to control performance deterioration since the complex working environment means frequent changing of scenarios to this end one aim of this study is to develop an approximation free controller to deal with uncertainties apart from system uncertainties and ocean perturbances the prescribed control performance also has attracted considerable attention from the control community recently guaranteeing both transient and steady state performance of the system output response has the considerable significance of safely achieving marine missions liu et al 2020 nevertheless it is difficult to theoretically establish the formulation of transient performance i e the convergence rate and overshoot during the controller design process due to its complex engineering characteristics hu et al 2017 taking this challenge into account bechlioulis and rovithakis creatively visualized the prescribed performance as tracking error constraints by prescribed performance function ppf and then transformed the constrained system into an equivalent unconstrained one via an error transformation method bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 later this control framework was widely utilized in various fields involving spacecrafts hu et al 2017 shao et al 2020 autonomous ground vehicles hu et al 2019 and unmanned marine vehicles liu et al 2020 it is well known that the parameters of traditional ppf should be carefully selected according to the initial state errors to avert singularity bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 in practical applications nevertheless there may be significant measurement errors of the initial system state due to the unknown sensor noise or draft in consideration of this a novel ppf that does not require accurate initial errors was proposed in hu et al 2019 improving the ppf as well appointed time ppfs were proposed in yin et al 2019 liu et al 2019 such that the system errors can be forced to the predefined tolerance within preassigned time on the other hand recognizing that input saturation will severely degrade performance different solutions to such an issue were presented in shao et al 2018 yong et al 2020 wang et al 2019b although the previous works hu et al 2019 bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 shao et al 2018 2020 can successfully guarantee system signals evolving in a preselected region prior knowledge of model parameters is required for actual implementation motivated by the above discussions a saturated approximation free control scheme with the satisfaction of prescribed performance metrics is proposed in this paper to achieve msvs trajectory tracking missions the major contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 an approximation free control scheme is developed by virtue of the sliding mode control and the prescribed performance technology leaving the stability of the closed loop system isolating from uncertainties compared with the existing model free works ferri et al 2018 liao et al 2019 the transient and steady state behavior of tracking errors can be characterized quantitatively and be adjusted by a user defined performance function in advance 2 unlike the previous approximation free control schemes gao et al 2020 chen et al 2021 that assumes the saturation constraints to be large enough with scarce impact to the control performance the input saturation problem is explicitly considered in this paper specifically a smooth dead zone model which is used as a filter to confine command control signals is imposed on the control frame to endow the system with anti saturation property 3 the estimation mechanism either for uncertainties or saturation nonlinearity is removed from the control system such that the proposed control scheme has less computation burden and simpler architecture additionally the control performance is dominated by the intuitional performance function in this way the tedious and repeat parameter regulations guaranteeing error evolution to be acceptable is omitted thus the proposed control scheme is user designer friendly the remainder of this article is structured as follows in section 2 the problem formulation is presented in section 3 the saturated approximation free control scheme is proposed for the trajectory tracking of msvs numerical simulations are conducted in section 4 finally the main conclusion of this work is drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section the kinematic and dynamic models of the msv considering input saturation constraints and uncertainties are formulated as first then a smooth dead zone based model is given to approximate the input saturation nonlinearity adequately finally the tracking error dynamics are derived under the above models 2 1 kinematics and dynamics model of msv as depicted in fig 1 we define η x y ψ t comprising of msvs position x y and yaw angle ψ in the earth fixed frame ϑ u v r t comprising of msv s velocities u in surge v in sway and r in yaw angular with respect to body fixed frame within this context the nonlinear msv model subject to completely unknown dynamics and input saturation constraints can be described as wang and deng 2019 1 η r ψ ϑ m ϑ f t ϑ τ d s a t τ ϑ where m r 3 3 is the system inertia matrix f t ϑ r 3 1 denotes unknown nonlinear function encapsulating hydrodynamic forces and model parameter perturbations τ d denotes the external disturbances sat τ ϑ sat τ ϑ 1 sat τ ϑ 2 sat τ ϑ 3 t is the limited actual control input with τ ϑ being the command control input the jacobian transformation matrix r ψ is defined as 2 r ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 by referring to wang and deng 2019 we obtain that the equation r t ψ r 1 ψ holds and the derivative of r ψ can be written as r ψ r ψ w ψ with 3 w ψ 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 0 it is worth emphasizing that the proposed control algorithm is totally independent of model parameters as a consequence the term m presented in eq 1 would not be regarded as an accessible parameter in what follows assumption 1 zhang et al 2019 the inertia matrix m is positive definite and invertible remark 1 assumption 1 is satisfied as long as the hull of the msv has port starboard symmetry and force aft symmetry zhang et al 2019 since the application object of the proposed control scheme is the msvs with such symmetry assumption 1 is tenable 2 2 actuator saturation model due to physical restrictions such as hardware mass fuel the magnitude of the control input signals should be constrained wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 thus a discrepancy between the command control input τ ϑ and the actual control input sat τ ϑ would emerge once τ ϑ exceeds the maximum allowable value as stated in lu et al 2020 neglecting such an issue may lead to slower response to trajectory variation and even the divergence of the system regarding this similar to wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 lu et al 2020 a hard limited saturation model eq 4 is extra imposed on the system dynamics for problem formulation here 4 sat τ ϑ i sign τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i f τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i τ ϑ i i f τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 where the notation sign is the standard sign function and τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 represent the maximum allowable values of the corresponding control input signals an inspection of eq 4 reveals that such a model will give rise to a discontinuous signal when the control input approaches the saturated value and thus complicates the control design process on account of this we introduce a smooth dead zone based model o τ ϑ o τ ϑ 1 o τ ϑ 2 o τ ϑ 3 t to approximate the evolution of eq 4 such that the closed loop system is continuous wang and ji 2020 specifically we have 5 o τ ϑ i c i τ ϑ i d i i 1 2 3 6 d i 0 α i ℓ i β z τ ϑ i β d β i 1 2 3 where c i 0 α i ℓ i β d β i 1 2 3 are positive constants with α i 0 being a finite horizon related to τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 ℓ i β i 1 2 3 signify density functions satisfying ℓ i β 0 and vanishing at α i provided that β 0 z τ ϑ i β max τ ϑ i β min 0 τ ϑ i β is the dead zone operator a caveat here is that d i is bounded and it will be confirmed in the proof of lemma 1 based on eqs 4 6 we can eventually formulate the actuator dynamics as follows 7 sat τ ϑ c τ ϑ d δ where c diag c 1 c 2 c 3 d d 1 d 2 d 3 t δ t τ ϑ o τ ϑ lemma 1 wang and ji 2020 for any given maximum allowable force τ ϑ max i there is a density function ℓ i β such that 8 τ ϑ max i lim τ ϑ i o τ ϑ i 0 α i β ℓ i β d β proof according to the definition of z τ ϑ i β one can derive 9 lim τ ϑ i z τ ϑ i β τ ϑ i β substituting eqs 6 and 9 into eq 5 it yields 10 lim τ ϑ i o τ ϑ i c i τ ϑ i 0 α i τ ϑ i ℓ i β d β 0 α i β ℓ i β d β in light of the definition of c i we can thereby derive eq 8 meanwhile since o τ ϑ i is a continuous function wang and ji 2020 mousavi and khayatian 2016 the boundedness of o τ ϑ i is ensured as well which in turn implies that d i is bounded this completes the proof of lemma 1 remark 2 as stated in wang and ji 2020 this dead zone based model has the advantage that it is flexible enough to model multifarious saturation constraints either for soft limited or hard limited situations benefitting from its linearization feature the available robust and adaptive control techniques could be applied for this method as an instance fig 2 is given to show the validity of lemma 1 in fig 2 the density function is chosen as ℓ β max ζ sign α β 0 with ζ being a constant gain 2 3 tracking error dynamics model to proceed one can define the desired trajectory as 11 η d r ψ d ϑ d ϑ d f d t where η d x d y d ψ d t and ϑ d u d v d r d t are the desired kinematic and kinetic signals respectively f d t ℜ 3 1 denotes the desired dynamics vector accordingly one can obtain that the kinematics error vector as η e η η d and the kinetics error vector as ϑ e r ψ ϑ r ψ d ϑ d further the tracking error dynamics can be derived as 12 η e ϑ e ϑ e r ψ ϑ r ψ ϑ r ψ d ϑ d r ψ d ϑ d for the sake of brevity we define r r ψ r d r ψ d w w ψ w d w ψ d then according to eqs 1 and 7 together with the properties of r ψ mentioned above one can rewrite eq 12 as 13 η e ϑ e ϑ e p ϑ e ℱ d r m 1 c τ ϑ here p r w r t and ℱ p r d r d w d ϑ d r d f d t are known nonlinear terms whose relevant variables could be captured from onboard sensors or defined by the user d r m 1 f t ϑ τ d d δ denotes the lumped uncertainties assumption 2 qiao and zhang 2018 for the complex unknowns d pertaining to the msv there is an unknown positive constant d ℜ such that d d remark 3 in practice control forces are inevitably constrained owing to physical restrictions peng et al 2019 it implies that the velocities of msvs are bounded and thus guarantees the boundedness of f t ϑ in view of lemma 1 one can derive that δ d is bounded moreover the external environment always keeps changing with finite energies which means that τ d is bounded lu et al 2020 hence we can conclude that assumption 2 is tenable lemma 2 sontag 2013 for the initial value problem of the nonlinear system eq 14 14 x t f t x t x 0 ω x where f t x t r ω x r n with ω x r n being a nonempty open set if f t x t is locally lipschitz on x t and is continuous on t for each fixed x ω x then x t has a unique maximum solution 15 x t ω x t 0 t max on the time interval t 0 t max with t max ℜ corollary 1 sontag 2013 suppose that the hypotheses of lemma 2 hold for a maximal solution x 0 t max ω x if t max ℜ then there exists a time instant t 0 t max such that x t ω x hold for any compact set ω x ω x lemma3 ma et al 2014 suppose that there is a continuous and positive defined function v x satisfying k 1 x v x k 2 x and v x α v x β where k 1 k 2 ℜ n ℜ are class k functions α β are positive constants then x t would be semi globally uniformly ultimately bounded sguub provided that x 0 is bounded 3 controller design and stability analysis in this section the introduction of the prescribed performance technology is given first based on this theoretical foundation the control objective of this paper is then constructed after that we present the controller design and stability analysis part 3 1 prescribed performance technology the crucial idea of prescribed performance technology is to impose a proper time varying prescribed performance function ppf ρ t as a constraint on the tracking error η e inspired by bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 2014 we construct the ppf as follows 16 ρ i t ρ 0 i ρ i exp l i t ρ i i 1 2 3 where ρ 0 i 0 is the initial value of ρ i t selected to satisfy ρ 0 i η e i 0 ρ i 0 is the maximum admissible value of the tracking error and should be adjusted according to the mission s requirements l i 0 is the convergence rate of the ppf whose value dominates the convergence rate of η e i it can be seen that all these three parameters possess intuitive selection regulations then similar to bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 2014 a transformed error ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 t is designed as 17 ξ i η e i ρ i i 1 2 3 here ρ t ρ 1 t ρ 2 t ρ 3 t t and η e η e 1 η e 2 η e 3 t apparently η e would evolve in the predefined region ρ t as long as ξ i i 1 2 3 are forced to γ 1 1 for all t 0 further it means that the desired transient and steady state behavior of tracking error η e can be characterized a priori quantitatively by selecting design parameters ρ 0 i ρ i and l i since the extra state constraint imposed on the control system would complicate the controller design a mapping function s ε s ε 1 s ε 2 s ε 3 t is used to transform the constrained system into a constraint free one bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 18 ξ i s ε i exp ε i exp ε i exp ε i exp ε i i 1 2 3 where ε i i 1 2 3 are the transformed error s ε i is a smooth and strictly increasing function satisfying 1 lim ε i 0 s ε i 0 2 1 s ε i 1 the inverse transformation of s ε i can be given by 19 ε i s 1 ξ i 1 2 ln 1 ξ i 1 ξ i as we can see ε i 1 1 ℜ also is a smooth and strictly increasing function as well an inspection of eq 18 reveals that η e i ρ i t t 0 would hold as long as s ε i is well define one can further infer from eq 19 that the above requirement is a direct consequence of the boundedness of ε i in order to endow η e with a priori guaranteed evolution region it can thereby just concern with stabilizing the unconstrained error ε i to intuitively explain the behavior of prescribed tracking error and the transformation function s ε i the graphical illustration is shown in fig 3 3 2 saturated approximation free prescribed performance control derivation this subsection focuses on designing an approximation free prescribed performance control scheme for msvs subject to uncertainties and input saturation constraints firstly the control objective is given as control objective this paper aims to develop a trajectory tracking controller τ ϑ such that the following mission requirements could be achieved r1 all signals of the resulting closed loop system are sguub for all t 0 r2 the tracking error η e could always be confined to a prespecified tolerance i e η e i ρ i t holds for all t 0 to achieve this one can define the error metric as 20 s ε k ε where k d i a g k 1 k 2 k 3 is a designed constant matrix with the satisfaction of k i 0 as we can see the error metric s s 1 s 2 s 3 t is designed as a combination of ε and its derivative ε such an auxiliary state is capable of guaranteeing both ε and ε to be sguub as long as the controller is properly designed such that s could be drived to a residual set recalling the statement below eq 19 we can further infer that r2 could be achieved once the boundedness of s is confirmed in light of the above presentation we differentiate s along with eq 13 to obtain the dynamic of the error metric as follows 21 s i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i 2 t η e i 2 k i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i k i η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 2 k i ρ i t η e i η e i 2 ρ i 2 t η e i 2 2 2 k i η e i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 2 k i 1 ρ i t ε i ξ i j 1 3 p i j ϑ e j ℱ i d i j 1 3 r m 1 i j c i τ ϑ j η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t ρ i t 2 k i 1 ρ i t ε i ξ i η e i η e i 2 ρ i 2 t η e i η e i ρ i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 1 ρ i t ε i ξ i η e i k i l i j 1 3 p i j ϑ e j ℱ i d i 2 g i l i η e i k i l i j 1 3 r m 1 i j c i τ ϑ j 22 l i t ρ i 1 t ε i ξ i ρ i 2 t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 23 g i η e i η e i 2 ρ i 2 t η e i η e i ρ i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t 2 ρ i t here p i j ℱ i d i r m 1 i j and ϑ e j are the j th column and the i th row element of the given corresponding matrix vector to facilitate the following analysis the stack form of eq 21 is given by 24 s k l p η e ℱ d 2 g l η e k l r m 1 c τ ϑ where l diag l 1 l 2 l 3 g g 1 g 2 g 3 t at this point the achievement of r2 is ultimately transformed into a problem of stabilizing the dynamic system eq 24 in summary we have the following steps to endow the system with prescribed performance i imposing a proper ppf on the tracking error η e such that the transient and steady state performance indicators can be characterized a priori quantitatively for this purpose a constrained error ξ is designed ii transforming the constrained error ξ into an unconstrained one such that the complexity of control design can be reduced for this purpose a mapping function s ε ξ is given iii stabilizing the unconstrained error ε and its derivative simultaneously such that tracking error can strictly evolve inside the predefined region for this purpose an error metric s is constructed remark 4 in some existing works wang and hu 2020 wang et al 2019a the above design procedure is the opposite that is the error manifold is designed in advance and then the transformed error is defined although such a procedure would further simplify the control design process the ppf cannot be directly imposed on η e see theorem 1 of wang and hu 2020 as a result the parameter selection would not be as intuitive as in this paper in general both processes have their own benefits and designers can switch between the different frames if they would like with the above statement in mind the approximation free controller is designed as 25 τ ϑ k 1 s t θ s c 1 r l t θ s where k is a strictly positive control gain θ d i a g θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 is a user defined matrix with θ i 0 i 1 2 3 for the related parameters regulations please refer to section 4 3 and one caveat is that these gains affect control performance only within the preset range besides to intuitively illustrate the designing process the schematic diagram of the proposed control scheme is given in fig 4 remark 5 in the proposed control scheme eq 25 terms 1 s t θ s 1 and θ s are utilized to guarantee that the closed loop system is sguub even the occurrences of external disturbances and parametric uncertainties in order to endow the controller with prescribed performance metrics the term l t is embedded such that the tracking error η e can evolve strictly inside the predefined performance envelope the term c 1 is introduced herein to compensate for the effect of the saturation nonlinearity remark 6 as we can see from eq 25 that the proposed control scheme does not incorporate any prior knowledge of system nonlinearities furthermore there is no approximation structures such as adaptive laws estimation methods neural networks and fuzzy systems being employed to acquire such knowledge i e the controller is approximation free besides one can notice that no complex calculations neither analytic nor numerical are required to generate the control signals these factors can result in a low complexity architecture and less computation burden as for the detailed explanation of solving uncertainties one can refer to stability analysis and remark 7 remark 7 as stated in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 driving the tracking error strictly inside the predefined performance envelop means that the control performance specifications are solely determined by specific ppf ρ i t i 1 2 3 since ρ i t i 1 2 3 possess the intuitive parameter regulations together with the fact that auxiliary estimation structures containing extra gains are omitted the selection process of control gains is significantly simplified one can deduce from the above statement and remark 6 that the controller is user designer friendly 3 3 stability analysis the main results of this section are summarized in the following theorem where the controller eq 25 is utilized to guaranteed the boundedness of s and thus ensures that the tracking error η e can evolve inside its preset performance envelope theorem 1 consider the tracking error system eq 13 obeying assumptions 1 2 if the proposed control scheme eq 25 is applied with design parameters satisfying eqs 26 and 27 then it is ensured that r1 and r2 could be achieved 26 η e i 0 ρ 0 i i 1 2 3 27 s t 0 θ s 0 1 proof two steps are required for the illustration of theorem 1 firstly by means of lemma 2 the existence of a unique maximal solution ξ i γ i 1 1 i 1 2 3 on the time interval 0 t max is confirmed secondly we aim to illustrate from corollary 1 that t max would hold under the effort of the controller the above conclusion together with lemma 3 can eventually verify theorem 1 step 1 since ρ 0 i is selected to satisfy ρ 0 i η e i 0 i 1 2 3 it holds that ξ i 0 1 in this setting the time derivative of ξ i satisfies 28 ξ i ρ i 2 t η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t an inspection of eq 28 reveals that ξ i is continuous and locally integrable on t and locally lipschitz on ξ i besides we can ensure from eq 18 that ε i i 1 2 3 is well defined and continuous over the set γ i 1 1 thus according to lemma 2 there exists a unique maximal solution ξ i 0 t max γ i on the time interval 0 t max it means ξ i γ i t 0 t max holds with t max ℜ step 2 from the conclusion of step 1 one can ensure that ε i t 0 t max is well defined furthermore it can be inferred that s is continuously differentiable for all t 0 t max based on the above analysis we construct a lyapunov function as 29 v 1 4 s t θ s 2 its time derivative along with eq 24 is given by 30 v s t θ s s t θ s s t θ s k l p η e ℱ d 2 g l η e k l r m 1 c τ ϑ t θ s s t θ s p η e ℱ d 2 g k 1 η e r m 1 c τ ϑ t l t k t θ s due to the constraint imposed on the control input it makes sense that p is bounded since the reference trajectory η d ϑ d is defined by designers and r 1 holds it is easy to verify the boundedness of ℱ by virtue of assumptions 1 2 there is no doubt that d m 1 is bounded as well on the other hand from the conclusion of step 1 we can deduce that η e η e are both bounded on the time interval 0 t max further we have 31 l i ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 a i i 1 2 3 32 g i η e i η e i 2 ρ i 2 t η e i η e i ρ i t ρ i t ρ i 2 t η e i 2 η e i ρ i t η e i ρ i t 2 ρ i t b i i 1 2 3 where a i b i i 1 2 3 are unknown positive constants hence the following inequality can be derived 33 ℱ p k 1 η e d 2 g q 1 34 l t k t θ s q 2 where q 1 0 q 2 0 are unknown constants on caveat here is that eqs 33 and 34 hold on the time interval 0 t max with t max ℜ rather than t max in what follows we will make sure that t max hold for this purpose defining ξ s t θ s and substituting the controller eq 25 into eq 30 yield 35 v ξ q 1 q 2 τ ϑ t c t m t r l t k t θ s ξ q 1 q 2 k 1 ξ s t θ t l r t m t r l t k t θ s ξ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 1 ξ ξ ξ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 1 ξ here λ 1 0 λ 2 0 are the minimum eigenvalue of matrix k k θ t and l r t m t r l t respectively to avoid overlength mathematical expressions we define μ q 1 q 2 λ 1 λ 2 such that eq 35 can be rewritten as 36 v ξ μ ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 1 ξ μ ξ 1 ξ q 1 q 2 μ ξ a v b where a 4 μ 1 ξ 1 b q 1 q 2 ξ 1 ξ 1 owing to the fact that μ 1 q 1 q 2 satisfies the inequality 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 and that 0 ξ 0 1 can be obtained by choosing proper θ to satisfy eq 27 the following two situations are discussed 1 if 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 ξ 0 1 holds ture it can be concluded via eq 35 that v 0 0 which means that ξ would keep decreasing until it satisfies the condition ξ μ 1 q 1 q 2 that is ξ will be forced to a residual set ω ξ 0 ξ μ 1 q 1 q 2 2 if 0 ξ 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 holds ture one can derive that ξ 4 v 4 b a 1 q 1 q 2 μ 1 due to a 0 and b 0 thus ξ still would drive to the residual set ω on the basis of the above analysis we can obtain that ξ would evolve in a small region ξ 0 δ for all t t max with δ max ξ 0 μ 1 q 1 q 2 1 according to the definition of ξ one can further obtain the following inequality 37 δ θ i s i δ θ i i 1 2 3 t 0 t max then it is easy to argue from eqs 18 20 that 38 η e i ρ i t ξ i γ i i 1 2 3 t 0 t max where γ i γ i 1 1 according to corollary 1 if t max ℜ then for any compact subset γ i γ i there is a time instant t 0 t max such that ξ i t γ i however one can observe from eq 38 that ξ i t remains in a compact subset γ i for all t 0 t max such a contradiction implies that t max holds recalling eq 19 we can ensure that η e i would evolve strictly inside the constraint η e i ρ i t for all t 0 which in turn means that eqs 33 and 34 hold for all t 0 in view of this conclusion together with lemma 3 we can further ensure from eqs 35 and 36 that all closed loop system signals are sguub bechlioulis and rovithakis 2014 chen et al 2021 at this point the proof of theorem 1 is completed remark 8 from the proof of theorem 1 it is observed that one can render the linear manifold s bounded to endow the resulting closed loop system with prescribed performance ability and guarantee the stability of the system simultaneously this means that the proposed control scheme can achieve its goals without the requirement of driving s to an arbitrarily small region which is different from previous sliding like methods qiao and zhang 2018 yao 2020 in this spirit the lumped uncertainties d can be compensated without any auxiliary control signals since they only affect the size of s but leave unaltered the achieved stability properties in other words the tracking performance which is solely determined by ρ i t i 1 2 3 becomes isolated against the model uncertainties thus extending the robustness of the proposed control scheme greatly remark 9 to endow the controller with anti saturation propery in the previous works wang and deng 2019 yao 2020 the estimation methods are used to compensate for the discrepancy between the command and actual control input on the contrary this paper imposed a smooth dead zone model eqs 5 6 on the control frame as shown in fig 4 such a model act as a filter confining the magnitude of control signals to counteract the effect of this model the term c 1 is added in the control scheme see eq 35 it is worth noting that one can obtain the maximal allowable values of control input signals by practical trials thus the value of c 1 can be easily derived remark 10 in this paper we mainly focus on the safety and portability of the system specifically the prescribed evolution of tracking error makes the system more secure since the occurrence of exceeding error is inhibited meanwhile the simple architecture low computation burden and intuitive parameter regulations render the controller portability such a controller will be suitable for many scenarios however as shown in eq 36 one drawback of the proposed controller is that only the asymptotic convergence rate is guaranteed which means that it will be unsuitable for time oriented missions to extend the application scope of the controller we will devote to improving the convergence rate of the closed loop system in the future 4 simulations and comparison results in this section some numerical simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm more specifically the external disturbance and model perturbance are imposed on the system to show the feasibility and robustness of the proposed control scheme at first then the comparative simulation results are presented for exhibiting the advantages of the proposed controller finally we focus on the performance variations under different design parameters throughout section 4 we perform numerical simulation experiments on the system described as eqs 39 and 40 the hydrodynamic parameters of this system are taken from skjetne et al 2005 it is notable that the model parameters are set to be unavailable for the proposed control scheme 39 η r ψ ϑ 40 m ϑ c ϑ ϑ d ϑ ϑ g f t ϑ sat τ ϑ τ d here c ϑ ℜ 3 3 denotes the centripetal and coriolis matrix d ϑ ℜ 3 3 denotes the hydrodynamic damping matrix g ℜ 3 denotes the model perturbation τ d ℜ 3 is the external disturbance all these three terms mentioned above are expressed in the body fixed frame the other parameters definitions are the same as that in eq 1 to clarify the input saturation model we assume that the maximum allowable control input signal is τ ϑ max i 300 i 1 2 3 in this context the control parameters that would be utilized in following experiments are selected as table 1 where the density function of dead zone model is chosen as ℓ β max ζ sign α β 0 with ζ being a constant 4 1 comparative results under different external disturbance in this subsection the desired trajectories are defined as eq 41 with initial states being η d 0 0 0 t and ϑ d 1 0 0 t as for the initial condition of the msv we select η 0 0 4 0 5 π 18 t and ϑ 0 0 8 0 1 0 05 t then two scenarios involving model perturbation and external disturbance are considered to demonstrate the robustness 41 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 05 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 01 cos 0 02 π t scenario i by referring to the literature lu et al 2018b we take the model perturbation g and the external disturbance τ d as follows 42 g 0 0279 v 2 0 0 0342 v 2 0 0 0912 u 2 0 0 0156 r 2 0 0 0278 u v 3 u v r 43 τ d 2 cos 0 5 t cos t 0 3 cos 0 5 t sin 0 5 t 3 0 1 sin 0 1 t 0 6 sin 1 1 t cos 0 3 t scenario ii the model perturbation g is given as the same as that in scenario i to imitate more practical external disturbance the second order gauss markov process z 1 is extra added to external disturbance formulation specifically we have wang and deng 2019 44 z 1 z 2 z 2 q t q z 1 2 n q z 2 λ ω τ d z 1 τ d where q diag 3 3 3 n diag 1 1 1 and λ diag 100 100 100 are positive definite matrixes ω ℜ 3 is zero mean gaussian white noises the time responses of tracking trajectories are presented in fig 5 from which it can be observed that the desired trajectory is successfully tracked with remarkable control performance fig 6 a b c depict the position errors η e i i 1 2 3 along with the corresponding performance envelopes thus we can ensure that the proposed controller can guarantee desired performance metrics and possess desirable robustness against uncertainties fig 6 d e f show the time responses of control input signals as we can see the control signals are indeed confined to τ ϑ i τ ϑ max i i 1 2 3 together with fig 6 a b c one can infer that the influence of input saturation constraints is significantly suppressed from figs 5 7 we can obtain that uncertainties appear to have less effect on the closed loop system which implies that the proposed controller has a good disturbance cancellation capability 4 2 comparative results under different control schemes to sufficiently verify the performance of the proposed control scheme we call it mfppc here comparative studies are conducted here in the following simulations the initial states of the msv and desired trajectories are set as η 0 0 5 0 7 π 36 t ϑ 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 t η d 1 0 5 π 18 t and ϑ d 0 3 0 0 t model perturbations and external disturbances are chosen the same as that in section 4 1 scenario i at first we aim to highlight the robustness of the proposed controller for this purpose a traditional model based prescribed performance controller considering input saturation constraint mbppc is given by 45 τ ϑ m r k c 1 η e m r c 1 u m r l k c 1 ω s 46 u e η e ℱ 2 g r m 1 f t ϑ 47 ω s i s i ς i f s i ς 1 s i g n s i ς o t h e r w i s e i 1 2 3 where ς is chosen as ς 0 01 and the other gains are chosen as table 1 the desired trajectory of this group simulation is selected as follows 48 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 01 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 001 sin 0 02 π t based on the above a comparative result shown in figs 7 8 is obtained specifically fig 7 shows that both controllers possess satisfactory trajectory tracking performance it must be mentioned that the mbppc requires the exact model parameter information even though its control accuracy seems similar to mfppc as illustrated in fig 8 a c additionally fig 8 d f depicted the control input signals of these two controllers are indeed constrained in maximum allowable magnitude τ ϑ max i 300 secondly we aim to exhibit the simplicity of the proposed controller for this purpose an nn based dynamic surface control scheme ndsc in hu et al 2020b is utilized as a comparative object the desired trajectory is chosen as eq 49 while the other settings are the same as that in the first group simulation of this subsection 49 f d 1 t 0 01 cos 0 015 π t f d 2 t 0 05 sin 0 1 π t f d 3 t 0 002 cos 0 01 π t the time responses of tracking errors and control input signals are shown in figs 9 10 while a quantitative comparison of computation burden is given by table 2 it can be observed from fig 9 and fig 10 a c that ndsc possesses satisfactory control performance as well since the input saturation problem is left in the basket ndsc cannot guarantee the control input signals to be evolved in the desired constraint as illustrated in fig 10 d f to make a tradeoff between the magnitudes of control input signals and control performance we have conducted many trials to select the proper gains of ndsc in contrast the gains selection of mfppc is easily made for the detailed parameter regulations of ndsc please refer to hu et al 2020b to obtain the data in table 2 we select the ram of the computer as 8 gb and the platform of this experiment as matlab simulink apparently mfppc has less computational burden due to the fact that the online estimation process is ignored although the above comparisons demonstrate the advantages of the proposed control scheme there still exist two issues that deserved mention 1 the slower convergence rate an inspection of fig 8 a c and fig 10 a c reveals that the mfppc tracks trajectory slower than the other two methods as stated in remark 9 mfppc may be unsuitable for time oriented missions 2 the occurrence of the chattering phenomenon as shown in fig 8 d f and fig 10 d f such a phenomenon will harm actuators to some extend for sliding mode control large switching gain is often required to eliminate the effect arising from uncertainties and external disturbance which is a source of chattering lee and utkin 2007 besides an inspection of 1 s t θ s 1 s reveals that a large command signal would be generated once the tracking error is close to the predefined boundary when the variation of the reference trajectory becomes large we can think it as an additional disturbance in the closed loop system the hysteresis of the control response leaves the system suddenly moved away from the manifold i e the tracking error approaches the predefined boundary it follows that the control scheme generates a large command control signal to force the system to the manifold and thus leads to chattering phenomenon to eliminate the chattering the chattering free sliding mode surface may be an appropriate solution moreover a proper switching gain possessing chattering reduction can be used to replace 1 s t θ s 1 s the above problems are interesting and it is worth to be solved in our future work 4 3 exploration of the parameter space since the effect of parameters of ppf ρ t ρ 0 ρ exp κ t ρ has been detailed discussed in bechlioulis and rovithakis 2008 this subsection only aims to explore the sensitivity of the control performance to the selections of k and k here two groups of experiments are conducted with different parameters case 1 k is selected as k diag 1 1 1 and 1 k is selected as k 100 2 k is selected as k 800 case 2 k is selected as k 400 and 1 k is selected as k diag 1 1 0 5 2 k is selected as k diag 2 2 1 fig 11 shows the comparative result of different k case1 and fig 12 demonstrates the comparative result of different k case 2 the partially enlarged details of these results present the difference of convergence rate tracking accuracy and magnitude of control input signals it can be observed that the control performance is adjusted within the preset range by tuning k k specifically larger k leads to slower convergence rate and higher control accuracy while larger k endows the closed loop system with better transient performance besides larger control input signals would be given rise if we increase k k in summary one can find that these results effectively examine the impact of parameters variation on the control performance 5 conclusion in this paper a saturated approximation free tracking control scheme is developed compared with the existing works the proposed controller is simple and intuitiveness for implementation the specific reasons lie in two aspects 1 the uncertainties are isolated from the closed loop system by the prescribed performance technology and the saturation constraint problem is addressed by imposing a smooth dead zone model based filter as a result there is no need of extra estimation mechanism to compensate for uncertainties and saturation nonlinearity 2 the control performance just depends on the user defined performance function such that the parameter selection can to be more intuitive the theoretical stability of the proposed control scheme is confirmed by transforming the constrained error system to a constrained free one numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness in the future we are dedicated to constructing the semi physical simulation platform further to verify the practical applicability of the proposed control scheme on the other hand accelerating the convergence rate and reducing the chattering effect will also become the focuses of our future work credit authorship contribution statement cheng zhu conceptualization

predicting fatigue loads the assessing methods and formulas are proposed involving the wave spectrum sea wave height wave loading transfer function zero crossing period possibility of sea state occurrence and wave direction meanwhile the model test of the wave loads is carried out in a see keeping basin for studying the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function the corrected formulas of the significant wave height and mean zero crossing period are statistically regressed by calculating the sea states in the northwest pacific and south china sea furthermore the influence factors of the sea states of difference seasons are analysed and the distribution law of the wave direction of the wave loads and fatigue life of a semi submersible platform are investigated finally the fatigue reliability index of typical structures for a semi submersible platform is assessed on the basis of uncertainties of wave loads and the other uncertainties of structural factors keywords uncertainty wave loads fatigue reliability semi submersible 1 introduction the traditional and deterministic strength assessment methods have a certain negative effect on the safety design and review of marine structures due to manufacturing technology material properties and some hypotheses on strength and loading calculations thus more reasonable approaches for assessing the structure and loading must be based on statistics theory to guarantee the sufficient safety reliability of marine structures furthermore advanced design rules of marine structures demand a reliable design for marine platforms the structural fatigue reliability of the ship hull has been studied widely ang et al 2001 feng and low 2012 mahmoud et al 2014 doshi et al 2017 the fatigue damage induced by wave frequency and low frequency nongaussian bimodal wave loading in a mooring line has been investigated by frequency domain methods the correctness of which is validated by time domain simulations gao and moan 2007 furthermore the wide banded fatigue damage of the catenary mooring lines of wind turbines has been evaluated by various artificial neural network models li et al 2018 in addition the structural fatigue reliability of offshore platforms has been assessed under different failure scenarios gholizad et al 2012 and artificial transfer functions are introduced to save time the fatigue life reliability of the welded structure of a ship hull has been investigated by the improved paris law and monte carlo simulation yan and huang 2015 a direct method using 3d linear potential flow theory and spectral analysis is adopted to assess the structural fatigue reliability of a high performance trimaran zhen et al 2018 the statistical uncertainty of the parameters and fatigue reliability have been analysed for a jacket platform under a storm sea state including the uncertainty of the wave height nava viveros and heredia zavoni 2018 the fatigue reliability of butt welded joints with misalignments has been analysed based on the monte carlo method and the hotspot stress approach dong et al 2019 the main types and the damage model of offshore structures have been summarized including a description of the main statistical signal processing analysis of gaussian and narrow band history jimenez martinez 2019 in terms of the uncertainty analysis of wave loads the various uncertainties of short term and long term wave loading mainly for north atlantic and global sea states have been investigated in detail guedes soares 1984 however the author has not found any analysis for the northwest pacific which is very important for the ships and ocean engineering designs of asia in addition guedes soares has mainly analysed short term and long term uncertainties of total ship wave loading but has not studied any uncertainties of fatigue wave loading then the influences of the sea state annual variation in the north atlantic on long term wave loading have been analysed moan et al 2005 meanwhile the uncertainties of the vertical bending moment for floating production storage and offloading fpso the local structure stress and the fatigue loading have been studied furthermore the uncertainties of short term and long term wave loading predictions for a semi submersible platform including the uncertainties of the wave spectrum wave height and wave loading transfer function have been investigated wu 2011 yang et al 2012 the model uncertainties derived from different wave models and turbulence are adopted on fatigue reliability estimates of offshore wind turbine monopiles colone et al 2018 the uncertainties of external load effects related to foundation fatigue have been proposed for a detailed wind directional model wind wave misalignment and a second order wave load model horn et al 2019 previous studies have mainly focused on the structural part of the fatigue reliability method but less on the uncertainty of external wave loads in this paper to study the uncertainties of wave loads in fatigue life assessment and structural fatigue reliability formulas are established by considering the uncertainties under the random wave loading effect at the same time the model test of the wave loading is carried out in the sea keeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc to investigate the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function furthermore the new regressing formulas of the wave height and period are proposed to consider various sea states with the statistical data of buoy and ship observations in the northwest pacific for the wave height and period meanwhile the effects of the wave period uncertainty on the structural stress amplitude and fatigue life are evaluated the influence of the possibility of a sea state occurrence on the structural fatigue life is assessed by using the long term sea state scatter of the s4 zone in the south china sea in which the wave direction distribution rules are also used to investigate the uncertainty of the wave direction and the effect on the structural fatigue life finally the fatigue reliability index of the typical structures for a semi submersible platform is predicted on the basis of uncertainties of wave loading and the other uncertainties the main purpose of this paper is to study the fatigue reliability of the typical dangerous structures of a serving semi submersible platform in the south china sea which has served for 8 years and is considered fatigue safe the results of the fatigue reliability index could supply guiding significance for the same type of platform 2 uncertainty analysis method of the fatigue life 2 1 fatigue life under a sea environment the long term statistical characteristics of the sea state are determined by a wave scatter diagram during the service life of an offshore platform on the basis of the fatigue damage linear cumulative rule the total fatigue stress parameter could be obtained by linear superposition through every sea state in the short term considering rain drop and low stress range corrections and short term stress characteristics obeying the rayleigh distribution the equation of the structural fatigue stress parameter is hu et al 2010 1 ω 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i λ i f 0 i γ i p j σ i m where q denotes the total number of wave directions p j denotes the possibility of the wave direction occurrence σ i denotes alternating stress amplitude in the ith sea state γ denotes the gamma function f 0i denotes the zero crossing frequency of the stress response for each sea state in the short term γ i denotes the possibility of each combination of h s and t z occurrence k denotes the total number of sea states in the short term from the wave scatter diagram ε i denotes the band coefficient λ m ε i denotes the rain drop correction coefficient wirsching and light 1980 m denotes the slope parameter of the s n curve and λ i denotes the fatigue damage correction coefficient considering the low stress range hu et al 2010 after considering the uncertainties of the fatigue cumulative damage and stress parameters the structural fatigue life with the s n curve method is as follows 2 t f δ a b m ω where a is a random parameter of the s n curve δ denotes a random parameter involving fatigue cumulative damage and b denotes random parameters considering uncertainties in the fatigue loading calculation the uncertainties of wave loading in the fatigue damage assessment include the sea wave spectrum wave height zero crossing period wave loading transfer function occurring possibility and wave direction and each uncertainty factor is a random variable 2 2 fatigue stress parameter with a random factor some random variables are introduced such as φ s to describe the uncertainty of the sea wave spectrum φ l to describe the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function φ h to describe the uncertainty of the wave height φ z to describe the uncertainty of the mean zero crossing period and φ t to describe the total uncertainty of the short term response assuming these uncertainties are independent of each other it is concluded that the sea wave spectrum is proportional to the square of the wave height on the other hand the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function is considered in the hotspot stress transfer function the total bias φ t of the zero order moment of the stress response under the short term sea state is as follows 3 φ t φ s φ l 2 φ h 2 φ z the mean value and cov are as follows and the detailed derivation process of the above formula is shown in appendix a 4a φ t φ s φ l 2 φ h 2 φ z 4b v t 2 v s 2 4 v l 2 v h 2 v z 2 furthermore the stress parameter considering the uncertainty factors in the fatigue life calculation in the long term sea state is derived by using the s n curve method which is as follows 5 b w m ω s φ η 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i p j φ t σ i j 2 m 2 φ η φ q ω s where ω s denotes the unbiased nominal value of the stress parameter then the following formula is introduced 6 ω φ q ω s 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i p j φ t σ i j 2 m 2 when φ t is equal to the mean value φ t the corresponding stress parameter in eq 6 is ω moreover φ t is equal to 1 0 and the unbiased stress parameter in eq 6 is ω s then the mean value of the bias of the stress parameter is as follows 7 φ q ω ω s 3 uncertainty analysis of wave loads of semi submersible platforms 3 1 main parameters of the semi submersible platform a semi submersible platform serves mainly in the south china sea and east china sea which is designed to withstand a typhoon once in 200 years and the design life is 30 years the overall length and breadth are 114 m and 78 m respectively the upper deck is 38 m above the baseline the design draught is 19 m and the displacement is 50 000 tons the hull is shown in fig 1 a the fatigue life of many key joints of semi submersible offshore platforms needs to be evaluated in this paper taking the local structure at the junction of the brackets and columns as an example a typical joint a point at the junction of the brackets and columns is selected as shown in fig 1 b and c because the natural frequencies of structures under random wave loads are much larger than those at wave energy concentrations the structural alternating stress response of semi submersible offshore platforms can be regarded as a quasi static process 3 2 sea wave spectrum the uncertainty of the sea wave spectrum could simply be taken as follows for a short term sea state h s t z if a different wave spectrum is taken to describe the sea state the corresponding calculation results vary for actual engineering calculations a theoretical spectrum formula that is different from the real sea state is generally used and a series of uncertainties have been taken in at present some theoretical spectra such as the p m spectrum jonswap spectrum and double peak spectrum are recommended in the engineering field the zero order moment of the wave loading mean square response is r θ i α h s t z i 1 n s ω i θ i h s t z 1 ε i ω i h s t z 8a h 2 ω i α δ ω i where h ω i α denotes the wave loading transfer function and α and ω i denote the wave direction and wave frequency respectively s ω i θ i h s t z denotes the wave spectrum θ i denotes the spectrum style ε i is a random parameter with a mean normal distribution of zero the uncertainties due to variations in the spectrum could be represented by the zero order moment of some loading response spectra and each spectrum has one conditional probability then the mean value and variance of the total bias are 8b r r θ f θ θ d θ 8c v a r r v a r r θ r θ r 2 f θ θ d θ where θ denotes a different spectrum f θ denotes the possibility of a spectrum occurrence and the uncertainty of r is presented as eqs 8b and 8c which is from the uncertainty of the spectrum and the differences among them the msr mean square response loading value with the standard spectrum is as follows 9 r s 0 s ω h 2 ω d ω where s ω could be the p m spectrum the bias relative to the standard spectrum is 10a φ s r r s where φ s has the same distribution type as r and is also normally distributed the mean value and cov of bias are 10b φ s α h s t z r α h s t z r s α h s t z 10c v φ s α h s t z v r α h s t z the p m spectrum and jonswap spectrum are chosen to synthetically simulate the real sea state for analysing the spectrum uncertainty due to wave spectrum representation according to the results guedes soares 1984 the occurrence possibility of the p m spectrum in the north atlantic is p h s 0 86 0 06 h s for h s 14 33 m and p h s 0 for h s 14 33 m the variance in ε i equals 0 525 the p m spectrum is chosen as the standard spectrum the uncertainty results of the three main loadings of the semi submersible platform dnv rp c103 2005 in surviving conditions h s 13 7 m t z 11 89 s are shown in table 1 including the lvbm longitudinal vertical bending moment tvbm transverse vertical bending moment and thsf transverse horizontal splitting force the results show that the bias mean value of the spectrum ranges from 0 90 to 0 99 and the cov ranges from 0 17 to 0 19 it is concluded that the bias approaches 1 0 and the cov is comparatively large which implies that the uncertainty of the spectrum mainly induces discreteness 3 3 wave heights the current sources of long term wave statistics can be divided into the following categories measured data by instruments postpredicted data eye observed data and improved eye observed data fang et al 1996 generally the data measured by instruments are relatively reliable but in practice the data are expensive and scarce and the short term data are difficult to predict the long term statistical characteristics the post predicted or eye observed data have accumulated for a long time in most sea areas so the latter several data also have considerable value the wave height and period in the instrument survey are generally accurate and can be treated as the true value however the errors of the wave height and period in the eye observed survey in the ship survey are large and need to be converted into the true value through an appropriate correction formula based on the eye measurement and theoretical analysis the regression formulas between the true significant wave height h s and eye observed value h v in the north atlantic have been presented as follows guedes soares 1984 11 h s 2 33 0 75 h v ε s 1 59 where ε denotes the normal random distribution variable and the mean value and standard deviation of ε are zero and s respectively the eye observed value is always selected from the long term scatter diagram of the sea states then the bias mean value and cov of the wave height are 12a φ h h s h v 0 75 2 33 h v 12b v h v a r φ h e φ h 1 59 0 75 h v 2 33 the mean square response of wave loading is proportional to the square of the wave height then the bias mean value of the mean square response of wave loading caused by the uncertainty of the wave height is 13c φ h s φ h 2 the mean value and cov of the wave height bias are shown in table 2 since the targeted semi submersible platform in the paper is located in the northwest pacific the regression formula of the wave height should be studied again the sea state data of the significant wave height in the northwest pacific ocean are shown in tables 3 and 4 fang et al 1996 the buoy data are from the japanese buoy station results the buoy measurement lasts approximately one year the ship report data adopt the direct statistical results of the whole wave group although the data in tables 3 and 4 are the average values of the wave heights of the whole sea state data they can also reflect the differences and trends between the instrumental measured and eye observed data based on the sea states of significant wave height in the northwest pacific the new relationship between h s and h v could be regressed as follows 14 h s 0 45 0 76 h v ε where ε is the normal random variable which has a zero mean value and standard deviation s the statistical relationship of the standard deviation between h s and h v is shown in table 5 the variance relationship between h s and h v is as follows based on the data in table 5 15 σ h s 2 0 76 2 σ h v 2 σ ε 2 the value of s 0 560 for the sea state of the northwest pacific then v h 0 560 0 76 h v 0 45 furthermore the bias mean value and cov of the wave height in the northwest pacific could be assessed and the corresponding results are shown in table 6 after comparing table 2 with table 6 it is revealed that the cov of the wave height formula in the paper is less than that of guedes soares s formula this may be because the formula in the paper is regressed for the northwest pacific but the guedes soares has regressed for the north atlantic the latter s sea state is more terrible meanwhile the statistical discreteness and standard deviation are larger thus the new regressed equation of eq 15 is meaningful for the floating structures in the northwest pacific 3 4 mean zero crossing period and effect on the stress amplitude there is a certain difference in the mean zero crossing period between the eye observed and measured values the relationship between the measured data and ship observed results has been investigated for the northwest pacific using zero crossing period data fang et al 1996 the regressing formula between the measured and observed data is 16 t m a t v b ε where a and b denote constant coefficients and are related to the sea states ε is the normal random variable of which the mean value and standard deviation are zero and σ ε respectively then the bias mean value and cov of the period are 17a φ p t m t v a b t v 17b v p σ φ p e φ p σ ε a t v b the statistically measured results and eye observed data of the mean crossing period in the northwest pacific are shown in tables 7 and 8 the new linear regression relationship of the period is 18 t m 3 59 0 62 t v ε where ε is the normal random variable which has a zero mean value and standard deviation s the statistical relationship of the standard deviation between t m and t v is shown in table 9 the variance relationship between t m and t v is as follows based on the data in table 9 the variance relationship between t m and t v is 19 σ t m 2 0 62 2 σ t v 2 σ ε 2 where σ t m and σ t v denote the standard deviation of t m and t v respectively s 0 533 then v p 0 533 0 62 t v 3 59 the zero order moment of the stress amplitude response is derived by considering the uncertainty effect of the wave period 20 r α h s t z i 1 n s ω i h s t z φ p h 2 ω i α δ ω i the unbiased r p0 is obtained from eq 20 during φ p 1 0 when φ p φ p the mean value of r is r p only considering the uncertainty of the zero crossing period then the bias mean value φ z of r caused by the uncertainty of period is 21 φ z α h s t z r p r p 0 when φ p φ p φ p v p r becomes r p when φ p φ p φ p v p r becomes r p the variance of φ z is 22a σ φ z α h s t z r p r p 2 r p 0 it can be proven that eq 21 and eq 22a have one order precision then the cov v z of φ z is 22b v z α h s t z r p r p 2 r p it is assumed in eq 22a and eq 22b that the mean value and cov of φ z are not related to the significant wave height the calculated results of a semi submersible platform are shown in table 10 3 5 wave loading transfer function to rationally investigate the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function wave loading model tests should be carried out the semi submersible model test with a scale ratio of 1 40 is carried out in the sea keeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc as shown in figs 2 and 3 l b and h denote the length breadth and depth of the semi submersible platform respectively and g is the gravity acceleration the transverse vertical moment and horizontal splitting force loading transfer function of the middle longitudinal section are measured meanwhile the experimental values are taken as true standard values and the uncertainties induced by various factors in the model test are 5 the numerical predictions and experimental results of the transverse vertical moment and horizontal splitting force loading transfer function in the beam sea are shown in fig 4 a and b if the experimental data and numerical results are taken as the true value and theoretical value respectively the numerical results of the bias mean value and cov of the loading transfer function are shown in table 13 since there are some systematic and incidental errors in the model test and the transverse vertical moment is remarkably larger than the horizontal splitting force the measured signal of the horizontal splitting force is less and the measuring errors may be larger than the transverse vertical moment which is demonstrated by the results in table 13 the relationship between the test value h m ω and the numerical predicted value h t ω is expressed by the following formula 23 h m ω φ l ω h t ω where φ l ω denotes a random variable in this paper it is assumed that the statistical parameter of the bias coefficient φ l ω of the load transfer function is independent of the circular frequency ω the uncertainty analysis results of the load transfer function of the horizontal splitting force and transverse vertical bending moment are shown in tables 11 and 12 after considering the 5 uncertainties in the model test the cov of the transverse vertical moment transfer function is 0 10 2 0 05 2 0 11 and the cov of the horizontal splitting force transfer function is 0 18 2 0 05 2 0 19 taking the bias mean value and cov in table 13 as references it is rational to suppose that the mean value of the wave loading transfer function bias b f is 0 76 1 14 and the cov is 0 11 0 19 then the bias mean value and cov are taken as 0 90 and 0 15 in the later calculations respectively meanwhile the conclusion is extended to each direction the mean square response is proportional to the square of the loading transfer function 3 6 the possibility of the sea state occurrence and the effect on the stress parameter generally the sea state sets are from the statistical regression analysis of the data for many years since the sea state sets have seasonal and annual variations the sea state sets obtained by various times have comparatively large differences using the sea state set in the north atlantic with various statistical periods such as 1 2 4 and 29 years the influence on long term extreme forecasting and fatigue life assessment has been investigated moan et al 2005 if 1 year is taken as a statistical period there are 29 fatigue damage values the ratio of the maximum and minimum fatigue damage is 4 3 for fpso and 1 9 for a semi submersible platform which shows that the sea state occurrence possibilities during different statistical periods have a comparatively large influence on the fatigue life assessment results in addition it is concluded that the significant wave height obviously varies by year nolte 1973 and the annual variation in the sea state has been analysed guedes soares and ferreira 1995 to investigate the uncertainty of the possibility of sea state occurrence in the sea state scatter diagram the fatigue life of the semi submersible platform is assessed by the sea state set of the s4 sea zone in the south china sea fang et al 1996 as shown in fig 5 the sea state data of the s4 sea zone are divided into spring summer autumn winter and whole year and the wave direction is divided into eight wave directions and all wave directions so there are 45 5 9 sea state scatter diagrams in the s4 sea zone the detailed sea state data are listed in the reference fang et al 1996 the 45 sea state scatter diagrams contain the influence of the season and wave directions and it is difficult to calculate the two factors directly thus the 45 sea states are divided into two parts to consider the possibility of the sea state occurrence and the effect on the stress parameters including the season effect and wave direction effect the influence of the possibility of sea state occurrence by wave direction will be discussed in the next section assuming that the occurring probability of each wave direction is equal the s n curve method is adopted to calculate the fatigue life by using the four seasons and the whole year sea state scatter diagrams five scatter diagrams in total in the s4 sea zone the results are shown in table 14 the mean four seasons weighted sum refers to the fatigue life calculated after the average weighted sum of the stress parameters of four seasons in spring summer autumn and winter it can be seen that there is a great fluctuation in the structural fatigue life calculated according to the sea state scatter diagram in different seasons the dimensionless calculation is based on the weighted sum of four seasons the ratio of the maximum and minimum fatigue life is 4 3 which occurs in summer and autumn respectively and it can be seen that the sea condition is worse in autumn and winter than in spring and summer it can also be seen that the weighted sum of the four seasons is not consistent with the calculation result of the whole year sea state scatter diagram and the weighted sum of the four seasons is 1 05 times that of the whole year the reason for this difference lies in the difference between the weighted sum of the sea state scatter diagram of the four seasons and the whole year sea state scatter diagram in addition the difference between the methods of calculating the fatigue life by calculating the stress parameters in different seasons and then accumulating the stress parameter results the fatigue life by adding the scatter diagram in different seasons and the fatigue life for example in the sea state scatter diagram including all the wave directions considering the short term sea state probability of a significant wave height of 0 0 5 m and a mean zero crossing period of 6 s the weighted sum of the fatigue life of the four seasons is 23 75 years the fatigue life is 29 years for the whole year sea state scatter diagram and the difference is obvious according to miner s fatigue cumulative damage principle the fatigue damage caused by actual sea conditions should be calculated by calculating the fatigue cumulative damage caused by four seasons and then the total fatigue damage is accumulated if the whole year sea state scatter diagram is directly used there will be some deviation from the above calculation results which is shown in table 14 assuming the possibility of occurrence of each wave direction is equal and considering the influence of uncertainty of the occurrence possibility on the stress parameter the true stress parameter is expressed as follows 24 φ ω s 1 4 q 2 2 m γ m 2 1 n 1 4 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i n σ i j m where ω s denotes the unbiased nominal value of the stress parameter k and q denote the short term sea state number and direction number respectively φ denotes the bias coefficient and is a random variable which is used to express the uncertainty of the possibility of occurrence and n denotes the four seasons thes bias φ of the possibility of occurrence of the sea states for the fatigue stress parameter ω s is 0 955 as shown in table 15 3 7 wave direction and effect on the stress parameter since different wave directions have different sea states the possibility of sea state occurrence is related to the occurrence possibility of the wave direction the wave directions are defined in table 16 the heading direction of the floating platform has a certain random distribution and the wave direction generally does not obey a uniform distribution which makes it difficult to establish the heading wave angle thus the random heading wave angle is introduced to solve the problem the traditional method assumes that the heading wave angle obeys uniformity in the wave loading assessment for actual engineering design this paper adopts sea state statistical data for the whole year to investigate the uncertainty of the wave direction and assess the effect of the wave direction uncertainty on the fatigue life assessment this shows that the sea state scatter is very complex from the data of the s4 sea zone 1 the uncertainty of possibility of wave direction occurrence to study the influence of the heading angle of the semi submersible platform on the fatigue life evaluation the heading angle of the semi submersible platform is assumed to be uniform during the service life so that the distribution law of the wave direction of the platform can be obtained through the distribution law of the wave direction in the sea state data at the same time the sea state data of the whole year include the sea state scatter diagram of all the wave directions the heading direction is divided into four cases east south west and north the 0 wave direction of the sea state data in the s4 area in the literature is defined as north the fatigue life results are shown in table 17 the calculation results of the uniform direction in the table refer to the fatigue life when the distribution of the wave direction is uniform which means that the mean of the stress parameters of each direction is used to calculate the fatigue life it can be seen that the fatigue life results obtained from different heading directions are quite different among which the south is the safest so it is better for the bow of the platform to face the south when working in this sea area since the wave direction varies greatly with seasons and years the statistical wave direction data in the sea state data must have greater uncertainty in addition to the randomness of the heading angle of the ship or offshore platform the angle distribution that affects the fatigue life of the structure needs to be studied which needs the support of the statistical data to carry out the relevant analysis the stress parameter ω under uniform heading distribution is taken as nominal stress parameter ω s and the stress parameter under actual heading is ω d the bias is defined as η 1 and the result is 0 824 25c η 1 ω d ω s 2 the uncertainty of the sea state scatter diagram under various wave directions the sea state scatter diagram of the s4 sea zone is different under different wave directions fang et al 1996 the structural fatigue life calculated by sea state data of the different wave directions is shown in table 18 the sea state data in the northeast and north are the worst while the sea state data in the southeast south southwest west and northwest are relatively mild in the sea state sets of the s4 sea zone there are some differences among the sets of single wave directions and the sets including all the wave directions traditionally the sea state sets including all the directions are used to assess the fatigue life but the more exact structural fatigue damage should accumulate the fatigue damage of each sea state set under different wave directions therefore it induces bias of the fatigue life including stress parameters now the bias η 2 of the stress parameter caused by the uncertainty of the sea state sets under various wave directions is 25a η 2 ω s 2 2 m γ m 2 1 1 q n 1 q j 1 q i 1 k λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i n p n σ i j m n 1 q p n where ω s denotes the nominal value of the stress parameter calculated by the sea state sets including all directions under a uniform heading distribution k and q are the number of short tern sea states and wave directions respectively and p n denotes the possibility of wave direction occurrence assuming that the heading wave angle obeys a uniform distribution and that the occurrence possibility of the sea state scatter diagram of each wave direction is uniform the bias is 0 963 finally the total bias of the stress parameter due to the uncertainty of the wave direction is 25b η η 1 η 2 the result of η is 0 794 less than 1 0 which reveals that the method directly using the sea state scatter diagram of the full directions and the assumption of a uniform wave direction to assess the fatigue life is too conservative 4 fatigue reliability analysis 4 1 results in the short term sea states based on the previous results of the paper an uncertainty analysis is carried out for the northwest pacific the calculated uncertainty results of the total zero order moment under the short term sea state h s 4 5 m and t z 8 0 s for the semi submersible platform are shown in table 19 the sea state has the highest contribution to fatigue damage 4 2 results in the long term sea states the result of φ q for the semi submersible platform is 0 438 from eq 5 it is obtained that 26 b w m φ η φ q the mean value of b w m is expressed as follows the mean value for the semi submersible platform is 0 332 27 b w m φ η φ q the mean square variance of ω is derived through the taylor series expansion 28 σ ω d ω d φ t σ φ t substituting eq 6 into eq 28 it is obtained that 29 σ ω m 2 2 2 m γ m 2 1 j 1 q i 1 k λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i p j φ t m 2 1 σ φ t σ i j m from eq 6 the mean square variance of φ q can be calculated by σ φ q σ ω ω s and the result for the semi submersible platform is 0 309 the cov of b w m is 30 c b w m φ η σ φ q φ η φ q σ φ q φ q eq 30 shows that the cov of b w m is only related to the short term uncertainty and is independent of the possibility of the occurrence of the sea state and wave direction the cov c b w m for the semi submersible platform is 0 722 assuming that b w m obeys a lognormal distribution the middle value of b w m is 0 269 which is calculated by 31a b w m μ b w m 1 c b w m 2 0 5 because both b w and b w m obey lognormal distributions the middle value and cov of b w are 0 646 and 0 39 respectively as calculated by 31b b w b w m 1 m 31c c b w 2 1 c b w m 2 1 m 1 4 3 fatigue reliability index the uncertainties in the fatigue stress calculation can be described by a random b which is expressed as 32 b i b i i m w n h where m denotes the structure fabrication technology w denotes the sea wave description n denotes the nominal stress calculation and h is the hotspot stress coefficient b i and b all obey lognormal distributions meanwhile the values of b i are shown in table 20 and b w adopts the previous result in the paper the limit state equation of the fatigue life with the method of the s n curve is 33 z ln t f ln t d ln δ a b m ω ln t d where δ a and b obey lognormal distributions ω and t d denote the stress parameter and design life which are 616 and 30 years for the semi submersible respectively the variable δ obeys a lognormal distribution

equation and the result is 2 2 which is the fatigue reliability index of the typical joint the junction of the bracket and column of the semi submersible platform according to the literature ssc 392 1996 the target value of the hot spot fatigue reliability index of a general hull structure is between 2 0 and 3 0 if the semi submersible platform is also checked according to this standard the local structure at this point can meet the requirements of the fatigue strength however due to the lack of a statistical reliability design index for semi submersible platforms the data have certain guiding significance for the design of offshore platforms 34 β μ z σ z ln δ ln a m ln b ln ω ln t d ln 1 c δ 2 ln 1 c a 2 m 2 ln 1 c b 2 1 2 5 conclusions a proper method is proposed to assess the uncertainties of fatigue wave loading mainly including the uncertainties of the wave spectrum wave loading transfer function wave height mean zero crossing period occurrence possibility of the sea state and wave direction as well as the influence on the wave loading and fatigue life moreover the fatigue reliability index is investigated according to the uncertainties of the loading and strength some important conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the mean value of the wave loading transfer function bias is 0 76 1 14 and the cov is 0 11 0 19 the uncertainty results of the wave height are assessed for the northwest pacific which are very different from those of the north atlantic the new regressed formula is meaningful for the floating structures in the northwest pacific 2 there are some comparatively large differences among the sea state scatter diagrams of various seasons that induce certain uncertainties in the fatigue life for the south china sea the sea states in spring and summer have smaller contributions to fatigue damage than those in autumn and winter 3 the distribution principle of the wave direction has a distinguishing influence on the fatigue life meanwhile the traditional assumption of the uniform wave direction and the full direction sea state sets make the predicted results too conservative thus the actual distribution principle and uncertainties of the wave direction are worthy of study and concern 4 the mean value and cov of the wave loading uncertainties are 0 646 and 0 39 respectively while assessing the fatigue reliability the fatigue reliability index of a typical joint the junction of the bracket and column of the semi submersible platform is 2 2 which has certain guiding significance for the design of offshore platforms credit

20299,the statistical uncertainties of wave loads have large proportions in the structural fatigue strength analysis of offshore platforms to investigate the uncertainties of wave loads during predicting fatigue loads the assessing methods and formulas are proposed involving the wave spectrum sea wave height wave loading transfer function zero crossing period possibility of sea state occurrence and wave direction meanwhile the model test of the wave loads is carried out in a see keeping basin for studying the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function the corrected formulas of the significant wave height and mean zero crossing period are statistically regressed by calculating the sea states in the northwest pacific and south china sea furthermore the influence factors of the sea states of difference seasons are analysed and the distribution law of the wave direction of the wave loads and fatigue life of a semi submersible platform are investigated finally the fatigue reliability index of typical structures for a semi submersible platform is assessed on the basis of uncertainties of wave loads and the other uncertainties of structural factors keywords uncertainty wave loads fatigue reliability semi submersible 1 introduction the traditional and deterministic strength assessment methods have a certain negative effect on the safety design and review of marine structures due to manufacturing technology material properties and some hypotheses on strength and loading calculations thus more reasonable approaches for assessing the structure and loading must be based on statistics theory to guarantee the sufficient safety reliability of marine structures furthermore advanced design rules of marine structures demand a reliable design for marine platforms the structural fatigue reliability of the ship hull has been studied widely ang et al 2001 feng and low 2012 mahmoud et al 2014 doshi et al 2017 the fatigue damage induced by wave frequency and low frequency nongaussian bimodal wave loading in a mooring line has been investigated by frequency domain methods the correctness of which is validated by time domain simulations gao and moan 2007 furthermore the wide banded fatigue damage of the catenary mooring lines of wind turbines has been evaluated by various artificial neural network models li et al 2018 in addition the structural fatigue reliability of offshore platforms has been assessed under different failure scenarios gholizad et al 2012 and artificial transfer functions are introduced to save time the fatigue life reliability of the welded structure of a ship hull has been investigated by the improved paris law and monte carlo simulation yan and huang 2015 a direct method using 3d linear potential flow theory and spectral analysis is adopted to assess the structural fatigue reliability of a high performance trimaran zhen et al 2018 the statistical uncertainty of the parameters and fatigue reliability have been analysed for a jacket platform under a storm sea state including the uncertainty of the wave height nava viveros and heredia zavoni 2018 the fatigue reliability of butt welded joints with misalignments has been analysed based on the monte carlo method and the hotspot stress approach dong et al 2019 the main types and the damage model of offshore structures have been summarized including a description of the main statistical signal processing analysis of gaussian and narrow band history jimenez martinez 2019 in terms of the uncertainty analysis of wave loads the various uncertainties of short term and long term wave loading mainly for north atlantic and global sea states have been investigated in detail guedes soares 1984 however the author has not found any analysis for the northwest pacific which is very important for the ships and ocean engineering designs of asia in addition guedes soares has mainly analysed short term and long term uncertainties of total ship wave loading but has not studied any uncertainties of fatigue wave loading then the influences of the sea state annual variation in the north atlantic on long term wave loading have been analysed moan et al 2005 meanwhile the uncertainties of the vertical bending moment for floating production storage and offloading fpso the local structure stress and the fatigue loading have been studied furthermore the uncertainties of short term and long term wave loading predictions for a semi submersible platform including the uncertainties of the wave spectrum wave height and wave loading transfer function have been investigated wu 2011 yang et al 2012 the model uncertainties derived from different wave models and turbulence are adopted on fatigue reliability estimates of offshore wind turbine monopiles colone et al 2018 the uncertainties of external load effects related to foundation fatigue have been proposed for a detailed wind directional model wind wave misalignment and a second order wave load model horn et al 2019 previous studies have mainly focused on the structural part of the fatigue reliability method but less on the uncertainty of external wave loads in this paper to study the uncertainties of wave loads in fatigue life assessment and structural fatigue reliability formulas are established by considering the uncertainties under the random wave loading effect at the same time the model test of the wave loading is carried out in the sea keeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc to investigate the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function furthermore the new regressing formulas of the wave height and period are proposed to consider various sea states with the statistical data of buoy and ship observations in the northwest pacific for the wave height and period meanwhile the effects of the wave period uncertainty on the structural stress amplitude and fatigue life are evaluated the influence of the possibility of a sea state occurrence on the structural fatigue life is assessed by using the long term sea state scatter of the s4 zone in the south china sea in which the wave direction distribution rules are also used to investigate the uncertainty of the wave direction and the effect on the structural fatigue life finally the fatigue reliability index of the typical structures for a semi submersible platform is predicted on the basis of uncertainties of wave loading and the other uncertainties the main purpose of this paper is to study the fatigue reliability of the typical dangerous structures of a serving semi submersible platform in the south china sea which has served for 8 years and is considered fatigue safe the results of the fatigue reliability index could supply guiding significance for the same type of platform 2 uncertainty analysis method of the fatigue life 2 1 fatigue life under a sea environment the long term statistical characteristics of the sea state are determined by a wave scatter diagram during the service life of an offshore platform on the basis of the fatigue damage linear cumulative rule the total fatigue stress parameter could be obtained by linear superposition through every sea state in the short term considering rain drop and low stress range corrections and short term stress characteristics obeying the rayleigh distribution the equation of the structural fatigue stress parameter is hu et al 2010 1 ω 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i λ i f 0 i γ i p j σ i m where q denotes the total number of wave directions p j denotes the possibility of the wave direction occurrence σ i denotes alternating stress amplitude in the ith sea state γ denotes the gamma function f 0i denotes the zero crossing frequency of the stress response for each sea state in the short term γ i denotes the possibility of each combination of h s and t z occurrence k denotes the total number of sea states in the short term from the wave scatter diagram ε i denotes the band coefficient λ m ε i denotes the rain drop correction coefficient wirsching and light 1980 m denotes the slope parameter of the s n curve and λ i denotes the fatigue damage correction coefficient considering the low stress range hu et al 2010 after considering the uncertainties of the fatigue cumulative damage and stress parameters the structural fatigue life with the s n curve method is as follows 2 t f δ a b m ω where a is a random parameter of the s n curve δ denotes a random parameter involving fatigue cumulative damage and b denotes random parameters considering uncertainties in the fatigue loading calculation the uncertainties of wave loading in the fatigue damage assessment include the sea wave spectrum wave height zero crossing period wave loading transfer function occurring possibility and wave direction and each uncertainty factor is a random variable 2 2 fatigue stress parameter with a random factor some random variables are introduced such as φ s to describe the uncertainty of the sea wave spectrum φ l to describe the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function φ h to describe the uncertainty of the wave height φ z to describe the uncertainty of the mean zero crossing period and φ t to describe the total uncertainty of the short term response assuming these uncertainties are independent of each other it is concluded that the sea wave spectrum is proportional to the square of the wave height on the other hand the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function is considered in the hotspot stress transfer function the total bias φ t of the zero order moment of the stress response under the short term sea state is as follows 3 φ t φ s φ l 2 φ h 2 φ z the mean value and cov are as follows and the detailed derivation process of the above formula is shown in appendix a 4a φ t φ s φ l 2 φ h 2 φ z 4b v t 2 v s 2 4 v l 2 v h 2 v z 2 furthermore the stress parameter considering the uncertainty factors in the fatigue life calculation in the long term sea state is derived by using the s n curve method which is as follows 5 b w m ω s φ η 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i p j φ t σ i j 2 m 2 φ η φ q ω s where ω s denotes the unbiased nominal value of the stress parameter then the following formula is introduced 6 ω φ q ω s 2 2 m γ m 2 1 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i p j φ t σ i j 2 m 2 when φ t is equal to the mean value φ t the corresponding stress parameter in eq 6 is ω moreover φ t is equal to 1 0 and the unbiased stress parameter in eq 6 is ω s then the mean value of the bias of the stress parameter is as follows 7 φ q ω ω s 3 uncertainty analysis of wave loads of semi submersible platforms 3 1 main parameters of the semi submersible platform a semi submersible platform serves mainly in the south china sea and east china sea which is designed to withstand a typhoon once in 200 years and the design life is 30 years the overall length and breadth are 114 m and 78 m respectively the upper deck is 38 m above the baseline the design draught is 19 m and the displacement is 50 000 tons the hull is shown in fig 1 a the fatigue life of many key joints of semi submersible offshore platforms needs to be evaluated in this paper taking the local structure at the junction of the brackets and columns as an example a typical joint a point at the junction of the brackets and columns is selected as shown in fig 1 b and c because the natural frequencies of structures under random wave loads are much larger than those at wave energy concentrations the structural alternating stress response of semi submersible offshore platforms can be regarded as a quasi static process 3 2 sea wave spectrum the uncertainty of the sea wave spectrum could simply be taken as follows for a short term sea state h s t z if a different wave spectrum is taken to describe the sea state the corresponding calculation results vary for actual engineering calculations a theoretical spectrum formula that is different from the real sea state is generally used and a series of uncertainties have been taken in at present some theoretical spectra such as the p m spectrum jonswap spectrum and double peak spectrum are recommended in the engineering field the zero order moment of the wave loading mean square response is r θ i α h s t z i 1 n s ω i θ i h s t z 1 ε i ω i h s t z 8a h 2 ω i α δ ω i where h ω i α denotes the wave loading transfer function and α and ω i denote the wave direction and wave frequency respectively s ω i θ i h s t z denotes the wave spectrum θ i denotes the spectrum style ε i is a random parameter with a mean normal distribution of zero the uncertainties due to variations in the spectrum could be represented by the zero order moment of some loading response spectra and each spectrum has one conditional probability then the mean value and variance of the total bias are 8b r r θ f θ θ d θ 8c v a r r v a r r θ r θ r 2 f θ θ d θ where θ denotes a different spectrum f θ denotes the possibility of a spectrum occurrence and the uncertainty of r is presented as eqs 8b and 8c which is from the uncertainty of the spectrum and the differences among them the msr mean square response loading value with the standard spectrum is as follows 9 r s 0 s ω h 2 ω d ω where s ω could be the p m spectrum the bias relative to the standard spectrum is 10a φ s r r s where φ s has the same distribution type as r and is also normally distributed the mean value and cov of bias are 10b φ s α h s t z r α h s t z r s α h s t z 10c v φ s α h s t z v r α h s t z the p m spectrum and jonswap spectrum are chosen to synthetically simulate the real sea state for analysing the spectrum uncertainty due to wave spectrum representation according to the results guedes soares 1984 the occurrence possibility of the p m spectrum in the north atlantic is p h s 0 86 0 06 h s for h s 14 33 m and p h s 0 for h s 14 33 m the variance in ε i equals 0 525 the p m spectrum is chosen as the standard spectrum the uncertainty results of the three main loadings of the semi submersible platform dnv rp c103 2005 in surviving conditions h s 13 7 m t z 11 89 s are shown in table 1 including the lvbm longitudinal vertical bending moment tvbm transverse vertical bending moment and thsf transverse horizontal splitting force the results show that the bias mean value of the spectrum ranges from 0 90 to 0 99 and the cov ranges from 0 17 to 0 19 it is concluded that the bias approaches 1 0 and the cov is comparatively large which implies that the uncertainty of the spectrum mainly induces discreteness 3 3 wave heights the current sources of long term wave statistics can be divided into the following categories measured data by instruments postpredicted data eye observed data and improved eye observed data fang et al 1996 generally the data measured by instruments are relatively reliable but in practice the data are expensive and scarce and the short term data are difficult to predict the long term statistical characteristics the post predicted or eye observed data have accumulated for a long time in most sea areas so the latter several data also have considerable value the wave height and period in the instrument survey are generally accurate and can be treated as the true value however the errors of the wave height and period in the eye observed survey in the ship survey are large and need to be converted into the true value through an appropriate correction formula based on the eye measurement and theoretical analysis the regression formulas between the true significant wave height h s and eye observed value h v in the north atlantic have been presented as follows guedes soares 1984 11 h s 2 33 0 75 h v ε s 1 59 where ε denotes the normal random distribution variable and the mean value and standard deviation of ε are zero and s respectively the eye observed value is always selected from the long term scatter diagram of the sea states then the bias mean value and cov of the wave height are 12a φ h h s h v 0 75 2 33 h v 12b v h v a r φ h e φ h 1 59 0 75 h v 2 33 the mean square response of wave loading is proportional to the square of the wave height then the bias mean value of the mean square response of wave loading caused by the uncertainty of the wave height is 13c φ h s φ h 2 the mean value and cov of the wave height bias are shown in table 2 since the targeted semi submersible platform in the paper is located in the northwest pacific the regression formula of the wave height should be studied again the sea state data of the significant wave height in the northwest pacific ocean are shown in tables 3 and 4 fang et al 1996 the buoy data are from the japanese buoy station results the buoy measurement lasts approximately one year the ship report data adopt the direct statistical results of the whole wave group although the data in tables 3 and 4 are the average values of the wave heights of the whole sea state data they can also reflect the differences and trends between the instrumental measured and eye observed data based on the sea states of significant wave height in the northwest pacific the new relationship between h s and h v could be regressed as follows 14 h s 0 45 0 76 h v ε where ε is the normal random variable which has a zero mean value and standard deviation s the statistical relationship of the standard deviation between h s and h v is shown in table 5 the variance relationship between h s and h v is as follows based on the data in table 5 15 σ h s 2 0 76 2 σ h v 2 σ ε 2 the value of s 0 560 for the sea state of the northwest pacific then v h 0 560 0 76 h v 0 45 furthermore the bias mean value and cov of the wave height in the northwest pacific could be assessed and the corresponding results are shown in table 6 after comparing table 2 with table 6 it is revealed that the cov of the wave height formula in the paper is less than that of guedes soares s formula this may be because the formula in the paper is regressed for the northwest pacific but the guedes soares has regressed for the north atlantic the latter s sea state is more terrible meanwhile the statistical discreteness and standard deviation are larger thus the new regressed equation of eq 15 is meaningful for the floating structures in the northwest pacific 3 4 mean zero crossing period and effect on the stress amplitude there is a certain difference in the mean zero crossing period between the eye observed and measured values the relationship between the measured data and ship observed results has been investigated for the northwest pacific using zero crossing period data fang et al 1996 the regressing formula between the measured and observed data is 16 t m a t v b ε where a and b denote constant coefficients and are related to the sea states ε is the normal random variable of which the mean value and standard deviation are zero and σ ε respectively then the bias mean value and cov of the period are 17a φ p t m t v a b t v 17b v p σ φ p e φ p σ ε a t v b the statistically measured results and eye observed data of the mean crossing period in the northwest pacific are shown in tables 7 and 8 the new linear regression relationship of the period is 18 t m 3 59 0 62 t v ε where ε is the normal random variable which has a zero mean value and standard deviation s the statistical relationship of the standard deviation between t m and t v is shown in table 9 the variance relationship between t m and t v is as follows based on the data in table 9 the variance relationship between t m and t v is 19 σ t m 2 0 62 2 σ t v 2 σ ε 2 where σ t m and σ t v denote the standard deviation of t m and t v respectively s 0 533 then v p 0 533 0 62 t v 3 59 the zero order moment of the stress amplitude response is derived by considering the uncertainty effect of the wave period 20 r α h s t z i 1 n s ω i h s t z φ p h 2 ω i α δ ω i the unbiased r p0 is obtained from eq 20 during φ p 1 0 when φ p φ p the mean value of r is r p only considering the uncertainty of the zero crossing period then the bias mean value φ z of r caused by the uncertainty of period is 21 φ z α h s t z r p r p 0 when φ p φ p φ p v p r becomes r p when φ p φ p φ p v p r becomes r p the variance of φ z is 22a σ φ z α h s t z r p r p 2 r p 0 it can be proven that eq 21 and eq 22a have one order precision then the cov v z of φ z is 22b v z α h s t z r p r p 2 r p it is assumed in eq 22a and eq 22b that the mean value and cov of φ z are not related to the significant wave height the calculated results of a semi submersible platform are shown in table 10 3 5 wave loading transfer function to rationally investigate the uncertainty of the wave loading transfer function wave loading model tests should be carried out the semi submersible model test with a scale ratio of 1 40 is carried out in the sea keeping basin of the china ship scientific research center cssrc as shown in figs 2 and 3 l b and h denote the length breadth and depth of the semi submersible platform respectively and g is the gravity acceleration the transverse vertical moment and horizontal splitting force loading transfer function of the middle longitudinal section are measured meanwhile the experimental values are taken as true standard values and the uncertainties induced by various factors in the model test are 5 the numerical predictions and experimental results of the transverse vertical moment and horizontal splitting force loading transfer function in the beam sea are shown in fig 4 a and b if the experimental data and numerical results are taken as the true value and theoretical value respectively the numerical results of the bias mean value and cov of the loading transfer function are shown in table 13 since there are some systematic and incidental errors in the model test and the transverse vertical moment is remarkably larger than the horizontal splitting force the measured signal of the horizontal splitting force is less and the measuring errors may be larger than the transverse vertical moment which is demonstrated by the results in table 13 the relationship between the test value h m ω and the numerical predicted value h t ω is expressed by the following formula 23 h m ω φ l ω h t ω where φ l ω denotes a random variable in this paper it is assumed that the statistical parameter of the bias coefficient φ l ω of the load transfer function is independent of the circular frequency ω the uncertainty analysis results of the load transfer function of the horizontal splitting force and transverse vertical bending moment are shown in tables 11 and 12 after considering the 5 uncertainties in the model test the cov of the transverse vertical moment transfer function is 0 10 2 0 05 2 0 11 and the cov of the horizontal splitting force transfer function is 0 18 2 0 05 2 0 19 taking the bias mean value and cov in table 13 as references it is rational to suppose that the mean value of the wave loading transfer function bias b f is 0 76 1 14 and the cov is 0 11 0 19 then the bias mean value and cov are taken as 0 90 and 0 15 in the later calculations respectively meanwhile the conclusion is extended to each direction the mean square response is proportional to the square of the loading transfer function 3 6 the possibility of the sea state occurrence and the effect on the stress parameter generally the sea state sets are from the statistical regression analysis of the data for many years since the sea state sets have seasonal and annual variations the sea state sets obtained by various times have comparatively large differences using the sea state set in the north atlantic with various statistical periods such as 1 2 4 and 29 years the influence on long term extreme forecasting and fatigue life assessment has been investigated moan et al 2005 if 1 year is taken as a statistical period there are 29 fatigue damage values the ratio of the maximum and minimum fatigue damage is 4 3 for fpso and 1 9 for a semi submersible platform which shows that the sea state occurrence possibilities during different statistical periods have a comparatively large influence on the fatigue life assessment results in addition it is concluded that the significant wave height obviously varies by year nolte 1973 and the annual variation in the sea state has been analysed guedes soares and ferreira 1995 to investigate the uncertainty of the possibility of sea state occurrence in the sea state scatter diagram the fatigue life of the semi submersible platform is assessed by the sea state set of the s4 sea zone in the south china sea fang et al 1996 as shown in fig 5 the sea state data of the s4 sea zone are divided into spring summer autumn winter and whole year and the wave direction is divided into eight wave directions and all wave directions so there are 45 5 9 sea state scatter diagrams in the s4 sea zone the detailed sea state data are listed in the reference fang et al 1996 the 45 sea state scatter diagrams contain the influence of the season and wave directions and it is difficult to calculate the two factors directly thus the 45 sea states are divided into two parts to consider the possibility of the sea state occurrence and the effect on the stress parameters including the season effect and wave direction effect the influence of the possibility of sea state occurrence by wave direction will be discussed in the next section assuming that the occurring probability of each wave direction is equal the s n curve method is adopted to calculate the fatigue life by using the four seasons and the whole year sea state scatter diagrams five scatter diagrams in total in the s4 sea zone the results are shown in table 14 the mean four seasons weighted sum refers to the fatigue life calculated after the average weighted sum of the stress parameters of four seasons in spring summer autumn and winter it can be seen that there is a great fluctuation in the structural fatigue life calculated according to the sea state scatter diagram in different seasons the dimensionless calculation is based on the weighted sum of four seasons the ratio of the maximum and minimum fatigue life is 4 3 which occurs in summer and autumn respectively and it can be seen that the sea condition is worse in autumn and winter than in spring and summer it can also be seen that the weighted sum of the four seasons is not consistent with the calculation result of the whole year sea state scatter diagram and the weighted sum of the four seasons is 1 05 times that of the whole year the reason for this difference lies in the difference between the weighted sum of the sea state scatter diagram of the four seasons and the whole year sea state scatter diagram in addition the difference between the methods of calculating the fatigue life by calculating the stress parameters in different seasons and then accumulating the stress parameter results the fatigue life by adding the scatter diagram in different seasons and the fatigue life for example in the sea state scatter diagram including all the wave directions considering the short term sea state probability of a significant wave height of 0 0 5 m and a mean zero crossing period of 6 s the weighted sum of the fatigue life of the four seasons is 23 75 years the fatigue life is 29 years for the whole year sea state scatter diagram and the difference is obvious according to miner s fatigue cumulative damage principle the fatigue damage caused by actual sea conditions should be calculated by calculating the fatigue cumulative damage caused by four seasons and then the total fatigue damage is accumulated if the whole year sea state scatter diagram is directly used there will be some deviation from the above calculation results which is shown in table 14 assuming the possibility of occurrence of each wave direction is equal and considering the influence of uncertainty of the occurrence possibility on the stress parameter the true stress parameter is expressed as follows 24 φ ω s 1 4 q 2 2 m γ m 2 1 n 1 4 i 1 k j 1 q λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i n σ i j m where ω s denotes the unbiased nominal value of the stress parameter k and q denote the short term sea state number and direction number respectively φ denotes the bias coefficient and is a random variable which is used to express the uncertainty of the possibility of occurrence and n denotes the four seasons thes bias φ of the possibility of occurrence of the sea states for the fatigue stress parameter ω s is 0 955 as shown in table 15 3 7 wave direction and effect on the stress parameter since different wave directions have different sea states the possibility of sea state occurrence is related to the occurrence possibility of the wave direction the wave directions are defined in table 16 the heading direction of the floating platform has a certain random distribution and the wave direction generally does not obey a uniform distribution which makes it difficult to establish the heading wave angle thus the random heading wave angle is introduced to solve the problem the traditional method assumes that the heading wave angle obeys uniformity in the wave loading assessment for actual engineering design this paper adopts sea state statistical data for the whole year to investigate the uncertainty of the wave direction and assess the effect of the wave direction uncertainty on the fatigue life assessment this shows that the sea state scatter is very complex from the data of the s4 sea zone 1 the uncertainty of possibility of wave direction occurrence to study the influence of the heading angle of the semi submersible platform on the fatigue life evaluation the heading angle of the semi submersible platform is assumed to be uniform during the service life so that the distribution law of the wave direction of the platform can be obtained through the distribution law of the wave direction in the sea state data at the same time the sea state data of the whole year include the sea state scatter diagram of all the wave directions the heading direction is divided into four cases east south west and north the 0 wave direction of the sea state data in the s4 area in the literature is defined as north the fatigue life results are shown in table 17 the calculation results of the uniform direction in the table refer to the fatigue life when the distribution of the wave direction is uniform which means that the mean of the stress parameters of each direction is used to calculate the fatigue life it can be seen that the fatigue life results obtained from different heading directions are quite different among which the south is the safest so it is better for the bow of the platform to face the south when working in this sea area since the wave direction varies greatly with seasons and years the statistical wave direction data in the sea state data must have greater uncertainty in addition to the randomness of the heading angle of the ship or offshore platform the angle distribution that affects the fatigue life of the structure needs to be studied which needs the support of the statistical data to carry out the relevant analysis the stress parameter ω under uniform heading distribution is taken as nominal stress parameter ω s and the stress parameter under actual heading is ω d the bias is defined as η 1 and the result is 0 824 25c η 1 ω d ω s 2 the uncertainty of the sea state scatter diagram under various wave directions the sea state scatter diagram of the s4 sea zone is different under different wave directions fang et al 1996 the structural fatigue life calculated by sea state data of the different wave directions is shown in table 18 the sea state data in the northeast and north are the worst while the sea state data in the southeast south southwest west and northwest are relatively mild in the sea state sets of the s4 sea zone there are some differences among the sets of single wave directions and the sets including all the wave directions traditionally the sea state sets including all the directions are used to assess the fatigue life but the more exact structural fatigue damage should accumulate the fatigue damage of each sea state set under different wave directions therefore it induces bias of the fatigue life including stress parameters now the bias η 2 of the stress parameter caused by the uncertainty of the sea state sets under various wave directions is 25a η 2 ω s 2 2 m γ m 2 1 1 q n 1 q j 1 q i 1 k λ m ε i j λ i j f 0 i j γ i n p n σ i j m n 1 q p n where ω s denotes the nominal value of the stress parameter calculated by the sea state sets including all directions under a uniform heading distribution k and q are the number of short tern sea states and wave directions respectively and p n denotes the possibility of wave direction occurrence assuming that the heading wave angle obeys a uniform distribution and that the occurrence possibility of the sea state scatter diagram of each wave direction is uniform the bias is 0 963 finally the total bias of the stress parameter due to the uncertainty of the wave direction is 25b η η 1 η 2 the result of η is 0 794 less than 1 0 which reveals that the method directly using the sea state scatter diagram of the full directions and the assumption of a uniform wave direction to assess the fatigue life is too conservative 4 fatigue reliability analysis 4 1 results in the short term sea states based on the previous results of the paper an uncertainty analysis is carried out for the northwest pacific the calculated uncertainty results of the total zero order moment under the short term sea state h s 4 5 m and t z 8 0 s for the semi submersible platform are shown in table 19 the sea state has the highest contribution to fatigue damage 4 2 results in the long term sea states the result of φ q for the semi submersible platform is 0 438 from eq 5 it is obtained that 26 b w m φ η φ q the mean value of b w m is expressed as follows the mean value for the semi submersible platform is 0 332 27 b w m φ η

direction the cov c b w m for the semi submersible platform is 0 722 assuming that b w m obeys a lognormal distribution the middle value of b w m is 0 269 which is calculated by 31a b w m μ b w m 1 c b w m 2 0 5 because both b w and b w m obey lognormal distributions the middle value and cov of b w are 0 646 and 0 39 respectively as calculated by 31b b w b w m 1 m 31c c b w 2 1 c b w m 2 1 m 1 4 3 fatigue reliability index the uncertainties in the fatigue stress calculation can be described by a random b which is expressed as 32 b i b i i m w n h where m denotes the structure fabrication technology w denotes the sea wave description n denotes the nominal stress calculation and h is the hotspot stress coefficient b i and b all obey lognormal distributions meanwhile the values of b i are shown in table 20 and b w adopts the previous result in the paper the limit state equation of the fatigue life with the method of the s n curve is 33 z ln t f ln t d ln δ a b m ω ln t d where δ a and b obey lognormal distributions ω and t d denote the stress parameter and design life which are 616 and 30 years for the semi submersible respectively the variable δ obeys a lognormal distribution

equation and the result is 2 2 which is the fatigue reliability index of the typical joint the junction of the bracket and column of the semi submersible platform according to the literature ssc 392 1996 the target value of the hot spot fatigue reliability index of a general hull structure is between 2 0 and 3 0 if the semi submersible platform is also checked according to this standard the local structure at this point can meet the requirements of the fatigue strength however due to the lack of a statistical reliability design index for semi submersible platforms the data have certain guiding significance for the design of offshore platforms 34 β μ z σ z ln δ ln a m ln b ln ω ln t d ln 1 c δ 2 ln 1 c a 2 m 2 ln 1 c b 2 1 2 5 conclusions a proper method is proposed to assess the uncertainties of fatigue wave loading mainly including the uncertainties of the wave spectrum wave loading transfer function wave height mean zero crossing period occurrence possibility of the sea state and wave direction as well as the influence on the wave loading and fatigue life moreover the fatigue reliability index is investigated according to the uncertainties of the loading and strength some important conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the mean value of the wave loading transfer function bias is 0 76 1 14 and the cov is 0 11 0 19 the uncertainty results of the wave height are assessed for the northwest pacific which are very different from those of the north atlantic the new regressed formula is meaningful for the floating structures in the northwest pacific 2 there are some comparatively large differences among the sea state scatter diagrams of various seasons that induce certain uncertainties in the fatigue life for the south china sea the sea states in spring and summer have smaller contributions to fatigue damage than those in autumn and winter 3 the distribution principle of the wave direction has a distinguishing influence on the fatigue life meanwhile the traditional assumption of the uniform wave direction and the full direction sea state sets make the predicted results too conservative thus the actual distribution principle and uncertainties of the wave direction are worthy of study and concern 4 the mean value and cov of the wave loading uncertainties are 0 646 and 0 39 respectively while assessing the fatigue reliability the fatigue reliability index of a typical joint the junction of the bracket and column of the semi submersible platform is 2 2 which has certain guiding significance for the design of offshore platforms credit
