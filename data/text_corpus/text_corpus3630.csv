18150,global lakes have been identified as an important component of natural methane ch4 sources given that lake ch4 emissions involve multiple complex processes influenced by various environmental factors estimates of global lake ch4 emissions are largely uncertain in this study we compiled global ch4 emission data on 744 lakes from published studies and found a significantly negative correlation r2 0 50 p 0 01 between diffusive ch4 flux and lake maximum depth further analysis indicated that no significant differences in global sediment ch4 production were found for the different maximum depths investigated owing to the longer oxidation pathway presence of oxycline layer and the lower nutrient environment deeper lakes yield less diffusive ch4 efflux compared to shallower lakes additionally we also found that lake area was negatively correlated r2 0 13 p 0 01 to diffusive ch4 flux therefore based on empirical correlations between lake morphometry maximum depth and area and diffusive ch4 emission as well as the combination of two lake databases we estimated that the annual diffusive ch4 emission from global lakes is approximately 11 2 6 2 19 5 tg ch4 yr and greater than 84 is emitted from lakes with a mean depth of less than 5 m furthermore two regions 40 70 n 30 4 and 20 s 10 n 37 4 were found to be the dominant contributors of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions resulting from the considerable total lake area and the extensive shallow lakes in these regions this study highlights the significance of the depth effect which controls the spatial distribution of lake diffusive ch4 flux and allows for the quantification of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords global methane estimation lake ch4 diffusion maximum depth surface area freshwaters ghgs emissions 1 introduction recent studies have raised considerable concern on the rapid increase in global atmospheric methane ch4 levels since 1750 myhre et al 2013 saunois et al 2016 while also motivating fields of research targeted at investigating the magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics of dominant sinks and sources kirschke et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 of late years global lake ecosystems including ponds have been identified as important natural ch4 sources bastviken et al 2011 kirschke et al 2013 contributing 20 6 32 8 to global natural ch4 emission despite the fact that such water bodies only cover from approximately 1 8 3 6 of the total land area verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 abundant organic carbon c storage and anoxic conditions in lake sediment stimulate high ch4 production by methanogenic bacteria bastviken et al 2008 tranvik et al 2009 delsontro et al 2016 resulting in ch4 supersaturation in the many lakes kankaala et al 2013 beaulieu et al 2016 to date there have been many field investigations into the magnitude and regulation of lake ch4 emission as well as its spatio temporal dynamics juutinen et al 2009 bastviken et al 2010 sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 rasilo et al 2015 northington and saros 2016 with the increasing number of field measurements and improvements in geographic mapping technology some studies set out to estimate the global lake ch4 emissions via compiling the lake ch4 observations around the world bastviken et al 2004 2011 walter et al 2007 juutinen et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 delsontro et al 2018 a first systematic study of global lake ch4 emission estimation was presented by bastviken et al 2011 they reported that global lakes emit approximately 71 6 tg ch4 into atmosphere every year via four pathways diffusive flux ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux recently holgerson raymond 2016 found a significantly negative correlation between the ch4 concentration and the lake surface area thus based on the mean diffusive flux and the corresponding lake area of each area class e g 0 001 km2 0 001 0 01 km2 etc they estimated that global lakes including ponds release about 16 tg ch4 yr through diffusion pathway besides lake area delsontro et al 2018 demonstrated that lake ch4 emissions also are related with trophic status chlorophyll a and total phosphorus at global scale subsequently they combined the lake area databases and a global chlorophyll a distribution map sayers et al 2015 to estimate a global lake ch4 emissions of 78 139 tg ch4 yr overall these works revealed the important role of lake ecosystems in global ch4 budget and gave us some enlightenment about quantifying the magnitude and dynamics of lake ch4 emission however significant uncertainties remain in lake ch4 emission estimation on one hand among the four types of ch4 flux components mentioned above the ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux in general only occur in some special circumstances for instance previous studies have suggested that lake ebullitive ch4 emission is highly episodic and mostly happened in the sites with high sediment carbon storage saunois et al 2016 west et al 2016 the storage flux and plant mediated flux usually can be observed during lake overturn and in the mostly vegetated regions respectively bastviken et al 2004 therefore current field measurements of ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux usually are scarce and highly spatiotemporally variable saunois et al 2016 on the other hand most of lake ch4 measurements used in previous estimations were sampled from boreal regions bastviken et al 2011 holgerson and raymond 2016 however more and more evidences revealed that temperate and tropical lakes have higher ch4 emission rates than lakes located in northern latitude regions narvenkar et al 2013 rinta et al 2017 lacking of substantial data to calculate a representative mean ch4 emission rate for each classification category i e flux types or regional divisions could bring large uncertainties during estimating global lake ch4 emission another source of uncertainty in current estimations is lacking in the fitting drivers used to upscaling emission estimates in detail these fitting drivers should have a significant impact on ch4 emission at global scale and be easy to access from the current global maps or other databases although the significant impact of lake area and chlorophyll a on ch4 emission had been proved in previous studies and thus had been used to estimate global lake ch4 emission west et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 it should be noted that the combination of lake area and chlorophyll a explained only a minority of variations in lake ch4 emissions e g r2 0 29 in the model of predicting ch4 diffusion delsontro et al 2018 interestingly a large amount of studies found the significantly reverse dependency of lake depth and diffusive ch4 flux in the different regions natchimuthu et al 2016 west et al 2016 wik et al 2016 in addition messager et al 2016 developed a new global database termed hydralakes to simulate surface area and depth of global lakes by employing a geo statistical model therefore we might simulate the global spatial distribution of diffusive ch4 emission based on that spatially resolved lake depth database hydrolakes if we can demonstrate the significant correlation between lake depth and diffusive ch4 flux at global scale in this study we focused on diffusive ch4 flux from global lakes to explore the relationship between diffusive ch4 emission and lake size i e maximum depth and area on global scale and we used this relationship to provide a spatial map of diffusive ch4 emission from global lakes we compiled global database including in situ ch4 measurements ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux and basin morphometry data maximum depth and surface area of 744 lakes from published literature updated to 2018 the main objectives of this study were to explore variation in diffusive ch4 emissions from global lakes to analyze and quantify the potential relevance of diffusive ch4 emissions and lake size to simulate spatial dynamics of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions and to obtain a more accurate global lake ch4 budget 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compiled lake diffusive ch4 flux and concentration data from published literature by searching keywords that include methane ch4 ghg and greenhouse gases along with lake and pond from the web of science google scholar and cnki china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net database until march 2018 given that there is only limited ch4 data from temperate and tropical lakes in previous global estimations we contented to compile lake ch4 measurements from temperate and tropical regions n 265 from 102 articles where n is the number of lakes compiled as much as possible in total our database comprised of 744 lakes wherein diffusive ch4 flux n 554 and concentration n 407 data were recorded from a total of 171 published studies in order to reduce potential methodological bias or other restrictive reasons we directly adopted the ch4 flux data including diffusive flux ebullitive flux and sediment ch4 flux reported in the original studies rather than calculating these fluxes by ourselves besides this study used three criteria for ch4 data collection 1 we directly adopted diffusive ch4 flux data that was measured using floating chamber method or have already been calculated from dissolved ch4 concentrations i e the boundary layer method by the authors we did not include ch4 flux measured by eddy covariance flux towers in this study because it was not possible to distinguish between diffusion and ebullition flux paranaíba et al 2018 2 all ch4 flux observations from littoral zones were excluded which could potentially represent a mixture of diffusive flux and plant mediated flux ch4 flux emitted through aquatic vegetation juutinen et al 2003 although littoral zones have a large contribution to total ch4 emission from the whole lake ecosystem it is very difficult to distinguish between diffusion and plant mediated flux in each study because of the limited information about the presence absence of plants during data compilation 3 we only included diffusive ch4 flux and concentration data measured on in the surface water layer which represents ch4 diffusion from lakes into the atmosphere and dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water layer respectively furthermore we also recorded maximum depth surface area and geographic location longitude latitude information of each lake from corresponding literature or from relevant documents which contained such information although we have made great effort to collect maximum depth and area data we ultimately obtained limited records about maximum depth n 355 and surface area n 534 from the 774 lakes we compiled therefore some lakes compiled in our database may still lack maximum depth or lake area data or both in other words the actual numbers of lakes used in our statistical analysis could be less than 744 to avoid inaccurate or misleading results we recorded the number of lakes used in each statistical analysis e g lake number n in eq 2 see fig 1 additionally it is important to mention that mean depth could be a more effective index of morphometric basin characteristics than maximum depth however in our database we found 1 that there was only limited information on mean depth in the literature and its relevance to ch4 flux was relatively limited compared to maximum depth fig s4 in appendix a 2 that most of ch4 measurements were sampled from or in the vicinity of the pelagic zone and 3 that the correlation between maximum depth and mean depth was highly significant r2 0 97 n 152 fig s5 in appendix a taken this into account we used maximum depth as a proxy of mean depth in this study 2 2 estimating the annual diffusive ch4 flux and average ch4 concentration of each lake before conducing statistical analysis we needed to estimate the annual diffusive ch4 flux and concentration of each lake in our database ch4 measurements from most lakes n 560 were sampled multiple times over a one year period for these lakes we directly adopted annual diffusive ch4 flux and concentrations reported in the original studies moreover approximately 23 of lakes only reported ch4 measurements during the summer or winter seasons or during ice free periods for these lakes we calculated the average seasonal ch4 measurement as the annual diffusive ch4 values for lakes that had multiple sampled locations we first excluded the ch4 measurements from littoral habitats vegetated zones and then calculated the mean flux and concentration sampled from the remaining locations moreover for the same lake were recorded in multiple studies we calculated the mean diffusive ch4 flux and concentration separately finally we converted units of all ch4 flux and concentration data into mg ch4 m2 h and mg ch4 l respectively to simplify database management 2 3 statistical analysis we adopted regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between diffusive ch4 flux and concentration with lake morphometric characteristics maximum depth and lake area respectively due to the high spatiotemporal variability in the original data we log transferred data ch4 flux and concentration prior to regression analysis besides to explore how the relationships e g lake diffusive flux vs maximum depth varied in different biomes we classified the lakes into different biomes and conducted regression analysis of each biome zones separately in this study we determined the biomes zone of each lakes based on köppen geiger climate classification map kottek et al 2006 considering the limited the number of lakes in our database we simplified the categories of köppen geiger map and classified the 744 lakes into 5 biome classes tropical temperate boreal tundra and other biome types i e desert ice mangroves etc all statistical analyses were performed using r software version 3 5 0 2 4 upscaling to global diffusive ch4 emissions we estimated diffusive ch4 flux for global lakes based on eq 1 which integrates the maximum depth and surface area of lake to predict potential ch4 diffusion rates first of all we need a global high resolution lake database to provide the morphometric parameters surface area and maximum depth and the geographic location of global lakes a satellite imagery based lakes database glowabo global water bodies database consists of 117 million lakes with an area greater than 0 002 km2 and its combined total lake area is approximately 5 4 106 km2 which has a higher resolution and covers a greater total area than previous global lake databases lehner and döll 2004 verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 additionally the glowabo database has previously been used to estimate regional or global ch4 emissions from lakes holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 in this study we also adopted the glowabo database to estimate global diffusive ch4 emissions however it is important to note that maximum depth had not been reported in most current global lake databases including glowabo database fortunately hydrolakes another global lake database has successfully simulated lake mean depth by employing a multiple variable geo statistical model although both its total area 2 7 106 km2 and lake number 1 42 million are smaller than the glowabo database verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 one of important works is how to obtain the maximum depth of each lake in the glowabo database firstly we found a strong correlation between maximum depth and mean depth for global lakes r2 0 97 fig s5 in appendix a based on this correlation we calculated the maximum depth of each lake in hydrolakes database secondly we used the inverse distance weighting idw method to interpolate a global grid map of lake maximum depth grid cell area 0 002 km2 thirdly for 117 million lakes in glowabo database we extracted maximum depth value of each lake based on their geographic location from the interpolated global map mentioned above and then we simulated the diffusive ch4 flux mg ch4 m2 h of individual lakes n 117 million with the corresponding maximum depth and area data according to eq 1 finally we calculated annual diffusive ch4 emissions tg ch4 yr by multiplying diffusive flux by the surface area of each lake all spatial analyses e g idw analysis were performed using arcgis software esri version 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of morphometric characteristics on methane lake dynamics ch4 lake emissions and concentrations were typically highest in shallow lakes or ponds and decreased with an increase in maximum depth fig 1 a c where maximum depth explained 50 p 0 001 n 245 and 49 p 0 001 n 160 of variation in lake ch4 flux and concentration respectively additionally lake area was negatively correlated to ch4 lake flux r 2 0 13 p 0 001 n 364 and concentration r 2 0 19 p 0 001 n 273 respectively fig 1 b d the maximum depth and area combined explained 61 of variation in ch4 lake emissions 1 log 10 f c h 4 0 42 0 085 0 097 0 028 l o g 10 a r e a 1 08 0 072 l o g 10 d m a x where numbers in parentheses represent standard deviations of regression coefficients in contrast to maximum depth the impact of area size on ch4 lake emissions was relatively minor which differed somewhat from previous assessments holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 in fact this finding can be explained by our updated database for instance high ch4 flux has been measured in some shallow lakes with relatively large areas such as lake dong 10 77 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 32 km2 chilika lake 2 92 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 1032 5 km2 and lake poyang 0 36 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 3210 km2 ray 2013 xiao et al 2013 liu et al 2017 compared to mean values from lakes around the world 0 10 mg ch4 m2 h additionally we further classified measurements into four biome types tundra boreal temperate and tropical and explored the impact of maximum depth and area on ch4 lake emissions within specific biomes results suggested that lake ch4 flux exhibited a significantly decreasing trend with an increase in maximum depth for the different biome types fig 2 left which further demonstrates that shallow lakes are hot spots of diffusive ch4 emissions in different biomes on the contrary only ch4 flux from tundra and boreal lakes were significantly correlated to lake area and no correlation was found between lake area and ch4 flux of temperate and tropical lakes fig 2 right similar findings were also reported in rinta et al 2017 the weaker correlation between ch4 flux and lake area in temperate and tropical lakes could be the result of their larger range of lake surface area cover compared to tundra and boreal lakes more specifically most tundra and boreal lakes are glacial origin wik et al 2016 and could therefore characterized by less variable morphometry compared to lakes of tectonic and volcanic origin in temperate and tropical regions it is important to note that ch4 flux in our study only represents diffusive flux even though ebullitive flux was regarded as the dominant pathway in previous studies bastviken et al 2004 2011 previous studies found that ebullitive flux could also be correlated to the mean depth or surface area of lakes juutinen et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 in this study we specifically collected ebullitive ch4 flux data from 153 global lakes to analyze the correlation between ebullitive flux with maximum depth and area fig 3 and fig s6 in appendix a but the correlation was not significant which means that ebullitive flux is not significantly different in lakes of variable depth or area additionally when we incorporated ebullitive flux into our estimate we found that the correlation between the sum of ch4 flux diffusive ebullitive and morphometric characteristics maximum depth and area was relatively low compared to diffusive flux only fig s7 in appendix a in fact ebullitive ch4 flux could be directly released into the atmosphere and only limited ch4 transported by this means would oxidize along the water column walter et al 2007 therefore ch4 ebullition flux could potentially be determined by net ch4 production in sediment delsontro et al 2016 additionally ch4 transported through ebullitive flux is most often observed in carbon rich and shallow lakes bastviken et al 2004 juutinen et al 2009 where dissolved ch4 is generally supersaturated being rarely found in deeper lakes in addition to the high randomness of ebullitive flux more data and better knowledge of ebullitive ch4 dynamics is required before we can begin to assess global ebullitive ch4 emissions 3 2 global estimation of diffusive methane emissions from lakes by combining our updated global lake database and eq 1 see the methods and materials section we were able to simulate the global diffusive ch4 flux mg ch4 m2 h and the annual diffusive ch4 emission tg ch4 yr for global lakes fig 4 we obtained an average of 0 10 mg ch4 m2 h 0 077 0 14 mg ch4 m2 h where the range was calculated with eq 1 which is slightly less than the global estimation obtained by bastviken et al 2011 using 365 lakes 0 30 mg ch4 m2 but it is close to a previous estimation of boreal lakes 0 075 mg ch4 m2 h juutinen et al 2009 high diffusive ch4 flux is found in the lakes from two regions high northern latitudes and large tropical river watersheds one of the links between these two regions is their numerous shallow and small lakes which could result in high diffusive ch4 emissions a great number of shallow and small lakes or ponds pervade boreal and northern tundra regions which have recently been identified as critical hotspots of global ch4 emissions wik et al 2016 elder et al 2018 moreover previous studies suggested that shallow lakes or more precisely forest flood zones along floodplains and large rivers such as the amazon basin also contribute significantly to ch4 emissions devol et al 1990 smith et al 2000 in this study we estimated the annual diffusive ch4 emission the total number of lakes 117 million at 11 2 tg ch4 yr 6 2 19 5 tg ch4 yr where the range was calculated using eq 1 from global lakes fig 4b and table 1 this estimation is slightly higher than that calculated by 9 7 tg ch4 yr bastviken et al 2011 but lower than a recent estimation 16 tg ch4 yr by holgerson and raymond 2016 one of the primary differences between our estimation and previous estimations is total lake area that we adopted table 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 added a large number of small ponds 0 001 km2 to global lake ch4 simulation accounting for the important role that small ponds play in global lake ch4 emissions that study estimated that global lake diffusive ch4 emission is approximately 16 tg ch4 yr in which small ponds 0 001 km2 contributed 6 5 tg ch4 yr if emissions of the small ponds 0 001 km2 were subtracted from their estimate global diffusive ch4 emission estimated by holgerson raymond 2016 would be approximately 9 5 tg ch4 yr which is closer to our estimation 11 2 tg ch4 yr our more conservative results were the result of difficulty in identifying small ponds 0 001 km2 using current remote sensing technology holgerson and raymond 2016 additionally we made some efforts to conduct a more comprehensive and improved assessment on the one hand most previous estimations just calculated the mean or median ch4 flux of each area class and then upscaled results to regional or global lake scales bastviken et al 2004 juutinen et al 2009 wik et al 2016 in contrast we initially adopted an empirically integrated effect based hypothesis i e that lake morphometry is correlated to ch4 emissions in our assessment specifically for maximum depth results from our study indicated that greater than 84 of diffusive ch4 flux is emitted from lakes with a mean water depth less than 5 m therefore shallow lakes play an important role in global lake diffusive ch4 emissions additionally we analyzed spatial patterns of diffusive ch4 emissions and found high variability in different regions for example we found that lakes between coordinates 40 70 n 30 4 and 20 s 10 n 37 4 were the dominant contributors of diffusive ch4 emissions globally further analysis revealed that high diffusive ch4 emissions from these two regions could be related to the large total area and extensive shallow lakes distributed moreover our estimate also revealed that lakes in high northern latitude zones i e boreal and tundra biomes only comprise of approximately 21 of the global lake diffusive ch4 emission even though such regions are regarded as the crucial zones in the global lake ch4 budget juutinen et al 2009 wik et al 2016 considering that both the number and the total area of lakes in high northern latitude zones are greater than other regions downing et al 2006 juutinen et al 2009 verpoorter et al 2014 wik et al 2016 being a more important component of the global lake ch4 budget i e 34 of global lake ch4 diffusion more attention should be paid to researches related to current ch4 measurements and mechanisms from shallow lakes in tropical regions 3 3 why shallow lakes emit more diffusive ch4 than deep lakes our results indicated that lake morphometry maximum depth and area had an effective impact on diffusive ch4 emissions from global lakes as the two important physical factors maximum depth and area could affect water column mixing the anoxic state of volume fraction piston velocity and sediment carbon accumulation fee et al 1996 bastviken et al 2004 ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 as well as further influence ch4 production and oxidation diffusive ch4 flux reflects a balance between ch4 production from sediment and oxidation in the water column previous regional investigations reported two potential causes for high ch4 diffusive flux from shallow lakes abundant organic c storage in sediment or a short residence time namely either high ch4 production or low ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2008 holgerson and raymond 2016 in our study we attempted to identify the most pivotal depth dependence driver of global diffusive ch4 emissions from the two possible causes mentioned above previous studies suggested that most of ch4 is produced in lake sediment where the anaerobic environment can promote the conversion of carbon dioxide co2 hydrogen h2 or acetate c2h3o2 into ch4 by means of methanogenic bacteria jarrell 1985 michmerhuizen et al 1996 sediment conditions including temperature the absence of oxygen and organic carbon content determine ch4 production ultimately affecting lake ch4 emissions kotelnikova 2002 hanson and hanson 1996 in fact we also compiled sediment ch4 flux data from 79 global lakes but we found no significant correlation between sediment ch4 flux and lake maximum depth fig 5 b accordingly it was concluded that there was no obvious difference in sediment ch4 production among the global lakes investigated in other words the high diffusive ch4 flux in shallow lakes could be most likely correlated to its lesser ch4 oxidation than deep lakes ch4 production in sediment is transported upward to the lake surface along the water column wherein most ch4 will be oxidized by aerobic or anaerobic methanotrophic bacteria thauer et al 2008 being influenced by gradients in water temperature some dissolved substances e g dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a commonly found in many lakes are vertically stratified boehrer and schultze 2008 shade et al 2012 similarly ch4 profiles also exhibit vertical stratification in some lakes wherein dissolved ch4 significantly decreases from the bottom of the water column to the lake surface fig s2 in appendix a in general lake ch4 oxidation could be related to the length of ch4 transportation pathway absence presence of oxycline layer and the trophic status in the water first for shallow lakes the shallow water column causes a shorter transportation pathway including vertical diffusion and lateral transport resulting in a significant proportion of ch4 production to rapidly be emitted into the atmosphere in contrast deep lakes usually are physically stratified into three layers hypolimnion oxycline and epilimnion many studies indicated that the highest ch4 oxidation rate generally occurs at the oxycline layer where the high ch4 concentration and low oxygen concentration meets joye et al 1999 oswald et al 2015 2017 due to the presence of oxycline large proportion of ch4 production in deep lakes could be oxidized at the oxycline before reaching the surface water layer besides the ch4 oxidation rate will gradually decrease in the epilimnion layer resulting from the depletion of ch4 availability moreover compared to deep lakes the shallow lakes are vulnerable for eutrophication as a result of high nutrient loadings and poor physical self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 janse 2005 in this study we found that lake diffusive ch4 flux significantly increased with the increasing nutrients concentration such as the doc dissolved organic carbon chl a chlorophyll a tn total nitrogen and tp total phosphorus fig s8 in appendix a the nutrient rich environment in shallow lakes not only provide more liable organic substrate to enhance the ch4 production by methanogenesis but also cause a depletion of dissolved oxygen do in the water body west et al 2012 beaulieu et al 2019 resulting in low ch4 oxidation in shallow lakes thus the high diffusive ch4 emission in shallow lakes could be also related to its nutrient rich environment in summary compared to shallow lakes the deep lakes showed lower diffusive ch4 flux which could be related to the longer oxidation pathway presence of oxycline layer and its lower nutrient environment besides lake ch4 oxidation could also be influenced by other environment factors such as hypolimnetic do ch4 availability water temperature etc hershey et al 2015 denfeld et al 2016 3 4 potential impacts of global warming on lake methane emissions in the future recent studies reported a profound change taking place in lake water levels and areas under a background of global warming fig s9 in appendix a despite the different variation patterns of different regions donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 for example due to the rise in net precipitation and ice melt in the qinghai tibet plateau according to our findings water levels of most lakes in these regions have been markedly increased zhang et al 2017 which could further affect diffusive ch4 emissions more specifically previous studies have indicated that lake water depth and area in the qinghai tibet plateau tp have increased by approximately 15 and 40 respectively from 2002 to 2010 as a result of global warming tan et al 2017 according this information and eq 1 we estimated that mean diffusive ch4 flux of tp s lake decreased by 11 0 during 2002 2010 but due to the remarkable increasing of lake area our estimation suggested that the total diffusive ch4 emission from the lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau significantly increased by 24 3 from 2002 to 2010 of course this prediction is obviously simplistic and actual situation are far more complex on one hand global warming could accelerate the permafrost thaw and glaciers melting in ice rich regions causing lake area increasing or new lakes formation which finally resulting in higher ch4 emissions knoblauch et al 2018 walter et al 2006 on the other hand the temperature rising could also cause the increasing of ch4 oxidation or even the disappearance of many lakes or ponds in some regions walter et al 2007 martinez cruz et al 2015 leading to the mitigation of lake ch4 emissions therefore although much effort has been invested in how diffusive ch4 emissions respond to global warming our understanding of this process clearly remains very limited walter et al 2006 aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 3 5 limitations and uncertainties despite the various efforts having been made there remains some limitations that could result in significant uncertainties in the quantification of the spatio temporal variations and estimations of total ch4 emissions diffusion other ch4 flux component from global lakes for instance an accurate survey of the abundance and seasonality of global lakes is crucial for an accurate global ch4 emission estimation in this study we adopted the glowabo database due to its high resolution 0 002 km2 in comparison to other lakes database and compared our results with previous estimations that had also adopted the glowabo database holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 however a recent estimate suggested that greater than 40 of global diffusive ch4 flux could be emitted from very small lakes or ponds 0 001 km2 holgerson and raymond 2016 such small lakes are extremely difficult to map using current remote sensing and geographical information systems gis technology and they were thus not included in current global lake databases such as the glowabo database lehner and döll 2004 holgerson and raymond 2016 this is important because the exclusion of these small lakes 0 001 km2 could result in an underestimation of global lake ch4 diffusion estimations additionally maximum depth data used in this study were calculated from the hydrolakes database which has adopted a geo statistical model to simulate the mean depth of global lakes messager et al 2016 however it should be noted that even though mean depth simulated in the hydrolakes database agreed well with observed mean depth for the lakes with an area greater than 1 km2 e g r2 0 55 this data may produce large errors in smaller lakes area 1 km2 r2 0 24 messager et al 2016 for small lakes area 1 km2 the hydrolakes database tends to underestimate mean depth in mountain lakes of the andes in south america and european alps or tends to be overestimated in shallow lakes from low land regions failure to estimate mean depth in small lakes could be result of the spatial variability in mean depth in these small lakes and this could have resulted in high uncertainty of our ch4 estimations for lakes with an area less than 1 km2 another limitation of our estimation is related to temporal variation in annual diffusive ch4 flux according to eq 1 temporal variation in ch4 flux could be simulated by seasonal or interannual variation in lake water depth and surface area unfortunately due to a lack of a long term database on the morphometry dynamics of global lakes here we just assumed that there was no seasonal interannual variation in morphometric characteristics water depth and surface area for global lakes however for most lakes both lake water depth i e maximum or mean depth and surface area are highly variable with climate change or seasonal interannual inundation particularly small lakes for example seasonal or interannual inundation will largely alter its hydrological conditions e g water level and the biogeochemical cycles of small lakes and will significantly affect the ch4 emission from global lakes furthermore based on our empirical model eq 1 during flood inundation rising water level could increase the length of the ch4 oxidation pathway and ultimately reduce the diffusive ch4 emission from lakes in addition flood inundation also could result in an increase in organic matter input and cause a shift from aerobic to an anaerobic environment resulting in more ch4 production previous field experiments also found that lake ch4 emissions could increase or decrease during flood inundation for instance wassmann and thein 1996 found that ch4 flux would immediately start to increase at the beginning of flood inundation and continue a rise before the water level reach to maximum however forsberg et al 2015 reported that ch4 emission from lakes in the amazon floodplain were relative lower during high water periods compared to low water periods from 2014 to 2015 thus the variation in ch4 emission during flood inundation could differ and will depend on balance between ch4 production and oxidation it is interesting to note that seasonal drought could also alter the ghgs emission from global lakes marcé et al 2018 moreover this study mainly focused on the relationship between diffusive ch4 flux and morphometric characteristics maximum depth and lake area it also provided an updated estimation of ch4 diffusion from global lakes although the contribution of diffusive flux to the total ch4 emission is relatively small 13 according to a recent global estimation bastviken et al 2011 for major contributor of lake ch4 emission i e ebullitive ch4 we did not find an effective index to predict the global ebullitive ch4 flux fig 3 this could be due to the high spatiotemporal variability of ebullitive ch4 flux and the relative scarcity of ch4 ebullition measurements in current

estimated the global lake diffusive ch4 emission and its spatial distribution we found that greater than 84 of ch4 is emitted from shallow lakes with a mean depth less than 5m distributed within high

18150,global lakes have been identified as an important component of natural methane ch4 sources given that lake ch4 emissions involve multiple complex processes influenced by various environmental factors estimates of global lake ch4 emissions are largely uncertain in this study we compiled global ch4 emission data on 744 lakes from published studies and found a significantly negative correlation r2 0 50 p 0 01 between diffusive ch4 flux and lake maximum depth further analysis indicated that no significant differences in global sediment ch4 production were found for the different maximum depths investigated owing to the longer oxidation pathway presence of oxycline layer and the lower nutrient environment deeper lakes yield less diffusive ch4 efflux compared to shallower lakes additionally we also found that lake area was negatively correlated r2 0 13 p 0 01 to diffusive ch4 flux therefore based on empirical correlations between lake morphometry maximum depth and area and diffusive ch4 emission as well as the combination of two lake databases we estimated that the annual diffusive ch4 emission from global lakes is approximately 11 2 6 2 19 5 tg ch4 yr and greater than 84 is emitted from lakes with a mean depth of less than 5 m furthermore two regions 40 70 n 30 4 and 20 s 10 n 37 4 were found to be the dominant contributors of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions resulting from the considerable total lake area and the extensive shallow lakes in these regions this study highlights the significance of the depth effect which controls the spatial distribution of lake diffusive ch4 flux and allows for the quantification of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions graphical abstract image 1 keywords global methane estimation lake ch4 diffusion maximum depth surface area freshwaters ghgs emissions 1 introduction recent studies have raised considerable concern on the rapid increase in global atmospheric methane ch4 levels since 1750 myhre et al 2013 saunois et al 2016 while also motivating fields of research targeted at investigating the magnitude and spatiotemporal dynamics of dominant sinks and sources kirschke et al 2013 deemer et al 2016 of late years global lake ecosystems including ponds have been identified as important natural ch4 sources bastviken et al 2011 kirschke et al 2013 contributing 20 6 32 8 to global natural ch4 emission despite the fact that such water bodies only cover from approximately 1 8 3 6 of the total land area verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 abundant organic carbon c storage and anoxic conditions in lake sediment stimulate high ch4 production by methanogenic bacteria bastviken et al 2008 tranvik et al 2009 delsontro et al 2016 resulting in ch4 supersaturation in the many lakes kankaala et al 2013 beaulieu et al 2016 to date there have been many field investigations into the magnitude and regulation of lake ch4 emission as well as its spatio temporal dynamics juutinen et al 2009 bastviken et al 2010 sepulveda jauregui et al 2015 rasilo et al 2015 northington and saros 2016 with the increasing number of field measurements and improvements in geographic mapping technology some studies set out to estimate the global lake ch4 emissions via compiling the lake ch4 observations around the world bastviken et al 2004 2011 walter et al 2007 juutinen et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 delsontro et al 2018 a first systematic study of global lake ch4 emission estimation was presented by bastviken et al 2011 they reported that global lakes emit approximately 71 6 tg ch4 into atmosphere every year via four pathways diffusive flux ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux recently holgerson raymond 2016 found a significantly negative correlation between the ch4 concentration and the lake surface area thus based on the mean diffusive flux and the corresponding lake area of each area class e g 0 001 km2 0 001 0 01 km2 etc they estimated that global lakes including ponds release about 16 tg ch4 yr through diffusion pathway besides lake area delsontro et al 2018 demonstrated that lake ch4 emissions also are related with trophic status chlorophyll a and total phosphorus at global scale subsequently they combined the lake area databases and a global chlorophyll a distribution map sayers et al 2015 to estimate a global lake ch4 emissions of 78 139 tg ch4 yr overall these works revealed the important role of lake ecosystems in global ch4 budget and gave us some enlightenment about quantifying the magnitude and dynamics of lake ch4 emission however significant uncertainties remain in lake ch4 emission estimation on one hand among the four types of ch4 flux components mentioned above the ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux in general only occur in some special circumstances for instance previous studies have suggested that lake ebullitive ch4 emission is highly episodic and mostly happened in the sites with high sediment carbon storage saunois et al 2016 west et al 2016 the storage flux and plant mediated flux usually can be observed during lake overturn and in the mostly vegetated regions respectively bastviken et al 2004 therefore current field measurements of ebullitive flux storage flux and plant mediated flux usually are scarce and highly spatiotemporally variable saunois et al 2016 on the other hand most of lake ch4 measurements used in previous estimations were sampled from boreal regions bastviken et al 2011 holgerson and raymond 2016 however more and more evidences revealed that temperate and tropical lakes have higher ch4 emission rates than lakes located in northern latitude regions narvenkar et al 2013 rinta et al 2017 lacking of substantial data to calculate a representative mean ch4 emission rate for each classification category i e flux types or regional divisions could bring large uncertainties during estimating global lake ch4 emission another source of uncertainty in current estimations is lacking in the fitting drivers used to upscaling emission estimates in detail these fitting drivers should have a significant impact on ch4 emission at global scale and be easy to access from the current global maps or other databases although the significant impact of lake area and chlorophyll a on ch4 emission had been proved in previous studies and thus had been used to estimate global lake ch4 emission west et al 2016 beaulieu et al 2019 it should be noted that the combination of lake area and chlorophyll a explained only a minority of variations in lake ch4 emissions e g r2 0 29 in the model of predicting ch4 diffusion delsontro et al 2018 interestingly a large amount of studies found the significantly reverse dependency of lake depth and diffusive ch4 flux in the different regions natchimuthu et al 2016 west et al 2016 wik et al 2016 in addition messager et al 2016 developed a new global database termed hydralakes to simulate surface area and depth of global lakes by employing a geo statistical model therefore we might simulate the global spatial distribution of diffusive ch4 emission based on that spatially resolved lake depth database hydrolakes if we can demonstrate the significant correlation between lake depth and diffusive ch4 flux at global scale in this study we focused on diffusive ch4 flux from global lakes to explore the relationship between diffusive ch4 emission and lake size i e maximum depth and area on global scale and we used this relationship to provide a spatial map of diffusive ch4 emission from global lakes we compiled global database including in situ ch4 measurements ch4 concentration diffusive ch4 flux and basin morphometry data maximum depth and surface area of 744 lakes from published literature updated to 2018 the main objectives of this study were to explore variation in diffusive ch4 emissions from global lakes to analyze and quantify the potential relevance of diffusive ch4 emissions and lake size to simulate spatial dynamics of global lake diffusive ch4 emissions and to obtain a more accurate global lake ch4 budget 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection we compiled lake diffusive ch4 flux and concentration data from published literature by searching keywords that include methane ch4 ghg and greenhouse gases along with lake and pond from the web of science google scholar and cnki china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net database until march 2018 given that there is only limited ch4 data from temperate and tropical lakes in previous global estimations we contented to compile lake ch4 measurements from temperate and tropical regions n 265 from 102 articles where n is the number of lakes compiled as much as possible in total our database comprised of 744 lakes wherein diffusive ch4 flux n 554 and concentration n 407 data were recorded from a total of 171 published studies in order to reduce potential methodological bias or other restrictive reasons we directly adopted the ch4 flux data including diffusive flux ebullitive flux and sediment ch4 flux reported in the original studies rather than calculating these fluxes by ourselves besides this study used three criteria for ch4 data collection 1 we directly adopted diffusive ch4 flux data that was measured using floating chamber method or have already been calculated from dissolved ch4 concentrations i e the boundary layer method by the authors we did not include ch4 flux measured by eddy covariance flux towers in this study because it was not possible to distinguish between diffusion and ebullition flux paranaíba et al 2018 2 all ch4 flux observations from littoral zones were excluded which could potentially represent a mixture of diffusive flux and plant mediated flux ch4 flux emitted through aquatic vegetation juutinen et al 2003 although littoral zones have a large contribution to total ch4 emission from the whole lake ecosystem it is very difficult to distinguish between diffusion and plant mediated flux in each study because of the limited information about the presence absence of plants during data compilation 3 we only included diffusive ch4 flux and concentration data measured on in the surface water layer which represents ch4 diffusion from lakes into the atmosphere and dissolved ch4 concentration in the surface water layer respectively furthermore we also recorded maximum depth surface area and geographic location longitude latitude information of each lake from corresponding literature or from relevant documents which contained such information although we have made great effort to collect maximum depth and area data we ultimately obtained limited records about maximum depth n 355 and surface area n 534 from the 774 lakes we compiled therefore some lakes compiled in our database may still lack maximum depth or lake area data or both in other words the actual numbers of lakes used in our statistical analysis could be less than 744 to avoid inaccurate or misleading results we recorded the number of lakes used in each statistical analysis e g lake number n in eq 2 see fig 1 additionally it is important to mention that mean depth could be a more effective index of morphometric basin characteristics than maximum depth however in our database we found 1 that there was only limited information on mean depth in the literature and its relevance to ch4 flux was relatively limited compared to maximum depth fig s4 in appendix a 2 that most of ch4 measurements were sampled from or in the vicinity of the pelagic zone and 3 that the correlation between maximum depth and mean depth was highly significant r2 0 97 n 152 fig s5 in appendix a taken this into account we used maximum depth as a proxy of mean depth in this study 2 2 estimating the annual diffusive ch4 flux and average ch4 concentration of each lake before conducing statistical analysis we needed to estimate the annual diffusive ch4 flux and concentration of each lake in our database ch4 measurements from most lakes n 560 were sampled multiple times over a one year period for these lakes we directly adopted annual diffusive ch4 flux and concentrations reported in the original studies moreover approximately 23 of lakes only reported ch4 measurements during the summer or winter seasons or during ice free periods for these lakes we calculated the average seasonal ch4 measurement as the annual diffusive ch4 values for lakes that had multiple sampled locations we first excluded the ch4 measurements from littoral habitats vegetated zones and then calculated the mean flux and concentration sampled from the remaining locations moreover for the same lake were recorded in multiple studies we calculated the mean diffusive ch4 flux and concentration separately finally we converted units of all ch4 flux and concentration data into mg ch4 m2 h and mg ch4 l respectively to simplify database management 2 3 statistical analysis we adopted regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between diffusive ch4 flux and concentration with lake morphometric characteristics maximum depth and lake area respectively due to the high spatiotemporal variability in the original data we log transferred data ch4 flux and concentration prior to regression analysis besides to explore how the relationships e g lake diffusive flux vs maximum depth varied in different biomes we classified the lakes into different biomes and conducted regression analysis of each biome zones separately in this study we determined the biomes zone of each lakes based on köppen geiger climate classification map kottek et al 2006 considering the limited the number of lakes in our database we simplified the categories of köppen geiger map and classified the 744 lakes into 5 biome classes tropical temperate boreal tundra and other biome types i e desert ice mangroves etc all statistical analyses were performed using r software version 3 5 0 2 4 upscaling to global diffusive ch4 emissions we estimated diffusive ch4 flux for global lakes based on eq 1 which integrates the maximum depth and surface area of lake to predict potential ch4 diffusion rates first of all we need a global high resolution lake database to provide the morphometric parameters surface area and maximum depth and the geographic location of global lakes a satellite imagery based lakes database glowabo global water bodies database consists of 117 million lakes with an area greater than 0 002 km2 and its combined total lake area is approximately 5 4 106 km2 which has a higher resolution and covers a greater total area than previous global lake databases lehner and döll 2004 verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 additionally the glowabo database has previously been used to estimate regional or global ch4 emissions from lakes holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 in this study we also adopted the glowabo database to estimate global diffusive ch4 emissions however it is important to note that maximum depth had not been reported in most current global lake databases including glowabo database fortunately hydrolakes another global lake database has successfully simulated lake mean depth by employing a multiple variable geo statistical model although both its total area 2 7 106 km2 and lake number 1 42 million are smaller than the glowabo database verpoorter et al 2014 messager et al 2016 one of important works is how to obtain the maximum depth of each lake in the glowabo database firstly we found a strong correlation between maximum depth and mean depth for global lakes r2 0 97 fig s5 in appendix a based on this correlation we calculated the maximum depth of each lake in hydrolakes database secondly we used the inverse distance weighting idw method to interpolate a global grid map of lake maximum depth grid cell area 0 002 km2 thirdly for 117 million lakes in glowabo database we extracted maximum depth value of each lake based on their geographic location from the interpolated global map mentioned above and then we simulated the diffusive ch4 flux mg ch4 m2 h of individual lakes n 117 million with the corresponding maximum depth and area data according to eq 1 finally we calculated annual diffusive ch4 emissions tg ch4 yr by multiplying diffusive flux by the surface area of each lake all spatial analyses e g idw analysis were performed using arcgis software esri version 10 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of morphometric characteristics on methane lake dynamics ch4 lake emissions and concentrations were typically highest in shallow lakes or ponds and decreased with an increase in maximum depth fig 1 a c where maximum depth explained 50 p 0 001 n 245 and 49 p 0 001 n 160 of variation in lake ch4 flux and concentration respectively additionally lake area was negatively correlated to ch4 lake flux r 2 0 13 p 0 001 n 364 and concentration r 2 0 19 p 0 001 n 273 respectively fig 1 b d the maximum depth and area combined explained 61 of variation in ch4 lake emissions 1 log 10 f c h 4 0 42 0 085 0 097 0 028 l o g 10 a r e a 1 08 0 072 l o g 10 d m a x where numbers in parentheses represent standard deviations of regression coefficients in contrast to maximum depth the impact of area size on ch4 lake emissions was relatively minor which differed somewhat from previous assessments holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 in fact this finding can be explained by our updated database for instance high ch4 flux has been measured in some shallow lakes with relatively large areas such as lake dong 10 77 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 32 km2 chilika lake 2 92 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 1032 5 km2 and lake poyang 0 36 mg ch4 m2 h surface area 3210 km2 ray 2013 xiao et al 2013 liu et al 2017 compared to mean values from lakes around the world 0 10 mg ch4 m2 h additionally we further classified measurements into four biome types tundra boreal temperate and tropical and explored the impact of maximum depth and area on ch4 lake emissions within specific biomes results suggested that lake ch4 flux exhibited a significantly decreasing trend with an increase in maximum depth for the different biome types fig 2 left which further demonstrates that shallow lakes are hot spots of diffusive ch4 emissions in different biomes on the contrary only ch4 flux from tundra and boreal lakes were significantly correlated to lake area and no correlation was found between lake area and ch4 flux of temperate and tropical lakes fig 2 right similar findings were also reported in rinta et al 2017 the weaker correlation between ch4 flux and lake area in temperate and tropical lakes could be the result of their larger range of lake surface area cover compared to tundra and boreal lakes more specifically most tundra and boreal lakes are glacial origin wik et al 2016 and could therefore characterized by less variable morphometry compared to lakes of tectonic and volcanic origin in temperate and tropical regions it is important to note that ch4 flux in our study only represents diffusive flux even though ebullitive flux was regarded as the dominant pathway in previous studies bastviken et al 2004 2011 previous studies found that ebullitive flux could also be correlated to the mean depth or surface area of lakes juutinen et al 2009 holgerson and raymond 2016 in this study we specifically collected ebullitive ch4 flux data from 153 global lakes to analyze the correlation between ebullitive flux with maximum depth and area fig 3 and fig s6 in appendix a but the correlation was not significant which means that ebullitive flux is not significantly different in lakes of variable depth or area additionally when we incorporated ebullitive flux into our estimate we found that the correlation between the sum of ch4 flux diffusive ebullitive and morphometric characteristics maximum depth and area was relatively low compared to diffusive flux only fig s7 in appendix a in fact ebullitive ch4 flux could be directly released into the atmosphere and only limited ch4 transported by this means would oxidize along the water column walter et al 2007 therefore ch4 ebullition flux could potentially be determined by net ch4 production in sediment delsontro et al 2016 additionally ch4 transported through ebullitive flux is most often observed in carbon rich and shallow lakes bastviken et al 2004 juutinen et al 2009 where dissolved ch4 is generally supersaturated being rarely found in deeper lakes in addition to the high randomness of ebullitive flux more data and better knowledge of ebullitive ch4 dynamics is required before we can begin to assess global ebullitive ch4 emissions 3 2 global estimation of diffusive methane emissions from lakes by combining our updated global lake database and eq 1 see the methods and materials section we were able to simulate the global diffusive ch4 flux mg ch4 m2 h and the annual diffusive ch4 emission tg ch4 yr for global lakes fig 4 we obtained an average of 0 10 mg ch4 m2 h 0 077 0 14 mg ch4 m2 h where the range was calculated with eq 1 which is slightly less than the global estimation obtained by bastviken et al 2011 using 365 lakes 0 30 mg ch4 m2 but it is close to a previous estimation of boreal lakes 0 075 mg ch4 m2 h juutinen et al 2009 high diffusive ch4 flux is found in the lakes from two regions high northern latitudes and large tropical river watersheds one of the links between these two regions is their numerous shallow and small lakes which could result in high diffusive ch4 emissions a great number of shallow and small lakes or ponds pervade boreal and northern tundra regions which have recently been identified as critical hotspots of global ch4 emissions wik et al 2016 elder et al 2018 moreover previous studies suggested that shallow lakes or more precisely forest flood zones along floodplains and large rivers such as the amazon basin also contribute significantly to ch4 emissions devol et al 1990 smith et al 2000 in this study we estimated the annual diffusive ch4 emission the total number of lakes 117 million at 11 2 tg ch4 yr 6 2 19 5 tg ch4 yr where the range was calculated using eq 1 from global lakes fig 4b and table 1 this estimation is slightly higher than that calculated by 9 7 tg ch4 yr bastviken et al 2011 but lower than a recent estimation 16 tg ch4 yr by holgerson and raymond 2016 one of the primary differences between our estimation and previous estimations is total lake area that we adopted table 1 holgerson and raymond 2016 added a large number of small ponds 0 001 km2 to global lake ch4 simulation accounting for the important role that small ponds play in global lake ch4 emissions that study estimated that global lake diffusive ch4 emission is approximately 16 tg ch4 yr in which small ponds 0 001 km2 contributed 6 5 tg ch4 yr if emissions of the small ponds 0 001 km2 were subtracted from their estimate global diffusive ch4 emission estimated by holgerson raymond 2016 would be approximately 9 5 tg ch4 yr which is closer to our estimation 11 2 tg ch4 yr our more conservative results were the result of difficulty in identifying small ponds 0 001 km2 using current remote sensing technology holgerson and raymond 2016 additionally we made some efforts to conduct a more comprehensive and improved assessment on the one hand most previous estimations just calculated the mean or median ch4 flux of each area class and then upscaled results to regional or global lake scales bastviken et al 2004 juutinen et al 2009 wik et al 2016 in contrast we initially adopted an empirically integrated effect based hypothesis i e that lake morphometry is correlated to ch4 emissions in our assessment specifically for maximum depth results from our study indicated that greater than 84 of diffusive ch4 flux is emitted from lakes with a mean water depth less than 5 m therefore shallow lakes play an important role in global lake diffusive ch4 emissions additionally we analyzed spatial patterns of diffusive ch4 emissions and found high variability in different regions for example we found that lakes between coordinates 40 70 n 30 4 and 20 s 10 n 37 4 were the dominant contributors of diffusive ch4 emissions globally further analysis revealed that high diffusive ch4 emissions from these two regions could be related to the large total area and extensive shallow lakes distributed moreover our estimate also revealed that lakes in high northern latitude zones i e boreal and tundra biomes only comprise of approximately 21 of the global lake diffusive ch4 emission even though such regions are regarded as the crucial zones in the global lake ch4 budget juutinen et al 2009 wik et al 2016 considering that both the number and the total area of lakes in high northern latitude zones are greater than other regions downing et al 2006 juutinen et al 2009 verpoorter et al 2014 wik et al 2016 being a more important component of the global lake ch4 budget i e 34 of global lake ch4 diffusion more attention should be paid to researches related to current ch4 measurements and mechanisms from shallow lakes in tropical regions 3 3 why shallow lakes emit more diffusive ch4 than deep lakes our results indicated that lake morphometry maximum depth and area had an effective impact on diffusive ch4 emissions from global lakes as the two important physical factors maximum depth and area could affect water column mixing the anoxic state of volume fraction piston velocity and sediment carbon accumulation fee et al 1996 bastviken et al 2004 ferland et al 2012 read et al 2012 as well as further influence ch4 production and oxidation diffusive ch4 flux reflects a balance between ch4 production from sediment and oxidation in the water column previous regional investigations reported two potential causes for high ch4 diffusive flux from shallow lakes abundant organic c storage in sediment or a short residence time namely either high ch4 production or low ch4 oxidation bastviken et al 2008 holgerson and raymond 2016 in our study we attempted to identify the most pivotal depth dependence driver of global diffusive ch4 emissions from the two possible causes mentioned above previous studies suggested that most of ch4 is produced in lake sediment where the anaerobic environment can promote the conversion of carbon dioxide co2 hydrogen h2 or acetate c2h3o2 into ch4 by means of methanogenic bacteria jarrell 1985 michmerhuizen et al 1996 sediment conditions including temperature the absence of oxygen and organic carbon content determine ch4 production ultimately affecting lake ch4 emissions kotelnikova 2002 hanson and hanson 1996 in fact we also compiled sediment ch4 flux data from 79 global lakes but we found no significant correlation between sediment ch4 flux and lake maximum depth fig 5 b accordingly it was concluded that there was no obvious difference in sediment ch4 production among the global lakes investigated in other words the high diffusive ch4 flux in shallow lakes could be most likely correlated to its lesser ch4 oxidation than deep lakes ch4 production in sediment is transported upward to the lake surface along the water column wherein most ch4 will be oxidized by aerobic or anaerobic methanotrophic bacteria thauer et al 2008 being influenced by gradients in water temperature some dissolved substances e g dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a commonly found in many lakes are vertically stratified boehrer and schultze 2008 shade et al 2012 similarly ch4 profiles also exhibit vertical stratification in some lakes wherein dissolved ch4 significantly decreases from the bottom of the water column to the lake surface fig s2 in appendix a in general lake ch4 oxidation could be related to the length of ch4 transportation pathway absence presence of oxycline layer and the trophic status in the water first for shallow lakes the shallow water column causes a shorter transportation pathway including vertical diffusion and lateral transport resulting in a significant proportion of ch4 production to rapidly be emitted into the atmosphere in contrast deep lakes usually are physically stratified into three layers hypolimnion oxycline and epilimnion many studies indicated that the highest ch4 oxidation rate generally occurs at the oxycline layer where the high ch4 concentration and low oxygen concentration meets joye et al 1999 oswald et al 2015 2017 due to the presence of oxycline large proportion of ch4 production in deep lakes could be oxidized at the oxycline before reaching the surface water layer besides the ch4 oxidation rate will gradually decrease in the epilimnion layer resulting from the depletion of ch4 availability moreover compared to deep lakes the shallow lakes are vulnerable for eutrophication as a result of high nutrient loadings and poor physical self cleaning capacity havens et al 2001 janse 2005 in this study we found that lake diffusive ch4 flux significantly increased with the increasing nutrients concentration such as the doc dissolved organic carbon chl a chlorophyll a tn total nitrogen and tp total phosphorus fig s8 in appendix a the nutrient rich environment in shallow lakes not only provide more liable organic substrate to enhance the ch4 production by methanogenesis but also cause a depletion of dissolved oxygen do in the water body west et al 2012 beaulieu et al 2019 resulting in low ch4 oxidation in shallow lakes thus the high diffusive ch4 emission in shallow lakes could be also related to its nutrient rich environment in summary compared to shallow lakes the deep lakes showed lower diffusive ch4 flux which could be related to the longer oxidation pathway presence of oxycline layer and its lower nutrient environment besides lake ch4 oxidation could also be influenced by other environment factors such as hypolimnetic do ch4 availability water temperature etc hershey et al 2015 denfeld et al 2016 3 4 potential impacts of global warming on lake methane emissions in the future recent studies reported a profound change taking place in lake water levels and areas under a background of global warming fig s9 in appendix a despite the different variation patterns of different regions donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 for example due to the rise in net precipitation and ice melt in the qinghai tibet plateau according to our findings water levels of most lakes in these regions have been markedly increased zhang et al 2017 which could further affect diffusive ch4 emissions more specifically previous studies have indicated that lake water depth and area in the qinghai tibet plateau tp have increased by approximately 15 and 40 respectively from 2002 to 2010 as a result of global warming tan et al 2017 according this information and eq 1 we estimated that mean diffusive ch4 flux of tp s lake decreased by 11 0 during 2002 2010 but due to the remarkable increasing of lake area our estimation suggested that the total diffusive ch4 emission from the lakes in the qinghai tibet plateau significantly increased by 24 3 from 2002 to 2010 of course this prediction is obviously simplistic and actual situation are far more complex on one hand global warming could accelerate the permafrost thaw and glaciers melting in ice rich regions causing lake area increasing or new lakes formation which finally resulting in higher ch4 emissions knoblauch et al 2018 walter et al 2006 on the other hand the temperature rising could also cause the increasing of ch4 oxidation or even the disappearance of many lakes or ponds in some regions walter et al 2007 martinez cruz et al 2015 leading to the mitigation of lake ch4 emissions therefore although much effort has been invested in how diffusive ch4 emissions respond to global warming our understanding of this process clearly remains very limited walter et al 2006 aben et al 2017 davidson et al 2018 3 5 limitations and uncertainties despite the various efforts having been made there remains some limitations that could result in significant uncertainties in the quantification of the spatio temporal variations and estimations of total ch4 emissions diffusion other ch4 flux component from global lakes for instance an accurate survey of the abundance and seasonality of global lakes is crucial for an accurate global ch4 emission estimation in this study we adopted the glowabo database due to its high resolution 0 002 km2 in comparison to other lakes database and compared our results with previous estimations that had also adopted the glowabo database holgerson and raymond 2016 wik et al 2016 however a recent estimate suggested that greater than 40 of global diffusive ch4 flux could be emitted from very small lakes or ponds 0 001 km2 holgerson and raymond 2016 such small lakes are extremely difficult to map using current remote sensing and geographical information systems gis technology and they were thus not included in current global lake databases such as the glowabo database lehner and döll 2004 holgerson and raymond 2016 this is important because the exclusion of these small lakes 0 001 km2 could result in an underestimation of global lake ch4 diffusion estimations additionally maximum depth data used in this study were calculated from the hydrolakes database which has adopted a geo statistical model to simulate the mean depth of global lakes messager et al 2016 however it should be noted that even though mean depth simulated in the hydrolakes database agreed well with observed mean depth for the lakes with an area greater than 1 km2 e g r2 0 55 this data may produce large errors in smaller lakes area 1 km2 r2 0 24 messager et al 2016 for small lakes area 1 km2 the hydrolakes database tends to underestimate mean depth in mountain lakes of the andes in south america and european alps or tends to be overestimated in shallow lakes from low land regions failure to estimate mean depth in small lakes could be result of the spatial variability in mean depth in these small lakes and this could have resulted in high uncertainty of our ch4 estimations for lakes with an area less than 1 km2 another limitation of our estimation is related to temporal variation in annual diffusive ch4 flux according to eq 1 temporal variation in ch4 flux could be simulated by seasonal or interannual variation in lake water depth and surface area unfortunately due to a lack of a long term database on the morphometry dynamics of global lakes here we just assumed that there was no seasonal interannual variation in morphometric characteristics water depth and surface area for global lakes however for most lakes both lake water depth i e maximum or mean depth and surface area are highly variable with climate change or seasonal interannual inundation particularly small lakes for example seasonal or interannual inundation will largely alter its hydrological conditions e g water level and the biogeochemical cycles of small lakes and will significantly affect the ch4 emission from global lakes furthermore based on our empirical model eq 1 during flood inundation rising water level could increase the length of the ch4 oxidation pathway and ultimately reduce the diffusive ch4 emission from lakes in addition flood inundation also could result in an increase in organic matter input and cause a shift from aerobic to an anaerobic environment resulting in more ch4 production previous field experiments also found that lake ch4 emissions could increase or decrease during flood inundation for instance wassmann and thein 1996 found that ch4 flux would immediately start to increase at the beginning of flood inundation and continue a rise before the water level reach to maximum however forsberg et al 2015 reported that ch4 emission from lakes in the amazon floodplain were relative lower during high water periods compared to low water periods from 2014 to 2015 thus the variation in ch4 emission during flood inundation could differ and will depend on balance between ch4 production and oxidation it is interesting to note that seasonal drought could also alter the ghgs emission from global lakes marcé et al 2018 moreover this study mainly focused on the relationship between diffusive ch4 flux and morphometric characteristics maximum depth and lake area it also provided an updated estimation of ch4 diffusion from global lakes although the contribution of diffusive flux to the total ch4 emission is relatively small 13 according to a recent global estimation bastviken et al 2011 for major contributor of lake ch4 emission i e ebullitive ch4 we did not find an effective index to predict the global ebullitive ch4 flux fig 3 this could be due to the high spatiotemporal variability of ebullitive ch4 flux and the relative scarcity of ch4 ebullition measurements in current databases recently some studies reported that ch4 ebullition could be more sensitive to sediment conditions e g sediment temperature and carbon availability e g doc and chlorophyll a in lake ecosystems delsontro et al 2016 2018 wik et al 2016 4 conclusions this study showed that diffusive ch4 flux from global lakes varies significantly with maximum depth in view of this finding we estimated the global lake diffusive ch4 emission and its spatial distribution we found that greater than 84 of ch4 is emitted from shallow lakes with a mean depth less than 5m distributed within high northern latitudes and regions with large tropical river basin considering the limitations and uncertainties of the current estimate urgent efforts or new directions need to be considered for future analysis in terms of the 1 developing of higher resolution lake database that records relevant morphological indexes e g maximum depth and surface area and trophic status i e doc chlorophyll a total phosphorus etc as well as their associative seasonal interannual variation especially for small lakes or ponds 2 quantifying ch4 dynamics during each process including ch4 production oxidation and

18151,bioelectrochemical system bes is promising technology to simultaneously treat wastewater and recover energy and electrode material is important for the system performance microbial fuel cell mfc is one of typical bes to be applied in wastewater treatment how to improve the electrode material is significant to improve wastewater treatment energy recovery and cost effectiveness in this study 3d weaved carbon electrode entity assembled by multiple pieces of carbon mesh cm was proposed to combine all electrode components as entity to facilitate electron conduction and ionic migration compared with carbon brush cb and granular activated carbon gac the result showed that current density and internal resistance of mfc using 3d weaved cm as horizontally extended inside anode cm t were 30 9 a m 3 and 4 5 ω respectively with higher output than traditional gac 22 6 a m 3 and 6 2 ω though gac had greater electrode filling and surface area for biomass growth the electron transfer efficiency per unit electrode biomass was only at 0 0019 0 0002 mol g 1 d 1 much lower than cm t at 0 0077 0 0009 mol g 1 day 1 higher ionic migration rate of cm t suggested the assisting effect of composite electrode to enhance ionic transportation towards the cathode microbial analysis further indicated that 3d cm electrode network could simultaneously enhance geobacter abundance and methanogen activity suggesting the importance of electrode network on electricigens furthermore cm t could obtain 10 times higher energy output efficiency than traditional gac when applied inside anode chamber this study proved that network construction of anode electrode could promote the electrode performance and cost effectiveness suggesting the future development of reactor design of bioelectrochemical system graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system 3d electrode network carbon mesh electron transfer efficiency cost effectiveness 1 introduction with global population explosion energy demand becomes higher sustainable energy recovery for waste conversion to available energy is important to solve the above problem for wastewater treatment bioelectrochemical system bes is an effective technology to make advantage of microorganisms to convert the chemical energy stored in the organic pollutant to electricity logan et al 2006 slate et al 2019 microbial fuel cell mfc is typical bes to be applied and electrode material and configuration play key roles on microbial growth and electron transfer appropriate electrode modification will benefit organic transportation to enhance microbial activity and facilitate electron harvesting for higher electricity generation furthermore electrodes contribute to large amount of total capital cost of bes and suitable electrode modification will reduce cost to increase practical application value in real world do et al 2018 thus how to enhance electrode performance warrants massive research to improve anode electrode is key component for the above functions in the bes because of its significance to support microbial growth for organic degradation and provide conductive network to transfer electrons to external circuit at present carbon based electrodes were commonly used due to its light weight good conductivity and biocompatibility for microbial adhesion and electricity generation li et al 2017a high porosity and surface area would be important parameters for biofilm formation and active sites for electrochemical reaction sonawane et al 2017 three dimensional 3d anodic morphology would be useful to guarantee the above parameters in satisfactory condition liu et al 2010 however currently the practical application of carbon based electrodes still faced challenges due to its high capital cost especially when applied in large scale context do et al 2018 thus further 3d anode modification and comparison are needed for better carbon based material most 3d carbon based electrode modification was processed by adding conductive coatings or changing morphology on the electrode surface itself to increase space for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation such as graphene and carbon nanotube cnt based on about half of total papers related to carbonaceous material in fuel cell application do et al 2018 cornejo et al 2015 you and kamarudin 2017 another typical 3d anode material is carbon brush cb which could assist enhanced biofilm growth brush fiber and electron conducting out process titanium bar kang et al 2017 hutchinson et al 2011 however cb still has its own limit its void space among brush fibers especially near the fiber edges would reduce available space for microbial colonization zhang et al 2013 lower electrode filling proportion in anode chamber would limit biomass content in cb anode and the organic degradation efficiency would also be reduced liao et al 2015 furthermore cb has high cost to limit the application value mainly attributed to titanium wire bian et al 2018 thus new material type and electrode structure are needed to solve the above problems another electrode material granular activated carbon gac could greatly reduce the electrode price compared to the conventional cb cb at 21 43 kg 1 vs gac at 0 07 0 14 kg 1 wei et al 2011 also gac could increase the ratio of electrode surface area versus reactor volume to increase biomass content in the anode and further improve hydraulic flow condition for higher bacterial affinity with substrate sonawane et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 however gac packing anode has difficulty on electron conduction to external circuit due to contacting difficulty to conduct electrons based on limited particle size liu et al 2014 also excessive attached biofilm growth on gac would lead to clogging problem to retard mass transfer inside the gac packing anode jung et al 2018 sun et al 2016 furthermore current collector such as titanium mesh was needed inside gac packed anode chamber to conduct electrons out liu et al 2019 and the practical problem might become more severe due to high cost in scale up reactor zhang and angelidaki 2016 thus the anode configuration and material need further improvement on electrical conduction and cost effectiveness new electrode material combining three main functions together would be good solution including feasible electron transferring process high biocompatibility and non clogging process advantage combination of cb and gac would be effective strategy and carbon mesh cm made of weaved carbon fibers is a promising electrode candidate to satisfy the above demands based on its high conductivity and integration flexibility by weaving together as 3d electrode network the objective of this study was to construct weaved cm network electrode in mfc anode and compare with traditional anode material e g cb gac besides cm structure would be applied as two different morphologies with anolyte flowing through and along the cm surface i e cm t and cm a all system performance was compared based on their electrochemical performance anodic surface characterization microbial community and cost efficiency to evaluate the practical values of the new electrode morphology 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc configuration and construction each mfc reactor was constructed with one anode and one cathode side by side separated by a cation exchange membrane cem with surface area at 156 cm2 dimension 26 cm 6 cm the anode had empty volume at 1560 ml dimension 26 cm 6 cm x 10 cm and all four mfc anodes were constructed with various materials the first mfc anode was installed with six cbs height 26 cm diameter 3 cm from haote new material inc wuhan china with stainless steel bar to support and connect outside the second mfc anode was fully filled with gac diameter 1 5 mm length 3 5 mm using two titanium meshes and one titanium sheet to connect the external circuit the third and fourth mfc anodes were all equipped with 3d weaved cm 3k cross lamination but the anode structure was differently designed one cm piece size 26 cm 6 cm was set as base layer to adhere on one side of cem facing anode in the third mfc anode each short edge of 26 cm pieces size of each cm 6 cm 10 cm was weaved on the cm base layer and these were extended out horizontally as multiple extension layers which enabled wastewater to flow up from bottom through all cms to the anode outlet cm t fig 1 the fourth anode was assembled with 6 cm pieces size of each cm 26 cm 10 cm but differently each long edge of cm piece was weaved on the cm based vertically as multiple extension layers to allow anolyte to flow up along all surfaces of cm cm a instead of crossing through fig 1 each piece of cm had a 10 cm long extension layers inside the anode chamber and the edge was attached on the inner surface of the anode chamber to be stabilized in the media the total electrode surface area of cm t and cm a was the same each cathode chamber had volume at 468 ml dimension 26 cm 6 cm x 3 cm fully filled with gac as cathode material using stainless steel mesh as current collector since the anode and cathode material was nearly uniformly distributed in the anode and cathode chamber the average electrode distance could be perceived as 6 5 cm mfc construction and operation schematic using cm t and anodic structure details of cm t and cm a were all shown in fig 1a c mfc anode using cb and gac were shown in figs s1 and s2 supplementary information 2 2 mfc start up and operation all anodes were inoculated with anaerobic sludge already cultivated for three months mixed liquid suspended solid mlss 2 98 0 15 g l 1 originally obtained from the origin water company beijing china and fed with synthetic wastewater for one month to achieve steady microbial community in the anode it should be noted that this study was to compare all electrodes on electron transferring efficiency to validate the feasibility of cm electrode application as mfc anode and thus other operating condition such as anolyte composition should be kept the same to feed all reactors the composition of synthetic anolyte was made with tap water supplemented with the following component per liter water ch3coona 0 64 g

2 6 ms cm 1 conductivity and ph at 6 9 7 0 the anolyte was fed into each mfc anode in continuous mode at rate of 2 17 ml min 1 anodic hrt at 12 h fig 1a which was controlled by a peristaltic pump senz 310ht shenzhen china the catholyte in each mfc was operated in batch mode with circulation rate at 80 ml min 1 controlled by another peristaltic pump the catholyte was composed of 16 46 g l 1 k3 fe cn 6 as electron acceptor and 10 mm phosphate buffer saline pbs 0 73 g l 1 k2hpo4 3h2o and 0 94 g l 1 kh2po4 as ph buffer with conductivity at 16 35 ms cm 1 and ph at 7 7 7 8 all catholyte was completely refreshed once every two days to maintain good catholyte condition with high conductivity and stable ph to remove the cathode interference on mfc performance to comprehensively analyze the electrochemical performance of various anode material during wastewater treatment the experiment was designed with various external resistances to connect the anode and cathode of each mfc including 1 10 and 100 ω this was to compare anode electrochemical performance under various current output each mfc anode under certain resistance was operated for at least a week to achieve stable performance for current generation measurement 2 3 measurement and analysis 2 3 1 water quality measurement cod in anodic effluent and nh4 n in both anode and cathode effluent were measured by colorimetric method 5b 3c linahua china based on previous research liu et al 2019 conductivity in anolyte and catholyte was measured by conductivity meter inlab 731 mettler toledo usa to evaluate the ionic migration cation concentrations in catholyte were measured by ionic chromatograph ics 200 dionex us equipped with cs 16 and a csrs 300 suppressor for cation measurement cathodic ammonium accumulation and conductivity increasing rate could be calculated to indicate the ionic migration rate from the anode to the cathode 2 3 2 electrochemical analysis during steady operation under each resistance the voltage of each mfc was monitored every 15 min by an automated voltage acquisition system daq2213 adlink china for six continuous days electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was also operated before inoculation and after steady performance to assess the resistance distribution of each entire mfc with working electrode anode material counter electrode cathode material and reference electrode ag agcl 0 201 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she and scanning frequency from 105 to 10 2 hz by a potentialstat autolab metrohm switzerland ohmic and charge transfer resistance were derived from x axis intersection and diameter of semi circle by fitting the nyquist plot of an equivalent circuit respectively bian et al 2018 equivalent circuit including components of ohmic and charge transfer resistance was applied and the details of equivalent circuit was shown in fig s3 supplementary information polarization curve was determined only for resistance at 100 10 and 1 ω and each resistance was operated for at least 6 days to achieve stable performance for data collection mentioned above and power density determination based on previous study watson and logan 2011 coulombic efficiencies ce were also calculated to indicate the organic conversion efficiency to electricity based on previous studies liu et al 2019 2 3 3 anodic biomass characterization after finishing all system operation electrode materials of all mfc anodes were obtained by cutting off the anode material for following surface characterization and biomass analysis scanning electron microscopy imaging sem zeiss germany was processed to characterize the anodic surface for biofilm formation protein concentration of electrode biofilm was measured by coomassie brilliant blue method to quantitate the biomass content while atp measurement was processed by atp assay kit to determine the biofilm activity and microbial metabolism promega wi us volumetric protein g l 1 and atp density μmol l 1 of entire anode chamber were derived from the protein and atp amount of the tested material samples multiplied by the weight ratio of entire anodic material versus tested sample each parameter was measured with triplicate samples for data assurance and statistical analysis detailed information was described in the supplementary information 2 4 microbial community characterization 2 4 1 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish to explain the reason for the difference of electrochemical performance microbial community played important role on organic degradation and electrochemical activity the relative abundance of geobacter over methanogens could reflect the electrochemical property in microbiological angle since geobacter is often predominant organism on the anodes due to its high power output nevin et al 2008 jothinathan et al 2018 fish was processed to determine their relative activity and the procedures were based on the previous study wang et al 2016 specific probes for g sulfurreducens and methanogens species were geo2 and s darch 0872 a a 18 respectively based on previous studies rotaru et al 2012 raghoebarsing et al 2006 after sufficient probe hybridization a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica us was used for image acquisition and fluorescence intensity quantification to characterize the relative activity of geobacter and methanogens detailed information was given in supplementary information 2 5 dna extraction and sequencing analysis the electrode biofilm and supernatant samples were harvested for dna extraction after three month continuous operation after completing dna extraction purification and pcr amplification illuminahiseq2500 platform was applied to construct the sequencing library and usearch software and silva database were used to annotate the library taxanomy yuan et al 2017 rarefaction curve was made for quality control and α diversity was also calculated for basic community characterization detailed procedures for dna extraction quality control following purification and sequencing analysis were stated in supplementary information 2 5 1 quantitative real time pcr analysis qpcr qpcr was processed to quantify electrigens geobacter and methanogens including aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen by using applied biosystems steponeplus real time system the primers were designed to target for microbes with significant functions including aceticlastic methanogenic archaea methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea methanobacteriales and crucial electricigens geobacter chae et al 2010 the details for primer sets qpcr mixture solution component and program setting were shown in supplementary information table s1 3 result and discussion 3 1 electrode performance comparison cm t had higher current density and ce than other materials and the difference was greater under lower external resistance the average current and ce result under various external resistance were shown in fig 2 a open circuit voltage after bacterial inoculation and six day current profile under 1 ω was shown in figs s4 and s5 the stable profile of open circuit voltage and current generation indicated that all mfc anodes were completely acclimatized it should be noted that the following current density was normalized by the anode volume a m 3 under high resistance at 100 ω current density of cm t was at 2 74 0 03 a m 3 though with higher current generation than traditional cb 1 86 0 02 a m 3 and gac 2 22 0 02 a m 3 cm did not show apparent electrochemical advantages under high resistance fig 2a on the contrary with decreasing resistance to 1 ω cm showed significantly better electrochemical performance for example cm t and cm a achieved the current density at 31 16 0 70 a m 3 and 23 41 0 69 a m 3 at 1 ω both significantly higher than cb 20 95 0 33 a m 3 and gac 22 62 0 91 a m 3 p 0 05 fig 2a furthermore cm t and cm a could obtain much higher ce 36 4 0 6 and 30 5 0 9 than those of cb and gac 23 8 0 4 and 21 6 1 0 p 0 05 fig 2a demonstrating superior energy conversion efficiency from organic degradation of weaved cm structure for the electrode morphology evaluation cm t had greater current density and ce than cm a fig 2a indicating the impact of flowing direction along the electrode surface on electrochemical performance polarization curves under these three resistances were shown in fig 2b to compare the maximum power density and indicate the electrochemical behavior of various anode material it should be noted that different from the traditional polarization curves with multiple data points under various resistances the polarization curve in this study was obtained after system stabilization for sufficiently long time to eliminate power overshoot 6 days under each resistance based on the previous study watson and logan 2011 it was indicated that cm t obtained higher power density under all resistance e g cm t at 1 43 w m 3 higher than other materials 0 9 w m 3 fig 2b further demonstrating better electrochemical behavior of 3d weaved cm as anode material for wastewater treatment performance gac obtained highest cod removal efficiency among all materials 75 1 3 8 under resistance at 1 ω this indicated its strong ability on organic degradation fig 2c while removal efficiencies of cm t and cm a were only at 61 5 3 1 and 54 4 0 9 respectively significantly lower than gac due to their low anodic biomass density discussed in section 3 4 however associated with higher ce and lower cod reduction cm embodied its advantage on harvesting electrical energy since low resistance 1 ω could simultaneously achieve better current generation and organic degradation fig 2a c the following analysis for anode characterization and performance explanation would be needed based on high current situation due to its higher practical value in wastewater treatment performance and electrode comparison for the electrochemical evaluation comparison with other mfc studies under similar anode volume is appropriate standard to indicate the application value of cm entity material since system volume greatly affected current output of electrochemical system ge et al 2014 lu and ren 2016 current density could be used to compare the electrochemical performance some other mfc studies used cb or gac as the anode material anode volume 4 l to treat the domestic wastewater and the current density was about 9 15 a m 3 anode volume zhang et al 2013 li et al 2013 which was lower than that of cm t in this study another study used thick carbon yarn woven on stainless steel mesh for greater surface area anode volume 0 7 l and the maximum current density was 43 21 a m 3 anode volume sonawane et al 2014 though various operating conditions were highly possible to affect the system performance e g anolyte composition difference comparative current output still indicated the satisfactory electrochemical performance of cm t as mfc anode more comparison details were shown in supplementary information table s2 3 2 charge transfer improvement by 3d weaved cm cm electrode entity could greatly reduce the charge transfer resistance of mfc system and eis was applied to measure and determine the resistance of various anodes the nyquist plot derived by eis was shown in fig 3 a to indicate the resistance distribution of all mfcs when achieving stable performance after sludge inoculation another nyquist plot for all anode materials before sludge inoculation was shown in fig s6 the final result of resistance distribution was shown in fig 3b without sludge inoculation gac possessed outstanding conductivity due to lower charge transfer resistance rcr 6 54 ω than other anodes without bacterial inoculation rcr 18 27 ω mainly due to higher filling proportion of electrode in the anode chamber 55 than others 4 with high surface area in the anode chamber to easily contact the electron donor in the anode chamber for electron conduction also it should be noted that ohmic resistance of all reactors were similar 1 3 ω indicating the similar configuration of all mfc reactors e g electrode distance distance between geometric center of anode and cathode electrode and solution conductivity 1 7 2 0 ms cm 1 he and mansfeld 2009 zhang et al 2016 however after sufficient mfc acclimatization for two weeks under 1 ω charge transfer resistances of cm t and cm a were greatly reduced to 2 5 ω and 3 2 ω respectively which were significantly lower than cb and gac 16 2 ω and 4 9 ω fig 3b after sludge inoculation anodic electricigens would attach on the electrode and form conductive biofilm to degrade organic and transfer electrons thus electrogenic biofilm on the electrode surface could serve anodic biocatalyst to reduce system resistance and promote current generation electrode morphology is proposed to significantly affect the biomass growth and electron transfer performance as an intact electrode plane 3d weaved cm structure could serve as compatible supporting material for microbial growth and facilitate the direct electron conduction to the external circuit however gac had drawbacks of massive gaps among gac particles to enhance electron conduction difficulty e g adjacent carbon particle better within 5 nm ali et al 2019 compared between cb and cm morphology conductive surface of cb formed as the shape of multiple lines i e carbon fibers tended to aggregate together in the flow media biomass would easily grow surrounding the carbon fibers and the biomass cluster would retard mass transfer from outside to inside of cb specifically biomass on the outside edge of cb was easier to contact and degrade substrate and they tended to collect and clog together against mass transfer thus inner parts of cb were hard to contact substrate i e inner carbon fibers closed to the titanium bar also the compact fiber aggregation of cb limited space for biofilm formation thus limited biomass grew in the inner parts and surface area of cb was not fully used for biomass growth on the contrary cm electrode entity have multiple plane surfaces connected together facilitating the intact biofilm formation along the electrode surface each cm piece was conductive plane i e carbon fiber weaved and contacted tightly together in the plane surface to easily transfer the generated electrons from attached biofilm out to the external circuit also the space between each cm piece from downside to upside was enough 1 cm in this study to allow enough mass transfer towards anodic biofilm to be accepted and give more space for biofilm formation than cb thus cm entity could solve biofilm clogging problem for higher mass transfer efficiency and more space for biofilm formation further discussed in section 3 4 and 3 5 2 furthermore 3d weaved cm in this study had a cm plane attached on cem fig 1c to greatly reduce the electrode distance for easier electron conduction environment than cb thus 3d weaved cm structure had much lower system resistance than other anode chambers filled with gac or inserted with cb interestingly the assembling direction of electrode planes in 3d weaved cm structure also affected the electrochemical performance cm t had lower charge transfer resistance at 2 5 ω than cm a at 3 2 ω fig 3b leading to better electrochemical performance e g higher maximum power density current generation this is possible due to better hydraulic condition and substrate diffusion with anolyte going through cm for anode biofilm to uptake also gravitational settling effect was reported to benefit suspended inocula to deposit on the horizontal electrode surface and accelerate the mfc biofilm formation for greater electricity generation li et al 2017b thus this discovery suggested that 3d weaved cm electrode assembly should constructed with more horizontal extension planes for current generation in mfc anode chamber 3 3 ionic migration measurement and analysis 3d weaved cm structure could also give stronger electrochemical driving force for ionic migration into the cathode than traditional materials conductivity could be used to indicate the ionic migration rate and cm t and cm a could obtain cathodic conductivity accumulation rate at 66 7 2 9 and 53 5 2 0 ms cm 1 m 2 d 1 respectively significantly higher than cb and gac at 33 3 2 4 and 47 8 3 6 ms cm 1 m 2 d 1 p 0 05 fig 4 a which was mainly due to stronger current density produced by 3d weaved cm structure for specific ionic migration efficiency nh4 n the potential recoverable resource for agricultural production is important to be targeted to evaluate the application value of the 3d weaved cm structure cm t and cm a had greater nh4 n migration rates at 1 7 0 2 and 1 3 0 1 g m 2 d 1 respectively than cb and gac 0 6 0 1 and 0 9 0 1 g m 2 d 1 p 0 05 fig 4 indicating the importance of anodic material design on increasing the resource recovery comparison of various ionic migration behavior indicated material impact on mfc performance compared with cb and gac cm t had greater cation migration ability for all detected cations in this study e g cathodic accumulation rate of na in cm t at 37 0 0 8 mmol l 1 d 1 significantly higher than other materials p 0 05 table 1 further indicating the beneficial effect of 3d weaved cm electrode on ionic migration over gac it was reported that electric double layer edl in porous media e g gac could serve as expressway for ionic migration due to high surface conductivity bian et al 2015 but the high biomass content of gac in this study might block the mesopore micropore of gac to prevent the ionic migration through edl pathway han et al 2014 on the contrary conductive planes of 3d weaved cm entity could serve as guideline for ionic migration along electrode water interface towards ionic exchange membrane with little blocking effect high ionic migration efficiency indicated high potential for resource recovery and nh4 n would be promising option however competitive ionic migration occurred among various cations including k na ca2 and mg2 for mfc equipped with cm t with highest ionic migration rate cation accumulation in cathode showed na 42 5 k 31 4 nh4 8 7 ca2 mg2 2 0 2 5 fig 4b indicating the competitive ionic migration relationship especially the suppression of k and na against nh4 migration this phenomenon fit the cathodic accumulation condition in previous studies chen et al 2015 if needed to intensify nh4 migration rate of cm t to benefit following resource recovery suitable method to decrease k na competition against nh4 migration is needed to enhance nh4 migration cathodic aeration is suitable method to consistently collect the cathodic volatile nh4 and keep low cathodic nh4 concentration for high nh4 concentration gradient to maintain high nh4 migration rate from anode to cathode qin et al 2017 which could warrant further investigation 3 4 biofilm electron transfer assessment sem images were taken to embody the biofilm formation on electrode surface and sem images were shown in fig 5 with x 5000 and x500 magnification biofilm formation and aggregation were clearly indicated to cover the carbon electrode surface in x5000 images fig 5a to d it was clear that the electrode biofilm was mainly composed of rod shape likely as geobacter spherical and filamentous microorganism likely as methanogen especially gac surface was fully covered with dense biofilm associated with massive rod shape bacteria attached on activated carbon particle conforming to geobacter morphology fig 5b microbial analysis shown in section 3 5 other carbon materials however still had large smooth surface area with little bacterial coverage based on sem image of x500 magnification fig 5e to h large remaining smooth surface for bacterial attachment of weaved cm electrode fig 5g and h indicated the high potential to have more bacterial coverage and further electrochemical improvement in the long term operation protein and atp concentrations were measured to determine biomass content to assist the anode evaluation gac had the highest volumetric biomass content at 10 94 g l 1 fig 5a due to its higher electrode filling proportion in anode chamber and larger specific surface area than other material gac 247 59 m2 g 1 cb 8 01 m2 g 1 and cm 2 19 m2 g 1 based on bet measurement also total bacterial activities on gac and cb electrode were significantly higher than other anode materials atp concentration of gac and cb at 2 02 and 0 52 μmol l 1 respectively significantly higher than other anodes 0 07 0 12 μmol l 1 p 0 05 fig 6 a indicating beneficial role of gac or cb to make appropriate living environment for bacterial metabolism and resulting in higher cod removal efficiency of gac and cb than cm fig 2c thus high wastewater treatment efficiency in mfc was significantly attributed to sufficient supporting surface area for bacterial attachment and growth however the sufficient electrode area and biomass content does not necessarily guarantee high electron transferring efficiency gac only obtained electron transferring rate per unit biomass at 0 003 0 001 mol g protein 1 d 1 much lower than both cm at 0 011 0 012 mol g protein 1 d 1 fig 6b the low electron transfer efficiency of gac confirmed the previous eis result demonstrating the negative effect of dispersed electrode particles on electron conduction this was mainly due to breaking points between each activated carbon particle on electron conduction on the contrary planar weaved cm electrode could solve the problem by assembling all cm planes together as an entity to facilitate electron conduction to external circuit while the high organic degradation efficiency could still be maintained also compared cb and cm t though cb had higher surface area than cm t the volumetric biomass density of cb 2 29 0 65 g l 1 anode volume was lower than cm t fig 6a proving the previous proposition section 3 2 that cb had clogging problem to inhibit biomass growth in the inner parts of cb and the electrode surface area was not fully used 3 5 microbial community regulated by 3d cm 3 5 1 microbial community structure change illumina sequencing and qpcr were processed to give comprehensive analysis of microbial community to indicate the impact of material difference on electrochemical performance of all reactors sequencing data quality could be assured based on rarefaction curve reaching the plateau based on 97 similarity indicating that nearly all species of the microbial communities were covered from the illumina sequencing fig s7 alpha analysis was processed for microbial samples to indicate their comparative relationship each sample community obtained 1230 2177 operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance chao1 indicates the species richness of microbial species of each sample and higher value of chao1 for electrode samples versus supernatant e g cbe at 2455 2 vs cbs at 2257 8 table s3 indicated the contribution of attached biofilm growth on enhancing species richness shannon index could indicate the relative abundance and evenness of the biofilm community shehab et al 2013 lower shannon index of cm a and cm t e g cmte at 6 07 vs gace at 7 16 table s3 indicated the lower microbial diversity of cm biofilm community likely attributed to limited electrode surface of 3d weaved cm to restrict the biofilm growth and acclimation community structure of the electrode and supernatant samples could be reflected by relative abundance comparison at various levels based on the sequencing analysis result especially for understanding the microbial growth and inhabitation of electricigens and methanogens totally top 25 otus in 8 major phyla were detected to account for 31 53 and 45 71 of the total relative abundance in the biofilm and suspended communities respectively shown in the heatmap fig s8 of all detected species two key groups were mainly targeted to directly indicate the performance of electron transfer and sink from organic degradation in the mfc reactor liu et al 2018 malvankar et al 2012 electricigens geobacter in this study primarily responsible for the electricity generation in mfc methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium in this study major methane producers to direct the electrons to co2 h2 to form methane instead of electron acceptor liu et al 2018 significantly higher relative abundance of electricigens and methanogens were detected on the electrode biofilm rather than supernatant indicating their preference to grow and perform in attached biofilm fig 7 a since electrode biofilm had much higher abundance of key microbes and biomass accumulation than supernatant elaborate community analysis on the biofilm would be shown in the following content relative abundance comparison of electricigens and methanogens was important to characterize microbial electrochemical properties and genus level would have relatively high selectivity for community analysis the relative abundance of geobacter on the gac electrode was 25 4 much higher than cb 6 0 cm t 16 8 and cm a 4 7 fig 7a it was reported that activated carbon particle could greatly facilitate the enrichment of geobacter on the attached biomass because activated carbon particle could provide great attachment space and serve as conductive intermediate for geobacter to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer process diet for greater biomass growth lee et al 2016 however unexpectedly the electron transfer rate per unit biomass of gac was much lower than those of cb cmt and cma fig 5b indicating that most geobacter might functioned poorly to transfer electrons in gac two reasons could explain the poor functions in the gac anode the first reason was possible due to the competition with methanogens for acetate due to higher relative abundance of methanogens on gac electrode 3 2 including methanosaeta and methanobacterium than those of cmt and cma 1 3 and 0 8 fig 7a it was previously reported that gac could serve as conductive pathway to substitute the microbial secreted protein related to electron transfer and diet was greatly strengthened to stimulate methanogen to increase methane production liu et al 2012 methanosaeta was reported to be more active to accept electrons from geobacter via gac for methanogenesis park et al 2018 thus the diet syntrophy between geobacter and methanogens was triggered in gac environment and methanogenic activity was boosted to compete with anode electrode to accept electrons though the relative abundance of methanogen on the electrode surface was only at 3 2 the low methanogen proportion still had non ignorable capability to compete for electrons against the electrode material liu et al 2016 lu et al 2019 also suspended methanogen could contribute to methane production for the electron competition not accounted in the relative abundance on the electrode surface fig 7a thus higher relative abundance of methanogen in gac anode than that in cm anode led to more severe electron bifurcation to inhibit the current generation furthermore higher abundance of methylotrophs mainly methylobacillus in gac 1 3 in gac versus 0 05 in cmt cma indicated the higher conversion potential from methane to methanol further confirming the higher methane content in gac myung et al 2018 the second reason was possibly related to the excessive biomass formation or content to construct complex microbial community to weaken capability of geobacter to utilize acetate sasaki et al 2019 though without biofilm thickness measurement higher volumetric biomass content almost more than two times greater than cmt and community richness of gac fig 4a and table s3 indicated that the biofilm thickness would be evident and even excessive the electron transferring process was retarded due to substrate diffusion resistance high biofilm thickness and impaired electrochemical activity already dead inner core biofilm sun et al 2015 thus though with high geobacter abundance gac packing anode on the contrary still faced problems on electron transferring and electricity generation 3 5 2 geobacter methanogen ratio to indicate electrogenic activity fish technique can be applied to target specific microbial species of interest and give information about relative abundance of geobacter and methanogens based on fluorescence intensity the fluorescence intensity ratio of geobacter over methanogen could generally reflect the biofilm composition on specific anode surface to reflect the impact of anode material on electrogenic activity fish images taken from gac and cm t were shown in figs s9a and s9b indicating that fluorescence intensity ratio of geobacter green versus methanogens blue on cm t was greater than that from gac combining all fish images from each anode material ten spots taken from electrode surface the fluorescence intensity ratio was shown in table 2 cm t and cm a had greater intensity ratio than gac confirming that 3d weaved cm electrode entity had appropriate electrochemical environment to benefit the growth of electricigens qpcr result further confirmed the collected data and derived conclusion from fish and even could give more accurately quantitative result with absolute abundance of targeted species in the reactor this study targeted for the abundance comparison of key species geobacter and three methanogens based on the gene copy number per unit gram anode biomass hiegemann et al 2016 and the result could directly reflect the potential of electricity generation and methane generation it was surprisingly discovered that cmt and cma had significantly higher gene copy number of geobacter 5 15 x 108 9 29 107 and 3 23 x 108 5 24 107 gene copies g 1 collected biomass than that in cb and gac 2 79 x 108 2 38 107 and 2 19 x 108 4 51 x 107 gene copies g 1 fig 7b higher geobacter gene copy abundance of cm than cb further proved the previous proposition section 3 2 that limitation of growth space and mass transfer of cb led to lower utilization efficiency of the surface area to grow geobacter and cm could reflect its advantage of more space for biomass growth 3d weaved cm structure had advantages to create favorable electron transferring environment by connecting all conductive extension face together and the geobacter growth could be stimulated and enhanced it also should be noticed that gene copy number of all targeted methanogens was also significantly higher in cmt cma and cb e g for methanosarcinaceae 2 63 x 108 3 57 106 1 18 x 108 1 27 107 and 2 05 x 108 6 92 106 gene copies g 1 for cmt cma and cb respectively than that of gac 1 89 x 107 2 27 106 gene copies g 1 p 0 05 fig 7b cm entity not only gave favorable environment for electricigen but also created pathways for diet from electricigen to methanogens to stimulate the methanogen growth and activity not only gac but also the 3d weaved cm structure could serve as conductive intact electrode assembly to assist all attached geobacter and methanogens on diet and their abundance was greatly enhanced the increase of methanogens could reflect the higher potential of methane production from higher organic removal efficiency confirming higher organic removal efficiency fig 2c on the contrary though as well known conductive material to facilitate diet minimal size of gac particle makes huge barrier to realize the electron conduction among all attached biofilm when packed together inside the anode chamber thus 3d weaved cm electrode assembly successfully combined all available conducting pathways to facilitate electron harvesting and transportation 3 6 economic perspective cost effectiveness of all anode materials was important parameter to compare the application value and assist the material determination for better anode performance cost efficiency was calculated based on the daily energy generation in a 6 day continuous experimental period divided by the total anode electrode material cost assuming the same price for other anode components quantified using numerical standard kj 1 day 1 based on the previous study yuan et al 2016 the calculation process of total anode electrode material cost was detailed in supplementary information the calculation result of cost efficiency was shown in fig 8 cm t and cm a could achieve the daily energy output per unit cost of anode construction at 0 089 and 0 050 kj 1 day 1 respectively which was nearly more than 10 times and 6 times of the economic value of gac at 0 008 kj 1 day 1 detailed calculation process is described in supplementary information the great improvement of energy recovery achieved by 3d weaved cm electrode suggested that the anode could be extended for 3d electrode entity construction to maximize electron harvesting instead of only focusing surface area and electrochemical reactivity furthermore anodic weight could be greatly reduced e g gac weighed at 2 42 kg reduced to cm t at 0 06 kg by about 40 times the discovery from this study gave insights that scaled up bes could adopt similar 3d anodic structure as entity to reduce the material weight and optimize capital cost 4 conclusions this study adopted an innovative 3d weaved cm network to overcome the drawbacks of traditional material e g cb and gac lower internal resistance of cm electrode indicated the beneficial effect of 3d electrode composite on electron transfer and organic degradation though biomass accumulation was greater in gac the hydraulic clogging and contacting difficulty limited mass transfer and electron conduction while 3d weaved cm electrode could solve the problem microbial community analysis showed the beneficial effect of 3d weaved cm electrode to enhance geobacter and methanogenic population indicating promoting effect of cm network to stimulate the electrogenic growth and activity higher cost efficiency further proved the practical value of 3d weaved cm thus 3d weaved cm network initiated a new concept as combining all single unit electrode material pieces together as electrical network to improve electron transfer and increase cost efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18151,bioelectrochemical system bes is promising technology to simultaneously treat wastewater and recover energy and electrode material is important for the system performance microbial fuel cell mfc is one of typical bes to be applied in wastewater treatment how to improve the electrode material is significant to improve wastewater treatment energy recovery and cost effectiveness in this study 3d weaved carbon electrode entity assembled by multiple pieces of carbon mesh cm was proposed to combine all electrode components as entity to facilitate electron conduction and ionic migration compared with carbon brush cb and granular activated carbon gac the result showed that current density and internal resistance of mfc using 3d weaved cm as horizontally extended inside anode cm t were 30 9 a m 3 and 4 5 ω respectively with higher output than traditional gac 22 6 a m 3 and 6 2 ω though gac had greater electrode filling and surface area for biomass growth the electron transfer efficiency per unit electrode biomass was only at 0 0019 0 0002 mol g 1 d 1 much lower than cm t at 0 0077 0 0009 mol g 1 day 1 higher ionic migration rate of cm t suggested the assisting effect of composite electrode to enhance ionic transportation towards the cathode microbial analysis further indicated that 3d cm electrode network could simultaneously enhance geobacter abundance and methanogen activity suggesting the importance of electrode network on electricigens furthermore cm t could obtain 10 times higher energy output efficiency than traditional gac when applied inside anode chamber this study proved that network construction of anode electrode could promote the electrode performance and cost effectiveness suggesting the future development of reactor design of bioelectrochemical system graphical abstract image 1 keywords bioelectrochemical system 3d electrode network carbon mesh electron transfer efficiency cost effectiveness 1 introduction with global population explosion energy demand becomes higher sustainable energy recovery for waste conversion to available energy is important to solve the above problem for wastewater treatment bioelectrochemical system bes is an effective technology to make advantage of microorganisms to convert the chemical energy stored in the organic pollutant to electricity logan et al 2006 slate et al 2019 microbial fuel cell mfc is typical bes to be applied and electrode material and configuration play key roles on microbial growth and electron transfer appropriate electrode modification will benefit organic transportation to enhance microbial activity and facilitate electron harvesting for higher electricity generation furthermore electrodes contribute to large amount of total capital cost of bes and suitable electrode modification will reduce cost to increase practical application value in real world do et al 2018 thus how to enhance electrode performance warrants massive research to improve anode electrode is key component for the above functions in the bes because of its significance to support microbial growth for organic degradation and provide conductive network to transfer electrons to external circuit at present carbon based electrodes were commonly used due to its light weight good conductivity and biocompatibility for microbial adhesion and electricity generation li et al 2017a high porosity and surface area would be important parameters for biofilm formation and active sites for electrochemical reaction sonawane et al 2017 three dimensional 3d anodic morphology would be useful to guarantee the above parameters in satisfactory condition liu et al 2010 however currently the practical application of carbon based electrodes still faced challenges due to its high capital cost especially when applied in large scale context do et al 2018 thus further 3d anode modification and comparison are needed for better carbon based material most 3d carbon based electrode modification was processed by adding conductive coatings or changing morphology on the electrode surface itself to increase space for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation such as graphene and carbon nanotube cnt based on about half of total papers related to carbonaceous material in fuel cell application do et al 2018 cornejo et al 2015 you and kamarudin 2017 another typical 3d anode material is carbon brush cb which could assist enhanced biofilm growth brush fiber and electron conducting out process titanium bar kang et al 2017 hutchinson et al 2011 however cb still has its own limit its void space among brush fibers especially near the fiber edges would reduce available space for microbial colonization zhang et al 2013 lower electrode filling proportion in anode chamber would limit biomass content in cb anode and the organic degradation efficiency would also be reduced liao et al 2015 furthermore cb has high cost to limit the application value mainly attributed to titanium wire bian et al 2018 thus new material type and electrode structure are needed to solve the above problems another electrode material granular activated carbon gac could greatly reduce the electrode price compared to the conventional cb cb at 21 43 kg 1 vs gac at 0 07 0 14 kg 1 wei et al 2011 also gac could increase the ratio of electrode surface area versus reactor volume to increase biomass content in the anode and further improve hydraulic flow condition for higher bacterial affinity with substrate sonawane et al 2017 zhao et al 2016 however gac packing anode has difficulty on electron conduction to external circuit due to contacting difficulty to conduct electrons based on limited particle size liu et al 2014 also excessive attached biofilm growth on gac would lead to clogging problem to retard mass transfer inside the gac packing anode jung et al 2018 sun et al 2016 furthermore current collector such as titanium mesh was needed inside gac packed anode chamber to conduct electrons out liu et al 2019 and the practical problem might become more severe due to high cost in scale up reactor zhang and angelidaki 2016 thus the anode configuration and material need further improvement on electrical conduction and cost effectiveness new electrode material combining three main functions together would be good solution including feasible electron transferring process high biocompatibility and non clogging process advantage combination of cb and gac would be effective strategy and carbon mesh cm made of weaved carbon fibers is a promising electrode candidate to satisfy the above demands based on its high conductivity and integration flexibility by weaving together as 3d electrode network the objective of this study was to construct weaved cm network electrode in mfc anode and compare with traditional anode material e g cb gac besides cm structure would be applied as two different morphologies with anolyte flowing through and along the cm surface i e cm t and cm a all system performance was compared based on their electrochemical performance anodic surface characterization microbial community and cost efficiency to evaluate the practical values of the new electrode morphology 2 materials and methods 2 1 mfc configuration and construction each mfc reactor was constructed with one anode and one cathode side by side separated by a cation exchange membrane cem with surface area at 156 cm2 dimension 26 cm 6 cm the anode had empty volume at 1560 ml dimension 26 cm 6 cm x 10 cm and all four mfc anodes were constructed with various materials the first mfc anode was installed with six cbs height 26 cm diameter 3 cm from haote new material inc wuhan china with stainless steel bar to support and connect outside the second mfc anode was fully filled with gac diameter 1 5 mm length 3 5 mm using two titanium meshes and one titanium sheet to connect the external circuit the third and fourth mfc anodes were all equipped with 3d weaved cm 3k cross lamination but the anode structure was differently designed one cm piece size 26 cm 6 cm was set as base layer to adhere on one side of cem facing anode in the third mfc anode each short edge of 26 cm pieces size of each cm 6 cm 10 cm was weaved on the cm base layer and these were extended out horizontally as multiple extension layers which enabled wastewater to flow up from bottom through all cms to the anode outlet cm t fig 1 the fourth anode was assembled with 6 cm pieces size of each cm 26 cm 10 cm but differently each long edge of cm piece was weaved on the cm based vertically as multiple extension layers to allow anolyte to flow up along all surfaces of cm cm a instead of crossing through fig 1 each piece of cm had a 10 cm long extension layers inside the anode chamber and the edge was attached on the inner surface of the anode chamber to be stabilized in the media the total electrode surface area of cm t and cm a was the same each cathode chamber had volume at 468 ml dimension 26 cm 6 cm x 3 cm fully filled with gac as cathode material using stainless steel mesh as current collector since the anode and cathode material was nearly uniformly distributed in the anode and cathode chamber the average electrode distance could be perceived as 6 5 cm mfc construction and operation schematic using cm t and anodic structure details of cm t and cm a were all shown in fig 1a c mfc anode using cb and gac were shown in figs s1 and s2 supplementary information 2 2 mfc start up and operation all anodes were inoculated with anaerobic sludge already cultivated for three months mixed liquid suspended solid mlss 2 98 0 15 g l 1 originally obtained from the origin water company beijing china and fed with synthetic wastewater for one month to achieve steady microbial community in the anode it should be noted that this study was to compare all electrodes on electron transferring efficiency to validate the feasibility of cm electrode application as mfc anode and thus other operating condition such as anolyte composition should be kept the same to feed all reactors the composition of synthetic anolyte was made with tap water supplemented with the following component per liter water ch3coona 0 64 g

2 6 ms cm 1 conductivity and ph at 6 9 7 0 the anolyte was fed into each mfc anode in continuous mode at rate of 2 17 ml min 1 anodic hrt at 12 h fig 1a which was controlled by a peristaltic pump senz 310ht shenzhen china the catholyte in each mfc was operated in batch mode with circulation rate at 80 ml min 1 controlled by another peristaltic pump the catholyte was composed of 16 46 g l 1 k3 fe cn 6 as electron acceptor and 10 mm phosphate buffer saline pbs 0 73 g l 1 k2hpo4 3h2o and 0 94 g l 1 kh2po4 as ph buffer with conductivity at 16 35 ms cm 1 and ph at 7 7 7 8 all catholyte was completely refreshed once every two days to maintain good catholyte condition with high conductivity and stable ph to remove the cathode interference on mfc performance to comprehensively analyze the electrochemical performance of various anode material during wastewater treatment the experiment was designed with various external resistances to connect the anode and cathode of each mfc including 1 10 and 100 ω this was to compare anode electrochemical performance under various current output each mfc anode under certain resistance was operated for at least a week to achieve stable performance for current generation measurement 2 3 measurement and analysis 2 3 1 water quality measurement cod in anodic effluent and nh4 n in both anode and cathode effluent were measured by colorimetric method 5b 3c linahua china based on previous research liu et al 2019 conductivity in anolyte and catholyte was measured by conductivity meter inlab 731 mettler toledo usa to evaluate the ionic migration cation concentrations in catholyte were measured by ionic chromatograph ics 200 dionex us equipped with cs 16 and a csrs 300 suppressor for cation measurement cathodic ammonium accumulation and conductivity increasing rate could be calculated to indicate the ionic migration rate from the anode to the cathode 2 3 2 electrochemical analysis during steady operation under each resistance the voltage of each mfc was monitored every 15 min by an automated voltage acquisition system daq2213 adlink china for six continuous days electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis was also operated before inoculation and after steady performance to assess the resistance distribution of each entire mfc with working electrode anode material counter electrode cathode material and reference electrode ag agcl 0 201 v vs standard hydrogen electrode she and scanning frequency from 105 to 10 2 hz by a potentialstat autolab metrohm switzerland ohmic and charge transfer resistance were derived from x axis intersection and diameter of semi circle by fitting the nyquist plot of an equivalent circuit respectively bian et al 2018 equivalent circuit including components of ohmic and charge transfer resistance was applied and the details of equivalent circuit was shown in fig s3 supplementary information polarization curve was determined only for resistance at 100 10 and 1 ω and each resistance was operated for at least 6 days to achieve stable performance for data collection mentioned above and power density determination based on previous study watson and logan 2011 coulombic efficiencies ce were also calculated to indicate the organic conversion efficiency to electricity based on previous studies liu et al 2019 2 3 3 anodic biomass characterization after finishing all system operation electrode materials of all mfc anodes were obtained by cutting off the anode material for following surface characterization and biomass analysis scanning electron microscopy imaging sem zeiss germany was processed to characterize the anodic surface for biofilm formation protein concentration of electrode biofilm was measured by coomassie brilliant blue method to quantitate the biomass content while atp measurement was processed by atp assay kit to determine the biofilm activity and microbial metabolism promega wi us volumetric protein g l 1 and atp density μmol l 1 of entire anode chamber were derived from the protein and atp amount of the tested material samples multiplied by the weight ratio of entire anodic material versus tested sample each parameter was measured with triplicate samples for data assurance and statistical analysis detailed information was described in the supplementary information 2 4 microbial community characterization 2 4 1 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish to explain the reason for the difference of electrochemical performance microbial community played important role on organic degradation and electrochemical activity the relative abundance of geobacter over methanogens could reflect the electrochemical property in microbiological angle since geobacter is often predominant organism on the anodes due to its high power output nevin et al 2008 jothinathan et al 2018 fish was processed to determine their relative activity and the procedures were based on the previous study wang et al 2016 specific probes for g sulfurreducens and methanogens species were geo2 and s darch 0872 a a 18 respectively based on previous studies rotaru et al 2012 raghoebarsing et al 2006 after sufficient probe hybridization a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm leica us was used for image acquisition and fluorescence intensity quantification to characterize the relative activity of geobacter and methanogens detailed information was given in supplementary information 2 5 dna extraction and sequencing analysis the electrode biofilm and supernatant samples were harvested for dna extraction after three month continuous operation after completing dna extraction purification and pcr amplification illuminahiseq2500 platform was applied to construct the sequencing library and usearch software and silva database were used to annotate the library taxanomy yuan et al 2017 rarefaction curve was made for quality control and α diversity was also calculated for basic community characterization detailed procedures for dna extraction quality control following purification and sequencing analysis were stated in supplementary information 2 5 1 quantitative real time pcr analysis qpcr qpcr was processed to quantify electrigens geobacter and methanogens including aceticlastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogen by using applied biosystems steponeplus real time system the primers were designed to target for microbes with significant functions including aceticlastic methanogenic archaea methanosarcinaceae and methanosaetaceae hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea methanobacteriales and crucial electricigens geobacter chae et al 2010 the details for primer sets qpcr mixture solution component and program setting were shown in supplementary information table s1 3 result and discussion 3 1 electrode performance comparison cm t had higher current density and ce than other materials and the difference was greater under lower external resistance the average current and ce result under various external resistance were shown in fig 2 a open circuit voltage after bacterial inoculation and six day current profile under 1 ω was shown in figs s4 and s5 the stable profile of open circuit voltage and current generation indicated that all mfc anodes were completely acclimatized it should be noted that the following current density was normalized by the anode volume a m 3 under high resistance at 100 ω current density of cm t was at 2 74 0 03 a m 3 though with higher current generation than traditional cb 1 86 0 02 a m 3 and gac 2 22 0 02 a m 3 cm did not show apparent electrochemical advantages under high resistance fig 2a on the contrary with decreasing resistance to 1 ω cm showed significantly better electrochemical performance for example cm t and cm a achieved the current density at 31 16 0 70 a m 3 and 23 41 0 69 a m 3 at 1 ω both significantly higher than cb 20 95 0 33 a m 3 and gac 22 62 0 91 a m 3 p 0 05 fig 2a furthermore cm t and cm a could obtain much higher ce 36 4 0 6 and 30 5 0 9 than those of cb and gac 23 8 0 4 and 21 6 1 0 p 0 05 fig 2a demonstrating superior energy conversion efficiency from organic degradation of weaved cm structure for the electrode morphology evaluation cm t had greater current density and ce than cm a fig 2a indicating the impact of flowing direction along the electrode surface on electrochemical performance polarization curves under these three resistances were shown in fig 2b to compare the maximum power density and indicate the electrochemical behavior of various anode material it should be noted that different from the traditional polarization curves with multiple data points under various resistances the polarization curve in this study was obtained after system stabilization for sufficiently long time to eliminate power overshoot 6 days under each resistance based on the previous study watson and logan 2011 it was indicated that cm t obtained higher power density under all resistance e g cm t at 1 43 w m 3 higher than other materials 0 9 w m 3 fig 2b further demonstrating better electrochemical behavior of 3d weaved cm as anode material for wastewater treatment performance gac obtained highest cod removal efficiency among all materials 75 1 3 8 under resistance at 1 ω this indicated its strong ability on organic degradation fig 2c while removal efficiencies of cm t and cm a were only at 61 5 3 1 and 54 4 0 9 respectively significantly lower than gac due to their low anodic biomass density discussed in section 3 4 however associated with higher ce and lower cod reduction cm embodied its advantage on harvesting electrical energy since low resistance 1 ω could simultaneously achieve better current generation and organic degradation fig 2a c the following analysis for anode characterization and performance explanation would be needed based on high current situation due to its higher practical value in wastewater treatment performance and electrode comparison for the electrochemical evaluation comparison with other mfc studies under similar anode volume is appropriate standard to indicate the application value of cm entity material since system volume greatly affected current output of electrochemical system ge et al 2014 lu and ren 2016 current density could be used to compare the electrochemical performance some other mfc studies used cb or gac as the anode material anode volume 4 l to treat the domestic wastewater and the current density was about 9 15 a m 3 anode volume zhang et al 2013 li et al 2013 which was lower than that of cm t in this study another study used thick carbon yarn woven on stainless steel mesh for greater surface area anode volume 0 7 l and the maximum current density was 43 21 a m 3 anode volume sonawane et al 2014 though various operating conditions were highly possible to affect the system performance e g anolyte composition difference comparative current output still indicated the satisfactory electrochemical performance of cm t as mfc anode more comparison details were shown in supplementary information table s2 3 2 charge transfer improvement by 3d weaved cm cm electrode entity could greatly reduce the charge transfer resistance of mfc system and eis was applied to measure and determine the resistance of various anodes the nyquist plot derived by eis was shown in fig 3 a to indicate the resistance distribution of all mfcs when achieving stable performance after sludge inoculation another nyquist plot for all anode materials before sludge inoculation was shown in fig s6 the final result of resistance distribution was shown in fig 3b without sludge inoculation gac possessed outstanding conductivity due to lower charge transfer resistance rcr 6 54 ω than other anodes without bacterial inoculation rcr 18 27 ω mainly due to higher filling proportion of electrode in the anode chamber 55 than others 4 with high surface area in the anode chamber to easily contact the electron donor in the anode chamber for electron conduction also it should be noted that ohmic resistance of all reactors were similar 1 3 ω indicating the similar configuration of all mfc reactors e g electrode distance distance between geometric center of anode and cathode electrode and solution conductivity 1 7 2 0 ms cm 1 he and mansfeld 2009 zhang et al 2016 however after sufficient mfc acclimatization for two weeks under 1 ω charge transfer resistances of cm t and cm a were greatly reduced to 2 5 ω and 3 2 ω respectively which were significantly lower than cb and gac 16 2 ω and 4 9 ω fig 3b after sludge inoculation anodic electricigens would attach on the electrode and form conductive biofilm to degrade organic and transfer electrons thus electrogenic biofilm on the electrode surface could serve anodic biocatalyst to reduce system resistance and promote current generation electrode morphology is proposed to significantly affect the biomass growth and electron transfer performance as an intact electrode plane 3d weaved cm structure could serve as compatible supporting material for microbial growth and facilitate the direct electron conduction to the external circuit however gac had drawbacks of massive gaps among gac particles to enhance electron conduction difficulty e g adjacent carbon particle better within 5 nm ali et al 2019 compared between cb and cm morphology conductive surface of cb formed as the shape of multiple lines i e carbon fibers tended to aggregate together in the flow media biomass would easily grow surrounding the carbon fibers and the biomass cluster would retard mass transfer from outside to inside of cb specifically biomass on the outside edge of cb was easier to contact and degrade substrate and they tended to collect and clog together against mass transfer thus inner parts of cb were hard to contact substrate i e inner carbon fibers closed to the titanium bar also the compact fiber aggregation of cb limited space for biofilm formation thus limited biomass grew in the inner parts and surface area of cb was not fully used for biomass growth on the contrary cm electrode entity have multiple plane surfaces connected together facilitating the intact biofilm formation along the electrode surface each cm piece was conductive plane i e carbon fiber weaved and contacted tightly together in the plane surface to easily transfer the generated electrons from attached biofilm out to the external circuit also the space between each cm piece from downside to upside was enough 1 cm in this study to allow enough mass transfer towards anodic biofilm to be accepted and give more space for biofilm formation than cb thus cm entity could solve biofilm clogging problem for higher mass transfer efficiency and more space for biofilm formation further discussed in section 3 4 and 3 5 2 furthermore 3d weaved cm in this study had a cm plane attached on cem fig 1c to greatly reduce the electrode distance for easier electron conduction environment than cb thus 3d weaved cm structure had much lower system resistance than other anode chambers filled with gac or inserted with cb interestingly the assembling direction of electrode planes in 3d weaved cm structure also affected the electrochemical performance cm t had lower charge transfer resistance at 2 5 ω than cm a at 3 2 ω fig 3b leading to better electrochemical performance e g higher maximum power density current generation this is possible due to better hydraulic condition and substrate diffusion with anolyte going through cm for anode biofilm to uptake also gravitational settling effect was reported to benefit suspended inocula to deposit on the horizontal electrode surface and accelerate the mfc biofilm formation for greater electricity generation li et al 2017b thus this discovery suggested that 3d weaved cm electrode assembly should constructed with more horizontal extension planes for current generation in mfc anode chamber 3 3 ionic migration measurement and analysis 3d weaved cm structure could also give stronger electrochemical driving force for ionic migration into the cathode than traditional materials conductivity could be used to indicate the ionic migration rate and cm t and cm a could obtain cathodic conductivity accumulation rate at 66 7 2 9 and 53 5 2 0 ms cm 1 m 2 d 1 respectively significantly higher than cb and gac at 33 3 2 4 and 47 8 3 6 ms cm 1 m 2 d 1 p 0 05 fig 4 a which was mainly due to stronger current density produced by 3d weaved cm structure for specific ionic migration efficiency nh4 n the potential recoverable resource for agricultural production is important to be targeted to evaluate the application value of the 3d weaved cm structure cm t and cm a had greater nh4 n migration rates at 1 7 0 2 and 1 3 0 1 g m 2 d 1 respectively than cb and gac 0 6 0 1 and 0 9 0 1 g m 2 d 1 p 0 05 fig 4 indicating the importance of anodic material design on increasing the resource recovery comparison of various ionic migration behavior indicated material impact on mfc performance compared with cb and gac cm t had greater cation migration ability for all detected cations in this study e g cathodic accumulation rate of na in cm t at 37 0 0 8 mmol l 1 d 1 significantly higher than other materials p 0 05 table 1 further indicating the beneficial effect of 3d weaved cm electrode on ionic migration over gac it was reported that electric double layer edl in porous media e g gac could serve as expressway for ionic migration due to high surface conductivity bian et al 2015 but the high biomass content of gac in this study might block the mesopore micropore of gac to prevent the ionic migration through edl pathway han et al 2014 on the contrary conductive planes of 3d weaved cm entity could serve as guideline for ionic migration along electrode water interface towards ionic exchange membrane with little blocking effect high ionic migration efficiency indicated high potential for resource recovery and nh4 n would be promising option however competitive ionic migration occurred among various cations including k na ca2 and mg2 for mfc equipped with cm t with highest ionic migration rate cation accumulation in cathode showed na 42 5 k 31 4 nh4 8 7 ca2 mg2 2 0 2 5 fig 4b indicating the competitive ionic migration relationship especially the suppression of k and na against nh4 migration this phenomenon fit the cathodic accumulation condition in previous studies chen et al 2015 if needed to intensify nh4 migration rate of cm t to benefit following resource recovery suitable method to decrease k na competition against nh4 migration is needed to enhance nh4 migration cathodic aeration is suitable method to consistently collect the cathodic volatile nh4 and keep low cathodic nh4 concentration for high nh4 concentration gradient to maintain high nh4 migration rate from anode to cathode qin et al 2017 which could warrant further investigation 3 4 biofilm electron transfer assessment sem images were taken to embody the biofilm formation on electrode surface and sem images were shown in fig 5 with x 5000 and x500 magnification biofilm formation and aggregation were clearly indicated to cover the carbon electrode surface in x5000 images fig 5a to d it was clear that the electrode biofilm was mainly composed of rod shape likely as geobacter spherical and filamentous microorganism likely as methanogen especially gac surface was fully covered with dense biofilm associated with massive rod shape bacteria attached on activated carbon particle conforming to geobacter morphology fig 5b microbial analysis shown in section 3 5 other carbon materials however still had large smooth surface area with little bacterial coverage based on sem image of x500 magnification fig 5e to h large remaining smooth surface for bacterial attachment of weaved cm electrode fig 5g and h indicated the high potential to have more bacterial coverage and further electrochemical improvement in the long term operation protein and atp concentrations were measured to determine biomass content to assist the anode evaluation gac had the highest volumetric biomass content at 10 94 g l 1 fig 5a due to its higher electrode filling proportion in anode chamber and larger specific surface area than other material gac 247 59 m2 g 1 cb 8 01 m2 g 1 and cm 2 19 m2 g 1 based on bet measurement also total bacterial activities on gac and cb electrode were significantly higher than other anode materials atp concentration of gac and cb at 2 02 and 0 52 μmol l 1 respectively significantly higher than other anodes 0 07 0 12 μmol l 1 p 0 05 fig 6 a indicating beneficial role of gac or cb to make appropriate living environment for bacterial metabolism and resulting in higher cod removal efficiency of gac and cb than cm fig 2c thus high wastewater treatment efficiency in mfc was significantly attributed to sufficient supporting surface area for bacterial attachment and growth however the sufficient electrode area and biomass content does not necessarily guarantee high electron transferring efficiency gac only obtained electron transferring rate per unit biomass at 0 003 0 001 mol g protein 1 d 1 much lower than both cm at 0 011 0 012 mol g protein 1 d 1 fig 6b the low electron transfer efficiency of gac confirmed the previous eis result demonstrating the negative effect of dispersed electrode particles on electron conduction this was mainly due to breaking points between each activated carbon particle on electron conduction on the contrary planar weaved cm electrode could solve the problem by assembling all cm planes together as an entity to facilitate electron conduction to external circuit while the high organic degradation efficiency could still be maintained also compared cb and cm t though cb had higher surface area than cm t the volumetric biomass density of cb 2 29 0 65 g l 1 anode volume was lower than cm t fig 6a proving the previous proposition section 3 2 that cb had clogging problem to inhibit biomass growth in the inner parts of cb and the electrode surface area was not fully used 3 5 microbial community regulated by 3d cm 3 5 1 microbial community structure change illumina sequencing and qpcr were processed to give comprehensive analysis of microbial community to indicate the impact of material difference on electrochemical performance of all reactors sequencing data quality could be assured based on rarefaction curve reaching the plateau based on 97 similarity indicating that nearly all species of the microbial communities were covered from the illumina sequencing fig s7 alpha analysis was processed for microbial samples to indicate their comparative relationship each sample community obtained 1230 2177 operational taxonomic units otus at a 3 distance chao1 indicates the species richness of microbial species of each sample and higher value of chao1 for electrode samples versus supernatant e g cbe at 2455 2 vs cbs at 2257 8 table s3 indicated the contribution of attached biofilm growth on enhancing species richness shannon index could indicate the relative abundance and evenness of the biofilm community shehab et al 2013 lower shannon index of cm a and cm t e g cmte at 6 07 vs gace at 7 16 table s3 indicated the lower microbial diversity of cm biofilm community likely attributed to limited electrode surface of 3d weaved cm to restrict the biofilm growth and acclimation community structure of the electrode and supernatant samples could be reflected by relative abundance comparison at various levels based on the sequencing analysis result especially for understanding the microbial growth and inhabitation of electricigens and methanogens totally top 25 otus in 8 major phyla were detected to account for 31 53 and 45 71 of the total relative abundance in the biofilm and suspended communities respectively shown in the heatmap fig s8 of all detected species two key groups were mainly targeted to directly indicate the performance of electron transfer and sink from organic degradation in the mfc reactor liu et al 2018 malvankar et al 2012 electricigens geobacter in this study primarily responsible for the electricity generation in mfc methanogens methanosaeta and methanobacterium in this study major methane producers to direct the electrons to co2 h2 to form methane instead of electron acceptor liu et al 2018 significantly higher relative abundance of electricigens and methanogens were detected on the electrode biofilm rather than supernatant indicating their preference to grow and perform in attached biofilm fig 7 a since electrode biofilm had much higher abundance of key microbes and biomass accumulation than supernatant elaborate community analysis on the biofilm would be shown in the following content relative abundance comparison of electricigens and methanogens was important to characterize microbial electrochemical properties and genus level would have relatively high selectivity for community analysis the relative abundance of geobacter on the gac electrode was 25 4 much higher than cb 6 0 cm t 16 8 and cm a 4 7 fig 7a it was reported that activated carbon particle could greatly facilitate the enrichment of geobacter on the attached biomass because activated carbon particle could provide great attachment space and serve as conductive intermediate for geobacter to facilitate direct interspecies electron transfer process diet for greater biomass growth lee et al 2016 however unexpectedly the electron transfer rate per unit biomass of gac was much lower than those of cb cmt and cma fig 5b indicating that most geobacter might functioned poorly to transfer electrons in gac two reasons could explain the poor functions in the gac anode the first reason was possible due to the competition with methanogens for acetate due to higher relative abundance of methanogens on gac electrode 3 2 including methanosaeta and methanobacterium than those of cmt and cma 1 3 and 0 8 fig 7a it was previously reported that gac could serve as conductive pathway to substitute the microbial secreted protein related to electron transfer and diet was greatly strengthened to stimulate methanogen to increase methane production liu et al 2012 methanosaeta was reported to be more active to accept electrons from geobacter via gac for methanogenesis park et al 2018 thus the diet syntrophy between geobacter and methanogens was triggered in gac environment and methanogenic activity was boosted to compete with anode electrode to accept electrons though the relative abundance of methanogen on the electrode surface was only at 3 2 the low methanogen proportion still had non ignorable capability to compete for electrons against the electrode material liu et al 2016 lu et al 2019 also suspended methanogen could contribute to methane production for the electron competition not accounted in the relative abundance on the electrode surface fig 7a thus higher relative abundance of methanogen in gac anode than that in cm anode led to more severe electron bifurcation to inhibit the current generation furthermore higher abundance of methylotrophs mainly methylobacillus in gac 1 3 in gac versus 0 05 in cmt cma indicated the higher conversion potential from methane to methanol further confirming the higher methane content in gac myung et al 2018 the second reason was possibly related to the excessive biomass formation or content to construct complex microbial community to weaken capability of geobacter to utilize acetate sasaki et al 2019 though without biofilm thickness measurement higher volumetric biomass content almost more than two times greater than cmt and community richness of gac fig 4a and table s3 indicated that the biofilm thickness would be evident and even excessive the electron transferring process was retarded due to substrate diffusion resistance high biofilm thickness and impaired electrochemical activity already dead inner core biofilm sun et al 2015 thus though with high geobacter abundance gac packing anode on the contrary still faced problems on electron transferring and electricity generation 3 5 2 geobacter methanogen ratio to indicate electrogenic activity fish technique can be applied to target specific microbial species of interest and give information about relative abundance of geobacter and methanogens based on fluorescence intensity the fluorescence intensity ratio of geobacter over methanogen could generally reflect the biofilm composition on specific anode surface to reflect the impact of anode material on electrogenic activity fish images taken from gac and cm t were shown in figs s9a and s9b indicating that fluorescence intensity ratio of geobacter green versus methanogens blue on cm t was greater than that from gac combining all fish images from each anode material ten spots taken from electrode surface the fluorescence intensity ratio was shown in table 2 cm t and cm a had greater intensity ratio than gac confirming that 3d weaved cm electrode entity had appropriate electrochemical environment to benefit the growth of electricigens qpcr result further confirmed the collected data and derived conclusion from fish and even could give more accurately quantitative result with absolute abundance of targeted species in the reactor this study targeted for the abundance comparison of key species geobacter and three methanogens based on the gene copy number per unit gram anode biomass hiegemann et al 2016 and the result could directly reflect the potential of electricity generation and methane generation it was surprisingly discovered that cmt and cma had significantly higher gene copy number of geobacter 5 15 x 108 9 29 107 and 3 23 x 108 5 24 107 gene copies g 1 collected biomass than that in cb and gac 2 79 x 108 2 38 107 and 2 19 x 108 4 51 x 107 gene copies g 1 fig 7b higher geobacter gene copy abundance of cm than cb further proved the previous proposition section 3 2 that limitation of growth space and mass transfer of cb led to lower utilization efficiency of the surface area to grow geobacter and cm could reflect its advantage of more space for biomass growth 3d weaved cm structure had advantages to create favorable electron transferring environment by connecting all conductive extension face together and the geobacter growth could be stimulated and enhanced it also should be noticed that gene copy number of all targeted methanogens was also significantly higher in cmt cma and cb e g for methanosarcinaceae 2 63 x 108 3 57 106 1 18 x 108 1 27 107 and 2 05 x 108 6 92 106 gene copies g 1 for cmt cma and cb respectively than that of gac 1 89 x 107 2 27 106 gene copies g 1 p 0 05 fig 7b cm entity not only gave favorable environment for electricigen but also created pathways for diet from electricigen to methanogens to stimulate the methanogen growth and activity not only gac but also the 3d weaved cm structure could serve as conductive intact electrode assembly to assist all attached geobacter and methanogens on diet and their abundance was greatly enhanced the increase of methanogens could reflect the higher potential of methane production from higher organic removal efficiency confirming higher organic removal efficiency fig 2c on the contrary though as well known conductive material to facilitate diet minimal size of gac particle makes huge barrier to realize the electron conduction among all attached biofilm when packed together inside the anode chamber thus 3d weaved cm electrode assembly successfully combined all available conducting pathways to facilitate electron harvesting and transportation 3 6 economic perspective cost effectiveness of all anode materials was important parameter to compare the application value and assist the material determination for better anode performance cost efficiency was calculated based on the daily energy generation in a 6 day continuous experimental period divided by the total anode electrode material cost assuming the same price for other anode components quantified using numerical standard kj 1 day 1 based on the previous study yuan et al 2016 the calculation process of total anode electrode material cost was detailed in supplementary information the calculation result of cost efficiency was shown in fig 8 cm t and cm a could achieve the daily energy output per unit cost of anode construction at 0 089 and 0 050 kj 1 day 1 respectively which was nearly more than 10 times and 6 times of the economic value of gac at 0 008 kj 1 day 1 detailed calculation process is described in supplementary information the great improvement of energy recovery achieved by 3d weaved cm electrode suggested that the anode could be extended for 3d electrode entity construction to maximize electron harvesting instead of only focusing surface area and electrochemical reactivity furthermore anodic weight could be greatly reduced e g gac weighed at 2 42 kg reduced to cm t at 0 06 kg by about 40 times the discovery from this study gave insights that scaled up bes could adopt similar 3d anodic structure as entity to reduce the material weight and optimize capital cost 4 conclusions this study adopted an innovative 3d weaved cm network to overcome the drawbacks of traditional material e g cb and gac lower internal resistance of cm electrode indicated the beneficial effect of 3d electrode composite on electron transfer and organic degradation though biomass accumulation was greater in gac the hydraulic clogging and contacting difficulty limited mass transfer and electron conduction while 3d weaved cm electrode could solve the problem microbial community analysis showed the beneficial effect of 3d weaved cm electrode to enhance geobacter and methanogenic population indicating promoting effect of cm network to stimulate the electrogenic growth and activity higher cost efficiency further proved the practical value of 3d weaved cm thus 3d weaved cm network initiated a new concept as combining all single unit electrode material pieces together as electrical network to improve electron transfer and increase cost efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

18152,the mechanism underlying legionella aerosolization and entry into the respiratory tract remains poorly documented in previous studies we characterized the aerodynamic behaviour of legionella aerosols and assessed their regional deposition within the respiratory tract using a human like anatomical model the aim of this study was to assess whether this experimental setup could mimic the exposure to bioaerosols generated by showers to achieve this objective we performed experiments to measure the mass median aerodynamic diameter mmad as well as the emitted dose and the physiological state of the airborne bacteria generated by a shower and two nebulizers vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers the mmads of the dispersed bioaerosols were characterized using a 12 stage cascade low pressure impactor the amount of dispersed airborne bacteria from a shower was quantified using a coriolis delta air sampler and compared to the airborne bacteria reaching the thoracic region in the experimental setup the physiological state and concentration of airborne legionella were assessed by qpcr for total cells culture for viable and cultivable legionella vc and flow cytometry for viable but non cultivable legionella vbnc in summary the experimental setup developed appears to mimic the bioaerosol emission of a shower in terms of aerodynamic size distribution compared to the specific case of a shower used as a reference in this study the experimental setup developed underestimates by 2 times when the jet nebulizer is used or overestimates by 43 times when the vibrating mesh nebulizer is used the total emitted dose of airborne bacteria to our knowledge this report is the first showing that an experimental model mimics so closely an exposure to legionella aerosols produced by showers to assess human lung deposition and infection in well controlled and safe conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella bioaerosols shower systems exposure 1 introduction members of the genus legionella gram negative bacilli are ubiquitous in natural and anthropogenic aquatic ecosystems these bacteria are responsible for severe pneumonia which may be fatal in 30 of cases when considering nosocomial infections l pneumophila is by far the most frequent species associated with legionnaires disease ld legionella is now the number one cause of reported waterborne disease in the united states the latest epidemiological data showed an increase in ld worldwide centers for disease control and prevention 2018 invs 2018 with the identification of new sources of contamination by legionella aerosol dispersion i e car washing stations baldovin et al 2018 street cleaning trucks valero et al 2017 aerosols from biologic wastewater treatment plants loenenbach et al 2018 reclaimed water used for spray irrigation pepper and gerba 2018 etc to assess the risk of infection of ld researchers have used the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra method to provide models for aerosol dispersion thomas w armstrong and haas 2007 t w armstrong and haas 2007 buse et al 2012 hamilton and haas 2016 schoen and ashbolt 2011 however these risk models are only based i on the fluidic characteristics of water systems that could generate bioaerosols and ii on the infectious doses extrapolated to humans from animal experiments using inhalation intraperitoneal injections or tracheal instillation for infection of the animal model in previous works we used a medical nebulization device to generate legionella aerosols thus we extensively characterized the bioaerosols produced by a vibrating mesh nebulizer in terms of aerodynamic features and airborne legionella emitted dose allegra et al 2016 we also experimentally assessed the deposition of these bacteria in the pulmonary region using a 3d replica of the upper airways pourchez et al 2017 and using an ex vivo ventilated porcine lung as an innovative human like respiratory model perinel et al 2018 we showed that the developed experimental setup can be used to mimic bacterial inhalation by an anatomical model of the respiratory tract to assess the legionella dose reaching the thoracic region for a given bioaerosol source therefore an interesting further step would consist of demonstrating that nebulizers can be used to satisfactorily mimic bioaerosol exposure during showering events indeed if cooling towers are the most significant sources of legionella outbreaks at a community level spa pools and showers from public facilities are the most significant sources of legionella nosocomial outbreaks k a hamilton et al 2018 for this purpose we compared in terms of aerodynamic size distribution and bacteria concentration two different technologies of bioaerosol generation a vibrating mesh nebulization system and a jet nebulizer the jet nebulizer has been in continuous development since medicinal aerosol delivery started in the 19th century today the majority of jet nebulizers are inexpensive devices operated via compressed gas the gas passes through a small aperture in the nebulizer to collect and atomize the liquid the aerosol generated by atomization contains large and small droplets and is driven to a baffle large droplets are impacted by the baffle while small droplets are transported out of the nebulizer in contrast the vibrating mesh nebulization system is a recent technology for aerosol generation using an annular piezo element to produce mesh vibration to push the liquid through the mesh holes in the mesh have a conical structure with the largest cross section of the cone in contact with the liquid the mesh deforms into the liquid side thus pumping and loading the holes with liquid this deformation on the other side of the liquid drug reservoir ejects droplets through the holes we hypothesize that with these two technologies our experimental setup will be able to reproduce many different shower like systems on the market place for adaptation of our previous model to showering facilities the original replica of the human upper airways el merhie et al 2015 leclerc et al 2014 was placed in an experimental sealed enclosure mimicking a shower cubicle and connected to a filter mimicking the thoracic region perinel et al 2018 pourchez et al 2017 a respiratory pump was used to fit the breathing parameters corresponding to adult male physiology at rest breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute and tidal volume of 500 ml gradon and marijnissen 2003 nf en 13544 1 2002 the results obtained using this experimental setup were compared with the mmad and the emitted dose of bioaerosols collected by the coriolis delta air sampler in the lab s shower that is routinely used by the staff the lab shower will be our reference in this work and hereafter

of the center for health engineering of mines saint etienne cis saint etienne france this shower is regularly used by the academic staff and postgraduate students at lunchtime after sporting activities three independent experiments were carried out the concentration of bacteria in the water network was determined by sampling 1 l of water from the first flow and 1 l during a 30 min showering event respectively at 10 20 and 30 min the quantity of bioaerosols dispersed during 10 20 and 30 min was measured by the coriolis delta air sampler bertin instruments france at a flow rate of 300 l min 1 in a coriolis collection tube containing 5 ml of physiological sterile water the water network samples 1 l and the coriolis delta collections 5 ml were concentrated on a polycarbonate membrane by filtration dna from each polycarbonate membrane was extracted with the power water dna extraction kit mobio the total number of bacteria in the water network and in bioaerosols was quantified by qpcr targeting the 16s rna gene see qpcr section 2 2 description of the experimental setup to generate bioaerosol and to assess lung deposition a previously validated and original respiratory model was used in this study pourchez et al 2017 the setup was composed of a human 3d replica corresponding to the entire nasal cavities nasal fossae and frontal ethmoid and maxillary sinuses el merhie et al 2015 le guellec et al 2014 this replica was manufactured in transparent water resistant and non porous resin qualitative analyses with endoscopy and ct scans were performed on the replica to assess the anatomical reproducibility durand et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 this human upper airway replica was placed in an exposition chamber allowing aerosol dispersion between 0 6 and

cfus according to the standard curves 2 5 biological characterization and aerodynamic features of aerosols generated by a jet nebulizer we compared two different technologies used for bioaerosol generation a vibrating mesh nebulization system and a jet nebulizer a vibrating mesh nebulizer a medical device erapid nebulizer system by pari cystic fibrosis services used to aerosolize the bacterial suspensions was linked to a small compressor and delivers aerosols with a vibrating membrane technology the jet nebulizer used was a bio aerosol nebulizing generator bang vitrocell this system is specifically designed for the generation of aqueous aerosols at a low air flow rate based on the aerosolization principle of the collison nebulizer the design of the bang has been modified to minimize foaming of protein solutions and thus increase the viability of microorganisms in bioaerosols while maximizing aerosol output the aerodynamic features of the jet nebulizer were determined as previously described allegra et al 2016 briefly the airborne particle size distribution was assessed using a 12 stage cascade low pressure impactor dlpi dekati finland the size classification in dlpi was made from 30 nm up to 10 μm with evenly distributed impactor stages each stage of the cascade impactor was covered with a polycarbonate membrane nuclepore track etched membrane filters

distribution of airborne particle mass with respect to the aerodynamic diameter 3 results 3 1 quantification of the exposure to airborne bacteria during 1 min in the shower as a reference the technical features of the real shower are presented in fig 2 as determined by qpcr the total bacteria concentration in the water network was 3 3 1 0 104 bacteria l 1 assuming that the aerosols are evenly distributed in the shower space when extrapolating the numbers we found that the mean number of bacteria collected per minute by the coriolis delta air sampler was 8 6 3 2 102 as the shower cubicle has a volume of 1 125 m3 the coriolis system 300 l min 1 can collect 26 7 of the air per minute the actual number of bacteria per minute in the shower cubicle was therefore 3 2 103 and the number of aerosolized bacteria in the shower cubicle was 2 9 103 bacteria m3 the volume of air inhaled by an adult male at rest is 7 5 10 3 m3 min 1 therefore in the specific case studied we can estimate that a human male at rest inhales approximately 22 bacteria per minute during a shower 3 2 legionella exposure quantification in the experimental setup the amount of legionella reaching the thoracic region was assessed by culture fca and qpcr the number of viable and culturable legionella vc was determined by culture fca allowed the quantification of viable and potentially pathogen bacteria vc and vbnc and qpcr was used to quantify the total dna from vc vbnc and dead cells dcs inside the experimental setup used with the vibrating mesh nebulizer or with the jet nebulizer to generate bioaerosols the volume per minute of calibrated suspension dispersed around the human 3d replica of the upper airways was 1 00 0 25 ml min 1 and 0 16 0 06 ml min 1 respectively as determined by qpcr only 2 0 0 3 of the total legionella dna dispersed from the jet nebulizer could reach the thoracic region compared to 11 9 6 from the vibrating mesh nebulizer in the experiments with the jet nebulizer no significant values were obtained in the culture and fca experiments the amount of culturable and viable bacteria that could be detected was below the detection limits of the culture and fca methods table 1 shows all the results obtained with the vibrating mesh nebulizer qpcr was used to quantify all legionella physiological states including dead cells we found that 11 9 6 of the total aerosolized legionella dna could reach the thoracic region from the culture results only 0 5 0 7 of the culturable aerosolized legionella was detected in the thoracic region as expected the culture method underestimates the real legionella risk finally with the fca results we observed that through the human anatomical model the thoracic region was exposed to 4 3 4 0 of the viable vc vbnc aerosolized legionella 3 3 comparison of the exposure to bacteria to determine if the shower like experimental setup satisfactorily mimics a bioaerosol shower exposure we compared the number of inhaled bacteria for a 1 min shower event table 2 as we used the real shower as a reference the number of bacteria in the nebulizer s reservoir 5 ml or 10 ml for the vibrating mesh and jet nebulizer respectively was fixed at 3 3 104 bacteria the results in table 2 indicate that the experimental setup developed underestimates by 2 times if the jet nebulizer is used or overestimates by 43 times if the vibrating mesh nebulizer is used the emitted dose of total vc vbnc and dc airborne bacteria 3 4 features of the aerosols generated by nebulization the aerodynamic features of the aerosols generated by the jet nebulizer were compared to those of the vibrating mesh nebulizer that were previously determined allegra et al 2016 fig 3 shows the repartition of legionella depending on the aerosol size table 3 presents the proportions of viable and potentially pathogenic airborne bacteria both nebulizer profiles were examined for the aerosol fraction that could reach the thoracic region 0 26 μm 2 4 μm from the literature and our previously published data with the vibrating mesh nebulizer allegra et al 2016 perinel et al 2018 pourchez et al 2017 we confirmed that legionella epf cells robertson et al 2014 are approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide several studies have shown that bioaerosol droplets of more than 2 5 μm in diameter cannot reach the pulmonary alveoli leclerc et al 2015 pourchez et al 2013 schlesinger 1989 in this study depending on the cut off diameters of the cascade impactor dlpi we defined the fraction of viable legionella bioaerosol diameters ranging from 0 26 μm to 2 4 μm as the fraction that can reach the pulmonary alveoli and cause infection first we obtained similar results by qpcr between the percentage of bacteria reaching the thoracic region table 1 and the percentage of bacteria collected in the dlpi table 3 2 0 0 3 compared to 2 4 0 1 for the jet nebulizer and 11 9 6 compared to 12 8 1 1 for the vibrating mesh nebulizer p 0 5 for the two tests second the results obtained with the jet nebulizer confirmed that i vc cells were detected with the 262 nm cut off diameter and ii the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation on the 12 stage dlpi same of vc vbnc and dc were obtained by fca data not shown the jet nebulizer generated smaller airborne droplets than the vibrating mesh nebulizer mmad of 1 2 0 4 μm for the jet nebulizer versus 3 4 0 4 μm for the vibrating mesh nebulizer but the same proportions of viable and potentially pathogen airborne bacteria 42 3 2 and 48 5 respectively can reach the deep lung 4 discussion qmra provides a very useful methodology to manage the risk of infections by foodborne or some waterborne pathogens with simple cases of contamination legionella is currently a well documented human waterborne pathogen but as shown by bentham and whiley bentham and whiley 2018 whiley et al 2014 persistent and indeterminable uncertainties remain regarding legionella epidemiology frequency of exposure aerosol characterization quantity size content of legionella strain infectivity infectious dose and detection methods no risk acceptance threshold is currently validated however in the context of global change and diminishing water resources the need to use various water sources will lead to a need for the development and use of lca life cycle assessment and qmra methodologies harder et al 2017 national academies of sciences and medicine 2019 to optimize these risk assessment and prevention methods our studies using different detection methods of legionella allegra et al 2008 2011 2011 s allegra et al 2011 severine allegra et al 2011 aimed to characterize the aerosol generation allegra et al 2016 pourchez et al 2017 and the inhaled aerosols that can reach pulmonary cells perinel et al 2018 the experimental setup developed in this study proposes a model as close as possible to the human anatomy and physiology respecting the 3r rule replacement reduction and refinement and consequently does not raise ethical issues the model is easy to handle and has physiological similarities to human ventilation some factors such as the nasal and bronchial mucosa the ciliated cells the secretion of mucus surfactant and the body temperature could not be taken into account in the model nevertheless depending on the use of the vibrating mesh or jet nebulizer we can adapt the experimental configuration to mimic the exposure to legionella aerosols generated by different shower like systems 4 1 bioaerosol generation from shower like systems regarding aerosol dispersion quantity size the discrepancy between the results from the different studies is due to the different methods and apparatuses used to measure the air bacteria concentration and to numerous other factors such as ambient humidity type of shower stall design of the showerhead water temperature piping materials human occupants or bacterial communities and biofilm development several publications chattopadhyay et al 2017 cowen and ollison 2006 estrada perez et al 2018 o toole et al 2009 perkins et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 have shown that i a shower with the low flow showerhead generates a significantly higher number of aerosols than a high flow shower ii a hot shower approximately 40 c increases the rate of evaporation therefore the number of small particles within the breathable range is increased and the culturability of cells is decreased with the turn off to the vbnc state as shown for pseudomonas and legionella iii the number of bioaerosols generated during a shower is not only dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the water network as an example zhou et al 2007 demonstrated that the particle size distribution of shower aerosols was only mildly affected by the water flow rate in the case of hot water experiments showing droplet size in the 5 μm range however for cold water the particle distribution varied significantly with the flow rate and the droplets generated were smaller approximately 2 μm the two nebulization technologies used in this study generated similar proportions of viable and potentially pathogenic airborne legionella that could reach the lungs in addition the droplet size generated by the vibrating mesh nebulizer mmad of 3 4 μm appeared to be representative of a shower using lukewarm water however the jet nebulizer which generates smaller airborne droplets mmad of 1 2 μm seems to be representative of a shower using cold water moreover these nebulizers could also mimic the bioaerosol characteristics from new sources of ld such as a spa moore et al 2015 or bioaerosols generated by wastewater treatment tanks wang et al 2019 concerning aerosol content we can identify 4 modes of transportation during the aerosolization of legionella allegra et al 2016 cellular fragments of legionella entrapped or not in droplets 28 262 nm airborne bacteria not entrapped in droplets and oriented by the air flow direction during the respiration process 0 262 0 949 μm airborne bacteria entrapped or not in droplets or in amoeba vacuoles 0 949 1 6 μm and airborne bacteria packaged in droplets or in amoebae vacuoles 1 6 9 92 μm vc legionella was also detected as early as the 262 nm cut off diameter of dlpi confirming that legionella bacilli have a size of approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and can reach the deep lung in the context of this study we demonstrated a new data that the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation through the 12 stage dlpi or the anatomical model thermally or chlorine induced vbnc legionella pneumophila may still infect amoebae and pulmonary cells after resuscitation on amoebae cervero aragó et al 2019 epalle et al 2015 mustapha et al 2015 vbnc cell concentrations in the water network must be included in the qmra models 4 2 exposure and dose response modelling there is currently no consensus on a threshold for the acceptability of microbiological risk the acceptable risk of infection set by the who for waterborne pathogens is less than one infection per 10000 persons per year and stipulates that risk assessment be undertaken for waterborne pathogens to demonstrate microbiologically safe water world health organization 2016 the calculation and the expression of the result of the risk differ according to the authors azuma et al 2013 bouwknegt et al 2013 kerry a hamilton et al 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2011 sharaby et al 2019 indeed the annual risk estimation varies significantly between the scenario analyses the dose response model chosen clinical severity incidence of ld or and pontiac fever during or after an outbreak etc the population at risk residential or occupational the detection method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr the meteorological conditions etc the exposure assessment duration frequency consists of determining the inhaled quantity of potentially pathogenic legionella however the amount of inhaled air will depend on the activity of the subject and the exposure scenario it is therefore easier to evaluate and model the risk associated with the generation of aerosols by shower like systems rather than cooling towers our study shows similarities and complementarities with 2 other recent studies from chattopadhyay et al 2017 and estrada perez et al 2018 in term of aerosol samplers gram negative bacillus targets and detection methods table 4 shows that the concentrations of legionella aerosols generated by the vibrating mesh nebulizer 8 9 103 cfu m3 or by the jet nebulizer 1 4 103 cfu m3 min 1 in our experimental setup effectively mimic an emitted dose of shower bacteria the air bacteria concentrations measured in these three studies were of the same order of magnitude studies using animal models or manikins calculate the dose of inhaled legionella from mathematical models here bioaerosols were inhaled by a well validated 3d replica of the upper airways le guellec et al 2014 pourchez et al 2017 a respiratory pump was used to fit the breathing parameters corresponding to adult male physiology at rest a breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 ml the number of viable bacteria reaching the thoracic region represents the dose of inhaled legionella that can result in ld as observed in table 1 4 3 4 0 of the viable vc vbnc legionella aerosolized during the experimentation experimental setup combined with the vibrating mesh nebulizer reached the thoracic region in the context of the shower used as a reference water network contaminated by 3 3 104 legionella l 1 22 viable and potentially pathogenic legionella may reach the pulmonary region after a 1 min shower depending on the exposure scenario we now have several experimental setups to mimic a large range of shower systems by adjusting the concentration of bacteria in the water network the nebulizers settings and the time of experimentation to provide robust data to scientific experts for qmra development 5 conclusion viable and cultivable aerosolized legionella bacilli were detected as early as the 262 nm cut off diameter of dlpi confirming that legionella bacilli are approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and can reach the deep lung the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation through the 12 stage dlpi or the anatomical model after a 1 min shower used as a reference in this study contaminated by 3 104 legionella cells l 22 viable and potentially pathogenic legionella cells may reach the pulmonary region of an adult male the characteristics of the 2 nebulizers can allow the adaptation of our experimental setup to analyse the exposure to different shower like systems this original experimental setup will provide data to accurately quantify the legionella risk exposure and the dose response in the context of a legionella infection from a water network to deposition in the lung funding information this study was supported by a grant from jean monnet university france

18152,the mechanism underlying legionella aerosolization and entry into the respiratory tract remains poorly documented in previous studies we characterized the aerodynamic behaviour of legionella aerosols and assessed their regional deposition within the respiratory tract using a human like anatomical model the aim of this study was to assess whether this experimental setup could mimic the exposure to bioaerosols generated by showers to achieve this objective we performed experiments to measure the mass median aerodynamic diameter mmad as well as the emitted dose and the physiological state of the airborne bacteria generated by a shower and two nebulizers vibrating mesh and jet nebulizers the mmads of the dispersed bioaerosols were characterized using a 12 stage cascade low pressure impactor the amount of dispersed airborne bacteria from a shower was quantified using a coriolis delta air sampler and compared to the airborne bacteria reaching the thoracic region in the experimental setup the physiological state and concentration of airborne legionella were assessed by qpcr for total cells culture for viable and cultivable legionella vc and flow cytometry for viable but non cultivable legionella vbnc in summary the experimental setup developed appears to mimic the bioaerosol emission of a shower in terms of aerodynamic size distribution compared to the specific case of a shower used as a reference in this study the experimental setup developed underestimates by 2 times when the jet nebulizer is used or overestimates by 43 times when the vibrating mesh nebulizer is used the total emitted dose of airborne bacteria to our knowledge this report is the first showing that an experimental model mimics so closely an exposure to legionella aerosols produced by showers to assess human lung deposition and infection in well controlled and safe conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella bioaerosols shower systems exposure 1 introduction members of the genus legionella gram negative bacilli are ubiquitous in natural and anthropogenic aquatic ecosystems these bacteria are responsible for severe pneumonia which may be fatal in 30 of cases when considering nosocomial infections l pneumophila is by far the most frequent species associated with legionnaires disease ld legionella is now the number one cause of reported waterborne disease in the united states the latest epidemiological data showed an increase in ld worldwide centers for disease control and prevention 2018 invs 2018 with the identification of new sources of contamination by legionella aerosol dispersion i e car washing stations baldovin et al 2018 street cleaning trucks valero et al 2017 aerosols from biologic wastewater treatment plants loenenbach et al 2018 reclaimed water used for spray irrigation pepper and gerba 2018 etc to assess the risk of infection of ld researchers have used the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra method to provide models for aerosol dispersion thomas w armstrong and haas 2007 t w armstrong and haas 2007 buse et al 2012 hamilton and haas 2016 schoen and ashbolt 2011 however these risk models are only based i on the fluidic characteristics of water systems that could generate bioaerosols and ii on the infectious doses extrapolated to humans from animal experiments using inhalation intraperitoneal injections or tracheal instillation for infection of the animal model in previous works we used a medical nebulization device to generate legionella aerosols thus we extensively characterized the bioaerosols produced by a vibrating mesh nebulizer in terms of aerodynamic features and airborne legionella emitted dose allegra et al 2016 we also experimentally assessed the deposition of these bacteria in the pulmonary region using a 3d replica of the upper airways pourchez et al 2017 and using an ex vivo ventilated porcine lung as an innovative human like respiratory model perinel et al 2018 we showed that the developed experimental setup can be used to mimic bacterial inhalation by an anatomical model of the respiratory tract to assess the legionella dose reaching the thoracic region for a given bioaerosol source therefore an interesting further step would consist of demonstrating that nebulizers can be used to satisfactorily mimic bioaerosol exposure during showering events indeed if cooling towers are the most significant sources of legionella outbreaks at a community level spa pools and showers from public facilities are the most significant sources of legionella nosocomial outbreaks k a hamilton et al 2018 for this purpose we compared in terms of aerodynamic size distribution and bacteria concentration two different technologies of bioaerosol generation a vibrating mesh nebulization system and a jet nebulizer the jet nebulizer has been in continuous development since medicinal aerosol delivery started in the 19th century today the majority of jet nebulizers are inexpensive devices operated via compressed gas the gas passes through a small aperture in the nebulizer to collect and atomize the liquid the aerosol generated by atomization contains large and small droplets and is driven to a baffle large droplets are impacted by the baffle while small droplets are transported out of the nebulizer in contrast the vibrating mesh nebulization system is a recent technology for aerosol generation using an annular piezo element to produce mesh vibration to push the liquid through the mesh holes in the mesh have a conical structure with the largest cross section of the cone in contact with the liquid the mesh deforms into the liquid side thus pumping and loading the holes with liquid this deformation on the other side of the liquid drug reservoir ejects droplets through the holes we hypothesize that with these two technologies our experimental setup will be able to reproduce many different shower like systems on the market place for adaptation of our previous model to showering facilities the original replica of the human upper airways el merhie et al 2015 leclerc et al 2014 was placed in an experimental sealed enclosure mimicking a shower cubicle and connected to a filter mimicking the thoracic region perinel et al 2018 pourchez et al 2017 a respiratory pump was used to fit the breathing parameters corresponding to adult male physiology at rest breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute and tidal volume of 500 ml gradon and marijnissen 2003 nf en 13544 1 2002 the results obtained using this experimental setup were compared with the mmad

of the center for health engineering of mines saint etienne cis saint etienne france this shower is regularly used by the academic staff and postgraduate students at lunchtime after sporting activities three independent experiments were carried out the concentration of bacteria in the water network was determined by sampling 1 l of water from the first flow and 1 l during a 30 min showering event respectively at 10 20 and 30 min the quantity of bioaerosols dispersed during 10 20 and 30 min was measured by the coriolis delta air sampler bertin instruments france at a flow rate of 300 l min 1 in a coriolis collection tube containing 5 ml of physiological sterile water the water network samples 1 l and the coriolis delta collections 5 ml were concentrated on a polycarbonate membrane by filtration dna from each polycarbonate membrane was extracted with the power water dna extraction kit mobio the total number of bacteria in the water network and in bioaerosols was quantified by qpcr targeting the 16s rna gene see qpcr section 2 2 description of the experimental setup to generate bioaerosol and to assess lung deposition a previously validated and original respiratory model was used in this study pourchez et al 2017 the setup was composed of a human 3d replica corresponding to the entire nasal cavities nasal fossae and frontal ethmoid and maxillary sinuses el merhie et al 2015 le guellec et al 2014 this replica was manufactured in transparent water resistant and non porous resin qualitative analyses with endoscopy and ct scans were performed on the replica to assess the anatomical reproducibility durand et al 2011 as shown in fig 1 this human upper airway replica was placed in an exposition chamber allowing aerosol dispersion between 0 6 and

software applied biosystems the results were expressed in genomic units gu when a comparison with cell counts was necessary and to a better understanding data was expressed in colonies forming units cfus according to the standard curves 2 5 biological characterization and aerodynamic features of aerosols generated by a jet nebulizer we compared two different technologies used for bioaerosol generation a vibrating mesh nebulization system and a jet nebulizer a vibrating mesh nebulizer a medical device erapid nebulizer system by pari cystic fibrosis services used to aerosolize the bacterial suspensions was linked to a small compressor and delivers aerosols with a vibrating membrane technology the jet nebulizer used was a bio aerosol nebulizing generator bang vitrocell this system is specifically designed for the generation of aqueous aerosols at a low air flow rate based on the aerosolization principle of the collison nebulizer the design of the bang has been modified to minimize foaming of protein solutions and thus increase the viability of microorganisms in bioaerosols while maximizing aerosol output the aerodynamic features of the jet nebulizer were determined as previously described allegra et al 2016 briefly the airborne particle size distribution was assessed using a 12 stage cascade low pressure impactor dlpi dekati finland the size classification in dlpi was made from 30 nm up to 10 μm with evenly distributed impactor stages each stage of the cascade impactor was covered with a polycarbonate membrane nuclepore track etched membrane filters whatman ge healthcare to collect legionella aerosols after nebulization each membrane was placed in 5 ml of physiological sterile water after a 30 s sonication bransonic 32 sonicator bath branson instruments danbury ct usa the bacterial suspensions of each stage were analysed by gfp mut2 qpcr the mass median aerodynamic diameter mmad was calculated the mmad was defined as the median of the distribution of airborne particle mass with respect to the aerodynamic diameter 3 results 3 1 quantification of the exposure to airborne bacteria during 1 min in the shower as a reference the technical features of the real shower are presented in fig 2 as determined by qpcr the total bacteria concentration in the water network was 3 3 1 0 104 bacteria l 1 assuming that the aerosols are evenly distributed in the shower space when extrapolating the numbers we found that the mean number of bacteria collected per minute by the coriolis delta air sampler was 8 6 3 2 102 as the shower cubicle has a volume of 1 125 m3 the coriolis system 300 l min 1 can collect 26 7 of the air per minute the actual number of bacteria per minute in the shower cubicle was therefore 3 2 103 and the number of aerosolized bacteria in the shower cubicle was 2 9 103 bacteria m3 the volume of air inhaled by an adult male at rest is 7 5 10 3 m3 min 1 therefore in the specific case studied we can estimate that a human male at rest inhales approximately 22 bacteria per minute during a shower 3 2 legionella exposure quantification in the experimental setup the amount of legionella reaching the thoracic region was assessed by culture fca and qpcr the number of viable and culturable legionella vc was determined by culture fca allowed the quantification of viable and potentially pathogen bacteria vc and vbnc and qpcr was used to quantify the total dna from vc vbnc and dead cells dcs inside the experimental setup used with the vibrating mesh nebulizer or with the jet nebulizer to generate bioaerosols the volume per minute of calibrated suspension dispersed around the human 3d replica of the upper airways was 1 00 0 25 ml min 1 and 0 16 0 06 ml min 1 respectively as determined by qpcr only 2 0 0 3 of the total legionella dna dispersed from the jet nebulizer could reach the thoracic region compared to 11 9 6 from the vibrating mesh nebulizer in the experiments with the jet nebulizer no significant values were obtained in the culture and fca experiments the amount of culturable and viable bacteria that could be detected was below the detection limits of the culture and fca methods table 1 shows all the results obtained with the vibrating mesh nebulizer qpcr was used to quantify all legionella physiological states including dead cells we found that 11 9 6 of the total aerosolized legionella dna could reach the thoracic region from the culture results only 0 5 0 7 of the culturable aerosolized legionella was detected in the thoracic region as expected the culture method underestimates the real legionella risk finally with the fca results we observed that through the human anatomical model the thoracic region was exposed to 4 3 4 0 of the viable vc vbnc aerosolized legionella 3 3 comparison of the exposure to bacteria to determine if the shower like experimental setup satisfactorily mimics a bioaerosol shower exposure we compared the number of inhaled bacteria for a 1 min shower event table 2 as we used the real shower as a reference the number of bacteria in the nebulizer s reservoir 5 ml or 10 ml for the vibrating mesh and jet nebulizer respectively was fixed at 3 3 104 bacteria the results in table 2 indicate that the experimental setup developed underestimates by 2 times if the jet nebulizer is used or overestimates by 43 times if the vibrating mesh nebulizer is used the emitted dose of total vc vbnc and dc airborne bacteria 3 4 features of the aerosols generated by nebulization the aerodynamic features of the aerosols generated by the jet nebulizer were compared to those of the vibrating mesh nebulizer that were previously determined allegra et al 2016 fig 3 shows the repartition of legionella depending on the aerosol size table 3 presents the proportions of viable and potentially pathogenic airborne bacteria both nebulizer profiles were examined for the aerosol fraction that could reach the thoracic region 0 26 μm 2 4 μm from the literature and our previously published data with the vibrating mesh nebulizer allegra et al 2016 perinel et al 2018 pourchez et al 2017 we confirmed that legionella epf cells robertson et al 2014 are approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide several studies have shown that bioaerosol droplets of more than 2 5 μm in diameter cannot reach the pulmonary alveoli leclerc et al 2015 pourchez et al 2013 schlesinger 1989 in this study depending on the cut off diameters of the cascade impactor dlpi we defined the fraction of viable legionella bioaerosol diameters ranging from 0 26 μm to 2 4 μm as the fraction that can reach the pulmonary alveoli and cause infection first we obtained similar results by qpcr between the percentage of bacteria reaching the thoracic region table 1 and the percentage of bacteria collected in the dlpi table 3 2 0 0 3 compared to 2 4 0 1 for the jet nebulizer and 11 9 6 compared to 12 8 1 1 for the vibrating mesh nebulizer p 0 5 for the two tests second the results obtained with the jet nebulizer confirmed that i vc cells were detected with the 262 nm cut off diameter and ii the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation on the 12 stage dlpi same of vc vbnc and dc were obtained by fca data not shown the jet nebulizer generated smaller airborne droplets than the vibrating mesh nebulizer mmad of 1 2 0 4 μm for the jet nebulizer versus 3 4 0 4 μm for the vibrating mesh nebulizer but the same proportions of viable and potentially pathogen airborne bacteria 42 3 2 and 48 5 respectively can reach the deep lung 4 discussion qmra provides a very useful methodology to manage the risk of infections by foodborne or some waterborne pathogens with simple cases of contamination legionella is currently a well documented human waterborne pathogen but as shown by bentham and whiley bentham and whiley 2018 whiley et al 2014 persistent and indeterminable uncertainties remain regarding legionella epidemiology frequency of exposure aerosol characterization quantity size content of legionella strain infectivity infectious dose and detection methods no risk acceptance threshold is currently validated however in the context of global change and diminishing water resources the need to use various water sources will lead to a need for the development and use of lca life cycle assessment and qmra methodologies harder et al 2017 national academies of sciences and medicine 2019 to optimize these risk assessment and prevention methods our studies using different detection methods of legionella allegra et al 2008 2011 2011 s allegra et al 2011 severine allegra et al 2011 aimed to characterize the aerosol generation allegra et al 2016 pourchez et al 2017 and the inhaled aerosols that can reach pulmonary cells perinel et al 2018 the experimental setup developed in this study proposes a model as close as possible to the human anatomy and physiology respecting the 3r rule replacement reduction and refinement and consequently does not raise ethical issues the model is easy to handle and has physiological similarities to human ventilation some factors such as the nasal and bronchial mucosa the ciliated cells the secretion of mucus surfactant and the body temperature could not be taken into account in the model nevertheless depending on the use of the vibrating mesh or jet nebulizer we can adapt the experimental configuration to mimic the exposure to legionella aerosols generated by different shower like systems 4 1 bioaerosol generation from shower like systems regarding aerosol dispersion quantity size the discrepancy between the results from the different studies is due to the different methods and apparatuses used to measure the air bacteria concentration and to numerous other factors such as ambient humidity type of shower stall design of the showerhead water temperature piping materials human occupants or bacterial communities and biofilm development several publications chattopadhyay et al 2017 cowen and ollison 2006 estrada perez et al 2018 o toole et al 2009 perkins et al 2009 zhou et al 2007 have shown that i a shower with the low flow showerhead generates a significantly higher number of aerosols than a high flow shower ii a hot shower approximately 40 c increases the rate of evaporation therefore the number of small particles within the breathable range is increased and the culturability of cells is decreased with the turn off to the vbnc state as shown for pseudomonas and legionella iii the number of bioaerosols generated during a shower is not only dependent on the concentration of bacteria in the water network as an example zhou et al 2007 demonstrated that the particle size distribution of shower aerosols was only mildly affected by the water flow rate in the case of hot water experiments showing droplet size in the 5 μm range however for cold water the particle distribution varied significantly with the flow rate and the droplets generated were smaller approximately 2 μm the two nebulization technologies used in this study generated similar proportions of viable and potentially pathogenic airborne legionella that could reach the lungs in addition the droplet size generated by the vibrating mesh nebulizer mmad of 3 4 μm appeared to be representative of a shower using lukewarm water however the jet nebulizer which generates smaller airborne droplets mmad of 1 2 μm seems to be representative of a shower using cold water moreover these nebulizers could also mimic the bioaerosol characteristics from new sources of ld such as a spa moore et al 2015 or bioaerosols generated by wastewater treatment tanks wang et al 2019 concerning aerosol content we can identify 4 modes of transportation during the aerosolization of legionella allegra et al 2016 cellular fragments of legionella entrapped or not in droplets 28 262 nm airborne bacteria not entrapped in droplets and oriented by the air flow direction during the respiration process 0 262 0 949 μm airborne bacteria entrapped or not in droplets or in amoeba vacuoles 0 949 1 6 μm and airborne bacteria packaged in droplets or in amoebae vacuoles 1 6 9 92 μm vc legionella was also detected as early as the 262 nm cut off diameter of dlpi confirming that legionella bacilli have a size of approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and can reach the deep lung in the context of this study we demonstrated a new data that the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation through the 12 stage dlpi or the anatomical model thermally or chlorine induced vbnc legionella pneumophila may still infect amoebae and pulmonary cells after resuscitation on amoebae cervero aragó et al 2019 epalle et al 2015 mustapha et al 2015 vbnc cell concentrations in the water network must be included in the qmra models 4 2 exposure and dose response modelling there is currently no consensus on a threshold for the acceptability of microbiological risk the acceptable risk of infection set by the who for waterborne pathogens is less than one infection per 10000 persons per year and stipulates that risk assessment be undertaken for waterborne pathogens to demonstrate microbiologically safe water world health organization 2016 the calculation and the expression of the result of the risk differ according to the authors azuma et al 2013 bouwknegt et al 2013 kerry a hamilton et al 2018 schoen and ashbolt 2011 sharaby et al 2019 indeed the annual risk estimation varies significantly between the scenario analyses the dose response model chosen clinical severity incidence of ld or and pontiac fever during or after an outbreak etc the population at risk residential or occupational the detection method culture based ema qpcr or qpcr the meteorological conditions etc the exposure assessment duration frequency consists of determining the inhaled quantity of potentially pathogenic legionella however the amount of inhaled air will depend on the activity of the subject and the exposure scenario it is therefore easier to evaluate and model the risk associated with the generation of aerosols by shower like systems rather than cooling towers our study shows similarities and complementarities with 2 other recent studies from chattopadhyay et al 2017 and estrada perez et al 2018 in term of aerosol samplers gram negative bacillus targets and detection methods table 4 shows that the concentrations of legionella aerosols generated by the vibrating mesh nebulizer 8 9 103 cfu m3 or by the jet nebulizer 1 4 103 cfu m3 min 1 in our experimental setup effectively mimic an emitted dose of shower bacteria the air bacteria concentrations measured in these three studies were of the same order of magnitude studies using animal models or manikins calculate the dose of inhaled legionella from mathematical models here bioaerosols were inhaled by a well validated 3d replica of the upper airways le guellec et al 2014 pourchez et al 2017 a respiratory pump was used to fit the breathing parameters corresponding to adult male physiology at rest a breathing rate of 15 breaths per minute and a tidal volume of 500 ml the number of viable bacteria reaching the thoracic region represents the dose of inhaled legionella that can result in ld as observed in table 1 4 3 4 0 of the viable vc vbnc legionella aerosolized during the experimentation experimental setup combined with the vibrating mesh nebulizer reached the thoracic region in the context of the shower used as a reference water network contaminated by 3 3 104 legionella l 1 22 viable and potentially pathogenic legionella may reach the pulmonary region after a 1 min shower depending on the exposure scenario we now have several experimental setups to mimic a large range of shower systems by adjusting the concentration of bacteria in the water network the nebulizers settings and the time of experimentation to provide robust data to scientific experts for qmra development 5 conclusion viable and cultivable aerosolized legionella bacilli were detected as early as the 262 nm cut off diameter of dlpi confirming that legionella bacilli are approximately 1 2 μm long and 0 3 0 9 μm wide and can reach the deep lung the legionella physiological states were not modified by the nebulization process or by its transportation through the 12 stage dlpi or the anatomical model after a 1 min shower used as a reference in this study contaminated by 3 104 legionella cells l 22 viable and potentially pathogenic legionella cells may reach the pulmonary region of an adult male the characteristics of the 2 nebulizers can allow the adaptation of our experimental setup to analyse the exposure to different shower like systems this original experimental setup will provide data to accurately quantify the legionella risk exposure and

18153,in this study the potential formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm from model organic compounds in ammonia containing water treated by uv chlorine process was evaluated monochloramine generated from the reaction of chlorine and ammonia can be photolyzed to produce no2 and reactive nitrogen species rns which play important roles in the formation of tcnm during the subsequent chlorination the results showed that increase of nitrogen to chlorine molar ratio from 0 to 1 0 and ph from 6 5 to 8 0 enhanced the formation of tcnm mainly due to the increased yield of no2 and rns from the photolyzed monochloramine the formation of tcnm was interestingly found to be linearly correlated with hammett constants of the model precursors which is theoretically related to the rate constants of rns with model compounds enhanced formation of tcnm was also observed during the treatment of natural organic matter by uv chlorine process in ammonia containing water the toxicity assessment showed that tcnm significantly increased the genotoxicity of formed dbps furthermore the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was proved to more likely occur on the ortho and para position of phenol according to the calculation of gaussian program and a possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 was proposed based on the calculated results graphical abstract image 1 keywords ammonia nitrogen chlorination uv irradiation disinfection byproducts trichloronitromethane tcnm 1 introduction in drinking water treatment plants disinfection is a key procedure to ensure the safety of drinking water among various disinfectants chlorine is the most widely used one for water disinfection deborde and von gunten 2008 due to its low cost high capability of inactivating pathogenic microorganisms and controlling odor and taste compounds in water bruchet and duguet 2004 burlingame et al 1992 hoff and geldreich 1981 however chlorine can also react with organic contaminants to produce disinfection byproducts dbps which have potential risks to human health hu et al 2018 richardson et al 2007a yang and zhang 2016 with the frequently emerging toxic dbps and chlorine resistant microorganisms i e giardia and cryptosporidium hijnen et al 2006 ultraviolet uv irradiation has been deemed as an ideal alternative for chlorine however uv irradiation cannot guarantee the lasting safety of water in the distribution system because of the absence of residual therefore uv irradiation is usually combined with chlorination to achieve multiple disinfection effects li et al 2016 ra et al 2019 and consequently this creates a uv chlor am ine process apart from the efficient disinfection performance uv chlorine process has been extensively investigated in the degradation of organic contaminants because of its ability to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh and chlorine radical cl bu et al 2018 chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 lu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2019a xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b of note uv chlorine process lowers chemical consumption compared to chlorination solely but the formation of dbps is still an important issue that needs more scrutiny in uv chlorine process because of the presence of chlorine and formation of other active chlorine species wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 since trichloromethane tcm was detected and identified as dbps in the 1970s bellar et al 1974 a large number of research studies were carried out to elucidate the formation and control of dbps and thousands of dbps have been identified in the disinfected drinking water krasner et al 2006 yang and zhang 2016 although the concentration of nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms is generally lower than the currently regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps e g trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas n dbps have received more attention in recent years because of their higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity hu et al 2018 krasner et al 2012 richardson et al 2007b therefore it is crucial to comprehensively investigate the precursors and control of n dbps in the disinfection process dissolved organic nitrogen don which is typically present in the form of amino acids proteins urea and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has been generally considered as the main precursors of the n dbps during disinfection ackerson et al 2019 bond et al 2011 how et al 2016 shen and andrews 2011 choi and valentine observed the formation of ndma from the chlorination of nitrite containing water but the formation potential was low choi and valentine 2003 in more recent research studies a series of radical chain reactions and generation of oh and reactive nitrogen species rns from the photolysis of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were observed to take place ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 these studies reported destruction of model contaminants and formation of nitrated products during the aforementioned process these results reveal that no3 and no2 can be converted to rns via photolysis or reactions with radicals and then turned to don indicating another possible pathway of the n dbps formation xu et al 2019 reported the enhanced formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm when nitrite containing wastewater effluents were irradiated by sunlight in our previous study bu et al 2020 non negligible formation of tcnm were also observed when low concentrations 0 0 05 mm of nitrite is present in uv persulfate and post chlorination process no3 and no2 can also be produced from the photolysis of chloramines by uv254 apart from the naturally present ones li and blatchley iii 2008 and chloramines can be generated from the reactions of nh4 with chlorine during water treatment he et al 2016 chloramines mainly as monochloramine are sometimes generated on purpose to provide a lasting disinfection effect and lower formation potentials of thms and haas hua and reckhow 2007 shah et al 2012 shen and andrews 2011 moreover the presence of nh4 in treated waters turns uv chlorine process into uv monochloramine process which can also degrade model contaminants sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019a yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however the transformation from nh4 to don in this process can result in a potential risk of the formation of emerging concerned n dbps shen and andrews 2011 until now the potential risks of n dbp formation has not been widely recognized when the uv chlorine process is used to treat nh4 n containing water and the corresponding mechanism also needs to be further understood herein in order to elucidate the mechanism and track the transformation of nitrogen phenol and benzoic acid were chosen as the target precursor in this study because there is no nitrogen in their structures besides phenol and benzoic acid are discharged into the surface water by sewage from the refining of oil and coal tar industries phipps et al 1981 due to their acute and chronic hazardous effects on human health the us environmental protection agency epa listed phenol and benzoic acid as priority controlled pollutants villegas et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 evaluate the potential threat of tcnm formation when nh4 n containing water is treated by uv chlorine process 2 investigate the influence of nitrogen source ph pre contact time uv irradiation fluence and nitrogen to chlorine n cl molar ratio on the formation of dbps 3 identify the transformation products of phenol and propose the reaction mechanism of phenol to nitrated compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents analytical standards of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol were of analytical grade and were purchased from aladdin industrial co china and used as received suwannee river 2r101n natural organic matter nom was obtained from the international humic substances society ihss usa information on all other chemicals and reagents is available in the si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures all photochemical experiments were carried out in a specially designed uv apparatus fig s1 in si four quartz tubes were evenly placed around a 10 w low pressure hg lamp 254 nm gph 212t5 l4 heraeus noblelight to get uniform irradiation and reduce experimental errors the average uv intensity was measured to be 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 zhou et al 2019 in order to obtain stable uv emission the uv lamp was preheated for 30 min before starting the experiment a cooling system was used to control the experiment temperature at 25 1 c the photochemical experiment was conducted in a 50 ml solution which contained 5 0 mg c l model contaminant e g phenol resorcinol phloroglucinol and nom 20 0 mg l 1 chlorine based on cl2 and a specific molar concentration of nh4 n no3 n or no2 n based on n cl molar ratio of 0 0 5 and 1 0 solution ph 6 5 8 0 was buffered with 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs the solution was magnetically stirred throughout the reaction the free chlorine stock solution was freshly prepared by diluting 10 sodium hypochlorite solution before each experiment after adding chlorine into the quartz tube the experiment was first performed in the dark for a certain period of time 0 15 min then the solution was irradiated by uv for a designed time 10 30 min to get different uv fluence average uv intensity was measured as 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 the residual chlorine in the solution was measured and additional amount of chlorine was added to bring the chlorine concentration to 20 mg l 1 based on cl2 after the irradiation subsequently the water sample was transferred into a headspace free ampere bottle of 20 ml and kept in the dark for 24 h incubation at 25 0 5 c the residual disinfectant was quenched with ascorbic acid prior to the analysis of dbps for uv h2o2 experiments the residual h2o2 can react with chlorine which therefore affect the subsequent chlorination as a result additional chlorine was used to quench residual h2o2 at a molar ratio of 1 1 all trials were performed twice and error bars represent one standard deviation of the average values 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of residual chlorine was measured by using hach dpd free chlorine reagent kits co usa the dissolved organic carbon doc content of the nom stock solution was determined using a toc v analyzer shimadzu japan the concentrations of the formed dbps were measured using purge and trap gas chromatography mass spectrometry pt gc ms the transformation products of phenol were identified using hplc ms ms details of the methods are presented in the si text s2 according to the protocol of previous research the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated by separately dividing the measured concentration of each dbps by the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment and the lc50 value listed in table s1 liu et al 2018 wagner and plewa 2017 based on the density functional theory dft the reaction pathway of phenol and no2 were elucidated using the gaussian 16 program the computational models and details of the program are presented in the si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dbps during chlorination with different pre treatment processes and different nitrogen source as shown in fig 1 a and fig s2a three nitrogen sources no3 nh4 and no2 and three different pre treatment processes uv ps uv h2o2 and uv chlorine were tested to investigate dbps formation potential direct chlorination of phenol without pre treatment process can generate tcm of 77 48 9 67 and 246 12 μg l 1 and tcnm of 0 0 and 0 262 μg l 1 in the presence of no3 nh4 and no2 respectively the phenomenon could be explained by the facts that 1 no3 n as a stable species in water treatment has no obvious impacts on the decay of chlorine and formation of dbps 2 nh4 n reacts with chlorine rapidly to generate chloramines mainly as monochloramine eqs 4 6 qiang and adams 2004 which is less reactive than chlorine and forms less amounts of dbps tian et al 2017 3 as shown in reactions 1 3 scholes et al 2019 shah et al 2011 typical nitrating agent no2 can be produced from the reactions between no2 n and chlorine which can react with phenol 3 2 103 m 1 s 1 scholes et al 2019 much faster than chlorine about 94 m 1 s 1 gallard and von gunten 2002 so more precursors of tcm and tcnm can be generated when no2 n is present in the treated waters when nitrogen sources no3 nh4 and no2 containing waters were pretreated by uv irradiation tcm of 378 67 28 93 and 418 26 μg l 1 and tcnm of 0 51 0 00 and 1 24 μg l 1 were formed during the post chlorination in the presence of no3 nh4 and no2 respectively the variation of tcm formation in the presence absence of uv was mainly due to the degradation of phenol under uv irradiation esplugas et al 2002 of note increasing formation of tcnm was observed during uv post chlorination which should be attributed to the produced rns from uv photolysis of no3 and no2 eqs 7 10 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 nitrated compounds can be generated from the electrophilic substitution reactions between rns and phenolic compounds ji et al 2017 machado and boule 1995 ricoux et al 2001 which has been recognized as typical precursors of tcnm xu et al 2019 due to the low quantum yield of equation 7 φ 0 01 scholes et al 2019 and equation 8 φ 0 0011 benedict et al 2017 the formation of tcnm in the no3 system was limited when uv chlorine process was used as pre treatment for no3 nh4 and no2 containing waters concentrations of formed tcm further increased compared to those pretreated by uv irradiation and tcm formed in nh4 n containing water 728 23 μg l 1 became comparable to that formed in no3 n 734 63 μg l 1 and no2 n 561 25 μg l 1 containing waters the phenomenon was because of the generation of various reactive species from photolysis of chlorine and monochloramine bu et al 2018 xiang et al 2016 so more compounds with smaller molecular weight were generated from uv chlorine process than uv irradiation meanwhile significant increase in formation of tcnm was observed in uv chlorine process in the presence of nh4 129 74 μg l 1 and no2 124 83 μg l 1 this is because reactive species such as oh generated in uv chlorine process could react with no2 to form no2 equation 11 k 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 which simultaneously attacked phenol to form nitrated compounds typical precursors of tcnm to explain the simultaneous occurrence of nitration and degradation induced by no2 and oh the values of ck of no2 and ho were calculated the rate constants of phenol reacting with no2 and ho are 3 2 103 m 1 s 1 scholes et al 2019 and 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively on the other hand the steady state concentration of no2 is reported as 10 9 m in photochemical processes minero et al 2007 wu et al 2019b while steady state concentration of ho usually falls in the range of 10 14 10 12 m in common aops bu et al 2016 fang et al 2014 therefore the values of ck of no2 and ho are comparable leading to the simultaneous occurrence of nitration and hydroxylation in nh4 n containing water chlorine would react with nh4 n at a relatively high rate constant to generate chloramines especially monochloramine fig s3 as shown in fig s3 both chlorine and monochloramine decomposed rapidly when the solution was exposure to uv it was reported that in situ formed chloramines would turn to no3 and no2 under uv photolysis and no2 was the main product at ph 8 0 li and blatchley iii 2008 to further confirm the generation of no2 from photolysis of monochloramine concentrations of no3 and no2 were determined during the uv chlorine process as presented in fig 2 both no3 and no2 were not detected in the dark system first 5 min and concentrations of no3 and no2 were detected at 0 44 and 1 47 mg l 1 when uv irradiated for 20 min the generated no2 was important for the subsequent formation of rns therefore nh4 plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during uv chlorine process because of its transformation to chloramines and nitrite nitrate to better understand the role of uv based aops on the formation of tcnm in the presence of nh4 three different aops uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine employed as pre treatment processes were considered fig 1b and fig s2b as presented in fig s2b the tcm formation potential of uv h2o2 sample was higher than that of uv ps which means that uv h2o2 pre treatment process could degrade phenol into more tcm precursors similar to the previous study reported by xie et al 2015 uv chlorine pre treatment generated the highest concentration of tcm because of its capability to form tcm it is worth noting that tcnm was neither formed in the uv ps nor in the uv h2o2 pre treatment processes but only in the uv chlorine treatment of the nh4 n containing water fig 1b this indicated that the process of chloramines formed from reactions between chlorine and nh4 was the key to form tcnm as shown in the following chlorination reactions 1 no2 hocl clno2 oh 2 clno2 no2 n2o4 cl 3 n2o4 no2 no2 4 hocl nh3 nh2cl h2o 5 hocl nh2cl nhcl2 h2o 6 hocl nhcl2 ncl3 h2o 7 no3 hv no2 o 8 no3 hv no2 o 9 no2 hv no o 10 o h oh 11 no2 oh no2 oh 3 2 effects of influence factors on tcnm formation during uv chlorine process in nh4 n containing water in this experiment four influence factors pre contact time uv fluence n cl ratio and ph were considered to evaluate their effects on tcnm formation the control experiment was conducted at pre contact time of 5 min uv irradiation time of 20 min n cl 1 and ph at 8 0 as shown in fig 3 a and fig s4a tcnm of 84 50 129 74 and 66 61 μg l 1 and tcm of 763 19 728 23 and 616 99 μg l 1 were generated with pre contact time of 0 5 and 15 min respectively the decreasing formation of tcm was mainly due to that fact that more chloramines were generated with the increasing contact time of chlorine and nh4 leading to the reduced formation of tcm during the subsequent processes wu et al 2019a however the formation of tcnm reached the highest yield at the pre contact time of 5 min which can be explained from two aspects 1 more chloramines can be generated with a pre contact time of 5 min compared to 0 min 2 almost all chlorine were transformed to chloramines with a pre contact time of 15 min leading to fewer generation of oh and no2 chuang et al 2017 therefore uv photolysis of a certain amount of chlorine could enhance the no2 generation consequently more nitrophenol was formed through reaction 11 during uv chlorine process with pre contact time of 5 min as the average uv intensity was measured as 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 uv fluence was denoted as uv irradiation time in this study the concentration of tcnm and tcm under 10 20 and 30 min photolysis are presented in fig 3b and fig s4b respectively similar results were obtained from other research work showing that as the uv irradiation fluence increased the concentration of tcm decreased fig s4b ben et al 2016 possible reasons could be that reactive species generated in uv chlorine process degraded tcm jo et al 2011 and precursors of tcm a different trend of formed tcnm was observed the concentration of tcnm was only 16 13 μg l 1 during uv chlorine process at irradiation time of 10 min and reached the highest 129 74 μg l 1 at 20 min then decreased a little bit at 30 min to 126 88 μg l 1 more precursors of tcnm e g nitrophenol during uv chlorine process were produced over time through reactions between rns and phenol the molar ratio of nitrogen to chlorine n cl determines the dominant species of chloramine and thus different n cl 0 0 5 and 1 0 were investigated in this study fig 3c and fig s4c at n cl 0 free chlorine existed as the dominant species thus leading to the absence of tcnm and the maximum concentration of tcm 821 37 μg l 1 as the simulated results proposed by zhang et al 2018a most of nh4 has been oxidized into no3 and only a small amount of monochloramine was formed because of the excessive chlorine at n cl 0 5 consequently the consumption of chlorine and the formation of no3 and monochloramine cause a decrease in the concentration of tcm from 821 37 μg l 1 to 771 35 μg l 1 and the formation of more tcnm from 0 to 55 03 μg l 1 when n cl increased to 1 0 chlorine and nh4 reacted in a molar ratio of 1 1 reaction 4 to produce monochloramine which means that monochloramine became the dominant species at n cl 1 0 resulting in the formation of the highest concentration of tcnm 129 74 μg l 1 these observed results indicated that the effect of chlor am ine species especially monochloramine in the formation of tcnm during the uv chlorine process was particularly significant fig 3d and fig s4d show the formation of tcnm and tcm at different solution ph in the range 6 5 8 0 although the formation of tcnm and tcm showed a similar trend that the concentration of tcnm from 2 58 μg l 1 to 129 74 μg l 1 and tcm from 220 04 μg l 1 to 728 23 μg l 1 increased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the formation of tcnm was more sensitive to the variation of solution ph consistent with other studies chu et al 2009 2012 tcm formation was more pronounced at a higher ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the increase of tcnm was attributed to the photolysis of monochloramine with sensitive ph dependence for example 10 8 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 6 5 44 4 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 7 5 and 56 2 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 8 5 li and blatchley iii 2008 therefore the increase of ph resulted in larger production of no2 through the photolysis of monochloramine which means more precursors of tcnm were generated during the uv chlorine process 3 3 the relationships between formation of tcnm and the structures of model precursors previous studies reported that no2 was readier to react with compounds with phenolic groups ji et al 2017 machado and boule 1995 therefore to elucidate the impact of phenolic contents on the formation of tcnm during the uv chlorine process phenol resorcinol phloroglucinol were compared however resorcinol benzene with two phenolic group and phloroglucinol benzene with three phenolic groups did not produce more tcnm compared to phenol the concentration of tcnm generated from aforementioned three phenolic compounds follows the order phloroglucinol 0 40 μg l 1 resorcinol 0 91 μg l 1 phenol 129 74 μg l 1 fig 4 a notably the concentration of generated tcnm was not proportional to the phenolic contents of model precursors but positively related to the hammett constants σ of precursors the hammett constant reflects the electron donating ability of the substituent and the larger the hammett constant the stronger the electron withdrawing ability gan et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 therefore the reaction of phenolic compounds with no2 is more likely to occur on substances with a small hammett constant because it is an electrophilic substitution reaction and resulting in more tcnm precursors the hammett constants of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol are 0 0 12 and 0 24 gan et al 2019 respectively which are consistent with the results of tcnm formation from uv chlorination of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol fig 4a to further examine the relationship between the hammett constant and the concentration of tcnm produced from model compounds during the uv chlorine process several benzoic acids with different substituent groups 2 chlorobenzoic acid 4 fluorobenzoic acid 3 methylbenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were chosen as precursors and the results are presented in figs 4b and 5 hammett constants of the aforementioned four benzoic acids are 0 277 0 062 0 069 and 0 360 exner and böhm 2002 zhou et al 2019 respectively as shown in fig 4b the concentration of formed tcnm by these four benzoic acids was 23 78 38 17 44 79 and 65 49 μg l 1 respectively and increased with a decrease in the hammett constant of benzoic acids besides the logarithm of the tcnm concentration formed by benzoic acids showed a good linear relationship r2 0 9766 with the corresponding hammett constant and the negative slope of the linear line confirmed that is an electrophilic substitution reaction fig 5 3 4 environmental implications and toxicity assessment according to the discussion of the experimental results in the previous sections certain model compounds in nh4 n containing water have high potential risk of tcnm formation when treated by uv chlorine process nom was used as precursor in this section to evaluate the risk of tcnm formation in natural waters the generated concentration of tcnm tcm and dcan under different treatment processes are shown in fig 6 and fig s5 respectively as shown in fig 6 1 formation of tcnm was not observed during direct chlorination of nom indicating that organic nitrogen in nom is mainly precursor of other n dbps instead of tcnm 2 tcnm of 3 43 μg l 1 and 11 19 μg l 1 were generated from nom when pretreated by uv ps and uv h2o2 process which was because the organic nitrogen in nom was oxidized to nitro group main precursor of tcnm 3 chlorination of nom generated more tcnm when treated by uv chlorine process and the generated tcnm increased with the increase in the amount of nh4 because of the low concentration of formed dcan no more than 2 0 μg l 1 the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of generated tcnm and tcm from nom during the above mentioned processes were evaluated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated by separately dividing the measured concentration of each dbps by the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment and the lc50 value as shown in fig s6 although the concentration of tcm about 200 520 μg l 1 is much higher than that of tcnm about 0 50 μg l 1 the tcnm exhibits greater genotoxicity than tcm in general tcm contributed to most of the cytotoxicity and tcnm contributed to most of the genotoxicity therefore it requires tradeoffs when uv chlorine process is used to treat ammonia containing water due to the high genotoxicity of tcnm 3 5 proposed reaction pathway of phenol with nitrogen dioxide radical and the formation pathway of tcnm to further understand the conversion pathway of nitrogen from nh4 to tcnm during uv chlorine process the transformation products of phenol were identified using hplc ms ms table s2 nitrophenol was detected indicating the involvement of no2 and the evolution profile of nitrophenol versus uv fluence was shown in fig s7 as shown nitrophenol was first generated and then degraded in uv chlorine process which was similar to the trend of tcnm formation fig 3b however the substitute position of the nitro group was unknown due to the three possible attack positions ortho meta and para on phenol therefore gaussian 16 program was used to calculate the energy barrier of each position on phenol and propose a possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 in which the reaction pathway with low energy barrier is easiest to carry out as shown in table s3 and fig 7 the energy barrier from phenol to transition state ts 1 and the energy barrier from intermediate to ts 2 were calculated and compared the following relationship about energy barrier kj mol could be extracted 1 from phenol to ts 1 ortho 106 06 para 107 00 meta 114 32 2 from intermediate to ts 2 ortho 112 51 meta 122 04 para 123 58 which means that the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was more likely to take place on the ortho and para position of phenol based on the previously mentioned reaction positions and products the formation pathway of tcnm was proposed in fig s8 as shown in fig s8 2 and 4 nitrophenol were formed by the attack of no2 on ortho or para position and 2 4 dinitrophenol has also been detected patnaik and khoury 2004 yang et al 2019 during the post chlorination process further ring opening reactions of nitrated phenol resulted in the formation of tcnm and tcm 4 conclusions in this study the potential risk of tcnm formation during the uv chlorine treatment of nh4 n containing water has been investigated and evaluated and the following conclusions could be drawn 1 no2 rather than no3 in the solution plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during uv chlorine pre treatment the risks of tcnm formation during the uv chlorine pre treatment and post chlorination in the nh4 n containing water were due to the formation of no2 and no2 by uv photolysis of monochloramine 2 the formation of tcnm was significantly affected by uv irradiation time n cl and ph as the increase of n cl from 0 to 1 0 and ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the formation of tcnm was enhanced because the yield of no2 under uv photolysis of monochloramine is increased 3 the amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups of the substance was not directly related to the concentration of the formed tcnm the linear relationship between the hammett constant and the concentration of tcnm produced by some model compounds was confirmed 4 the toxicity of formed dbps was mainly due to the high genotoxicity of tcnm and this was especially evident in the nh4 n containing water with uv chlorine pre treatment 5 the possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 was proposed in this study according to the calculation results of gaussian program the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was more likely to take place on the ortho and para position of phenol declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18153,in this study the potential formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm from model organic compounds in ammonia containing water treated by uv chlorine process was evaluated monochloramine generated from the reaction of chlorine and ammonia can be photolyzed to produce no2 and reactive nitrogen species rns which play important roles in the formation of tcnm during the subsequent chlorination the results showed that increase of nitrogen to chlorine molar ratio from 0 to 1 0 and ph from 6 5 to 8 0 enhanced the formation of tcnm mainly due to the increased yield of no2 and rns from the photolyzed monochloramine the formation of tcnm was interestingly found to be linearly correlated with hammett constants of the model precursors which is theoretically related to the rate constants of rns with model compounds enhanced formation of tcnm was also observed during the treatment of natural organic matter by uv chlorine process in ammonia containing water the toxicity assessment showed that tcnm significantly increased the genotoxicity of formed dbps furthermore the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was proved to more likely occur on the ortho and para position of phenol according to the calculation of gaussian program and a possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 was proposed based on the calculated results graphical abstract image 1 keywords ammonia nitrogen chlorination uv irradiation disinfection byproducts trichloronitromethane tcnm 1 introduction in drinking water treatment plants disinfection is a key procedure to ensure the safety of drinking water among various disinfectants chlorine is the most widely used one for water disinfection deborde and von gunten 2008 due to its low cost high capability of inactivating pathogenic microorganisms and controlling odor and taste compounds in water bruchet and duguet 2004 burlingame et al 1992 hoff and geldreich 1981 however chlorine can also react with organic contaminants to produce disinfection byproducts dbps which have potential risks to human health hu et al 2018 richardson et al 2007a yang and zhang 2016 with the frequently emerging toxic dbps and chlorine resistant microorganisms i e giardia and cryptosporidium hijnen et al 2006 ultraviolet uv irradiation has been deemed as an ideal alternative for chlorine however uv irradiation cannot guarantee the lasting safety of water in the distribution system because of the absence of residual therefore uv irradiation is usually combined with chlorination to achieve multiple disinfection effects li et al 2016 ra et al 2019 and consequently this creates a uv chlor am ine process apart from the efficient disinfection performance uv chlorine process has been extensively investigated in the degradation of organic contaminants because of its ability to generate the highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh and chlorine radical cl bu et al 2018 chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 lu et al 2018 sun et al 2018 wu et al 2019a xiang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018b of note uv chlorine process lowers chemical consumption compared to chlorination solely but the formation of dbps is still an important issue that needs more scrutiny in uv chlorine process because of the presence of chlorine and formation of other active chlorine species wang et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 since trichloromethane tcm was detected and identified as dbps in the 1970s bellar et al 1974 a large number of research studies were carried out to elucidate the formation and control of dbps and thousands of dbps have been identified in the disinfected drinking water krasner et al 2006 yang and zhang 2016 although the concentration of nitrogenous dbps n dbps e g haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms is generally lower than the currently regulated carbonaceous dbps c dbps e g trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas n dbps have received more attention in recent years because of their higher genotoxicity and cytotoxicity hu et al 2018 krasner et al 2012 richardson et al 2007b therefore it is crucial to comprehensively investigate the precursors and control of n dbps in the disinfection process dissolved organic nitrogen don which is typically present in the form of amino acids proteins urea and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps has been generally considered as the main precursors of the n dbps during disinfection ackerson et al 2019 bond et al 2011 how et al 2016 shen and andrews 2011 choi and valentine observed the formation of ndma from the chlorination of nitrite containing water but the formation potential was low choi and valentine 2003 in more recent research studies a series of radical chain reactions and generation of oh and reactive nitrogen species rns from the photolysis of nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were observed to take place ge et al 2019 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 these studies reported destruction of model contaminants and formation of nitrated products during the aforementioned process these results reveal that no3 and no2 can be converted to rns via photolysis or reactions with radicals and then turned to don indicating another possible pathway of the n dbps formation xu et al 2019 reported the enhanced formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm when nitrite containing wastewater effluents were irradiated by sunlight in our previous study bu et al 2020 non negligible formation of tcnm were also observed when low concentrations 0 0 05 mm of nitrite is present in uv persulfate and post chlorination process no3 and no2 can also be produced from the photolysis of chloramines by uv254 apart from the naturally present ones li and blatchley iii 2008 and chloramines can be generated from the reactions of nh4 with chlorine during water treatment he et al 2016 chloramines mainly as monochloramine are sometimes generated on purpose to provide a lasting disinfection effect and lower formation potentials of thms and haas hua and reckhow 2007 shah et al 2012 shen and andrews 2011 moreover the presence of nh4 in treated waters turns uv chlorine process into uv monochloramine process which can also degrade model contaminants sun et al 2019 wu et al 2019a yang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 however the transformation from nh4 to don in this process can result in a potential risk of the formation of emerging concerned n dbps shen and andrews 2011 until now the potential risks of n dbp formation has not been widely recognized when the uv chlorine process is used to treat nh4 n containing water and the corresponding mechanism also needs to be further understood herein in order to elucidate the mechanism and track the transformation of nitrogen phenol and benzoic acid were chosen as the target precursor in this study because there is no nitrogen in their structures besides phenol and benzoic acid are discharged into the surface water by sewage from the refining of oil and coal tar industries phipps et al 1981 due to their acute and chronic hazardous effects on human health the us environmental protection agency epa listed phenol and benzoic acid as priority controlled pollutants villegas et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 evaluate the potential threat of tcnm formation when nh4 n containing water is treated by uv chlorine process 2 investigate the influence of nitrogen source ph pre contact time uv irradiation fluence and nitrogen to chlorine n cl molar ratio on the formation of dbps 3 identify the transformation products of phenol and propose the reaction mechanism of phenol to nitrated compounds 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents analytical standards of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol were of analytical grade and were purchased from aladdin industrial co china and used as received suwannee river 2r101n natural organic matter nom was obtained from the international humic substances society ihss usa information on all other chemicals and reagents is available in the si text s1 2 2 experimental procedures all photochemical experiments were carried out in a specially designed uv apparatus fig s1 in si four quartz tubes were evenly placed around a 10 w low pressure hg lamp 254 nm gph 212t5 l4 heraeus noblelight to get uniform irradiation and reduce experimental errors the average uv intensity was measured to be 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 zhou et al 2019 in order to obtain stable uv emission the uv lamp was preheated for 30 min before starting the experiment a cooling system was used to control the experiment temperature at 25 1 c the photochemical experiment was conducted in a 50 ml solution which contained 5 0 mg c l model contaminant e g phenol resorcinol phloroglucinol and nom 20 0 mg l 1 chlorine based on cl2 and a specific molar concentration of nh4 n no3 n or no2 n based on n cl molar ratio of 0 0 5 and 1 0 solution ph 6 5 8 0 was buffered with 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs the solution was magnetically stirred throughout the reaction the free chlorine stock solution was freshly prepared by diluting 10 sodium hypochlorite solution before each experiment after adding chlorine into the quartz tube the experiment was first performed in the dark for a certain period of time 0 15 min then the solution was irradiated by uv for a designed time 10 30 min to get different uv fluence average uv intensity was measured as 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 the residual chlorine in the solution was measured and additional amount of chlorine was added to bring the chlorine concentration to 20 mg l 1 based on cl2 after the irradiation subsequently the water sample was transferred into a headspace free ampere bottle of 20 ml and kept in the dark for 24 h incubation at 25 0 5 c the residual disinfectant was quenched with ascorbic acid prior to the analysis of dbps for uv h2o2 experiments the residual h2o2 can react with chlorine which therefore affect the subsequent chlorination as a result additional chlorine was used to quench residual h2o2 at a molar ratio of 1 1 all trials were performed twice and error bars represent one standard deviation of the average values 2 3 analytical methods the concentration of residual chlorine was measured by using hach dpd free chlorine reagent kits co usa the dissolved organic carbon doc content of the nom stock solution was determined using a toc v analyzer shimadzu japan the concentrations of the formed dbps were measured using purge and trap gas chromatography mass spectrometry pt gc ms the transformation products of phenol were identified using hplc ms ms details of the methods are presented in the si text s2 according to the protocol of previous research the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated by separately dividing the measured concentration of each dbps by the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment and the lc50 value listed in table s1 liu et al 2018 wagner and plewa 2017 based on the density functional theory dft the reaction pathway of phenol and no2 were elucidated using the gaussian 16 program the computational models and details of the program are presented in the si text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 formation of dbps during chlorination with different pre treatment processes and different nitrogen source as shown in fig 1 a and fig s2a three nitrogen sources no3 nh4 and no2 and three different pre treatment processes uv ps uv h2o2 and uv chlorine were tested to investigate dbps formation potential direct chlorination of phenol without pre treatment process can generate tcm of 77 48 9 67 and 246 12 μg l 1 and tcnm of 0 0 and 0 262 μg l 1 in the presence of no3 nh4 and no2 respectively the phenomenon could be explained by the facts that 1 no3 n as a stable species in water treatment has no obvious impacts on the decay of chlorine and formation of dbps 2 nh4 n reacts with chlorine rapidly to generate chloramines mainly as monochloramine eqs 4 6 qiang and adams 2004 which is less reactive than chlorine and forms less amounts of dbps tian et al 2017 3 as shown in reactions 1 3 scholes et al 2019 shah et al 2011 typical nitrating agent no2 can be produced from the reactions between no2 n and chlorine which can react with phenol 3 2 103 m 1 s 1 scholes et al 2019 much faster than chlorine about 94 m 1 s 1 gallard and von gunten 2002 so more precursors of tcm and tcnm can be generated when no2 n is present in the treated waters when nitrogen sources no3 nh4 and no2 containing waters were pretreated by uv irradiation tcm of 378 67 28 93 and 418 26 μg l 1 and tcnm of 0 51 0 00 and 1 24 μg l 1 were formed during the post chlorination in the presence of no3 nh4 and no2 respectively the variation of tcm formation in the presence absence of uv was mainly due to the degradation of phenol under uv irradiation esplugas et al 2002 of note increasing formation of tcnm was observed during uv post chlorination which should be attributed to the produced rns from uv photolysis of no3 and no2 eqs 7 10 huang et al 2018 scholes et al 2019 nitrated compounds can be generated from the electrophilic substitution reactions between rns and phenolic compounds ji et al 2017 machado and boule 1995 ricoux et al 2001 which has been recognized as typical precursors of tcnm xu et al 2019 due to the low quantum yield of equation 7 φ 0 01 scholes et al 2019 and equation 8 φ 0 0011 benedict et al 2017 the formation of tcnm in the no3 system was limited when uv chlorine process was used as pre treatment for no3 nh4 and no2 containing waters concentrations of formed tcm further increased compared to those pretreated by uv irradiation and tcm formed in nh4 n containing water 728 23 μg l 1 became comparable to that formed in no3 n 734 63 μg l 1 and no2 n 561 25 μg l 1 containing waters the phenomenon was because of the generation of various reactive species from photolysis of chlorine and monochloramine bu et al 2018 xiang et al 2016 so more compounds with smaller molecular weight were generated from uv chlorine process than uv irradiation meanwhile significant increase in formation of tcnm was observed in uv chlorine process in the presence of nh4 129 74 μg l 1 and no2 124 83 μg l 1 this is because reactive species such as oh generated in uv chlorine process could react with no2 to form no2 equation 11 k 1 0 1010 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 which simultaneously attacked phenol to form nitrated compounds typical precursors of tcnm to explain the simultaneous occurrence of nitration and degradation induced by no2 and oh the values of ck of no2 and ho were calculated the rate constants of phenol reacting with no2 and ho are 3 2 103 m 1 s 1 scholes et al 2019 and 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 respectively on the other hand the steady state concentration of no2 is reported as 10 9 m in photochemical processes minero et al 2007 wu et al 2019b while steady state concentration of ho usually falls in the range of 10 14 10 12 m in common aops bu et al 2016 fang et al 2014 therefore the values of ck of no2 and ho are comparable leading to the simultaneous occurrence of nitration and hydroxylation in nh4 n containing water chlorine would react with nh4 n at a relatively high rate constant to generate chloramines especially monochloramine fig s3 as shown in fig s3 both chlorine and monochloramine decomposed rapidly when the solution was exposure to uv it was reported that in situ formed chloramines would turn to no3 and no2 under uv photolysis and no2 was the main product at ph 8 0 li and blatchley iii 2008 to further confirm the generation of no2 from photolysis of monochloramine concentrations of no3 and no2 were determined during the uv chlorine process as presented in fig 2 both no3 and no2 were not detected in the dark system first 5 min and concentrations of no3 and no2 were detected at 0 44 and 1 47 mg l 1 when uv irradiated for 20 min the generated no2 was important for the subsequent formation of rns therefore nh4 plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during uv chlorine process because of its transformation to chloramines and nitrite nitrate to better understand the role of uv based aops on the formation of tcnm in the presence of nh4 three different aops uv ps uv h2o2 uv chlorine employed as pre treatment processes were considered fig 1b and fig s2b as presented in fig s2b the tcm formation potential of uv h2o2 sample was higher than that of uv ps which means that uv h2o2 pre treatment process could degrade phenol into more tcm precursors similar to the previous study reported by xie et al 2015 uv chlorine pre treatment generated the highest concentration of tcm because of its capability to form tcm it is worth noting that tcnm was neither formed in the uv ps nor in the uv h2o2 pre treatment processes but only in the uv chlorine treatment of the nh4 n containing water fig 1b this indicated that the process of chloramines formed from reactions between chlorine and nh4 was the key to form tcnm as shown in the following chlorination reactions 1 no2 hocl clno2 oh 2 clno2 no2 n2o4 cl 3 n2o4 no2 no2 4 hocl nh3 nh2cl h2o 5 hocl nh2cl nhcl2 h2o 6 hocl nhcl2 ncl3 h2o 7 no3 hv no2 o 8 no3 hv no2 o 9 no2 hv no o 10 o h oh 11 no2 oh no2 oh 3 2 effects of influence factors on tcnm formation during uv chlorine process in nh4 n containing water in this experiment four influence factors pre contact time uv fluence n cl ratio and ph were considered to evaluate their effects on tcnm formation the control experiment was conducted at pre contact time of 5 min uv irradiation time of 20 min n cl 1 and ph at 8 0 as shown in fig 3 a and fig s4a tcnm of 84 50 129 74 and 66 61 μg l 1 and tcm of 763 19 728 23 and 616 99 μg l 1 were generated with pre contact time of 0 5 and 15 min respectively the decreasing formation of tcm was mainly due to that fact that more chloramines were generated with the increasing contact time of chlorine and nh4 leading to the reduced formation of tcm during the subsequent processes wu et al 2019a however the formation of tcnm reached the highest yield at the pre contact time of 5 min which can be explained from two aspects 1 more chloramines can be generated with a pre contact time of 5 min compared to 0 min 2 almost all chlorine were transformed to chloramines with a pre contact time of 15 min leading to fewer generation of oh and no2 chuang et al 2017 therefore uv photolysis of a certain amount of chlorine could enhance the no2 generation consequently more nitrophenol was formed through reaction 11 during uv chlorine process with pre contact time of 5 min as the average uv intensity was measured as 3 54 10 6 e s 1 l 1 uv fluence was denoted as uv irradiation time in this study the concentration of tcnm and tcm under 10 20 and 30 min photolysis are presented in fig 3b and fig s4b respectively similar results were obtained from other research work showing that as the uv irradiation fluence increased the concentration of tcm decreased fig s4b ben et al 2016 possible reasons could be that reactive species generated in uv chlorine process degraded tcm jo et al 2011 and precursors of tcm a different trend of formed tcnm was observed the concentration of tcnm was only 16 13 μg l 1 during uv chlorine process at irradiation time of 10 min and reached the highest 129 74 μg l 1 at 20 min then decreased a little bit at 30 min to 126 88 μg l 1 more precursors of tcnm e g nitrophenol during uv chlorine process were produced over time through reactions between rns and phenol the molar ratio of nitrogen to chlorine n cl determines the dominant species of chloramine and thus different n cl 0 0 5 and 1 0 were investigated in this study fig 3c and fig s4c at n cl 0 free chlorine existed as the dominant species thus leading to the absence of tcnm and the maximum concentration of tcm 821 37 μg l 1 as the simulated results proposed by zhang et al 2018a most of nh4 has been oxidized into no3 and only a small amount of monochloramine was formed because of the excessive chlorine at n cl 0 5 consequently the consumption of chlorine and the formation of no3 and monochloramine cause a decrease in the concentration of tcm from 821 37 μg l 1 to 771 35 μg l 1 and the formation of more tcnm from 0 to 55 03 μg l 1 when n cl increased to 1 0 chlorine and nh4 reacted in a molar ratio of 1 1 reaction 4 to produce monochloramine which means that monochloramine became the dominant species at n cl 1 0 resulting in the formation of the highest concentration of tcnm 129 74 μg l 1 these observed results indicated that the effect of chlor am ine species especially monochloramine in the formation of tcnm during the uv chlorine process was particularly significant fig 3d and fig s4d show the formation of tcnm and tcm at different solution ph in the range 6 5 8 0 although the formation of tcnm and tcm showed a similar trend that the concentration of tcnm from 2 58 μg l 1 to 129 74 μg l 1 and tcm from 220 04 μg l 1 to 728 23 μg l 1 increased with increasing ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the formation of tcnm was more sensitive to the variation of solution ph consistent with other studies chu et al 2009 2012 tcm formation was more pronounced at a higher ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the increase of tcnm was attributed to the photolysis of monochloramine with sensitive ph dependence for example 10 8 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 6 5 44 4 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 7 5 and 56 2 of monochloramine was converted to no2 at ph 8 5 li and blatchley iii 2008 therefore the increase of ph resulted in larger production of no2 through the photolysis of monochloramine which means more precursors of tcnm were generated during the uv chlorine process 3 3 the relationships between formation of tcnm and the structures of model precursors previous studies reported that no2 was readier to react with compounds with phenolic groups ji et al 2017 machado and boule 1995 therefore to elucidate the impact of phenolic contents on the formation of tcnm during the uv chlorine process phenol resorcinol phloroglucinol were compared however resorcinol benzene with two phenolic group and phloroglucinol benzene with three phenolic groups did not produce more tcnm compared to phenol the concentration of tcnm generated from aforementioned three phenolic compounds follows the order phloroglucinol 0 40 μg l 1 resorcinol 0 91 μg l 1 phenol 129 74 μg l 1 fig 4 a notably the concentration of generated tcnm was not proportional to the phenolic contents of model precursors but positively related to the hammett constants σ of precursors the hammett constant reflects the electron donating ability of the substituent and the larger the hammett constant the stronger the electron withdrawing ability gan et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 therefore the reaction of phenolic compounds with no2 is more likely to occur on substances with a small hammett constant because it is an electrophilic substitution reaction and resulting in more tcnm precursors the hammett constants of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol are 0 0 12 and 0 24 gan et al 2019 respectively which are consistent with the results of tcnm formation from uv chlorination of phenol resorcinol and phloroglucinol fig 4a to further examine the relationship between the hammett constant and the concentration of tcnm produced from model compounds during the uv chlorine process several benzoic acids with different substituent groups 2 chlorobenzoic acid 4 fluorobenzoic acid 3 methylbenzoic acid and 4 hydroxybenzoic acid were chosen as precursors and the results are presented in figs 4b and 5 hammett constants of the aforementioned four benzoic acids are 0 277 0 062 0 069 and 0 360 exner and böhm 2002 zhou et al 2019 respectively as shown in fig 4b the concentration of formed tcnm by these four benzoic acids was 23 78 38 17 44 79 and 65 49 μg l 1 respectively and increased with a decrease in the hammett constant of benzoic acids besides the logarithm of the tcnm concentration formed by benzoic acids showed a good linear relationship r2 0 9766 with the corresponding hammett constant and the negative slope of the linear line confirmed that is an electrophilic substitution reaction fig 5 3 4 environmental implications and toxicity assessment according to the discussion of the experimental results in the previous sections certain model compounds in nh4 n containing water have high potential risk of tcnm formation when treated by uv chlorine process nom was used as precursor in this section to evaluate the risk of tcnm formation in natural waters the generated concentration of tcnm tcm and dcan under different treatment processes are shown in fig 6 and fig s5 respectively as shown in fig 6 1 formation of tcnm was not observed during direct chlorination of nom indicating that organic nitrogen in nom is mainly precursor of other n dbps instead of tcnm 2 tcnm of 3 43 μg l 1 and 11 19 μg l 1 were generated from nom when pretreated by uv ps and uv h2o2 process which was because the organic nitrogen in nom was oxidized to nitro group main precursor of tcnm 3 chlorination of nom generated more tcnm when treated by uv chlorine process and the generated tcnm increased with the increase in the amount of nh4 because of the low concentration of formed dcan no more than 2 0 μg l 1 the genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of generated tcnm and tcm from nom during the above mentioned processes were evaluated genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were calculated by separately dividing the measured concentration of each dbps by the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment and the lc50 value as shown in fig s6 although the concentration of tcm about 200 520 μg l 1 is much higher than that of tcnm about 0 50 μg l 1 the tcnm exhibits greater genotoxicity than tcm in general tcm contributed to most of the cytotoxicity and tcnm contributed to most of the genotoxicity therefore it requires tradeoffs when uv chlorine process is used to treat ammonia containing water due to the high genotoxicity of tcnm 3 5 proposed reaction pathway of phenol with nitrogen dioxide radical and the formation pathway of tcnm to further understand the conversion pathway of nitrogen from nh4 to tcnm during uv chlorine process the transformation products of phenol were identified using hplc ms ms table s2 nitrophenol was detected indicating the involvement of no2 and the evolution profile of nitrophenol versus uv fluence was shown in fig s7 as shown nitrophenol was first generated and then degraded in uv chlorine process which was similar to the trend of tcnm formation fig 3b however the substitute position of the nitro group was unknown due to the three possible attack positions ortho meta and para on phenol therefore gaussian 16 program was used to calculate the energy barrier of each position on phenol and propose a possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 in which the reaction pathway with low energy barrier is easiest to carry out as shown in table s3 and fig 7 the energy barrier from phenol to transition state ts 1 and the energy barrier from intermediate to ts 2 were calculated and compared the following relationship about energy barrier kj mol could be extracted 1 from phenol to ts 1 ortho 106 06 para 107 00 meta 114 32 2 from intermediate to ts 2 ortho 112 51 meta 122 04 para 123 58 which means that the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was more likely to take place on the ortho and para position of phenol based on the previously mentioned reaction positions and products the formation pathway of tcnm was proposed in fig s8 as shown in fig s8 2 and 4 nitrophenol were formed by the attack of no2 on ortho or para position and 2 4 dinitrophenol has also been detected patnaik and khoury 2004 yang et al 2019 during the post chlorination process further ring opening reactions of nitrated phenol resulted in the formation of tcnm and tcm 4 conclusions in this study the potential risk of tcnm formation during the uv chlorine treatment of nh4 n containing water has been investigated and evaluated and the following conclusions could be drawn 1 no2 rather than no3 in the solution plays an important role in the formation of tcnm during uv chlorine pre treatment the risks of tcnm formation during the uv chlorine pre treatment and post chlorination in the nh4 n containing water were due to the formation of no2 and no2 by uv photolysis of monochloramine 2 the formation of tcnm was significantly affected by uv irradiation time n cl and ph as the increase of n cl from 0 to 1 0 and ph from 6 5 to 8 0 the formation of tcnm was enhanced because the yield of no2 under uv photolysis of monochloramine is increased 3 the amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups of the substance was not directly related to the concentration of the formed tcnm the linear relationship between the hammett constant and the concentration of tcnm produced by some model compounds was confirmed 4 the toxicity of formed dbps was mainly due to the high genotoxicity of tcnm and this was especially evident in the nh4 n containing water with uv chlorine pre treatment 5 the possible reaction pathway of phenol and no2 was proposed in this study according to the calculation results of gaussian program the electrophilic substitution reaction of no2 was more likely to take place on the ortho and para position of phenol declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

18154,activation of persulfates i e peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is reported to be effective in oxidative treatment of environmental contaminants it has been widely accepted in numerous literature that sulfate radical so4 formed from the decomposition of persulfates activated by aqueous fe ii released from nzvi corrosion is responsible for the oxidative performance in nzvi persulfates systems in this work by employing methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe we demonstrated that the activation of persulfates by nzvi through electron transfer led to so4 formation while the homogeneous activation of persulfate by the released fe ii resulted in ferryl ion species fe iv generation in nzvi persulfates systems similarly nanoscale zero valent aluminum nzval and zinc nzvzn were also demonstrated to be able to donate electron to persulfates leading to so4 formation however the insulative aluminum oxide shell hindered the electron transfer leading to the poor persulfates decomposition while the conductive iron and zinc oxide shell enabled the electron transfer process resulting in a continuous generation of so4 further it was obtained that the relative contribution of so4 and fe iv in nzvi persulfates systems was independent of the initial concentration of nzvi and pds but was positively correlated with pms concentration in addition the increase of ph from 3 to 7 led to the decrease of the relative contribution of fe iv which was rationalized by the decrease of availability of aqueous fe ii at higher ph our findings not only shed lights on the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the nzvi persulfates systems but also unprecedentedly distinguished the surface activation of persulfates from the homogeneous catalysis process graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes nanoscale zero valent iron peroxymonosulfate peroxydisulfate sulfate radical ferryl ion 1 introduction in situ

al 2017 wang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 iron containing catalysts aqueous fe ii and heterogeneous materials are considered to be one of the most feasible activators for persulfates activation due to the low cost high reactivity environmentally friendly nature as well as abundant reserves of iron liang and guo 2010 zhong et al 2015 bae et al 2018 comparing with aqueous fe ii salts nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is a more viable option for persulfates activation because nzvi not only declines the competitive consumption of the in situ formed reactive intermediate s by superfluous dissolved fe ii but also is more superior in migration in subsurface lefevre et al 2016 kim et al 2018 ike et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the combination of nzvi and persulfates has achieved a good

scale and pilot scale studies there is a good agreement in numerous literature that the activation of persulfates by nzvi leading to the formation of reactive intermediate can be described as the following two steps al shamsi and thomson 2013 oh et al 2016 yun et al 2017 kim et al 2018 firstly nzvi is corroded by h dissolved oxygen and persulfate ions s2o8 2 or hso5 to form fe ii eqs 1 4 1 fe0

formation of pmso2 is obtained when pmso is oxidized by the fe ii pds and fe ii pms systems at acidic and near neutral ph and the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 produced to pmso lost is quantified to be approximately 100 under acidic conditions however the assessment on the relative contribution of fe iv vs so4 in the nzvi persulfates systems is totally absent in previous studies most of them concerning the nzvi persulfates systems focused on the investigation of factors e g reactants dosage and nzvi corrosion affecting the degradation efficiency of various contaminants the objective of this study is to clarify the nature of the reactive intermediate s formed in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems by monitoring the degradation of pmso as well as the generation of pmso2 product in both systems influences of the initial concentrations of oxidants pds 0 and pms 0 and nzvi nzvi 0 as well as solution ph with or without ph control on the relative contribution of different reactive intermediates are investigated in parallel the transformation of pmso in the nanoscale zero valent aluminum nzval and zinc nzvzn activated persulfates is investigated meanwhile the transformation of pmso by the nzvi hydrogen peroxide h2o2 system is also conducted at similar conditions to make a comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

oxone and na2s2o8 in ultrapure water and standardized by an abts method yang et al 2015 and a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 respectively the purchased h2o2 standard solution was diluted to prepare the h2o2 stock solutions which were standardized by an n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase method bader et al 1998 2 2 experimental procedure batch experiments were carried out in a 1 l cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a glass stirrer at well controlled temperature 20 1 c to initiate a reaction an aliquot of one oxidant pds pms or h2o2 and a quantified amount of nanoscale metallic activator nzvi nzval or nzvzn were simultaneously added into the reactor containing pmso solutions at ph 3 were adjusted using hclo4 and or naoh sodium acetate buffer 10 mm and sodium borate buffer 10 mm were used for ph 4 6 and 7 respectively in the experiments with ph control in parallel experiments without buffer were also conducted in which the initial ph of 4 7 was pre adjusted by hclo4 and or naoh samples 0 9 ml were collected at pre determined time and quickly quenched by excess dmso 0 1 ml each sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter before analyses with high performance liquid chromatography hplc or electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with hplc hplc esi qqqms all experiments were independently triplicated to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical methods total dissolved iron was spectrophotometrically analyzed by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method keenan and sedlak 2008 pmso and pmso2 analysis were performed with a hplc waters 2695 equipped with a uv detector waters 2487 as described previously wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the hplc esi qqqms analysis was conducted using the absciex qtrap 5500 ms integrated with an agilent 1260 hplc at enhanced product ion epi mode detailed operating parameters for the hplc esi qqqms analysis were identical to those adopted in our previous work as shown in si text s1 wang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in different nzvi oxygenation processes 3 1 1 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the nzvi persulfates systems the typical transformation of pmso 100 μm by persulfates 200 μm activated by nzvi 0 01 g l was investigated at ph 3 it was obtained that pmso loss at 60 and 10 min i e δ pmso 60 and δ pmso 10 were 70 and 48 μm in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms system fig 1 a respectively due to the relatively fast oxidation of pmso by pms alone 0 14 m 1s 1 ph 3 7 note that this rate constant is shown with a wrong unit in our recent work wang et al 2019a pmso transformation by the nzvi pms system was only investigated in 10 min during which less than 2 μm pmso was degraded by pms alone fig s2 moreover the production of pmso2 was monitored as shown in fig 1b about 54 and 30 μm pmso2 were generated at 60 and 10 min i e δ pmso2 60 and δ pmso2 10 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms system respectively indicating that fe iv was formed in both systems further the yield of pmso2 was quantified to evaluate the contribution of fe iv to pmso degradation as shown the η pmso2 value kept constant with the reaction progressing and it was about 80 and 60 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems respectively fig 1c comparatively the η pmso2 value was quantified to be approximately 100 when pmso was oxidized in the fe ii persulfates systems eqs 7 and 8 under acidic conditions in our very recent work wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b accordingly the η pmso2 value below 100 in the nzvi persulfates systems indicated the presence of a non fe iv involved pmso transformation pathway see detailed discussion below 3 1 2 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the nzvi o2 and nzvi h2o2 systems the transformation of pmso 100 μm during nzvi 0 01 g l oxygenation without persulfates i e nzvi o2 system was studied in parallel it was found that 9 μm pmso was slowly degraded within 60 min in the nzvi o2 system fig 1a while no pmso2 production was obtained this result was ascribed to the fenton reaction induced by the aerobic corrosion of nzvi which has been well documented in previous literature hug and leupin 2003 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee et al 2008 kim et al 2015 he et al 2016 specifically nzvi reacts with o2 to produce h2o2 eq 12 accompanying with the release of aqueous fe ii which is further oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 with superoxide radical o2 as an intermediate eqs 13 and 14 the in situ generated h2o2 competitively oxidize fe ii to produce oh at acidic ph eq 15 which is responsible for pmso degradation in the nzvi o2 system 12 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 13 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 14 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 15 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh for comparison the transformation of pmso by the nzvi h2o2 system was studied under similar conditions to the nzvi persulfates systems as expected no pmso2 production was obtained although pmso was continuously degraded within 60 min fig 1 3 2 probing the non fe iv involved pmso transformation in the nzvi persulfates systems 3 2 1 alcohol scavenging effect on pmso transformation persulfates activation by monometallic catalysts can be categorized into two distinct pathways in terms of the role of persulfates radical precursors or electron acceptors i electron is transferred from metal catalysts to persulfates with the formation of metal ions and so4 e g zero valent aluminum nidheesh et al 2018 khatri et al 2018 and zinc li et al 2014a chen et al 2018 ii electron is delivered from organic contaminants to persulfates by conductive materials e g noble metals pd and au ahn et al 2016 chen et al 2018 with using persulfates as electron acceptors without forming so4 these two activation pathways i e so4 involved persulfates activation and conductive metal mediated electron shuttle are suspected to be involved in the non fe iv induced pmso degradation in the nzvi persulfates systems additionally oh generated via the aerobic corrosion of nzvi eqs 12 15 may also make contribution to pmso degradation alcohol scavenging experiments with using ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba 10 or 100 mm to capture the reactive intermediate s formed in nzvi 0 01 g l activated persulfates 200 μm were conducted the difference in the reaction rates between two alcohols and several reactive intermediates oh so4 or fe iv table s1 suggests that etoh is an excellent scavenger for the three reactive intermediates while tba only exhibits strong capacity on scavenging oh as shown in fig 2 a pmso degradation was greatly inhibited by 10 mm etoh in both nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems with adding 100 mm etoh even no pmso degradation was obtained in the nzvi pds system and about only 2 μm pmso was degraded in the nzvi pms system due to the oxidation of pmso by pms alone fig 2 vs fig s2 this result revealed that nzvi could not mediate electron transfer from pmso to persulfates which was also stated by yun et al 2017 who found that 4 chlorophenol degradation in the nzvi persulfates systems was obviously inhibited by excess methanol further 10 mm tba showed negligible effect on pmso degradation which ruled out the involvement of oh accordingly so4 was the most reasonable candidate for the intermediate which was responsible for the non fe iv induced pmso degradation this was further verified by exploring the potential formation of the so4 involved biphenyl products of pmso see eq 10 for their chemical structure when pmso was treated by the nzvi persulfates systems as expected these biphenyl compounds with molecular ions of m z 217 0 or 341 0 were identified see figs s3 6 for their hplc esi qqqms chromatograms and product ion spectra obtained at epi mode additionally with adding 100 mm tba pmso degradation was also reduced to some extent in both systems which was attributed to the competitive consumption of fe iv and so4 by excess tba the identification of so4 also well explain the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo trapped electron spin resonance esr spectra of the nzvi persulfates systems obtained in previous studies where an obvious signal of dmpo so4 adduct is observed zhu et al 2016 yun et al 2017 tan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 song et al 2019 furthermore it was found that the pmso2 production was also inhibited by adding alcohol scavengers except for the cases with adding 10 mm tba figs s7a and b due to the scavenging of fe iv by excess alcohol the yield of pmso2 was increased to different extents with using different concentrations of etoh and tba figs s7c and d which was reasonably explained by the stronger ability of etoh and tba on scavenging so4 than fe iv table s1 3 2 2 mechanistic insights for so4 involved persulfates activation in the nzvi persulfates systems since the primary reactive intermediates formed in persulfates activation by aqueous fe ii has been identified as fe iv wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b it is reasonable to propose that the heterogeneous persulfates activation by nzvi was responsible for the so4 formation as illustrated in fig 3 16 fe0 2s2o8 2 fe2 2so4 2so4 2 17 fe0 2hso5 fe2 2so4 2oh in general the inherent core shell structure of nzvi would prevent the attachment of nzvi core by persulfates unless depassivating the nzvi surface such as the dissolution of iron oxide shell by acid lai and lo 2008 han et al 2016 kim et al 2018 bae et al 2018 hu et al 2019 however several literature has reported that the iron oxide shell especially the magnetite content of nzvi has a property of n type semiconductor which enables the electron transfer from nzvi core to the electron acceptors on nzvi surface wilhelm 1979 li and zhang 2006 2007 mu et al 2017 for instance liu et al 2014 reported that iron oxide shell could transport electron from nzvi core to the divalent metal cations e g co ii ni ii and cu ii complexed on the nzvi surface leading to the reduction of these cations kim et al 2018 proposed that the electron transfer from nzvi core e0 0 44 v to pds e0 2 0 v through the outer shell via bulk conduction was crucial to the core shell evolution of nzvi in nzvi pds system nevertheless the formation of so4 resulting from persulfates activation by nzvi through electron transfer has never been realized in previous literature this may be attributed to the limitations of the common identification methods e g alcohol scavenging assay and esr spectra technique which cannot distinguish the persulfates activation on nzvi surface from its homogeneous activation by aqueous fe ii further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the electron transfer induced persulfates decomposition with forming so4 3 2 3 comparison with pmso transformation in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems the feasibility of the direct electron transfer from metallic catalysts to persulfates with producing so4 has been documented in the nzval and nzvzn activated persulfates processes eqs 18 21 nidheesh et al 2018 khatri et al 2018 chen et al 2018 18 2al0 s2o8 2 6h 1 5o2 2al3 2so4 3h2o 19 al0 3hso5 3h al3 3so4 3h2o 20 zn0 2s2o8 2 zn2 2so4 2so4 2 21 zn0 2hso5 zn2 2so4 2oh this is further demonstrated in this study by monitoring pmso 100 μm transformation in nzval or nzvzn 0 5 g l activated persulfates 200 μm at ph 3 as shown in fig 4 pmso was degraded to different extents in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems while negligible pmso2 production was obtained in cases with pds and less than 2 μm pmso2 was produced in cases with pms as a result of pmso oxidation by pms alone fig s8 notably it was observed that pmso degradation in the nzval pds system was extremely slow in the first 2 h comparing with the relatively fast pmso degradation in the next 2 h fig 4a although the two stage degradation was not observed in pmso transformation by the nzval pms system owing to the relative short investigation time 10 min fig 4b it was obtained during the treatment of other contaminants e g surfactant by the zval activated pms arslan alaton et al 2017 however the two stage degradation of pmso was not observed in the nzvzn persulfates systems fig 4 similar to the case of nzvi fig 1 likewise bokare and choi 2009 and shen et al 2018 observed that the degradation of contaminants atrazine or 4 chlorophenol by aerobic corrosion of zval zval o2 system was also divided into a slow initial degradation stage and a subsequent rapid degradation period whereas in the zvi o2 system these contaminants were degraded at a relatively constant rate these results were rationalized by the fact that aluminum oxide was insulator nguyen et al 2018 while zinc oxide was a well documented semiconductor kong et al 2004 similar to the iron oxide shell as aforementioned therefore the reaction between nzval and oxidants would be initiated only when the inert aluminum oxide was dissolved by h shen et al 2018 accordingly the distinct kinetic trends of pmso degradation in nzvi persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems versus nzval persulfates systems further supported the essential role of conductive iron oxide shell in mediating electron transfer from nzvi core to persulfates 3 3 factors affecting the relative contribution of fe iv versus so4 in the nzvi pds system 3 3 1 effect of nzvi initial concentration the effect of nzvi initial concentration nzvi 0 0 0025 0 025 g l on the transformation of pmso 100 μm at fixed pds 200 μm or pms 200 μm was evaluated at ph 3 in the nzvi pds system the increase of nzvi 0 from 0 0025 to 0 01 g l promoted δ pmso 60 and δ pmso2 60 from 32 to 70 μm and 24 54 μm respectively and then further increasing nzvi 0 0 025 g l caused an appreciable decline of them fig 5 a and b similarly the maxima of δ pmso 10 and δ pmso2 10 in the fe ii pms system were also achieved at 0 01 g l nzvi 0 fig 5c and d these results were explained by the competitive consumption of fe iv eq 22 mártire et al 2002 and so4 eq 23 buxton et al 1997 by excess aqueous fe ii released from nzvi corrosion 22 feivo2 fe2 2h 2fe3 h2o k 1 4 105 m 1s 1 ph 1 23 so4 fe2 fe3 so4 2 k 4 6 109 m 1s 1 however the η pmso2 values remained constant at about 80 and 60 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems respectively which was independent of nzvi 0 fig 5 the lower η pmso2 value obtained in the nzvi pms system suggested that the relative contribution of so4 on the pmso degradation was higher in the nzvi pms system eq 17 than that in the case with pds eq 16 this was in accordance with the fact that the decomposition of persulfate and release of dissolved iron in the nzvi pms system were faster than those in the nzvi pds system fig s9 3 3 2 effect of persulfates initial concentration the influence of the initial concentration of persulfates pds 0 or pms 0 over a range of 50 500 μm at fixed nzvi 0 0 01 g l and pmso 0 100 μm at ph 3 was investigated as pds 0 rose up from 50 to 500 mm δ pmso 60 and δ pmso2 60 were obviously promoted from 17 to 93 μm and 13 to 64 μm respectively fig 6 a and b however in the nzvi pms system δ pmso 10 and δ pmso2 10 reached the maxima at 200 μm pms 0 and then a significant decrease of them was observed at higher pms 0 500 μm fig 6c and d the discrepancy on the effect of pds and pms initial concentration on δ pmso and δ pmso2 was explained by the stronger consumption of the reactive intermediates by pms eq 24 das 2001 and eq 25 wang et al 2019a than that by pds eq 26 yu et al 2004 and eq 27 wang et al 2018 24 so4 hso5 so5 so4 2 h k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 25 feivo2 hso5 fe3 so5 oh k 2 0 105 m 1s 1 ph 1 26 so4 s2o8 2 s2o8 so4 2 k 5 8 102 ph 4 5 5 105 m 1s 1 ph 2 27 feivo2 s2o8 2 h fe3 s2o8 oh k 1 0 104 m 1s 1 ph 1 moreover the calculated η pmso2 value remained constant at about 80 which was independent of pds 0 fig 6c while it increased from about 40 to 75 with increasing pms 0 from 50 to 500 μm fig 6d it was further observed that the modified η pmso2 value obtained by subtracting the contribution of pmso transformation by pms alone was still linearly dependent on pms 0 table s2 one possible explanation for the pms 0 dependent change of η pmso2 value was that the competitive consumption of so4 by pms eq 24 was much stronger than that of fe iv by pms eq 25 leading to the improvement of fe iv contribution on pmso degradation with increasing pms 0 3 3 3 effect of ph 3 3 3 1 controlling ph with buffer the effect of solution ph was investigated at ph 3 7 under typical conditions i e 200 μm persulfates 0 0 01 g l nzvi 0 and 100 μm pmso 0 with careful ph control as shown in fig 7 a and b δ pmso t and δ pmso2 t decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 in both nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems moreover it was observed that the calculated η pmso2 value increased from about 80 to 91 with ph increasing from 3 to 4 in the nzvi pds system and then η pmso2 dramatically decreased to 0 with ph further increasing to 7 similarly the maximum η pmso2 value 81 in the nzvi pms system was also obtained at ph 4 the increase of η pmso2 from ph 3 to 4 in both systems was likely ascribed to the fact that the second order rate constant of the reaction between so4 and ch3cooh 2 0 105 herrmann et al 1999 was 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the reaction between fe iv and acetate 3 1 0 5 m 1s 1 ph 0 jacobsen et al 1998 this was verified by exploring the effect of sodium acetate concentration on η pmso2 value obtained in the nzvi persulfates systems at ph 3 and 4 as expected the η pmso2 value was increased with increasing sodium acetate concentration from 0 to 20 mm at both cases of ph 3 and 4 figs s10 and s11 further it was obtained that η pmso2 value was higher at ph 3 than that at ph 4 in both nzvi persulfates systems at identical concentration of sodium acetate several facts may account for the decline of the relative contribution of fe iv with increasing ph including the decrease of the availability of fe ii and the ph dependent reactivity of fe iv species i the rate of nzvi corrosion by h decreased with increasing ph leading to the decrease of dissolved fe ii eq 1 liu et al 2005 song and carraway 2005 bae and hanna 2015 ii the co precipitation of aqueous fe ii and fe iii in bulk solution further limited the availability of fe ii at near neutral ph keenan and sedlak 2008 yan et al 2012 iii the passivation of nzvi surface by iron hydr oxide precipitation and the weak dissolution of iron oxide shell at high ph encapsulated fe ii beneath the out shell rather than released to solution kim et al 2018 wu et al 2019 iv the oxidation power of aqueous fe iv species decreased with increasing ph while the ph variation has a weak effect on the oxidation ability of so4 bataineh et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2018 consequently the electron transfer from nzvi core to persulfates through the iron oxide shell with forming so4 gradually dominate with the increase of ph comparatively the effect of ph on the transformation of pmso in the nzvi h2o2 system was explored at similar conditions to the case of persulfates as shown in fig 7 pmso degradation decreased from 81 to about 2 μm with increasing ph from 3 to 7 while the maxima of both δ pmso2 60 3 5 μm and η pmso2 value 20 were obtained at ph 5 this result was consistent with our recent study that the optimal condition for fe iv formation in the fe ii h2o2 system was at ph 5 wang et al 2018 3 3 3 2 without ph control to simulate the poorly buffered conditions encountered in industrial domestic wastewater and contaminated groundwater soil when treated by nzvi based isco processes lab scale experiments were also conducted with pre adjusting the initial ph in previous studies bae and hanna 2015 kim et al 2018 for comparison the transformation of pmso 100 μm by nzvi 0 025 g l activated pds 500 μm was monitored at ph 3 7 without ph buffer the solution was changed to acidic conditions ph 4 within 20 min in cases at initial ph 4 fig s12a several literature also reported the rapid decrease of ph in zero valent iron activated persulfates when the initial ph was over 4 which was ascribed to the release of h during the formation of iron hydr oxide precipitation liang and guo 2010 li et al 2014b kim et al 2018 as expected both δ pmso t and δ pmso2 t decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 figs s12b and c the calculated η pmso2 value continuously increased with reaction progressing in the cases at initial ph 4 7 due to the gradual acidification of un buffered solutions fig s12d 4 conclusions numerous literature has suggested that nzvi is only a source of fe ii in nzvi persulfates systems and the subsequent activation of persulfates by fe ii leading to so4 formation play the key role in pollutant degradation however contradicting to the previous assertion this work identified that both so4 and fe iv was produced in the nzvi persulfates systems by using pmso as a probe i the firs step activation of persulfates by nzvi through electron transfer was responsible for so4 formation and the following catalysis of persulfates by fe ii released from nzvi corrosion produced fe iv ii the obvious pmso degradation was also obtained in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems without producing pmso2 which further supported that the electron transfer from some monometallic catalysts to persulfates could lead to the generation of so4 iii the pmso degradation in the nzval persulfates systems was divided into a slow initial degradation stage and a subsequent fast degradation stage which was not observed in nzvzn and nzvi activated persulfates this was likely ascribed to the fact that aluminum oxide shell was a kind of insulator while the iron and zinc oxide shell was semiconductor which could mediate electron transfer from catalysts core to persulfates iv the relative contribution of so4 and fe iv on pmso degradation was independent on nzvi and pds concentration however the relative contribution of fe iv increased with increasing pms initial concentration which was attributed to the fact that the competitive consumption of so4 by pms was faster than that of fe iv v the relative contribution of fe iv decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 as result of the decrease of available fe ii at higher ph comparing with the highly reactive free radicals so4 and oh the more selective oxidant fe iv has a longer life time allowing an outstanding mass transfer and more chances of contacting with target contaminants in subsurface

18154,activation of persulfates i e peroxydisulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms by nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is reported to be effective in oxidative treatment of environmental contaminants it has been widely accepted in numerous literature that sulfate radical so4 formed from the decomposition of persulfates activated by aqueous fe ii released from nzvi corrosion is responsible for the oxidative performance in nzvi persulfates systems in this work by employing methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso as a probe we demonstrated that the activation of persulfates by nzvi through electron transfer led to so4 formation while the homogeneous activation of persulfate by the released fe ii resulted in ferryl ion species fe iv generation in nzvi persulfates systems similarly nanoscale zero valent aluminum nzval and zinc nzvzn were also demonstrated to be able to donate electron to persulfates leading to so4 formation however the insulative aluminum oxide shell hindered the electron transfer leading to the poor persulfates decomposition while the conductive iron and zinc oxide shell enabled the electron transfer process resulting in a continuous generation of so4 further it was obtained that the relative contribution of so4 and fe iv in nzvi persulfates systems was independent of the initial concentration of nzvi and pds but was positively correlated with pms concentration in addition the increase of ph from 3 to 7 led to the decrease of the relative contribution of fe iv which was rationalized by the decrease of availability of aqueous fe ii at higher ph our findings not only shed lights on the nature of the reactive intermediate formed in the nzvi persulfates systems but also unprecedentedly distinguished the surface activation of persulfates from the homogeneous catalysis process graphical abstract image 1 keywords advanced oxidation processes nanoscale zero valent iron peroxymonosulfate peroxydisulfate sulfate radical ferryl ion 1 introduction in situ

al 2017 wang and wang 2018 zhou et al 2019 iron containing catalysts aqueous fe ii and heterogeneous materials are considered to be one of the most feasible activators for persulfates activation due

zero valent iron nzvi is a more viable option for persulfates activation because nzvi not only declines the competitive consumption of the in situ formed reactive intermediate s by superfluous dissolved fe ii but also is more superior in migration in subsurface lefevre et al 2016 kim et al 2018 ike et al 2018 wu et al 2019 the combination of nzvi and persulfates has achieved a good

scale and pilot scale studies there is a good agreement in numerous literature that the activation of persulfates by nzvi leading to the formation of reactive intermediate can be described as the following two steps al shamsi and thomson 2013 oh et al 2016 yun et al 2017 kim et al 2018 firstly nzvi is corroded by h dissolved oxygen and persulfate ions s2o8 2 or hso5 to form fe ii eqs 1 4 1 fe0

formation of pmso2 is obtained when pmso is oxidized by the fe ii pds and fe ii pms systems at acidic and near neutral ph and the yield of pmso2 i e η pmso2 the molar ratio of pmso2 produced to pmso lost is quantified to be approximately 100 under acidic conditions however the assessment on the relative contribution of fe iv vs so4 in the nzvi persulfates systems is totally absent in previous studies most of them concerning the nzvi persulfates systems focused on the investigation of factors e g reactants dosage and nzvi corrosion affecting the degradation efficiency of various contaminants the objective of this study is to clarify the nature of the reactive intermediate s formed in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems by monitoring the degradation of pmso as well as the generation of pmso2 product in both systems influences of the initial concentrations of oxidants pds 0 and pms 0 and nzvi nzvi 0 as well as solution ph with or without ph control on the relative contribution of different reactive intermediates are investigated in parallel the transformation of pmso in the nanoscale zero valent aluminum nzval and zinc nzvzn activated persulfates is investigated meanwhile the transformation of pmso by the nzvi hydrogen peroxide h2o2 system is also conducted at similar conditions to make a comparison 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

oxone and na2s2o8 in ultrapure water and standardized by an abts method yang et al 2015 and a modified iodometric method liang et al 2008 respectively the purchased h2o2 standard solution was diluted to prepare the h2o2 stock solutions which were standardized by an n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd peroxidase method bader et al 1998 2 2 experimental procedure batch experiments were carried out in a 1 l cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor equipped with a glass stirrer at well controlled temperature 20 1 c to initiate a reaction an aliquot of one oxidant pds pms or h2o2 and a quantified amount of nanoscale metallic activator nzvi nzval or nzvzn were simultaneously added into the reactor containing pmso solutions at ph 3 were adjusted using hclo4 and or naoh sodium acetate buffer 10 mm and sodium borate buffer 10 mm were used for ph 4 6 and 7 respectively in the experiments with ph control in parallel experiments without buffer were also conducted in which the initial ph of 4 7 was pre adjusted by hclo4 and or naoh samples 0 9 ml were collected at pre determined time and quickly quenched by excess dmso 0 1 ml each sample was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter before analyses with high performance liquid chromatography hplc or electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry equipped with hplc hplc esi qqqms all experiments were independently triplicated to ensure reproducibility 2 3 analytical methods total dissolved iron was spectrophotometrically analyzed by the 1 10 phenanthroline colorimetric method keenan and sedlak 2008 pmso and pmso2 analysis were performed with a hplc waters 2695 equipped with a uv detector waters 2487 as described previously wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the hplc esi qqqms analysis was conducted using the absciex qtrap 5500 ms integrated with an agilent 1260 hplc at enhanced product ion epi mode detailed operating parameters for the hplc esi qqqms analysis were identical to those adopted in our previous work as shown in si text s1 wang et al 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in different nzvi oxygenation processes 3 1 1 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the nzvi persulfates systems the typical transformation of pmso 100 μm by persulfates 200 μm activated by nzvi 0 01 g l was investigated at ph 3 it was obtained that pmso loss at 60 and 10 min i e δ pmso 60 and δ pmso 10 were 70 and 48 μm in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms system fig 1 a respectively due to the relatively fast oxidation of pmso by pms alone 0 14 m 1s 1 ph 3 7 note that this rate constant is shown with a wrong unit in our recent work wang et al 2019a pmso transformation by the nzvi pms system was only investigated in 10 min during which less than 2 μm pmso was degraded by pms alone fig s2 moreover the production of pmso2 was monitored as shown in fig 1b about 54 and 30 μm pmso2 were generated at 60 and 10 min i e δ pmso2 60 and δ pmso2 10 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms system respectively indicating that fe iv was formed in both systems further the yield of pmso2 was quantified to evaluate the contribution of fe iv to pmso degradation as shown the η pmso2 value kept constant with the reaction progressing and it was about 80 and 60 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems respectively fig 1c comparatively the η pmso2 value was quantified to be approximately 100 when pmso was oxidized in the fe ii persulfates systems eqs 7 and 8 under acidic conditions in our very recent work wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b accordingly the η pmso2 value below 100 in the nzvi persulfates systems indicated the presence of a non fe iv involved pmso transformation pathway see detailed discussion below 3 1 2 pmso degradation and pmso2 formation in the nzvi o2 and nzvi h2o2 systems the transformation of pmso 100 μm during nzvi 0 01 g l oxygenation without persulfates i e nzvi o2 system was studied in parallel it was found that 9 μm pmso was slowly degraded within 60 min in the nzvi o2 system fig 1a while no pmso2 production was obtained this result was ascribed to the fenton reaction induced by the aerobic corrosion of nzvi which has been well documented in previous literature hug and leupin 2003 keenan and sedlak 2008 lee et al 2008 kim et al 2015 he et al 2016 specifically nzvi reacts with o2 to produce h2o2 eq 12 accompanying with the release of aqueous fe ii which is further oxidized by o2 to produce h2o2 with superoxide radical o2 as an intermediate eqs 13 and 14 the in situ generated h2o2 competitively oxidize fe ii to produce oh at acidic ph eq 15 which is responsible for pmso degradation in the nzvi o2 system 12 o2 fe0 2h fe2 h2o2 13 o2 fe2 o2 fe3 14 o2 fe2 2h h2o2 fe3 15 fe2 h2o2 fe3 oh oh for comparison the transformation of pmso by the nzvi h2o2 system was studied under similar conditions to the nzvi persulfates systems as expected no pmso2 production was obtained although pmso was continuously degraded within 60 min fig 1 3 2 probing the non fe iv involved pmso transformation in the nzvi persulfates systems 3 2 1 alcohol scavenging effect on pmso transformation persulfates activation by monometallic catalysts can be categorized into two distinct pathways in terms of the role of persulfates radical precursors or electron acceptors i electron is transferred from metal catalysts to persulfates with the formation of metal ions and so4 e g zero valent aluminum nidheesh et al 2018 khatri et al 2018 and zinc li et al 2014a chen et al 2018 ii electron is delivered from organic contaminants to persulfates by conductive materials e g noble metals pd and au ahn et al 2016 chen et al 2018 with using persulfates as electron acceptors without forming so4 these two activation pathways i e so4 involved persulfates activation and conductive metal mediated electron shuttle are suspected to be involved in the non fe iv induced pmso degradation in the nzvi persulfates systems additionally oh generated via the aerobic corrosion of nzvi eqs 12 15 may also make contribution to pmso degradation alcohol scavenging experiments with using ethanol etoh and tert butyl alcohol tba 10 or 100 mm to capture the reactive intermediate s formed in nzvi 0 01 g l activated persulfates 200 μm were conducted the difference in the reaction rates between two alcohols and several reactive intermediates oh so4 or fe iv table s1 suggests that etoh is an excellent scavenger for the three reactive intermediates while tba only exhibits strong capacity on scavenging oh as shown in fig 2 a pmso degradation was greatly inhibited by 10 mm etoh in both nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems with adding 100 mm etoh even no pmso degradation was obtained in the nzvi pds system and about only 2 μm pmso was degraded in the nzvi pms system due to the oxidation of pmso by pms alone fig 2 vs fig s2 this result revealed that nzvi could not mediate electron transfer from pmso to persulfates which was also stated by yun et al 2017 who found that 4 chlorophenol degradation in the nzvi persulfates systems was obviously inhibited by excess methanol further 10 mm tba showed negligible effect on pmso degradation which ruled out the involvement of oh accordingly so4 was the most reasonable candidate for the intermediate which was responsible for the non fe iv induced pmso degradation this was further verified by exploring the potential formation of the so4 involved biphenyl products of pmso see eq 10 for their chemical structure when pmso was treated by the nzvi persulfates systems as expected these biphenyl compounds with molecular ions of m z 217 0 or 341 0 were identified see figs s3 6 for their hplc esi qqqms chromatograms and product ion spectra obtained at epi mode additionally with adding 100 mm tba pmso degradation was also reduced to some extent in both systems which was attributed to the competitive consumption of fe iv and so4 by excess tba the identification of so4 also well explain the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrolin n oxide dmpo trapped electron spin resonance esr spectra of the nzvi persulfates systems obtained in previous studies where an obvious signal of dmpo so4 adduct is observed zhu et al 2016 yun et al 2017 tan et al 2018 wu et al 2019 song et al 2019 furthermore it was found that the pmso2 production was also inhibited by adding alcohol scavengers except for the cases with adding 10 mm tba figs s7a and b due to the scavenging of fe iv by excess alcohol the yield of pmso2 was increased to different extents with using different concentrations of etoh and tba figs s7c and d which was reasonably explained by the stronger ability of etoh and tba on scavenging so4 than fe iv table s1 3 2 2 mechanistic insights for so4 involved persulfates activation in the nzvi persulfates systems since the primary reactive intermediates formed in persulfates activation by aqueous fe ii has been identified as fe iv wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a wang et al 2019b it is reasonable to propose that the heterogeneous persulfates activation by nzvi was responsible for the so4 formation as illustrated in fig 3 16 fe0 2s2o8 2 fe2 2so4 2so4 2 17 fe0 2hso5 fe2 2so4 2oh in general the inherent core shell structure of nzvi would prevent the attachment of nzvi core by persulfates unless depassivating the nzvi surface such as the dissolution of iron oxide shell by acid lai and lo 2008 han et al 2016 kim et al 2018 bae et al 2018 hu et al 2019 however several literature has reported that the iron oxide shell especially the magnetite content of nzvi has a property of n type semiconductor which enables the electron transfer from nzvi core to the electron acceptors on nzvi surface wilhelm 1979 li and zhang 2006 2007 mu et al 2017 for instance liu et al 2014 reported that iron oxide shell could transport electron from nzvi core to the divalent metal cations e g co ii ni ii and cu ii complexed on the nzvi surface leading to the reduction of these cations kim et al 2018 proposed that the electron transfer from nzvi core e0 0 44 v to pds e0 2 0 v through the outer shell via bulk conduction was crucial to the core shell evolution of nzvi in nzvi pds system nevertheless the formation of so4 resulting from persulfates activation by nzvi through electron transfer has never been realized in previous literature this may be attributed to the limitations of the common identification methods e g alcohol scavenging assay and esr spectra technique which cannot distinguish the persulfates activation on nzvi surface from its homogeneous activation by aqueous fe ii further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism underlying the electron transfer induced persulfates decomposition with forming so4 3 2 3 comparison with pmso transformation in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems the feasibility of the direct electron transfer from metallic catalysts to persulfates with producing so4 has been documented in the nzval and nzvzn activated persulfates processes eqs 18 21 nidheesh et al 2018 khatri et al 2018 chen et al 2018 18 2al0 s2o8 2 6h 1 5o2 2al3 2so4 3h2o 19 al0 3hso5 3h al3 3so4 3h2o 20 zn0 2s2o8 2 zn2 2so4 2so4 2 21 zn0 2hso5 zn2 2so4 2oh this is further demonstrated in this study by monitoring pmso 100 μm transformation in nzval or nzvzn 0 5 g l activated persulfates 200 μm at ph 3 as shown in fig 4 pmso was degraded to different extents in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems while negligible pmso2 production was obtained in cases with pds and less than 2 μm pmso2 was produced in cases with pms as a result of pmso oxidation by pms alone fig s8 notably it was observed that pmso degradation in the nzval pds system was extremely slow in the first 2 h comparing with the relatively fast pmso degradation in the next 2 h fig 4a although the two stage degradation was not observed in pmso transformation by the nzval pms system owing to the relative short investigation time 10 min fig 4b it was obtained during the treatment of other contaminants e g surfactant by the zval activated pms arslan alaton et al 2017 however the two stage degradation of pmso was not observed in the nzvzn persulfates systems fig 4 similar to the case of nzvi fig 1 likewise bokare and choi 2009 and shen et al 2018 observed that the degradation of contaminants atrazine or 4 chlorophenol by aerobic corrosion of zval zval o2 system was also divided into a slow initial degradation stage and a subsequent rapid degradation period whereas in the zvi o2 system these contaminants were degraded at a relatively constant rate these results were rationalized by the fact that aluminum oxide was insulator nguyen et al 2018 while zinc oxide was a well documented semiconductor kong et al 2004 similar to the iron oxide shell as aforementioned therefore the reaction between nzval and oxidants would be initiated only when the inert aluminum oxide was dissolved by h shen et al 2018 accordingly the distinct kinetic trends of pmso degradation in nzvi persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems versus nzval persulfates systems further supported the essential role of conductive iron oxide shell in mediating electron transfer from nzvi core to persulfates 3 3 factors affecting the relative contribution of fe iv versus so4 in the nzvi pds system 3 3 1 effect of nzvi initial concentration the effect of nzvi initial concentration nzvi 0 0 0025 0 025 g l on the transformation of pmso 100 μm at fixed pds 200 μm or pms 200 μm was evaluated at ph 3 in the nzvi pds system the increase of nzvi 0 from 0 0025 to 0 01 g l promoted δ pmso 60 and δ pmso2 60 from 32 to 70 μm and 24 54 μm respectively and then further increasing nzvi 0 0 025 g l caused an appreciable decline of them fig 5 a and b similarly the maxima of δ pmso 10 and δ pmso2 10 in the fe ii pms system were also achieved at 0 01 g l nzvi 0 fig 5c and d these results were explained by the competitive consumption of fe iv eq 22 mártire et al 2002 and so4 eq 23 buxton et al 1997 by excess aqueous fe ii released from nzvi corrosion 22 feivo2 fe2 2h 2fe3 h2o k 1 4 105 m 1s 1 ph 1 23 so4 fe2 fe3 so4 2 k 4 6 109 m 1s 1 however the η pmso2 values remained constant at about 80 and 60 in the nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems respectively which was independent of nzvi 0 fig 5 the lower η pmso2 value obtained in the nzvi pms system suggested that the relative contribution of so4 on the pmso degradation was higher in the nzvi pms system eq 17 than that in the case with pds eq 16 this was in accordance with the fact that the decomposition of persulfate and release of dissolved iron in the nzvi pms system were faster than those in the nzvi pds system fig s9 3 3 2 effect of persulfates initial concentration the influence of the initial concentration of persulfates pds 0 or pms 0 over a range of 50 500 μm at fixed nzvi 0 0 01 g l and pmso 0 100 μm at ph 3 was investigated as pds 0 rose up from 50 to 500 mm δ pmso 60 and δ pmso2 60 were obviously promoted from 17 to 93 μm and 13 to 64 μm respectively fig 6 a and b however in the nzvi pms system δ pmso 10 and δ pmso2 10 reached the maxima at 200 μm pms 0 and then a significant decrease of them was observed at higher pms 0 500 μm fig 6c and d the discrepancy on the effect of pds and pms initial concentration on δ pmso and δ pmso2 was explained by the stronger consumption of the reactive intermediates by pms eq 24 das 2001 and eq 25 wang et al 2019a than that by pds eq 26 yu et al 2004 and eq 27 wang et al 2018 24 so4 hso5 so5 so4 2 h k 1 0 106 m 1s 1 25 feivo2 hso5 fe3 so5 oh k 2 0 105 m 1s 1 ph 1 26 so4 s2o8 2 s2o8 so4 2 k 5 8 102 ph 4 5 5 105 m 1s 1 ph 2 27 feivo2 s2o8 2 h fe3 s2o8 oh k 1 0 104 m 1s 1 ph 1 moreover the calculated η pmso2 value remained constant at about 80 which was independent of pds 0 fig 6c while it increased from about 40 to 75 with increasing pms 0 from 50 to 500 μm fig 6d it was further observed that the modified η pmso2 value obtained by subtracting the contribution of pmso transformation by pms alone was still linearly dependent on pms 0 table s2 one possible explanation for the pms 0 dependent change of η pmso2 value was that the competitive consumption of so4 by pms eq 24 was much stronger than that of fe iv by pms eq 25 leading to the improvement of fe iv contribution on pmso degradation with increasing pms 0 3 3 3 effect of ph 3 3 3 1 controlling ph with buffer the effect of solution ph was investigated at ph 3 7 under typical conditions i e 200 μm persulfates 0 0 01 g l nzvi 0 and 100 μm pmso 0 with careful ph control as shown in fig 7 a and b δ pmso t and δ pmso2 t decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 in both nzvi pds and nzvi pms systems moreover it was observed that the calculated η pmso2 value increased from about 80 to 91 with ph increasing from 3 to 4 in the nzvi pds system and then η pmso2 dramatically decreased to 0 with ph further increasing to 7 similarly the maximum η pmso2 value 81 in the nzvi pms system was also obtained at ph 4 the increase of η pmso2 from ph 3 to 4 in both systems was likely ascribed to the fact that the second order rate constant of the reaction between so4 and ch3cooh 2 0 105 herrmann et al 1999 was 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of the reaction between fe iv and acetate 3 1 0 5 m 1s 1 ph 0 jacobsen et al 1998 this was verified by exploring the effect of sodium acetate concentration on η pmso2 value obtained in the nzvi persulfates systems at ph 3 and 4 as expected the η pmso2 value was increased with increasing sodium acetate concentration from 0 to 20 mm at both cases of ph 3 and 4 figs s10 and s11 further it was obtained that η pmso2 value was higher at ph 3 than that at ph 4 in both nzvi persulfates systems at identical concentration of sodium acetate several facts may account for the decline of the relative contribution of fe iv with increasing ph including the decrease of the availability of fe ii and the ph dependent reactivity of fe iv species i the rate of nzvi corrosion by h decreased with increasing ph leading to the decrease of dissolved fe ii eq 1 liu et al 2005 song and carraway 2005 bae and hanna 2015 ii the co precipitation of aqueous fe ii and fe iii in bulk solution further limited the availability of fe ii at near neutral ph keenan and sedlak 2008 yan et al 2012 iii the passivation of nzvi surface by iron hydr oxide precipitation and the weak dissolution of iron oxide shell at high ph encapsulated fe ii beneath the out shell rather than released to solution kim et al 2018 wu et al 2019 iv the oxidation power of aqueous fe iv species decreased with increasing ph while the ph variation has a weak effect on the oxidation ability of so4 bataineh et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 wang et al 2018 consequently the electron transfer from nzvi core to persulfates through the iron oxide shell with forming so4 gradually dominate with the increase of ph comparatively the effect of ph on the transformation of pmso in the nzvi h2o2 system was explored at similar conditions to the case of persulfates as shown in fig 7 pmso degradation decreased from 81 to about 2 μm with increasing ph from 3 to 7 while the maxima of both δ pmso2 60 3 5 μm and η pmso2 value 20 were obtained at ph 5 this result was consistent with our recent study that the optimal condition for fe iv formation in the fe ii h2o2 system was at ph 5 wang et al 2018 3 3 3 2 without ph control to simulate the poorly buffered conditions encountered in industrial domestic wastewater and contaminated groundwater soil when treated by nzvi based isco processes lab scale experiments were also conducted with pre adjusting the initial ph in previous studies bae and hanna 2015 kim et al 2018 for comparison the transformation of pmso 100 μm by nzvi 0 025 g l activated pds 500 μm was monitored at ph 3 7 without ph buffer the solution was changed to acidic conditions ph 4 within 20 min in cases at initial ph 4 fig s12a several literature also reported the rapid decrease of ph in zero valent iron activated persulfates when the initial ph was over 4 which was ascribed to the release of h during the formation of iron hydr oxide precipitation liang and guo 2010 li et al 2014b kim et al 2018 as expected both δ pmso t and δ pmso2 t decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 figs s12b and c the calculated η pmso2 value continuously increased with reaction progressing in the cases at initial ph 4 7 due to the gradual acidification of un buffered solutions fig s12d 4 conclusions numerous literature has suggested that nzvi is only a source of fe ii in nzvi persulfates systems and the subsequent activation of persulfates by fe ii leading to so4 formation play the key role in pollutant degradation however contradicting to the previous assertion this work identified that both so4 and fe iv was produced in the nzvi persulfates systems by using pmso as a probe i the firs step activation of persulfates by nzvi through electron transfer was responsible for so4 formation and the following catalysis of persulfates by fe ii released from nzvi corrosion produced fe iv ii the obvious pmso degradation was also obtained in the nzval persulfates and nzvzn persulfates systems without producing pmso2 which further supported that the electron transfer from some monometallic catalysts to persulfates could lead to the generation of so4 iii the pmso degradation in the nzval persulfates systems was divided into a slow initial degradation stage and a subsequent fast degradation stage which was not observed in nzvzn and nzvi activated persulfates this was likely ascribed to the fact that aluminum oxide shell was a kind of insulator while the iron and zinc oxide shell was semiconductor which could mediate electron transfer from catalysts core to persulfates iv the relative contribution of so4 and fe iv on pmso degradation was independent on nzvi and pds concentration however the relative contribution of fe iv increased with increasing pms initial concentration which was attributed to the fact that the competitive consumption of so4 by pms was faster than that of fe iv v the relative contribution of fe iv decreased with increasing ph from 3 to 7 as result of the decrease of available fe ii at higher ph comparing with the highly reactive free radicals so4 and oh the more selective oxidant fe iv has a longer life time allowing an outstanding mass transfer and more chances of contacting with target contaminants in subsurface
