8425,study region guadiana international catchment located in the iberian peninsula study focus the guadiana river catchment has registered an intense and speed up modification of its natural regime over the last few decades to cope with water scarcity such modifications pose a serious challenge to the development of improved management tools as information on available water resources is often not detailed enough this study aimed to simulate the flow regime of the guadiana river using the mohid land model during a 30 years period two scenarios were defined by considering or not inputs from reservoirs model performance was assessed by comparing simulated and measured monthly streamflow at 24 hydrometric stations influenced 9 stations or not 15 stations by reservoir management new hydrological insights for the region streamflow simulations produced quite acceptable estimates for most of the hydrometric stations not influenced by reservoirs however results also showed the importance of non simulated processes e g groundwater abstractions to the accurate prediction of the guadiana flow regime for the stations influenced by reservoir management model simulations generally overestimated streamflow measurements information related to reservoir management needs thus to be made clearer for achieving better results which can only be accomplished when national water agencies improve their cooperation protocols further model limitations were also addressed as well as the necessary developments for improving streamflow estimates in future modeling applications keywords distributed model iberian peninsula mohid land streamflow water scarcity 1 introduction water resources in regions under arid semi arid and even sub humid conditions are subjected to multiple pressures that result mostly from population growth major demographic shifts as people move from rural to urban environments higher demands for food security and socio economic well being increased competition between users and usages and contamination from point and diffuse pollution sources wwap 2019 agriculture is by far the largest water consumer accounting for 69 of the global annual water withdrawals followed by industry 19 and households 12 aquastat 2019 as global water demand is expected to increase 20 to 30 above the current level of water use by 2050 mainly due to the rising demand in the industrial and domestic sectors so will water stress levels which already afflict about 4 billion people worldwide be enhanced wwap 2019 sustainable management practices are thus needed for optimizing the use of water resources at the regional scale and reducing potential conflicts among users a representative example of the need for improved management plans is the guadiana transnational river catchment shared by portugal and spain the climate in the region is mostly dry sub humid to semi arid with some areas being among the driest places in europe the seasonality of rainfall and high evapotranspiration demand typically results in a period with high winter discharges and another with low summer discharges the region is also cyclically affected by extended droughts that further enhance the seasonality of local water resources vicente serrano 2006 paulo et al 2012 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 consequently the guadiana river has been subjected to an intense and speed up modification of its natural regime with reservoir storage capacity increasing from almost zero in 1954 to close to 14 000 hm3 nowadays brandão and rodrigues 2000 ceh cedex 2019 snirh 2019 at the same time large agriculture projects were developed with water withdrawals approaching sometimes the limits of sustainability for example the dramatic increase of groundwater abstractions for irrigation in the upper region of the guadiana basin has led to the decline of groundwater levels degradation of protected wetlands rise of groundwater salinity levels and occasional water transfers from the tagus basin conan et al 2003 bromley et al 2010 in portugal alqueva was built to be the largest reservoir in europe constituting a strategic water reserve for the southern part of the country and deeply modifying the landscape and production systems by providing water for irrigation of 150 000 ha of agricultural land distributed between the guadiana and sado basins urban and industrial consumption energy production and regularization of flows edia 2019 the albufeira convention is the international agreement signed between portugal and spain in 1998 and later revised in 2008 which regulates the flow regime in the five transnational basins shared by the two countries minho lima douro tejo and guadiana for the case of the guadiana catchment the convention defines minimum flows for different trimesters of the year or alternatively a minimum annual flow measured at the badajoz weir where the guadiana river enters portugal minimum flows are dependent on the amount of rainfall and water stored in pre defined reservoirs the convention further defines conditions for an exceptional regime which is usually associated with drought periods in this case a minimum daily flow of 2 m3 s 1 perceived as a basic ecological minimum is established as the only requirement at the badajoz weir but also at pomarão as the river flows from portugal to become the border between the two countries just 70 km above its estuary agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 while the compliance with the albufeira convention agreement is considered a top priority for water allocation in both countries water scarcity issues in both portugal and spain pose already significant challenges for water resources management do ó 2012 on the spanish side local authorities report an annual deficit close to 600 hm3 without the adoption of measures limiting demand confederação hidrográfica do guadiana 2014 on the portuguese side irrigation during drought seasons is much dependent on the amount of water stored in alqueva which is now connected to smaller reservoirs to compensate for water shortages in different parts of the alentejo region meanwhile climate change projections that foresee significant reductions in rainfall and streamflow for the near future kilsby et al 2007 guerreiro et al 2017 only add more uncertainty to the availability of water resources in the guadiana basin the vulnerability of water resources in the guadiana catchment requires a precise quantification of the volumes available with modeling being many times selected as a preferred tool for achieving such purpose brandão and rodrigues 2000 used the iras interactive river aquifer simulation loucks et al 1995 model to simulate streamflow in the portuguese part of the guadiana catchment considering six hydrological scenarios that were defined to assess the impact of the albufeira convention and the spanish hydrological plan on water volumes stored in portuguese reservoirs also conan et al 2003 applied the swat soil water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 model to assess the impact of groundwater withdrawals on the hydrological behavior of the upper guadiana river catchment later kilsby et al 2007 estimated the impact of climate change projections on runoff production streamflow and water resources availability in the guadiana catchment using a distributed daily rainfall runoff model finally guerreiro et al 2017 pursued a similar objective estimating the impact of climate change projections on the guadiana river streamflow using the shetran model ewen et al 2000 while the previous studies provided significant insights for the accurate quantification of local water resources they all shared similar constraints when validating model results due to simplifications adopted when describing the complexity of the guadiana basin and the modified flow regime of the guadiana river this study provides a further attempt to simulate streamflow in the guadiana river using the mohid land model trancoso et al 2009 mohid land is a fully distributed process based model that considers interactions between multiple components of the soil water atmosphere continuum with fundamental processes being formulated at fine spatial at the grid cell level and temporal scales contributing to the overall dynamics of the catchment at a larger scale the mohid land model structure is comparable to the shetran model used in guerreiro et al 2017 and applications include for example improving irrigation practices at the plot and field scales ramos et al 2017 2018 simionesei et al 2018 understanding the contribution of flood events to the eutrophication of water reservoirs brito et al 2017 2018 and forecasting fresh water quantity and quality in coastal rivers brito et al 2015 the objectives of this study were thus i to simulate streamflow in the guadiana catchment under two scenarios that included or not reservoir management and iii to discuss model limitations and developments research and data needed for better quantifying local water resources in future applications 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the guadiana catchment is located in the southern region of the iberian peninsula fig 1 being the fourth largest after douro tagus and ebro the drainage area covers 66 999 km2 of which 55 465 km2 82 8 are in spain and 11 534 km2 17 2 are in portugal agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 the river has a bed length over 800 km with headwaters in lagunas de ruidera castilla la mancha spain 38 58 21 n 2 53 9 w 868 m the river then flows in the north east south west direction to the border cities of vila real de santo antónio portugal and ayamonte spain where it meets the atlantic ocean 37 10 40 n 7 24 18 w 0 m the climate in the catchment ranges from hot summer mediterranean climate csa to cold semi arid steppe climate bsk im and aemet 2011 the mean annual temperature is close to 16 c varying between 28 c in july august ciudad real spain and 8 5 c in january elvas portugal the mean annual rainfall is 550 mm 561 mm in portugal and 540 mm in spain with minimum of 350 450 mm in the central area of the la mancha plain spain and mértola and moura portugal and maximum of more than 1000 mm in the headwaters of the tributaries ardila odeleite and caia the interannual distribution of precipitation is also extremely irregular ranging from 386 mm in dry years to 766 mm in wet years on average more than 80 of the total annual precipitation occurs between october and april agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 the dominant soils are regosols 44 of the area cambisols 28 and luvisols 14 iuss working group 2014 fig 2 soils in the upper region of the catchment are mostly derived from unconsolidated calcareous deposits while in the middle and low regions soils originate from metamorphic rocks schists gneiss migmatite the main land uses are divided between rainfed or irrigated agriculture 65 and mediterranean woodland 18 or shrubland 16 fig 2 in spain 85 of the diverted water is used for irrigation the irrigated area covers over 400 000 ha cereals vineyards and industrial crops are the dominant crops with an annual average consumption of 5300 m3 ha 1 confederação hidrográfica do guadiana 2014 in portugal 88 of the diverted water is used mainly for energy production although this is not a consumptive use water use in agriculture totalizes only 9 1 of the diverted water agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 however this number will inevitably increase in the near future as the alqueva project progressively adds over 150 000 ha of new irrigated land to that already existing in the region edia 2019 the catchment has a population of 1 9 million inhabitants with a density of 28 inhabitants km 2 in spain and 114 inhabitants km 2 in portugal eurostat 2019 there are 39 reservoirs located along the catchment with a total storage capacity above 10 hm3 the threshold limit assumed here to impact the hydrological regime of the guadiana river these were built between 1944 and 2010 the largest is alqueva 38 11 48 n 7 29 45 w 85 m built in 2002 with a total capacity of 4150 hm3 the smallest is lucefecit 38 38 09 n 7 24 22 w 173 m built in 1982 with a total capacity of 10 2 hm3 several others exist with less storage capacity fig 3 2 2 model description mohid land is a physically based fully distributed model designed to simulate the water cycle in hydrographic catchments trancoso et al 2009 the model considers four compartments or mediums atmosphere porous media soil surface and river network the atmosphere is not explicitly simulated but provides data necessary for imposing surface boundary conditions that may be space and time variant water moves through the remaining mediums based on mass and momentum conservation equations that are computed using a finite volume approach the simulation domain is organized into a regular structured grid quadrangular or rectangular in the horizontal plane and cartesian type in the vertical plane surface land is thus described by a 2d horizontal grid the porous media is a 3d domain which includes the same horizontal grid as the surface complemented with a vertical grid with variable thickness layers the river network is a 1d domain defined from the digital terrain model dtm with the drainage network linking surface cell centers nodes the model further uses an explicit algorithm with a variable time step that is maximum during dry seasons when fluxes are reduced and minimum when fluxes increase e g during rain events in this study runoff and infiltration of surface water were computed using the curve number cn procedure usda soil conservation service 1972 1 q s u r f 0 w h e n p d a y i a p d a y i a 2 p d a y i a r w h e n p d a y i a where qsurf is the accumulated runoff or rainfall excess l pday is the rainfall amount for the day l ia is the initial abstraction which includes surface storage and infiltration prior to runoff l and r is a retention parameter l 2 r 25400 c n 254 where cn is the curve number the variably saturated flow in the porous medium was computed using the richards equation as follows 3 θ t x i k θ h x i x i s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t is the time t xi are the xzy directions h is the soil pressure head l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and s is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots l3 l 3 t 1 the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were then described using the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genucthen 1980 4 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h η m 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 θr and θs denote the residual and saturated water contents l3 l 3 respectively ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 α l 1 and η are empirical shape parameters m 1 1 η and l is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter the mohid land model uses the richards equation in the whole subsurface domain and simulates saturated and unsaturated flow using the same grid a cell is considered as saturated when moisture is above 98 when a cell reaches saturation the model uses the saturated conductivity and pressure becomes hydrostatic corrected by friction this procedure easies the implementation of the model and simplifies its use at annual scale the penalty is the time step that during the wetting period must be shorter to guarantee stability the constraint is minimized using parallel computing the sink term s in eq 3 was computed using the macroscopic approach proposed by feddes et al 1978 following this approach potential transpiration tp l t 1 was linearly distributed over the root zone creating the function tp z which was diminished by the presence of depth varying root zone stressors namely water stress skaggs et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 as follows 6 t a α h t p z where ta is the actual transpiration rate l t 1 and α is a prescribed dimensionless function of h 0 α 1 limiting tp over the root zone the piecewise linear model proposed by feddes et al 1978 was then adopted for computing tp reductions due to water stress α h assuming that the water uptake was at the potential rate when the pressure head was between h2 and h3 dropped off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and became zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote for different threshold pressure heads plant transpiration and soil evaporation were thus the main drivers for computing soil water dynamics in the porous media but first crop evapotranspiration rates etc l t 1 were obtained from the product of reference evapotranspiration rates eto l t 1 computed with the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and a single crop coefficient kc the kc values were not crop stage dependent as in allen et al 1998 representing instead average characteristics of each vegetation type over the entire growing season as well as averaged effects of evaporation from the soil etc values were then partitioned into potential soil evaporation ep l t 1 and tp as a function of the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 following ritchie 1972 7 t p e t c 1 e λ l a i 8 e p e t c t p where λ is the extinction coefficient of radiation attenuation within the canopy the actual soil evaporation ea l t 1 was obtained by limiting ep values using an imposed pressure head threshold value american society of civil engineers 1996 the lai as well as other crop growth state variables were simulated using a modified version of the epic model williams et al 1989 neitsch et al 2011 this model is based on the heat unit theory which considers that all heat above the base temperature will accelerate crop growth and development crop growth was thus simulated as a function of the intercepted light its conversion into biomass and lai development neitsch et al 2011 lai was calculated as a function of heat units the crop development stages and crop stress neitsch et al 2011 additional details can be found in ramos et al 2017 surface water movement in the soil and the river network were computed by solving a saint venant equation in its conservative form accounting for advection pressure and friction forces for one in the river or two horizontal at the soil surface directions of the grid 9 q i t v i q i x i g a v h x i q q i n 2 a v r h 4 3 where q is the water flow in the river l3 t 1 av is the cross sectional flow area l2 g is the gravitational acceleration l t 2 v is the flow velocity l t 1 h is the hydraulic head l n is the manning coefficient t l 1 3 and rh is the hydraulic radius l the exchange between the river network and the subsurface flow computed with the richards equation was driven by the pressure at the interface river level and the pressure in the porous media phreatic level likewise the eventual excess water volume reallocated to the surface of the porous media domain exfiltration when the soil column was saturated was driven by the phreatic level surface water exchange between the river and riparian zones were further computed based on the kinematic approach neglecting bottom friction and using an implicit algorithm to avoid instabilities 2 3 model implementation the mohid land model trancoso et al 2009 was implemented in the study area using a square horizontal grid with 75 136 cells each with 0 045 0 045 5 km 5 km the digital terrain model dtm was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 3 arc second spatial resolution approximately 70 90 m rabus et al 2003 then interpolated to the mohid land grid using the average of values inside a grid cell and further modified to eliminate sunken or depressed cells topography in the modified dtm varied then from 0 to 1375 m fig 2 the soil map was extracted from the harmonized soil database fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 with the 30 arc second raster information being also interpolated to the mohid land grid the soil reference units represented at the scale of the study domain were regosols 44 0 cambisols 28 3 luvisols 14 0 leptosols 4 6 acrisols 4 5 fluvisols 2 8 planosols 0 7 vertisols 0 7 and arenosols 0 4 fig 2 first the porous media was discretized into seven vertical layers with varying thickness from 0 3 m at the surface to 8 9 m at the impermeable bottom each soil column was then divided into three horizons by grouping layers of the vertical grid the surface horizon was defined by the top layer of the vertical grid 0 0 0 3 m depth the sub surface horizon by the second layer 0 3 0 8 m depth and the bottom horizon by the remaining five layers 0 8 30 0 m depth soil depth was corrected according to the surface slope provided by the dtm assuming larger depths in valleys than in ridges the thickness of the bottom layers was thus adjusted based on the assumed soil depths which end up varying from 25 9 to 30 0 m the soil hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 were finally derived for each soil horizon of each soil reference group using soil texture information available in the harmonized soil database and the hypres class pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 the l pore connectivity tortuosity parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 for the initial conditions the soil was assumed as saturated for 83 of the profile from the bottom to the surface while the soil water content in the unsaturated zone was set to field capacity the corine land cover clc 2012 map with 100 m resolution copernicus land monitoring service 2019 was likewise interpolated to the mohid land grid and used for defining the vegetation type and surface rugosity the land uses represented at the scale of the study domain were agricultural areas 65 3 shrubland 16 5 mixed forest 12 4 evergreen forest 2 9 deciduous forest 2 7 and grassland 0 1 fig 2 urban areas were not included considering the large representation of agricultural and shrubland areas 81 9 the definition of the cn values ended up being simplified to basically account for the soil reference group and were set following the usda soil conservation service 1972 tables the manning coefficient was defined for each vegetation type according to van der sande et al 2003 vegetation growth parameters assumed the same default values as in neitsch et al 2011 the annual kc values of each vegetation type averaged the kc values of the different crop development stages given in allen et al 1998 hourly data from the safran model quintana seguí et al 2017 was used for defining the atmosphere boundary conditions of the simulation domain safran applies an interpolation algorithm that combines observations and the outputs of a meteorological model to produce a gridded dataset of precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and downward visible and infrared radiation for the period 1969 2014 the safran further uses climatically homogeneous zones to divide the space into the analysis areas which are then presented in a grid format with a resolution of 5 km this grid was here interpolated to the mohid land grid using a triangulation method the river network was derived from the dtm using the steepest slope in 8 directions i e according to the height of the surrounding cells the river cross sections were defined as having a trapezoidal shape with dimensions set based on the drainage area of each node 16 classes were considered table 1 with heights and widths at the top and bottom of the trapezoidal cross sections being set according to andreadis et al 2013 and neal et al 2015 for the nodes with intermediate drainage areas the dimensions of the cross section were linear interpolated from those assumed in the upper and lower classes for the scenario simulating the modified flow regime of the guadiana river model simulations further considered all reservoirs with a volume storage capacity larger than 10 hm3 39 reservoirs were implemented representing a total storage capacity of 13 974 hm3 fig 3 11 reservoirs were present from the beginning of the simulation period while the remaining were gradually introduced depending on the respective start of operation date the mohid land model further requires the location and maximum and minimum volume capacity for simulating reservoir operation reservoir outflows can then be imposed when data is available or estimated according to an operation curve in this study reservoir outflows were defined for 31 reservoirs with data being extracted from snirh 2019 for portugal and ceh cedex 2019 for spain the operation curve was considered for the remaining 8 reservoirs with the outflow being estimated as a function of the inflow and the actual storage volume in percentage values table 2 2 4 model calibration validation model simulations were conducted between october 1st 1979 and june 30rd 2014 the first six years october 1st 1979 to september 30rd 1985 were used as model warm up the calibration period was from october 1st 1985 to september 30rd 1995 10 years and the validation period was from october 1st 1995 to june 30rd 2014 19 years during model calibration validation simulations of daily streamflow were compared against measured data in 24 hydrometric stations located along the catchment fig 3 daily values were also converted to monthly data to compute the statistical indicators presented below only hydrometric stations having a minimum of five years of measured data were considered measured data were obtained from snirh 2019 for portugal and from ceh cedex 2019 for spain a sensitive analysis was first carried out where selected parameters were modified one at a time and the model was run until the end of the calibration period to assess their impact on mohid land simulations of streamflow model calibration validation ended up focusing on the dimensions of the river cross sections in the different nodes heights and top and bottom widths the curve number cn the manning coefficient n the annual crop coefficient kc the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the multiplying factor fh for obtaining the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity from ks ks hor fh ks model parameters were modified by trial and error during calibration until deviations between measured and simulated values were minimized validation was then performed by simply comparing model simulations using the calibrated parameters for the 1995 2014 period and respective measured dataset different goodness of fit tests were considered for assessing model performance including the coefficient of determination r2 the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias pbias and the model efficiency nse respectively given by 10 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 0 5 i 1 n p i p 2 0 5 2 11 n r m s e i 1 n o i p i 2 n 1 i 1 n o i o 2 12 p b i a s 100 i 1 n o i p i i 1 n o i 13 n s e 1 i 1 n o i p

indicate that the model explains well the variance of observations nrmse and pbias values close to zero indicate accurate model predictions legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 positive or negative pbias values refer to the occurrence of under or over estimation bias respectively nash and sutcliff 1970 modelling efficiency nse values close to 1 indicate that the residuals variance is much smaller than the observed data variance hence the model predictions are good contrarily when nse is very close to 0 or negative there is no gain in using the model i e o is as good or better predictor than the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization the mohid land model includes a considerable number of parameters that need to be first calibrated validated to provide reliable estimates of simulated results the sensitive analysis carried out in this study identified the dimensions of the river cross sections heights and top and bottom widths and the cn n kc ks and fh parameters as the most important in need of adjustment suggesting the importance of horizontal flow processes runoff and lateral flow for reproducing the hydrological response of the guadiana catchment this agrees with glaser et al 2019 who discussed the importance of nonuniform lateral flow rather than vertical preferential flow processes observed at plot scale for simulating the hydrological regime in the weierbach catchment germany using the hydrogeosphere model likewise el nasr et al 2005 simulated streamflow in the jeker catchment belgium using the mike she model in their application model calibration validation focused mostly on parameters influencing lateral flow such as the drainage network configuration and the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the geological layers in the saturated zone mcmichael et al 2006 and im et al 2009 further expressed the importance of horizontal flow processes in their applications using the same distributed model in this study the mohid land simulations required the enlargement of the river cross sections for accommodating streamflow in the drainage network during peak events table 1 this adjustment was especially noted at the nodes discharging the smallest areas with cross section areas increasing size by 3 to 10 times compared to the initial default values the cn values are listed in table 3 for the main soil reference units ranging from 66 to 79 these values were comparable to those used by conan et al 2003 in their swat model application for the upper guadiana basin in this previous work cn values were set to range from 39 for pasture in regosols to 87 for agriculture in luvisols in both applications higher cn values obviously resulted in higher runoff and lower infiltration volumes the n values suffered only minor adjustments table 4 except for the deciduous forest class which value increased from 0 125 to 0 230 s m 1 3 higher n values meant greater resistance to surface flow and reduced runoff volumes table 4 further lists the annual kc values considered in this study which ranged from 0 8 in the deciduous forest class to 1 0 in the evergreen forest class because catchment scale applications of the mohid land model can only currently consider a single kc value describing the full crop growing season the calibrated values cannot meet the definitions given in allen et al 1998 and can hardly be compared to other applications nevertheless higher kc values correspond to greater potential evapotranspiration rates the ks values also increased when compared with wösten et al 1999 tabulated values table 3 which comes with no surprise since pedotransfer functions can only provide modest estimates of soil hydraulic properties these functions are further based on measurements carried out in the laboratory in samples of limited size with issues related to their representativeness being often raised when describing actual flow conditions transport and reaction processes occurring at the field catchment scales due to limitations in the porous medium continuum van looy et al 2017 finally the fh was set to 3 0 promoting sub surface flow 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 streamflow simulations not influenced by reservoir management table 5 presents the goodness of fit indicators used to evaluate the level of agreement between streamflow measurements in hydrometric stations located in upstream reservoirs fig 3 and the mohid land simulations in general the model performed reasonably well when simulating streamflow at the above mentioned locations during the calibration 1985 1995 and validation periods 1995 2014 an example is given in fig 4 which shows the flow duration curve for the oeiras station the flow duration curve is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time during which specified discharges are equaled or exceeded in a given period searcy 1959 at the oeiras station model simulations matched closely the measured values for streamflow values below 2 0 m3 s 1 but a small departure between the two data series was noticed for larger flows relatively high values of r2 r2 0 75 were found for 10 of 15 hydrometric stations considered during calibration showing that the model could explain well the variability of the observed data most of these stations were in the lower region of the guadiana catchment mostly in portugal while those located in the upper part stations 4004 4201 and 4224 failed to produce acceptable r2 values r2 0 17 fig 5 a model simulations performed well for 5 of the 12 hydrometric stations considered during validation the r2 values were generally lower than in calibration with the upper region of the guadiana catchment still failing to produce acceptable r2 values r2 0 29 fig 5b overall the errors of the estimates were relatively small resulting in nrmse values below 0 25 for 12 of 15 hydrometric stations considered in calibration fig 6 a and for all stations accounted for in validation fig 6b on the other hand the pbias values evidenced some overestimation of the measured data negative values in most of the spanish hydrometric stations during both calibration and validation which were not so relevant since average flows were relatively small at these locations 0 17 to 4 60 m3 s 1 for the hydrometric stations in portugal model simulations resulted in smaller over or under predictions of the measured streamflow but no spatial trend was noticed fig 7 exceptions were the streamflow estimates in ponte algalé and monte dos fortes where a larger bias was found finally the nse modeling efficiency values were relatively high nse 0 75 for 7 of 15 hydrometric stations considered during calibration fig 8 a indicating that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance most of those stations were in the lower region of the guadiana catchment while for the upper region results showed that the measured averages were a more reliable predictor than model simulations similar results were found during validation fig 8b the model systematically failing in delivering accurate estimates of streamflow in the upper guadiana was associated with the large groundwater abstractions in the region which were not accounted for in model simulation conan et al 2003 kilsby et al 2007 for example bromley et al 2010 reported considerable annual groundwater discharge rates from 200 to 688 hm3 y 1 from the west la mancha aquifer during a period of unrestrained irrigation expansion from 1974 to 1988 nevertheless while the mohid land model was not able to accurately simulate streamflow in all hydrometric stations located upstream the reservoirs considered in this application results were very satisfactory for most of the locations under analysis note that contrarily to guerreiro et al 2017 who considered only a small sub basin for calibrating validating model predictions for the entire guadiana basin the mohid land model performance was here assessed considering the entire extent of the catchment thus accounting for the different land uses soils slopes and rainfall patterns found throughout the basin 3 2 2 streamflow simulations influenced by reservoir management the goodness of fit indicators obtained by comparing streamflow measurements in hydrometric stations influenced by reservoir management and the mohid land simulations are presented in table 6 these monitoring stations were naturally located downstream some reservoirs fig 3 with reservoir operation deeply modifying the flow regime globally results were much worse than those presented for the scenario without reservoir management with the mohid land model failing to reproduce streamflow measurements in most stations exceptions were the 4255 and amieira stations in spain and portugal respectively figs 5 8 in these locations all statistical indicators showed a relatively good agreement between model results and measured data r2 0 72 nrmse 0 05 pbias 33 9 and nse 0 6 fig 4 further gives an example of the flow duration curve for the amieira station for the remaining hydrometric stations the model always overestimated measured flows as seen by the large negative values of the pbias table 6 this constituted the main problem in this modeling application since measured streamflow were higher range from 1 01 to 145 8 m3 s 1 than those registered in the hydrometric stations located upstream reservoir management range from 0 17 to 4 60 m3 s 1 for the stations located in the main river bed rocha da galé pulo do lobo and ponte mourão streamflow simulations even produced unrealistic estimates 1688 m3 s 1 thus the erroneous predictions found for the stations influenced by reservoir management posed here as the main obstacle to an accurate computation of the catchment water balance in line with all previous modeling applications in the guadiana river brandão and rodrigues 2000 conan et al 2003 kilsby et al 2007 guerreiro et al 2017 fig 9 compares the scenarios with and without reservoirs at amieira 4255 and monte da vinha stations monte da vinha was added to the figure to better explain the differences between both scenarios despite results were not validated at that location by the statistical indicators table 6 in general the further downstream the station was located the greater the departure between the two simulations streamflow at amieira ended up being slightly influenced by reservoir management due to the size of the monte novo 15 3 hm3 and vigia 16 5 hm3 upstream reservoirs at 4255 the two simulations started departing after january 1996 when the peña del águila reservoir 130 hm3 began operating affecting mostly streamflow peaks monte da vinha showed the greatest difference between the two simulations but as consumptions were not considered in the modeling approach the differences between the two scenarios remained small 3 3 about model predictions fully distributed models such as mohid land are usually considered to provide improved predictions of streamflow along the river network of a catchment while also accounting for the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration soil moisture content water quality soil erosion and land use change impacts yilmaz et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 yet their spatial complexity often limits the proper identification of model parameters translating into significant predictive uncertainty in the simulation results beven and freer 2001 model parameters are typically derived from soil and land use datasets or inferred from spatiotemporal data these parameters mostly result from relationships derived from small scale applications being embedded into larger scale model grids without proper accounting for heterogeneity emergent processes scaling and interactions across scales reed et al 2004 yilmaz et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 as such proper calibration procedures are required to meet the set of parameters that best describe the simulated landscape processes this modeling application adopted a simple trial and error procedure for calibrating streamflow a series of techniques e g data mining machine learning and inverse optimization exist that can be used to further optimize model parameters but which require a considerable effort if implemented in mohid land despite that model uncertainty can still be associated with different causes including errors related to field measurements and to model input and model structure errors 3 3 1 field measurements streamflow measurements were obtained from public datasets used to monitor the guadiana flow regime in both portugal snirh 2019 and spain ceh cedex 2019 those values are usually not directly measured but converted from water level known as stage time series through a stage discharge model known as rating curve this in turn is derived using paired stage and discharge measurements occasionally observed in the field horner et al 2018 discussed the general sources of error for stage measurements with these being site specific and associated with the channel characteristics the information available to build the rating curve the station management the time interval at which streamflow data are averaged and the streamflow range those authors further adverted for the fact that while stage measurement errors are generally overlooked they may well be more substantial for hydrometric stations characterized by low flow depths such as those in the guadiana catchment catchments in arid semiarid environments additionally the cadc 2017 minutes refer the need for harmonizing the measurement procedures in both portugal and spain as readings from some hydrometric stations are sometimes inconsistent with others available nearby 3 4 model inputs parameter uncertainty was associated with soil land use and rainfall data detailed soil maps are rare in most regions of the world and soil information is even scarcer when referring to soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions are thus presented as the best possible solution for characterizing soil heterogeneity at the catchment scale since direct measurements are impractical due to the associated costs van looy et al 2017 the pedotransfer functions adopted in this study wösten et al 1999 provided only a very simplified representation of soil variability by considering a set of soil hydraulic parameters for each textural class likewise past applications of the mohid land model e g brito et al 2015 2017 adopted the same functions for characterizing soil variability recently montzka et al 2017 and tóth et al 2016 developed soil hydraulic grid maps 250 m 1 km for different layers that may better describe soil heterogeneity and that should provide the basis for improving soil hydraulic characterization in future catchment scale applications of the mohid land model a functional evaluation of those maps is thus required to better understand their usefulness to catchment scale modelling uncertainty related to land use was mostly associated with vegetation growth stages the corresponding set of model parameters impact directly evapotranspiration fluxes and respective partitioning into soil evaporation and crop transpiration ramos et al 2018 showed the importance of an accurate description of vegetation growth particularly the lai curve on estimates of the soil water balance at the plot scale they further described the impact of assimilation of lai data derived from landsat 8 imagery on mohid land simulations the main conclusion was that modeling vegetation growth at the regional scale cannot depend solely on inputs from the lai data assimilation because estimates may diverge substantially from the reality thus confirming the need to use a proper data set for calibration nevertheless the sensitivity analysis performed in this study failed to demonstrate vegetation growth as relevant for streamflow simulations meaning that the impact of those parameters on final model results was only minor finally the safran dataset quintana seguí et al 2017 was used for defining the atmosphere boundary conditions of the simulation domain as the only water input considered in the modeling application deviations between measured and simulated discharges were highly dependent on the quality of the rainfall inputs provided by that data limitations have been reported in quintana seguí et al 2017 and include the existence of artificial discontinuities at the borders of the climatically homogeneous zones the overestimation of the number of rainfall days as the model generates rainfall for a whole climatically homogeneous zone once there is a localized rainfall event in some of the stations within thereby wrongly assigning the event to unaffected stations and missing of high rainfall or localized events as the model tends to average the values of all stations in a zone the impact of these errors on model results needs thus to be quantified for example by comparing streamflow simulations using different weather datasets 3 4 1 model structure errors the mohid land model was implemented using a relatively coarse grid 5 km 5 km which was defined considering the length of the simulation period quality of results and computational speed while that grid size was similar to guerreiro et al 2017 much detail was inevitably lost when converting model inputs into the grid the impact of such losses on final model results was not assessed but streamflow simulations should expectably improve when adopting smaller grid scales as seen in other mohid land applications oliveira et al private communication while the mohid land model is generically a physically based model that solves mass and momentum conservation equations for simulating landscape processes water infiltration and surface runoff were here computed using a semi empirical approach with the intention of simplifying the description of the simulated processes and increasing computation speed limitations on using the cn method for simulating such processes are well documented in boughton 1989 and eli and lamont 2010 which among other critics include the systematic underestimation of runoff discharge peaks when compared with other approaches e g the green ampt method the modeling approach was also limited by not properly defining the kc values according to the vegetation growth stages allen et al 1998 systematically over or underestimating evapotranspiration in the catchment throughout the simulation period groundwater extractions were also not included as such information was not available with enough detail furthermore irrigation was absent but if considered would likely modify flow paths and impact the comparison of modeled and simulated streamflow finally water evaporation from reservoirs was not accounted for likely having some impact on the computation of the catchment water balance still the modeling limitation that most affected model performance was no doubly related to reservoir management on one hand better operation rules than those given in table 2 need to be defined in the mohid land model for properly estimating reservoir discharge in the absence of measured data on the other hand the information related to reservoir discharge and consumption needs to be improved to be included in model simulations with greater detail in this study reservoir outflows imposed in the portuguese reservoirs accounted for many data limitations as information was not available for the entire simulation period snirh 2019 for the spanish reservoirs the available information on reservoir outflows and consumptions was aggregated into one unique time series ceh cedex 2019 obviously increasing uncertainty with the assumptions that need to be made for partitioning that data as in this study no partitioning was considered simulated streamflow values were inevitably higher than actual discharge values 4 conclusions this modeling application showed the usefulness of the mohid land model in simulating streamflow at hydrometric stations not influenced by reservoir management but also the inherent limitations by not considering relevant processes such as groundwater abstractions to the accurate prediction of the guadiana river flow regime for the hydrometric stations located downstream reservoir management model simulations were generally poor as the agreement with measured streamflow was dependent on reservoir discharge rather than the basic physical processes evapotranspiration water infiltration soil storage and so on describing landscape heterogeneity hence information on groundwater abstractions and reservoir management discharges consumptions needs to be made available with greater detail for the better development of water management tools including fully distributed models like mohid land in the end the accurate quantification of streamflow in guadiana as well as in other transitional catchments can only benefit local water authorities and reduce potential conflicts in a context of enhanced water scarcity declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

8425,study region guadiana international catchment located in the iberian peninsula study focus the guadiana river catchment has registered an intense and speed up modification of its natural regime over the last few decades to cope with water scarcity such modifications pose a serious challenge to the development of improved management tools as information on available water resources is often not detailed enough this study aimed to simulate the flow regime of the guadiana river using the mohid land model during a 30 years period two scenarios were defined by considering or not inputs from reservoirs model performance was assessed by comparing simulated and measured monthly streamflow at 24 hydrometric stations influenced 9 stations or not 15 stations by reservoir management new hydrological insights for the region streamflow simulations produced quite acceptable estimates for most of the hydrometric stations not influenced by reservoirs however results also showed the importance of non simulated processes e g groundwater abstractions to the accurate prediction of the guadiana flow regime for the stations influenced by reservoir management model simulations generally overestimated streamflow measurements information related to reservoir management needs thus to be made clearer for achieving better results which can only be accomplished when national water agencies improve their cooperation protocols further model limitations were also addressed as well as the necessary developments for improving streamflow estimates in future modeling applications keywords distributed model iberian peninsula mohid land streamflow water scarcity 1 introduction water resources in regions under arid semi arid and even sub humid conditions are subjected to multiple pressures that result mostly from population growth major demographic shifts as people move from rural to urban environments higher demands for food security and socio economic well being increased competition between users and usages and contamination from point and diffuse pollution sources wwap 2019 agriculture is by far the largest water consumer accounting for 69 of the global annual water withdrawals followed by industry 19 and households 12 aquastat 2019 as global water demand is expected to increase 20 to 30 above the current level of water use by 2050 mainly due to the rising demand in the industrial and domestic sectors so will water stress levels which already afflict about 4 billion people worldwide be enhanced wwap 2019 sustainable management practices are thus needed for optimizing the use of water resources at the regional scale and reducing potential conflicts among users a representative example of the need for improved management plans is the guadiana transnational river catchment shared by portugal and spain the climate in the region is mostly dry sub humid to semi arid with some areas being among the driest places in europe the seasonality of rainfall and high evapotranspiration demand typically results in a period with high winter discharges and another with low summer discharges the region is also cyclically affected by extended droughts that further enhance the seasonality of local water resources vicente serrano 2006 paulo et al 2012 lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 consequently the guadiana river has been subjected to an intense and speed up modification of its natural regime with reservoir storage capacity increasing from almost zero in 1954 to close to 14 000 hm3 nowadays brandão and rodrigues 2000 ceh cedex 2019 snirh 2019 at the same time large agriculture projects were developed with water withdrawals approaching sometimes the limits of sustainability for example the dramatic increase of groundwater abstractions for irrigation in the upper region of the guadiana basin has led to the decline of groundwater levels degradation of protected wetlands rise of groundwater salinity levels and occasional water transfers from the tagus basin conan et al 2003 bromley et al 2010 in portugal alqueva was built to be the largest reservoir in europe constituting a strategic water reserve for the southern part of the country and deeply modifying the landscape and production systems by providing water for irrigation of 150 000 ha of agricultural land distributed between the guadiana and sado basins urban and industrial consumption energy production and regularization of flows edia 2019 the albufeira convention is the international agreement signed between portugal and spain in 1998 and later revised in 2008 which regulates the flow regime in the five transnational basins shared by the two countries minho lima douro tejo and guadiana for the case of the guadiana catchment the convention defines minimum flows for different trimesters of the year or alternatively a minimum annual flow measured at the badajoz weir where the guadiana river enters portugal minimum flows are dependent on the amount of rainfall and water stored in pre defined reservoirs the convention further defines conditions for an exceptional regime which is usually associated with drought periods in this case a minimum daily flow of 2 m3 s 1 perceived as a basic ecological minimum is established as the only requirement at the badajoz weir but also at pomarão as the river flows from portugal to become the border between the two countries just 70 km above its estuary agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 while the compliance with the albufeira convention agreement is considered a top priority for water allocation in both countries water scarcity issues in both portugal and spain pose already significant challenges for water resources management do ó 2012 on the spanish side local authorities report an annual deficit close to 600 hm3 without the adoption of measures limiting demand confederação hidrográfica do guadiana 2014 on the portuguese side irrigation during drought seasons is much dependent on the amount of water stored in alqueva which is now connected to smaller reservoirs to compensate for water shortages in different parts of the alentejo region meanwhile climate change projections that foresee significant reductions in rainfall and streamflow for the near future kilsby et al 2007 guerreiro et al 2017 only add more uncertainty to the availability of water resources in the guadiana basin the vulnerability of water resources in the guadiana catchment requires a precise quantification of the volumes available with modeling being many times selected as a preferred tool for achieving such purpose brandão and rodrigues 2000 used the iras interactive river aquifer simulation loucks et al 1995 model to simulate streamflow in the portuguese part of the guadiana catchment considering six hydrological scenarios that were defined to assess the impact of the albufeira convention and the spanish hydrological plan on water volumes stored in portuguese reservoirs also conan et al 2003 applied the swat soil water assessment tool neitsch et al 2011 model to assess the impact of groundwater withdrawals on the hydrological behavior of the upper guadiana river catchment later kilsby et al 2007 estimated the impact of climate change projections on runoff production streamflow and water resources availability in the guadiana catchment using a distributed daily rainfall runoff model finally guerreiro et al 2017 pursued a similar objective estimating the impact of climate change projections on the guadiana river streamflow using the shetran model ewen et al 2000 while the previous studies provided significant insights for the accurate quantification of local water resources they all shared similar constraints when validating model results due to simplifications adopted when describing the complexity of the guadiana basin and the modified flow regime of the guadiana river this study provides a further attempt to simulate streamflow in the guadiana river using the mohid land model trancoso et al 2009 mohid land is a fully distributed process based model that considers interactions between multiple components of the soil water atmosphere continuum with fundamental processes being formulated at fine spatial at the grid cell level and temporal scales contributing to the overall dynamics of the catchment at a larger scale the mohid land model structure is comparable to the shetran model used in guerreiro et al 2017 and applications include for example improving irrigation practices at the plot and field scales ramos et al 2017 2018 simionesei et al 2018 understanding the contribution of flood events to the eutrophication of water reservoirs brito et al 2017 2018 and forecasting fresh water quantity and quality in coastal rivers brito et al 2015 the objectives of this study were thus i to simulate streamflow in the guadiana catchment under two scenarios that included or not reservoir management and iii to discuss model limitations and developments research and data needed for better quantifying local water resources in future applications 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the study area the guadiana catchment is located in the southern region of the iberian peninsula fig 1 being the fourth largest after douro tagus and ebro the drainage area covers 66 999 km2 of which 55 465 km2 82 8 are in spain and 11 534 km2 17 2 are in portugal agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 the river has a bed length over 800 km with headwaters in lagunas de ruidera castilla la mancha spain 38 58 21 n 2 53 9 w 868 m the river then flows in the north east south west direction to the border cities of vila real de santo antónio portugal and ayamonte spain where it meets the atlantic ocean 37 10 40 n 7 24 18 w 0 m the climate in the catchment ranges from hot summer mediterranean climate csa to cold semi arid steppe climate bsk im and aemet 2011 the mean annual temperature is close to 16 c varying between 28 c in july august ciudad real spain and 8 5 c in january elvas portugal the mean annual rainfall is 550 mm 561 mm in portugal and 540 mm in spain with minimum of 350 450 mm in the central area of the la mancha plain spain and mértola and moura portugal and maximum of more than 1000 mm in the headwaters of the tributaries ardila odeleite and caia the interannual distribution of precipitation is also extremely irregular ranging from 386 mm in dry years to 766 mm in wet years on average more than 80 of the total annual precipitation occurs between october and april agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 the dominant soils are regosols 44 of the area cambisols 28 and luvisols 14 iuss working group 2014 fig 2 soils in the upper region of the catchment are mostly derived from unconsolidated calcareous deposits while in the middle and low regions soils originate from metamorphic rocks schists gneiss migmatite the main land uses are divided between rainfed or irrigated agriculture 65 and mediterranean woodland 18 or shrubland 16 fig 2 in spain 85 of the diverted water is used for irrigation the irrigated area covers over 400 000 ha cereals vineyards and industrial crops are the dominant crops with an annual average consumption of 5300 m3 ha 1 confederação hidrográfica do guadiana 2014 in portugal 88 of the diverted water is used mainly for energy production although this is not a consumptive use water use in agriculture totalizes only 9 1 of the diverted water agência portuguesa do ambiente 2016 however this number will inevitably increase in the near future as the alqueva project progressively adds over 150 000 ha of new irrigated land to that already existing in the region edia 2019 the catchment has a population of 1 9 million inhabitants with a density of 28 inhabitants km 2 in spain and 114 inhabitants km 2 in portugal eurostat 2019 there are 39 reservoirs located along the catchment with a total storage capacity above 10 hm3 the threshold limit assumed here to impact the hydrological regime of the guadiana river these were built between 1944 and 2010 the largest is alqueva 38 11 48 n 7 29 45 w 85 m built in 2002 with a total capacity of 4150 hm3 the smallest is lucefecit 38 38 09 n 7 24 22 w 173 m built in 1982 with a total capacity of 10 2 hm3 several others exist with less storage capacity fig 3 2 2 model description mohid land is a physically based fully distributed model designed to simulate the water cycle in hydrographic catchments trancoso et al 2009 the model considers four compartments or mediums atmosphere porous media soil surface and river network the atmosphere is not explicitly simulated but provides data necessary for imposing surface boundary conditions that may be space and time variant water moves through the remaining mediums based on mass and momentum conservation equations that are computed using a finite volume approach the simulation domain is organized into a regular structured grid quadrangular or rectangular in the horizontal plane and cartesian type in the vertical plane surface land is thus described by a 2d horizontal grid the porous media is a 3d domain which includes the same horizontal grid as the surface complemented with a vertical grid with variable thickness layers the river network is a 1d domain defined from the digital terrain model dtm with the drainage network linking surface cell centers nodes the model further uses an explicit algorithm with a variable time step that is maximum during dry seasons when fluxes are reduced and minimum when fluxes increase e g during rain events in this study runoff and infiltration of surface water were computed using the curve number cn procedure usda soil conservation service 1972 1 q s u r f 0 w h e n p d a y i a p d a y i a 2 p d a y i a

prior to runoff l and r is a retention parameter l 2 r 25400 c n 254 where cn is the curve number the variably saturated flow in the porous medium was computed using the richards equation as follows 3 θ t x i k θ h x i x i s h where θ is the volumetric water content l3 l 3 t is the time t xi are the xzy directions h is the soil pressure head l k is the hydraulic conductivity l t 1 and s is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots l3 l 3 t 1 the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties were then described using the van genuchten mualem functional relationships mualem 1976 van genucthen 1980 4 s e h θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α h η m 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where se is the effective saturation l3 l 3 θr and θs denote the residual and saturated water contents l3 l 3 respectively ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 α l 1 and η are empirical shape parameters m 1 1 η and l is a pore connectivity tortuosity parameter the mohid land model uses the richards equation in the whole subsurface domain and simulates saturated and unsaturated flow using the same grid a cell is considered as saturated when moisture is above 98 when a cell reaches saturation the model uses the saturated conductivity and pressure becomes hydrostatic corrected by friction this procedure easies the implementation of the model and simplifies its use at annual scale the penalty is the time step that during the wetting period must be shorter to guarantee stability the constraint is minimized using parallel computing the sink term s in eq 3 was computed using the macroscopic approach proposed by feddes et al 1978 following this approach potential transpiration tp l t 1 was linearly distributed over the root zone creating the function tp z which was diminished by the presence of depth varying root zone stressors namely water stress skaggs et al 2006 šimůnek and hopmans 2009 as follows 6 t a α h t p z where ta is the actual transpiration rate l t 1 and α is a prescribed dimensionless function of h 0 α 1 limiting tp over the root zone the piecewise linear model proposed by feddes et al 1978 was then adopted for computing tp reductions due to water stress α h assuming that the water uptake was at the potential rate when the pressure head was between h2 and h3 dropped off linearly when h h2 or h h3 and became zero when h h4 or h h1 subscripts 1 4 denote for different threshold pressure heads plant transpiration and soil evaporation were thus the main drivers for computing soil water dynamics in the porous media but first crop evapotranspiration rates etc l t 1 were obtained from the product of reference evapotranspiration rates eto l t 1 computed with the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 and a single crop coefficient kc the kc values were not crop stage dependent as in allen et al 1998 representing instead average characteristics of each vegetation type over the entire growing season as well as averaged effects of evaporation from the soil etc values were then partitioned into potential soil evaporation ep l t 1 and tp as a function of the leaf area index lai m2 m 2 following ritchie 1972 7 t p e t c 1 e λ l a i 8 e p e t c t p where λ is the extinction coefficient of radiation attenuation within the canopy the actual soil evaporation ea l t 1 was obtained by limiting ep values using an imposed pressure head threshold value american society of civil engineers 1996 the lai as well as other crop growth state variables were simulated using a modified version of the epic model williams et al 1989 neitsch et al 2011 this model is based on the heat unit theory which considers that all heat above the base temperature will accelerate crop growth and development crop growth was thus simulated as a function of the intercepted light its conversion into biomass and lai development neitsch et al 2011 lai was calculated as a function of heat units the crop development stages and crop stress neitsch et al 2011 additional details can be found in ramos et al 2017 surface water movement in the soil and the river network were computed by solving a saint venant equation in its conservative form accounting for advection pressure and friction forces for one in the river or two horizontal at the soil surface directions of the grid 9 q i t v i q i x i g a v h x i q q i n 2 a v r h 4 3 where q is the water flow in the river l3 t 1 av is the cross sectional flow area l2 g is the gravitational acceleration l t 2 v is the flow velocity l t 1 h is the hydraulic head l n is the manning coefficient t l 1 3 and rh is the hydraulic radius l the exchange between the river network and the subsurface flow computed with the richards equation was driven by the pressure at the interface river level and the pressure in the porous media phreatic level likewise the eventual excess water volume reallocated to the surface of the porous media domain exfiltration when the soil column was saturated was driven by the phreatic level surface water exchange between the river and riparian zones were further computed based on the kinematic approach neglecting bottom friction and using an implicit algorithm to avoid instabilities 2 3 model implementation the mohid land model trancoso et al 2009 was implemented in the study area using a square horizontal grid with 75 136 cells each with 0 045 0 045 5 km 5 km the digital terrain model dtm was obtained from the nasa shuttle radar topographic mission srtm at 3 arc second spatial resolution approximately 70 90 m rabus et al 2003 then interpolated to the mohid land grid using the average of values inside a grid cell and further modified to eliminate sunken or depressed cells topography in the modified dtm varied then from 0 to 1375 m fig 2 the soil map was extracted from the harmonized soil database fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 with the 30 arc second raster information being also interpolated to the mohid land grid the soil reference units represented at the scale of the study domain were regosols 44 0 cambisols 28 3 luvisols 14 0 leptosols 4 6 acrisols 4 5 fluvisols 2 8 planosols 0 7 vertisols 0 7 and arenosols 0 4 fig 2 first the porous media was discretized into seven vertical layers with varying thickness from 0 3 m at the surface to 8 9 m at the impermeable bottom each soil column was then divided into three horizons by grouping layers of the vertical grid the surface horizon was defined by the top layer of the vertical grid 0 0 0 3 m depth the sub surface horizon by the second layer 0 3 0 8 m depth and the bottom horizon by the remaining five layers 0 8 30 0 m depth soil depth was corrected according to the surface slope provided by the dtm assuming larger depths in valleys than in ridges the thickness of the bottom layers was thus adjusted based on the assumed soil depths which end up varying from 25 9 to 30 0 m the soil hydraulic parameters of the mualem van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 were finally derived for each soil horizon of each soil reference group using soil texture information available in the harmonized soil database and the hypres class pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 the l pore connectivity tortuosity parameter was set to 0 5 following mualem 1976 for the initial conditions the soil was assumed as saturated for 83 of the profile from the bottom to the surface while the soil water content in the unsaturated zone was set to field capacity the corine land cover clc 2012 map with 100 m resolution copernicus land monitoring service 2019 was likewise interpolated to the mohid land grid and used for defining the vegetation type and surface rugosity the land uses represented at the scale of the study domain were agricultural areas 65 3 shrubland 16 5 mixed forest 12 4 evergreen forest 2 9 deciduous forest 2 7 and grassland 0 1 fig 2 urban areas were not included considering the large representation of agricultural and shrubland areas 81 9 the definition of the cn values ended up being simplified to basically account for the soil reference group and were set following the usda soil conservation service 1972 tables the manning coefficient was defined for each vegetation type according to van der sande et al 2003 vegetation growth parameters assumed the same default values as in neitsch et al 2011 the annual kc values of each vegetation type averaged the kc values of the different crop development stages given in allen et al 1998 hourly data from the safran model quintana seguí et al 2017 was used for defining the atmosphere boundary conditions of the simulation domain safran applies an interpolation algorithm that combines observations and the outputs of a meteorological model to produce a gridded dataset of precipitation temperature wind speed relative humidity and downward visible and infrared radiation for the period 1969 2014 the safran further uses climatically homogeneous zones to divide the space into the analysis areas which are then presented in a grid format with a resolution of 5 km this grid was here interpolated to the mohid land grid using a triangulation method the river network was derived from the dtm using the steepest slope in 8 directions i e according to the height of the surrounding cells the river cross sections were defined as having a trapezoidal shape with dimensions set based on the drainage area of each node 16 classes were considered table 1 with heights and widths at the top and bottom of the trapezoidal cross sections being set according to andreadis et al 2013 and neal et al 2015 for the nodes with intermediate drainage areas the dimensions of the cross section were linear interpolated from those assumed in the upper and lower classes for the scenario simulating the modified flow regime of the guadiana river model simulations further considered all reservoirs with a volume storage capacity larger than 10 hm3 39 reservoirs were implemented representing a total storage capacity of 13 974 hm3 fig 3 11 reservoirs were present from the beginning of the simulation period while the remaining were gradually introduced depending on the respective start of operation date the mohid land model further requires the location and maximum and minimum volume capacity for simulating reservoir operation reservoir outflows can then be imposed when data is available or estimated according to an operation curve in this study reservoir outflows were defined for 31 reservoirs with data being extracted from snirh 2019 for portugal and ceh cedex 2019 for spain the operation curve was considered for the remaining 8 reservoirs with the outflow being estimated as a function of the inflow and the actual storage volume in percentage values table 2 2 4 model calibration validation model simulations were conducted between october 1st 1979 and june 30rd 2014 the first six years october 1st 1979 to september 30rd 1985 were used as model warm up the calibration period was from october 1st 1985 to september 30rd 1995 10 years and the validation period was from october 1st 1995 to june 30rd 2014 19 years during model calibration validation simulations of daily streamflow were compared against measured data in 24 hydrometric stations located along the catchment fig 3 daily values were also converted to monthly data to compute the statistical indicators presented below only hydrometric stations having a minimum of five years of measured data were considered measured data were obtained from snirh 2019 for portugal and from ceh cedex 2019 for spain a sensitive analysis was first carried out where selected parameters were modified one at a time and the model was run until the end of the calibration period to assess their impact on mohid land simulations of streamflow model calibration validation ended up focusing on the dimensions of the river cross sections in the different nodes heights and top and bottom widths the curve number cn the manning coefficient n the annual crop coefficient kc the vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the multiplying factor fh for obtaining the horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity from ks ks hor fh ks model parameters were modified by trial and error during calibration until deviations between measured and simulated values were minimized validation was then performed by simply comparing model simulations using the calibrated parameters for the 1995 2014 period and respective measured dataset different goodness of fit tests were considered for assessing model performance including the coefficient of determination r2 the ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of observed data nrmse the percent bias pbias and the model efficiency

predictor than the model 3 results and discussion 3 1 model parametrization the mohid land model includes a considerable number of parameters that need to be first calibrated validated to provide reliable estimates of simulated results the sensitive analysis carried out in this study identified the dimensions of the river cross sections heights and top and bottom widths and the cn n kc ks and fh parameters as the most important in need of adjustment suggesting the importance of horizontal flow processes runoff and lateral flow for reproducing the hydrological response of the guadiana catchment this agrees with glaser et al 2019 who discussed the importance of nonuniform lateral flow rather than vertical preferential flow processes observed at plot scale for simulating the hydrological regime in the weierbach catchment germany using the hydrogeosphere model likewise el nasr et al 2005 simulated streamflow in the jeker catchment belgium using the mike she model in their application model calibration validation focused mostly on parameters influencing lateral flow such as the drainage network configuration and the vertical and horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the geological layers in the saturated zone mcmichael et al 2006 and im et al 2009 further expressed the importance of horizontal flow processes in their applications using the same distributed model in this study the mohid land simulations required the enlargement of the river cross sections for accommodating streamflow in the drainage network during peak events table 1 this adjustment was especially noted at the nodes discharging the smallest areas with cross section areas increasing size by 3 to 10 times compared to the initial default values the cn values are listed in table 3 for the main soil reference units ranging from 66 to 79 these values were comparable to those used by conan et al 2003 in their swat model application for the upper guadiana basin in this previous work cn values were set to range from 39 for pasture in regosols to 87 for agriculture in luvisols in both applications higher cn values obviously resulted in higher runoff and lower infiltration volumes the n values suffered only minor adjustments table 4 except for the deciduous forest class which value increased from 0 125 to 0 230 s m 1 3 higher n values meant greater resistance to surface flow and reduced runoff volumes table 4 further lists the annual kc values considered in this study which ranged from 0 8 in the deciduous forest class to 1 0 in the evergreen forest class because catchment scale applications of the mohid land model can only currently consider a single kc value describing the full crop growing season the calibrated values cannot meet the definitions given in allen et al 1998 and can hardly be compared to other applications nevertheless higher kc values correspond to greater potential evapotranspiration rates the ks values also increased when compared with wösten et al 1999 tabulated values table 3 which comes with no surprise since pedotransfer functions can only provide modest estimates of soil hydraulic properties these functions are further based on measurements carried out in the laboratory in samples of limited size with issues related to their representativeness being often raised when describing actual flow conditions transport and reaction processes occurring at the field catchment scales due to limitations in the porous medium continuum van looy et al 2017 finally the fh was set to 3 0 promoting sub surface flow 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 streamflow simulations not influenced by reservoir management table 5 presents the goodness of fit indicators used to evaluate the level of agreement between streamflow measurements in hydrometric stations located in upstream reservoirs fig 3 and the mohid land simulations in general the model performed reasonably well when simulating streamflow at the above mentioned locations during the calibration 1985 1995 and validation periods 1995 2014 an example is given in fig 4 which shows the flow duration curve for the oeiras station the flow duration curve is a cumulative frequency curve that shows the percent of time during which specified discharges are equaled or exceeded in a given period searcy 1959 at the oeiras station model simulations matched closely the measured values for streamflow values below 2 0 m3 s 1 but a small departure between the two data series was noticed for larger flows relatively high values of r2 r2 0 75 were found for 10 of 15 hydrometric stations considered during calibration showing that the model could explain well the variability of the observed data most of these stations were in the lower region of the guadiana catchment mostly in portugal while those located in the upper part stations 4004 4201 and 4224 failed to produce acceptable r2 values r2 0 17 fig 5 a model simulations performed well for 5 of the 12 hydrometric stations considered during validation the r2 values were generally lower than in calibration with the upper region of the guadiana catchment still failing to produce acceptable r2 values r2 0 29 fig 5b overall the errors of the estimates were relatively small resulting in nrmse values below 0 25 for 12 of 15 hydrometric stations considered in calibration fig 6 a and for all stations accounted for in validation fig 6b on the other hand the pbias values evidenced some overestimation of the measured data negative values in most of the spanish hydrometric stations during both calibration and validation which were not so relevant since average flows were relatively small at these locations 0 17 to 4 60 m3 s 1 for the hydrometric stations in portugal model simulations resulted in smaller over or under predictions of the measured streamflow but no spatial trend was noticed fig 7 exceptions were the streamflow estimates in ponte algalé and monte dos fortes where a larger bias was found finally the nse modeling efficiency values were relatively high nse 0 75 for 7 of 15 hydrometric stations considered during calibration fig 8 a indicating that the residual variance was much smaller than the measured data variance most of those stations were in the lower region of the guadiana catchment while for the upper region results showed that the measured averages were a more reliable predictor than model simulations similar results were found during validation fig 8b the model systematically failing in delivering accurate estimates of streamflow in the upper guadiana was associated with the large groundwater abstractions in the region which were not accounted for in model simulation conan et al 2003 kilsby et al 2007 for example bromley et al 2010 reported considerable annual groundwater discharge rates from 200 to 688 hm3 y 1 from the west la mancha aquifer during a period of unrestrained irrigation expansion from 1974 to 1988 nevertheless while the mohid land model was not able to accurately simulate streamflow in all hydrometric stations located upstream the reservoirs considered in this application results were very satisfactory for most of the locations under analysis note that contrarily to guerreiro et al 2017 who considered only a small sub basin for calibrating validating model predictions for the entire guadiana basin the mohid land model performance was here assessed considering the entire extent of the catchment thus accounting for the different land uses soils slopes and rainfall patterns found throughout the basin 3 2 2 streamflow simulations influenced by reservoir management the goodness of fit indicators obtained by comparing streamflow measurements in hydrometric stations influenced by reservoir management and the mohid land simulations are presented in table 6 these monitoring stations were naturally located downstream some reservoirs fig 3 with reservoir operation deeply modifying the flow regime globally results were much worse than those presented for the scenario without reservoir management with the mohid land model failing to reproduce streamflow measurements in most stations exceptions were the 4255 and amieira stations in spain and portugal respectively figs 5 8 in these locations all statistical indicators showed a relatively good agreement between model results and measured data r2 0 72 nrmse 0 05 pbias 33 9 and nse 0 6 fig 4 further gives an example of the flow duration curve for the amieira station for the remaining hydrometric stations the model always overestimated measured flows as seen by the large negative values of the pbias table 6 this constituted the main problem in this modeling application since measured streamflow were higher range from 1 01 to 145 8 m3 s 1 than those registered in the hydrometric stations located upstream reservoir management range from 0 17 to 4 60 m3 s 1 for the stations located in the main river bed rocha da galé pulo do lobo and ponte mourão streamflow simulations even produced unrealistic estimates 1688 m3 s 1 thus the erroneous predictions found for the stations influenced by reservoir management posed here as the main obstacle to an accurate computation of the catchment water balance in line with all previous modeling applications in the guadiana river brandão and rodrigues 2000 conan et al 2003 kilsby et al 2007 guerreiro et al 2017 fig 9 compares the scenarios with and without reservoirs at amieira 4255 and monte da vinha stations monte da vinha was added to the figure to better explain the differences between both scenarios despite results were not validated at that location by the statistical indicators table 6 in general the further downstream the station was located the greater the departure between the two simulations streamflow at amieira ended up being slightly influenced by reservoir management due to the size of the monte novo 15 3 hm3 and vigia 16 5 hm3 upstream reservoirs at 4255 the two simulations started departing after january 1996 when the peña del águila reservoir 130 hm3 began operating affecting mostly streamflow peaks monte da vinha showed the greatest difference between the two simulations but as consumptions were not considered in the modeling approach the differences between the two scenarios remained small 3 3 about model predictions fully distributed models such as mohid land are usually considered to provide improved predictions of streamflow along the river network of a catchment while also accounting for the spatial dynamics of evapotranspiration soil moisture content water quality soil erosion and land use change impacts yilmaz et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 yet their spatial complexity often limits the proper identification of model parameters translating into significant predictive uncertainty in the simulation results beven and freer 2001 model parameters are typically derived from soil and land use datasets or inferred from spatiotemporal data these parameters mostly result from relationships derived from small scale applications being embedded into larger scale model grids without proper accounting for heterogeneity emergent processes scaling and interactions across scales reed et al 2004 yilmaz et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 as such proper calibration procedures are required to meet the set of parameters that best describe the simulated landscape processes this modeling application adopted a simple trial and error procedure for calibrating streamflow a series of techniques e g data mining machine learning and inverse optimization exist that can be used to further optimize model parameters but which require a considerable effort if implemented in mohid land despite that model uncertainty can still be associated with different causes including errors related to field measurements and to model input and model structure errors 3 3 1 field measurements streamflow measurements were obtained from public datasets used to monitor the guadiana flow regime in both portugal snirh 2019 and spain ceh cedex 2019 those values are usually not directly measured but converted from water level known as stage time series through a stage discharge model known as rating curve this in turn is derived using paired stage and discharge measurements occasionally observed in the field horner et al 2018 discussed the general sources of error for stage measurements with these being site specific and associated with the channel characteristics the information available to build the rating curve the station management the time interval at which streamflow data are averaged and the streamflow range those authors further adverted for the fact that while stage measurement errors are generally overlooked they may well be more substantial for hydrometric stations characterized by low flow depths such as those in the guadiana catchment catchments in arid semiarid environments additionally the cadc 2017 minutes refer the need for harmonizing the measurement procedures in both portugal and spain as readings from some hydrometric stations are sometimes inconsistent with others available nearby 3 4 model inputs parameter uncertainty was associated with soil land use and rainfall data detailed soil maps are rare in most regions of the world and soil information is even scarcer when referring to soil hydraulic properties pedotransfer functions are thus presented as the best possible solution for characterizing soil heterogeneity at the catchment scale since direct measurements are impractical due to the associated costs van looy et al 2017 the pedotransfer functions adopted in this study wösten et al 1999 provided only a very simplified representation of soil variability by considering a set of soil hydraulic parameters for each textural class likewise past applications of the mohid land model e g brito et al 2015 2017 adopted the same functions for characterizing soil variability recently montzka et al 2017 and tóth et al 2016 developed soil hydraulic grid maps 250 m 1 km for different layers that may better describe soil heterogeneity and that should provide the basis for improving soil hydraulic characterization in future catchment scale applications of the mohid land model a functional evaluation of those maps is thus required to better understand their usefulness to catchment scale modelling uncertainty related to land use was mostly associated with vegetation growth stages the corresponding set of model parameters impact directly evapotranspiration fluxes and respective partitioning into soil evaporation and crop transpiration ramos et al 2018 showed the importance of an accurate description of vegetation growth particularly the lai curve on estimates of the soil water balance at the plot scale they further described the impact of assimilation of lai data derived from landsat 8 imagery on mohid land simulations the main conclusion was that modeling vegetation growth at the regional scale cannot depend solely on inputs from the lai data assimilation because estimates may diverge substantially from the reality thus confirming the need to use a proper data set for calibration nevertheless the sensitivity analysis performed in this study failed to demonstrate vegetation growth as relevant for streamflow simulations meaning that the impact of those parameters on final model results was only minor finally the safran dataset quintana seguí et al 2017 was used for defining the atmosphere boundary conditions of the simulation domain as the only water input considered in the modeling application deviations between measured and simulated discharges were highly dependent on the quality of the rainfall inputs provided by that data limitations have been reported in quintana seguí et al 2017 and include the existence of artificial discontinuities at the borders of the climatically homogeneous zones the overestimation of the number of rainfall days as the model generates rainfall for a whole climatically homogeneous zone once there is a localized rainfall event in some of the stations within thereby wrongly assigning the event to unaffected stations and missing of high rainfall or localized events as the model tends to average the values of all stations in a zone the impact of these errors on model results needs thus to be quantified for example by comparing streamflow simulations using different weather datasets 3 4 1 model structure errors the mohid land model was implemented using a relatively coarse grid 5 km 5 km which was defined considering the length of the simulation period quality of results and computational speed while that grid size was similar to guerreiro et al 2017 much detail was inevitably lost when converting model inputs into the grid the impact of such losses on final model results was not assessed but streamflow simulations should expectably improve when adopting smaller grid scales as seen in other mohid land applications oliveira et al private communication while the mohid land model is generically a physically based model that solves mass and momentum conservation equations for simulating landscape processes water infiltration and surface runoff were here computed using a semi empirical approach with the intention of simplifying the description of the simulated processes and increasing computation speed limitations on using the cn method for simulating such processes are well documented in boughton 1989 and eli and lamont 2010 which among other critics include the systematic underestimation of runoff discharge peaks when compared with other approaches e g the green ampt method the modeling approach was also limited by not properly defining the kc values according to the vegetation growth stages allen et al 1998 systematically over or underestimating evapotranspiration in the catchment throughout the simulation period groundwater extractions were also not included as such information was not available with enough detail furthermore irrigation was absent but if considered would likely modify flow paths and impact the comparison of modeled and simulated streamflow finally water evaporation from reservoirs was not accounted for likely having some impact on the computation of the catchment water balance still the modeling limitation that most affected model performance was no doubly related to reservoir management on one hand better operation rules than those given in table 2 need to be defined in the mohid land model for properly estimating reservoir discharge in the absence of measured data on the other hand the information related to reservoir discharge and consumption needs to be improved to be included in model simulations with greater detail in this study reservoir outflows imposed in the portuguese reservoirs accounted for many data limitations as information was not available for the entire simulation period snirh 2019 for the spanish reservoirs the available information on reservoir outflows and consumptions was aggregated into one unique time series ceh cedex 2019 obviously increasing uncertainty with the assumptions that need to be made for partitioning that data as in this study no partitioning was considered simulated streamflow values were inevitably higher than actual discharge values 4 conclusions this modeling application showed the usefulness of the mohid land model in simulating streamflow at hydrometric stations not influenced by reservoir management but also the inherent limitations by not considering relevant processes such as groundwater abstractions to the accurate prediction of the guadiana river flow regime for the hydrometric stations located downstream reservoir management model simulations were generally poor as the agreement with measured streamflow was dependent on reservoir discharge rather than the basic physical processes evapotranspiration water infiltration soil storage and so on describing landscape heterogeneity hence information on groundwater abstractions and reservoir management discharges consumptions needs to be made available with greater detail for the better development of water management tools including fully distributed models like mohid land in the end the accurate quantification of streamflow in guadiana as well as in other transitional catchments can only benefit local water authorities and reduce potential conflicts in a context of enhanced water scarcity declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments

8426,the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the united states and its catchment has heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphologic characteristics it includes seven major river basins james patuxent potomac rappahannock susquehanna western shore eastern shore and york remote sensing data along with in situ observations of streamflow and simulated water budget components can provide significant understanding of variability in water resources availability in this diverse watershed in this study we quantify the terrestrial water storage using both remote sensing and in situ data and hydrologic model outputs in the chesapeake bay watershed total water storage change twsc was calculated based on the combination of three methods to identify the best approach in estimating twsc these methods evaluated different sources of data including parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism precipitation modis et u s geological survey observed streamflow and the variable infiltration capacity vic model estimated twsc were in close agreement with grace derived twsc when we employed vic simulated streamflow after calibration with observed streamflow however the use of vic simulated et or modis derived et yielded similar results for twsc assessment of twsc during extreme events drought during the summer months revealed that predicting et is critical for twsc in june august and that vic simulated twsc could be a reliable proxy for grace data to assess the water availability in the watershed keywords water availability remote sensing hydrological modeling chesapeake bay watershed 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of the water budget components namely soil moisture groundwater snow ice lakes and rivers rodell and famiglietti 2001 generally the water budget integrates coupled land and atmospheric processes quantifying precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to arrive at the estimates of terrestrial water storage change twsc over time and space the response of a watershed is assessed using streamflow records that reliably illustrate the space time convolution of the watershed seong and sridhar 2017 seong et al 2017 however the data for other water balance components are critical to understand extreme events such as drought quantify return periods and develop watershed management strategies lakshmi 2016 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 limitations in the spatial coverage of water budget components pose problems in representing the heterogeneity of the watershed at various spatial scales roads et al 2003 pan and wood 2006 although the in situ evapotranspiration measurements are useful for calibration or assimilation procedures interpolation and extrapolation of these estimates are routinely done with the aid of analytical and modeling tools these methods tools generate some uncertainty in the estimation of evapotranspiration which in turn affects the computation of twsc gao et al 2010 billah et al 2015 lakshmi 2016 as the single most influential variable precipitation is extremely important because it captures the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed syed et al 2004 a distributed precipitation estimate that is based on a dense network of in situ measurements is more reliable than evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage estimates gao et al 2010 hydrologic models that deal with land surface interactions such as the variable infiltration capacity vic model are often used to compute the terrestrial water budget berbery et al 2003 luo et al 2005 su and lettenmaier 2009 billah and goodall 2011 hoekema and sridhar 2013 billah et al 2015 these models apply water and energy balance approaches for estimating the spatial distribution of water and energy fluxes from regional to continental scales despite this advancement in modeling high resolution input data for these models are unable to account for anthropogenic effects on the hydrologic cycle nilsson et al 2005 oki and kanae 2006 sridhar 2013 the role of human disturbances that alter the basin hydrological cycle can be assessed by integrating remote sensing and in situ data with hydrologic simulation experiments hanasaki et al 2006 haddleland et al 2007 due to rapid advancements made over the past decade in acquiring high resolution application specific remote sensing observations the monitoring of hydrologic systems over vast areas where observed data are sparse has truly progressed tang et al 2009 dubayah et al 2000 rango and shalaby 1998 schultz 1988 tang et al 2009 wagner et al 2009 application of satellite data in hydrologic systems analysis is also constantly evolving at relevant spatio temporal scales rodell et al 2004 mccabe et al 2008 sheffield et al 2009 tang et al 2010 sridhar et al 2013 however the use of remote sensing data for hydrologic assessments has not reached its full potential due to the inconsistent resolution of data input interpretation and application across various spatial scales the application of remote sensing in combination with in situ observations and models can overcome these uncertainties sridhar et al 2006 sridhar and wedin 2009 the objective of this study is to estimate the terrestrial water storage using remote sensing and in situ data with various combinations of forcing and hydrologic model outputs to evaluate the best approach for estimating the water budget at regional scales this work is similar in some ways to a previous study conducted by billah et al 2015 in that study the researchers used grace gravity recovery and climate experiment modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer nldas north american land data assimilation system prism parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model and scan soil climate analysis network data to study the space time variability of the water balance components of the south carolina watersheds however there are differences between these two studies the 2015 study was carried out over a smaller region in south carolina whereas the present study of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw spans the mid atlantic region of new york pennsylvania delaware maryland virginia west virginia and all of washington d c the main difference between the two studies is the hydrologic component being analyzed in the 2015 study it was evapotranspiration during 2003 2007 period whereas in this work we performed the simulation for twsc from 2003 to 2016 lastly because the cbw is located in the densely populated eastern region of the us which has more than 18 million inhabitants periodical assessments using advanced models and datasets to understand both water quantity and quality are critical for watershed fishery and coastal ecosystem management based on temperature analysis of the years between 1950 and1999 an upward trend of 0 023 c decade was detected in the observed annual mean values in the watershed in a changing climate the average annual temperature is projected to increase between 1 2 c and 1 2 5 c between 2020 2039 relative to the baseline period under the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the increases were higher by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 with 2 3 5 c and 3 6 c respectively an analysis of observed participation records for the period 1950 1999 shows that the basin experienced an increase in magnitude of 18 mm decade generally wetter conditions were projected due to climate change i e more precipitation in the future when compared with the baseline period 1970 1999 for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios most of the models projected a decrease in precipitation of up to 5 while a few projected an increase of up to 20 in mean annual precipitation seong and sridhar 2017 this study also used united states geological survey usgs gauge station data from 19 locations to calibrate the simulated streamflow and enhance its performance compared to the data from 2 gauge stations used in billah et al 2015 usgs 2016 the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the methodology adopted for the analysis along with the study area and the various combinations of data used section 3 provides the results of the analysis and discussion the summary and conclusions of the study are presented in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 study area the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the us spanning from the delmarva peninsula in the east to southwest virginia in the west the fall line divides the watershed by distinguishing heterogeneity in the basin hydrology and geomorphologic characteristics across the line the watershed has a drainage area of 64 299 square miles and more than 150 major rivers and streams flow through it into the north atlantic ocean the watershed consists of seven major river basins susquehanna potomac patuxent eastern shore western shore rappahannock york and james usepa 2010 in the states of virginia west virginia delaware maryland pennsylvania the district of columbia and new york the geographical location and the topography of the chesapeake bay are shown in fig 1 as are the seven major sub basins and the stream network considered in this analysis the northwestern region of the watershed includes the appalachian mountains which have elevations up to 2000 m while the southeastern region is marked by the presence of low lying coastal plains the majority of the land in the watershed is covered with forests 70 while the remaining areas are used for agriculture 23 and urban development 6 seong and sridhar 2017 kang and sridhar 2018 the region experiences a cooler climate with a mean annual temperature of 10 75 c and mean annual precipitation of 1073 mm kang and sridhar 2018 2 2 estimation of water budget the methodology for the analysis is based on the computation of twsc using the water budget framework for the study area water budget accounting typically describes the partitioning of water entering and departing the top few meters of the soil column the mass conservation equation for estimating the change in storage is 1 d s d t t w s e p et r in r out where ds dt or twsc is change in terrestrial water storage p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration and rin is runoff entering and rout is runoff exiting the study area in eq 1 the contribution of the groundwater flux to the twsc was assumed to be negligible since the primary components of twsc are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff variations in each of the components will dynamically impact twsc we used the modeled and remotely sensed products of these components to calculate twsc and compared our results with the grace derived twsc 2 3 terrestrial water storage change estimations in this analysis we have used prism daly et al 1994 gibson et al 2002 precipitation two sources of evapotranspiration vic simulated and modis mu et al 2011 and two sources of runoff data vic simulated and usgs for the estimation of twsc prism precipitation and usgs streamflow data are considered as observed modis evapotranspiration is a remotely sensed product and simulated evapotranspiration and runoff are treated as vic derived model output at a monthly temporal resolution for the period from 2003 to 2016 twsc estimates were computed for the combination of each of these products to evaluate the role of remotely sensed and observed data in improving twsc and to identify the best combination of data while validating them with the grace derived twsc data therefore three combination approaches were employed to derive twsc in non traditional ways 1 prism precipitation vic simulated et and vic simulated runoff 2 prism precipitation modis et and vic simulated runoff and 3 prism precipitation modis et and usgs runoff table 1a et alone caused significant uncertainties in flows and therefore in estimating the twsc since usgs flow data was used for calibration use of usgs flows in combination with vic simulated et became redundant furthermore the focus was on obtaining a realistic estimate of the twsc in the watershed the effect of flows from usgs or the model was integrated adequately for this purpose 2 3 1 observed and remote sensing data precipitation table 1b provides the details of the data types resolution and sources used for this study the prism database gibson et al 2002 for the period between 2003 and 2016 was used for precipitation precipitation includes liquid rain snow freezing rain hail frost or dew the study area primarily received liquid rain during the study period with occasional snow or freezing rain the 4 km prism data was re gridded to 1 16 degree resolution to be used as an input to the vic model prism data is widely used for hydrologic modeling and forecasting schaake et al 2004 trend analysis small et al 2006 and calculation of glacier runoff neal et al 2010 fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation mm in the chesapeake bay watershed between 2003 and 2016 the eastern region of the watershed receives high precipitation ranging from 1100 mm to 1400 mm while the western part gets lesser precipitation of about 700 mm to 1100 mm the mean monthly precipitation mm month in the 7 sub basins between 2003 and 2016 exhibited seasonal variations as shown in fig 2 b h precipitation patterns in the sub basins were similar pattern to the chesapeake bay watershed except in the james eastern shore and patuxent basins where there were some spikes in early fall the seasonal cycle of the precipitation for the chesapeake bay can be divided into three sets of months with highest precipitation between may and september precipitation decreased from september to february reaching its lowest magnitude in the latter month the period from february to may was marked by a gradual increase in precipitation across the entire region 2 3 2 evapotranspiration remote sensing based et estimates were obtained from modis based on the algorithm used by mu et al 2011 this approach shown in mu et al 2007 adopts the penman monteith et method and combines both meteorological observations air pressure minimum air temperature humidity and radiation and remote sensing data land cover albedo lai and evi at a spatial resolution of 1 km mu et al 2011 showed improvements to the estimates of nighttime and wet surface et soil heat flux canopy transpiration we used the modis16 derived monthly et at a 1 km spatial resolution for the study period between 2003 and 2016 fig 3 which was re gridded to 1 16th of a degree approximately 7 km 2 3 3 streamflow the usgs observed monthly streamflow data for the period between 1991 and 2010 available from 19 stations distributed across the watershed were used the geographical locations and the details of these gauge station are included in fig 1 and table 2 respectively the management in the uplands of the catchment played a critical role in the selection of these streamflow stations we have chosen these stations in order to evaluate the basin flow under natural conditions farther downstream the flow was either managed using dams and reservoirs or influenced by tides the long term data available for the chosen sites was also a reason to include them in our analysis because they are a significant component in the estimation of twsc the calibration and evaluation of the hydrologic model using these streamflow records were considered important for the study and the results of those processes are shown in fig 4 2 3 4 grace to evaluate the storage in the watershed terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa was computed from the grace dataset for the period between 2003 and 2016 monthly estimates of the gravity field data from grace were interpreted to estimate the water storage swenson and wahr 2006 the grace product available at 1 degree spatial resolution from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl was used in the analysis several studies have used the grace data and examples of applications include the evaluation of groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 girotto et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 the improvement of global hydrological models güntner 2008 the estimation of steric sea level variations lombard et al 2007 and glacial isostatic adjustment steffen et al 2008 in this analysis the grace twsc product was used as the reference data for the comparison of the twsc derived from the various combinations of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff products the grace tws anomaly twsa products were converted into change in tws twsc for the above mentioned study period the difference between grace observed tws anomaly twsa for two consecutive time steps shown in eq 2 provides the estimates of twsc 2 t w s c g r a c e δ t t w s a t i δ t t w s a t i where t i δ t and t i represent the ending and starting times respectively in the time period δ t twsa was converted to twsc by multiplying the twsa by the grid scaling factor as doing so minimized the difference between the smoothed and unfiltered monthly water variations and allowed for consideration of the heterogeneity in the water budget components across the domain wiese et al 2016 2 4 hydrologic model we implemented the vic model liang et al 1994 for the simulation of streamflow and evapotranspiration in order to calculate the monthly estimates of twsc vic is a large scale semi distributed model that has been used for hydrological predictions and assessment jin and sridhar 2010 sridhar et al 2013 hokema and sridhar 2013 surface and groundwater modeling sridhar et al 2017 drought analysis kang and sridhar 2017 kang and sridhar 2018 mishra et al 2017 climate change impact assessment guo et al 2009 hydropower evaluation vicuňa et al 2011 and determination of anthropogenic effect on water and energy balance simulation haddleland et al 2007 the vic model solves water and energy fluxes for each grid to enable the estimation of runoff and baseflow the arno model conceptualization todini 1996 was used for the calculation of baseflow and excess precipitation related runoff generation based on the infiltration mechanism outlined in the xinanjiang model ren jun 1992 the vic model was implemented at 1 16th degree spatial resolution from 1991 to 2016 using monthly time steps for both the calibration and evaluation periods the meteorological forcing data included precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and wind speed the prism derived daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature data the national centers for environmental prediction and the national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis based wind data were all used in these simulations the data were processed using the linear interpolation technique to generate the gridded inputs with a spatial resolution of 1 16th of a degree the required soil and vegetation data were obtained from the land data assimilation systems ldas http ldas gsfc nasa gov at the same spatial resolution as the meteorological data the soil datasets obtained from ldas were derived from the 1 km penn state statsgo data and contained 11 individual layers up to a depth of 2 5 m and 16 soil texture classifications ranging from sand to bedrock the vic model contained three soil layers and were initially set to 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm for the top middle and deep layers respectively we selected the soil layer depths in part due to the model calibration and validation procedure described in the following paragraph the vegetation parameter file was generated from the ldas vegetation data which contained 11 vegetation classes at 1 16th of a degree the routing of the grid simulated runoff and baseflow was performed using a model developed by lohmann et al 1998 1996 which uses unit hydrograph describing the time travel information of water from each grid to the channel the linearized saint venant s equation guides the routing of flux from each grid through the channel network the vic model parameters used for the calibration include variable infiltration curve binf maximum baseflow velocity dsmax fraction of maximum base flow velocity where base flow occurred ds fraction of maximum soil moisture content above which nonlinear base flow occurred ws and top d1 mid d2 and deep d3 soil layer depth abdulla and lettenmaier 1997a 1997b crow et al 2003 troy et al 2008 ds and dsmax are linked with the control of baseflow whereas ws and binf play a role in the surface runoff the thickness of the soil layer is associated with the runoff peak and evapotranspiration 2 4 1 model calibration and evaluation the calibration of the vic model was carried out by comparing the monthly simulated streamflow with the observed usgs streamflow data at 19 gauge stations fig 1 table 2 during the period 1991 2000 the ability of the vic model to depict the observed streamflow was quantified by the calculation of nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation coefficient r values the nse is defined as 3 nse 1 q o t q m t 2 q o t q o 2 and correlation coefficient r is defined as 4 r n q o t q m t q o t q m t n q o t 2 q m t 2 n q m t 2 q m t 2 where q o is the mean of observed streamflow q o t is observed streamflow at time t q m t is modeled streamflow at time t and n is number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of modis and vic simulated evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is one of the important components of the water budget and plays a primary role in the estimation of tws for this region evapotranspiration is dominant in areas covered with forest due to canopy interception and increased soil moisture with less surface runoff over the ground fig 3 a b shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual evapotranspiration with values ranging between 50 to 1000 mm over the entire watershed as simulated by the vic model and the modis derived product respectively the vic model exhibited a wider range in the simulated evapotranspiration values than the modis derived product especially in the northern region of the watershed the susquehanna and potomac basins demonstrated some heterogeneity with simulated evapotranspiration values from 400 mm to 700 mm and also showed some discrepancies with the modis derived product the difference in vic simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration estimates varied between 300 mm to 300 mm fig 3 c the vic model underestimated the evapotranspiration in large sections of susquehanna potomac and patuxent basins when compared with the modis values the overestimation from the vic model was minimal with most of the region showing values below 150 mm more than 25 of the watershed showed some differences in evapotranspiration within 50 mm between vic simulated and modis derived estimates seasonal variations in evapotranspiration over the chesapeake bay watershed and the 7 sub basins were estimated using the mean monthly values for the same period fig 3 b c the evapotranspiration was the highest in july and then decreased until december the annual cycle of evapotranspiration was mainly governed by temperature variations that closely resembled those in the annual temperature evapotranspiration was greater during the growing season may to august and decreased as the temperature decreased the peak of the evapotranspiration during july was higher for the modis derived product when compared with vic simulated values with all 7 sub basins exhibiting a similar pattern throughout the year mean monthly variation in the estimates from the vic model and the modis derived product showed the underestimation by the vic model was dominant between june and august fig 3 f clearly the differences in et between vic and modis during the peak et periods suggest that modeling et is important for twsc assessment from fig 3f it is evident that vic was overestimating et for the northern and southern portions of the watershed while central and eastern parts showed underestimations of et due to these overestimations in most areas especially during drought years discrepancies in twsc for the regions including the james susquehanna patuxent and eastern shore sub watersheds were noticeable differences in mean monthly values varied from 15 mm to 25 mm with standard deviations of 13 mm the overall comparison between them demonstrated the ability of the vic model to simulate the evapotranspiration more closely and hence provided the justification for the usefulness of these datasets in estimating twsc to better understand basin water availability 3 2 streamflow analysis the calibration of the vic model was performed by comparing simulated and observed monthly streamflow with the aim of achieving both nse and r values closest to unity the parameter used in the calibration the allowable range of values and the range of the final values of the parameters obtained from the calibration are provided in table 3 fig 4 s1 and s2 show the comparison between the simulated monthly streamflow from the vic model and the observed streamflow at multiple gauge locations during the calibration period the nse and r values obtained for each of the gauge station locations are shown in table 4 the vic model was able to simulate the observed streamflow accurately for each of the basins with nse values for most of the stations greater than 0 7 and r values greater than 0 85 for the period between 1991 and 2000 the vic model was evaluated using the monthly streamflow observations for the same locations where the model was calibrated but for the period between 2001 and 2010 the evaluation of the streamflow was found to be satisfactory using the model classification scheme proposed by moriasi et al 2007 it should be noted that the validation period for es2 usgs01485000 gauge station was discontinuous for two years 2005 2006 when there was no data 3 3 estimation of terrestrial water storage change using the three methods the hydrological response of the watershed analyzed using different combinations to estimate twsc was presented as the mean monthly values for the period from 2003 to 2016 fig 5 the monthly variations in the prism precipitation fig 5a vic simulated evapotranspiration fig 5b modis evapotranspiration fig 5c vic simulated runoff fig 5d and usgs runoff fig 5e were used in the combinations specified earlier in order to estimate twsc the comparison of the vic simulated and modis evapotranspiration revealed similar patterns but the modis values were slightly better throughout the study period fig 5b 5c however the monthly vic simulated and usgs runoff series were in close agreement fig 5d 5e as mentioned in section 2 2 spatial analysis of twsc using the three methods was performed with the grace derived twsc estimates fig 6 and monthly time series fig 7 fig 6a shows the mean annual twsc during 2003 2016 as estimated using the prism precipitation vic simulated evapotranspiration and vic simulated runoff mean annual estimates of twsc varied between 30 mm and 30 mm with the lowest value observed in the james basin and the highest value in the eastern shore as estimated by the grace derived twsc mean monthly variations in twsc using method 1 with 1 standard deviation are shown in fig 7a the correlation between twsc estimated using method 1 and grace suggested the overall pattern and magnitudes of change were captured reasonably well over the entire period of 13 years the mean monthly twsc using method 1 varied between 70 mm and 90 mm the twsc calculated using method 2 i e by replacing the vic simulated evapotranspiration in method 1with the modis derived evapotranspiration is shown in fig 6b mean annual twsc estimates were found to be higher when using method 2 with a considerable portion of the watershed having values greater than 40 mm or less than 40 mm deficit storages from the estimates of twsc was evident in several sub basins including susquehanna potomac and patuxent while other areas of the watershed showed surplus values mean annual twsc for the entire chesapeake bay watershed was determined as 6 67 mm using method 2 as compared to the 0 26 mm estimated from method 1 since method 2 differed from method 1 with the use of modis derived evapotranspiration instead of vic simulated evapotranspiration the difference was primarily from modis data the spatial patterns of twsc using method 2 were similar to the spatial distribution of the difference between vic simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration vic simulated minus modis derived evapotranspiration fig 3c the evapotranspiration values fig 3c 5 b 5 c for the susquehanna potomac and patuxent basins were higher with the modis product than the vic simulated result but the twsc values for these areas were lower when calculated with method 2 when than the estimates obtained with method 1 in addition the twsc variations calculated using method 2 were more accurate than those calculated using method 1 in depicting the grace derived twsc with a correlation coefficient value of 0 52 during 2003 2016 method 2 performed better due to averaging that removed some spikes in the data resulting in mean monthly twsc values between 80 mm and 110 mm to increase understanding of the role of surface runoff in estimating twsc method 3 was developed by replacing the vic simulated runoff in method 2 with the usgs runoff so that the components became prism precipitation modis derived evapotranspiration and usgs runoff fig 6c shows the spatial variation of the mean annual twsc for the period 2003 2016 there are more regions of deficit evident in fig 6c than in fig 6b reflecting the effect of observed streamflow from usgs higher deficits were observed in the susquehanna and eastern shore basins and surplus was evident in the york basin marking the western half of the chesapeake bay watershed as a tws deficit region the comparison of the mean monthly vic simulated runoff and the usgs runoff showed a similar pattern but the magnitude of runoff was greater for the usgs data fig 5d e the inclusion of the higher runoff value in eq 1 caused the model to show a twsc deficit over several regions within the watershed even though the area with the tws deficit expanded the intensity of the tws deficiency decreased resulting in an average annual twsc of 14 2 mm for the chesapeake bay watershed fig 7c shows the mean monthly variation in twsc for the watershed from 2003 to 2016 method 3 was able to capture twsc reasonably well however the correlation coefficient between the twsc simulated using this method and the grace derived twsc was 0 45 which was least among the three methods the magnitudes of grace derived annual twsc varied spatially with the lowest value of 10 mm occurring over the james river basin while the highest values were present mostly in the eastern shore basin fig 6 d fig 7 bar plots shows the monthly variation of grace derived twsc for the chesapeake bay watershed from 2003 to 2016 with values ranging from 100 mm to 95 mm grace derived tws estimates showed deficit storage between june and september while the remaining months were marked with surpluses seasonal variations in twsc suggested that seasonal temperatures had opposite effects on twsc fig s3 the region is typically warmer in the months between june and september and cooler during the other months the variation in twsc explained these characteristics it can be suggested that twsc dynamics appeared to be governed primarily by temperature and precipitation anomalies 3 4 terrestrial water storage change for drought and non drought years terrestrial water storage change has been used for the evaluation of drought in various countries including the us jin and zhang 2016 india sinha et al 2017 and china sun et al 2018 while the average or normal year in terms of climatology or hydrology can be useful in understanding how grace data can help in mapping water availability over large areas it can also be effective for water management during drought and non drought years in order to investigate its utility an additional assessment was performed using the data generated from method 1 and compared with the estimates of grace derived twsc the period of the drought in the chesapeake bay watershed from 2003 to 2016 was adopted from the study performed by kang and sridhar 2018 which involved identifying moderate to extreme drought condition events using precipitation and the palmer drought severity index pdsi a total of four years 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 were used for the drought period while the remaining years were categorized as non drought years method 1 was employed to estimate twsc for both drought and non drought years using prism precipitation vic simulated evapotranspiration and vic simulated runoff data fig 8 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual twsc during the non drought period the mean annual tws remained relatively high for most of the watershed area with an average value of 13 2 mm twsc estimates within the susquehanna basin were negative while the highest value of twsc over 80 mm was evident in the potomac and eastern shore basins deficits in tws for the drought period were evident in the area with a mean annual twsc of 32 mm fig 8b the region with the lowest twsc included the james basin along with some areas of the potomac york and eastern shore basins as well a considerable portion of the susquehanna basin exhibited surpluses with twsc estimates up to 40 mm the difference between the twsc for the drought period and that for the non drought period highlighted the impact of drought as shown in fig 8c although the drought had an effect on the entire chesapeake bay watershed the severity was obvious in the james and the eastern shore potomac york patuxent and susquehanna river basins since the classification of the years into drought and non drought periods was based on precipitation the spatial variation in precipitation over the region influenced the heterogeneous response of the different basins monthly variations in prism precipitation fig 5a vic simulated evapotranspiration fig 5b and vic simulated runoff fig 5d explained the deficit in tws during the drought period similar patterns were seen in the monthly variations of the vic simulated evapotranspiration between 2003 and 2016 however vic simulated runoff had no discernable pattern during the drought years perhaps the prism precipitation was lower in the drought period 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 than in other years resulting in the deficit tws during these years fig 8d shows the mean monthly variations in twsc for the entire chesapeake bay watershed during the drought and non drought periods as estimated using method 1 fig 9 shows the results for each sub basin in the watershed the twsc variation between the drought and non drought periods remained similar for most months during the year but the contrast was obvious from may to july besides the negative values of twsc during both drought and non drought period twsc during the drought period was lower than 40 mm and reached its minimum in june on the other hand the twsc for the non drought months may to july remained greater than 40 mm the difference in the estimated twsc during the non drought and drought periods was also the highest in june at 40 mm fig 8e shows the mean monthly twsc estimated using the grace product which remained lower during the drought periods for the chesapeake bay watershed however the difference between the drought and non drought periods varied widely over the year and by each sub basin causing some challenges in determining a threshold value of twsc by which to distinguish the responses between them as is evident from fig 9a method 1 based twsc estimates were very close to grace for each sub basin and the entire watershed from fig 9b it is clear that the eastern shore york and james basins showed big differences between grace and twsc estimates obtained with method 1 it can be suggested that in these sub basins where streamflows and land cover are managed twsc estimates that do not consider anthropogenic factors can introduce some uncertainties 4 conclusions this study emphasizes the use of satellite in situ and simulation data for assessing the hydrologic budget and water availability in the chesapeake bay watershed the investigation offered insights into employing observed streamflow to calibrate vic thus providing better streamflow estimates and ultimately et this in combination with prism precipitation data and vic simulated et or modis derived et enhanced twsc predictions for the watershed it was also noted that predicting et is critical for twsc especially from june to august and that vic simulated twsc could be a reliable proxy for grace data in the assessment of water availability major portions of the region exhibited water excess conditions however the james river basin was marked with deficits in storage the mean annual twsc varied from 30 mm to 30 mm but the monthly values fluctuated between 70 mm and 90 mm with deficits occurring between june and september while the remaining months were identified to have higher storage levels than tws estimates indicated the anthropogenic effect was not considered in this analysis but can play a major role in altering the estimates of twsc over the study area therefore future studies can focus on anthropogenic impacts with long term simulations and forecasts using better climate forcing to predict the water resources for this climatologically sensitive region in the united states the assessment of water resources in a heterogeneous region also warrants the use of multiple sources of data such as in situ satellite based and hydrological model simulated states and fluxes when available when high resolution information is needed for decision making at the watershed scale vic simulated twsc data can reliably fill gaps in time and space this is especially true when localized extreme events such as meteorological or hydrological droughts occur and vic derived twsc can be provided as forecasts with proper state variables including environmental vegetation and soil moisture conditions the southern region of the chesapeake bay watershed and eastern shore were identified as more drought prone and they can be effectively monitored by a combination of vic and grace estimates of twsc during may july since a single source assessment of water resource availability and drought can lead to uncertainties declaration of interests none acknowledgements this project was funded in part by the virginia agricultural experiment station

8426,the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the united states and its catchment has heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphologic characteristics it includes seven major river basins james patuxent potomac rappahannock susquehanna western shore eastern shore and york remote sensing data along with in situ observations of streamflow and simulated water budget components can provide significant understanding of variability in water resources availability in this diverse watershed in this study we quantify the terrestrial water storage using both remote sensing and in situ data and hydrologic model outputs in the chesapeake bay watershed total water storage change twsc was calculated based on the combination of three methods to identify the best approach in estimating twsc these methods evaluated different sources of data including parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism precipitation modis et u s geological survey observed streamflow and the variable infiltration capacity vic model estimated twsc were in close agreement with grace derived twsc when we employed vic simulated streamflow after calibration with observed streamflow however the use of vic simulated et or modis derived et yielded similar results for twsc assessment of twsc during extreme events drought during the summer months revealed that predicting et is critical for twsc in june august and that vic simulated twsc could be a reliable proxy for grace data to assess the water availability in the watershed keywords water availability remote sensing hydrological modeling chesapeake bay watershed 1 introduction terrestrial water storage tws is the sum of the water budget components namely soil moisture groundwater snow ice lakes and rivers rodell and famiglietti 2001 generally the water budget integrates coupled land and atmospheric processes quantifying precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff to arrive at the estimates of terrestrial water storage change twsc over time and space the response of a watershed is assessed using streamflow records that reliably illustrate the space time convolution of the watershed seong and sridhar 2017 seong et al 2017 however the data for other water balance components are critical to understand extreme events such as drought quantify return periods and develop watershed management strategies lakshmi 2016 thilakarathne and sridhar 2017 limitations in the spatial coverage of water budget components pose problems in representing the heterogeneity of the watershed at various spatial scales roads et al 2003 pan and wood 2006 although the in situ evapotranspiration measurements are useful for calibration or assimilation procedures interpolation and extrapolation of these estimates are routinely done with the aid of analytical and modeling tools these methods tools generate some uncertainty in the estimation of evapotranspiration which in turn affects the computation of twsc gao et al 2010 billah et al 2015 lakshmi 2016 as the single most influential variable precipitation is extremely important because it captures the spatial heterogeneity of the watershed syed et al 2004 a distributed precipitation estimate that is based on a dense network of in situ measurements is more reliable than evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage estimates gao et al 2010 hydrologic models that deal with land surface interactions such as the variable infiltration capacity vic model are often used to compute the terrestrial water budget berbery et al 2003 luo et al 2005 su and lettenmaier 2009 billah and goodall 2011 hoekema and sridhar 2013 billah et al 2015 these models apply water and energy balance approaches for estimating the spatial distribution of water and energy fluxes from regional to continental scales despite this advancement in modeling high resolution input data for these models are unable to account for anthropogenic effects on the hydrologic cycle nilsson et al 2005 oki and kanae 2006 sridhar 2013 the role of human disturbances that alter the basin hydrological cycle can be assessed by integrating remote sensing and in situ data with hydrologic simulation experiments hanasaki et al 2006 haddleland et al 2007 due to rapid advancements made over the past decade in acquiring high resolution application specific remote sensing observations the monitoring of hydrologic systems over vast areas where observed data are sparse has truly progressed tang et al 2009 dubayah et al 2000 rango and shalaby 1998 schultz 1988 tang et al 2009 wagner et al 2009 application of satellite data in hydrologic systems analysis is also constantly evolving at relevant spatio temporal scales rodell et al 2004 mccabe et al 2008 sheffield et al 2009 tang et al 2010 sridhar et al 2013 however the use of remote sensing data for hydrologic assessments has not reached its full potential due to the inconsistent resolution of data input interpretation and application across various spatial scales the application of remote sensing in combination with in situ observations and models can overcome these uncertainties sridhar et al 2006 sridhar and wedin 2009 the objective of this study is to estimate the terrestrial water storage using remote sensing and in situ data with various combinations of forcing and hydrologic model outputs to evaluate the best approach for estimating the water budget at regional scales this work is similar in some ways to a previous study conducted by billah et al 2015 in that study the researchers used grace gravity recovery and climate experiment modis moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer nldas north american land data assimilation system prism parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model and scan soil climate analysis network data to study the space time variability of the water balance components of the south carolina watersheds however there are differences between these two studies the 2015 study was carried out over a smaller region in south carolina whereas the present study of the chesapeake bay watershed cbw spans the mid atlantic region of new york pennsylvania delaware maryland virginia west virginia and all of washington d c the main difference between the two studies is the hydrologic component being analyzed in the 2015 study it was evapotranspiration during 2003 2007 period whereas in this work we performed the simulation for twsc from 2003 to 2016 lastly because the cbw is located in the densely populated eastern region of the us which has more than 18 million inhabitants periodical assessments using advanced models and datasets to understand both water quantity and quality are critical for watershed fishery and coastal ecosystem management based on temperature analysis of the years between 1950 and1999 an upward trend of 0 023 c decade was detected in the observed annual mean values in the watershed in a changing climate the average annual temperature is projected to increase between 1 2 c and 1 2 5 c between 2020 2039 relative to the baseline period under the representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the increases were higher by the end of the 21st century 2070 2099 with 2 3 5 c and 3 6 c respectively an analysis of observed participation records for the period 1950 1999 shows that the basin experienced an increase in magnitude of 18 mm decade generally wetter conditions were projected due to climate change i e more precipitation in the future when compared with the baseline period 1970 1999 for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios most of the models projected a decrease in precipitation of up to 5 while a few projected an increase of up to 20 in mean annual precipitation seong and sridhar 2017 this study also used united states geological survey usgs gauge station data from 19 locations to calibrate the simulated streamflow and enhance its performance compared to the data from 2 gauge stations used in billah et al 2015 usgs 2016 the organization of the paper is as follows section 2 describes the methodology adopted for the analysis along with the study area and the various combinations of data used section 3 provides the results of the analysis and discussion the summary and conclusions of the study are presented in section 4 2 methodology 2 1 study area the chesapeake bay is the largest estuary in the us spanning from the delmarva peninsula in the east to southwest virginia in the west the fall line divides the watershed by distinguishing heterogeneity in the basin hydrology and geomorphologic characteristics across the line the watershed has a drainage area of 64 299 square miles and more than 150 major rivers and streams flow through it into the north atlantic ocean the watershed consists of seven major river basins susquehanna potomac patuxent eastern shore western shore rappahannock york and james usepa 2010 in the states of virginia west virginia delaware maryland pennsylvania the district of columbia and new york the geographical location and the topography of the chesapeake bay are shown in fig 1 as are the seven major sub basins and the stream network considered in this analysis the northwestern region of the watershed includes the appalachian mountains which have elevations up to 2000 m while the southeastern region is marked by the presence of low lying coastal plains the majority of the land in the watershed is covered with forests 70 while the remaining areas are used for agriculture 23 and urban development 6 seong and sridhar 2017 kang and sridhar 2018 the region experiences a cooler climate with a mean annual temperature of 10 75 c and mean annual precipitation of 1073 mm kang and sridhar 2018 2 2 estimation of water budget the methodology for the analysis is based on the computation of twsc using the water budget framework for the study area water budget accounting typically describes the partitioning of water entering and departing the top few meters of the soil column the mass conservation equation for estimating the change in storage is 1 d s d t t w s e p et r in r out where ds dt or twsc is change in terrestrial water storage p is precipitation et is evapotranspiration and rin is runoff entering and rout is runoff exiting the study area in eq 1 the contribution of the groundwater flux to the twsc was assumed to be negligible since the primary components of twsc are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff variations in each of the components will dynamically impact twsc we used the modeled and remotely sensed products of these components to calculate twsc and compared our results with the grace derived twsc 2 3 terrestrial water storage change estimations in this analysis we have used prism daly et al 1994 gibson et al 2002 precipitation two sources of evapotranspiration vic simulated and modis mu et al 2011 and two sources of runoff data vic simulated and usgs for the estimation of twsc prism precipitation and usgs streamflow data are considered as observed modis evapotranspiration is a remotely sensed product and simulated evapotranspiration and runoff are treated as vic derived model output at a monthly temporal resolution for the period from 2003 to 2016 twsc estimates were computed for the combination of each of these products to evaluate the role of remotely sensed and observed data in improving twsc and to identify the best combination of data while validating them with the grace derived twsc data therefore three combination approaches were employed to derive twsc in non traditional ways 1 prism precipitation vic simulated et and vic simulated runoff 2 prism precipitation modis et and vic simulated runoff and 3 prism precipitation modis et and usgs runoff table 1a et alone caused significant uncertainties in flows and therefore in estimating the twsc since usgs flow data was used for calibration use of usgs flows in combination with vic simulated et became redundant furthermore the focus was on obtaining a realistic estimate of the twsc in the watershed the effect of flows from usgs or the model was integrated adequately for this purpose 2 3 1 observed and remote sensing data precipitation table 1b provides the details of the data types resolution and sources used for this study the prism database gibson et al 2002 for the period between 2003 and 2016 was used for precipitation precipitation includes liquid rain snow freezing rain hail frost or dew the study area primarily received liquid rain during the study period with occasional snow or freezing rain the 4 km prism data was re gridded to 1 16 degree resolution to be used as an input to the vic model prism data is widely used for hydrologic modeling and forecasting schaake et al 2004 trend analysis small et al 2006 and calculation of glacier runoff neal et al 2010 fig 2 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation mm in the chesapeake bay watershed between 2003 and 2016 the eastern region of the watershed receives high precipitation ranging from 1100 mm to 1400 mm while the western part gets lesser precipitation of about 700 mm to 1100 mm the mean monthly precipitation mm month in the 7 sub basins between 2003 and 2016 exhibited seasonal variations as shown in fig 2 b h precipitation patterns in the sub basins were similar pattern to the chesapeake bay watershed except in the james eastern shore and patuxent basins where there were some spikes in early fall the seasonal cycle of the precipitation for the chesapeake bay can be divided into three sets of months with highest precipitation between may and september precipitation decreased from september to february reaching its lowest magnitude in the latter month the period from february to may was marked by a gradual increase in precipitation across the entire region 2 3 2 evapotranspiration remote sensing based et estimates were obtained from modis based on the algorithm used by mu et al 2011 this approach shown in mu et al 2007 adopts the penman monteith et method and combines both meteorological observations air pressure minimum air temperature humidity and radiation and remote sensing data land cover albedo lai and evi at a spatial resolution of 1 km mu et al 2011 showed improvements to the estimates of nighttime and wet surface et soil heat flux canopy transpiration we used the modis16 derived monthly et at a 1 km spatial resolution for the study period between 2003 and 2016 fig 3 which was re gridded to 1 16th of a degree approximately 7 km 2 3 3 streamflow the usgs observed monthly streamflow data for the period between 1991 and 2010 available from 19 stations distributed across the watershed were used the geographical locations and the details of these gauge station are included in fig 1 and table 2 respectively the management in the uplands of the catchment played a critical role in the selection of these streamflow stations we have chosen these stations in order to evaluate the basin flow under natural conditions farther downstream the flow was either managed using dams and reservoirs or influenced by tides the long term data available for the chosen sites was also a reason to include them in our analysis because they are a significant component in the estimation of twsc the calibration and evaluation of the hydrologic model using these streamflow records were considered important for the study and the results of those processes are shown in fig 4 2 3 4 grace to evaluate the storage in the watershed terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa was computed from the grace dataset for the period between 2003 and 2016 monthly estimates of the gravity field data from grace were interpreted to estimate the water storage swenson and wahr 2006 the grace product available at 1 degree spatial resolution from the jet propulsion laboratory jpl was used in the analysis several studies have used the grace data and examples of applications include the evaluation of groundwater depletion feng et al 2013 girotto et al 2016 rodell et al 2009 the improvement of global hydrological models güntner 2008 the estimation of steric sea level variations lombard et al 2007 and glacial isostatic adjustment steffen et al 2008 in this analysis the grace twsc product was used as the reference data for the comparison of the twsc derived from the various combinations of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff products the grace tws anomaly twsa products were converted into change in tws twsc for the above mentioned study period the difference between grace observed tws anomaly twsa for two consecutive time steps shown in eq 2 provides the estimates of twsc 2 t w s c g r a c e δ t t w s a t i δ t t w s a t i where t i δ t and t i represent the ending and starting times respectively in the time period δ t twsa was converted to twsc by multiplying the twsa by the grid scaling factor as doing so minimized the difference between the smoothed and unfiltered monthly water variations and allowed for consideration of the heterogeneity in the water budget components across the domain wiese et al 2016 2 4 hydrologic model we implemented the vic model liang et al 1994 for the simulation of streamflow and evapotranspiration in order to calculate the monthly estimates of twsc vic is a large scale semi distributed model that has been used for hydrological predictions and assessment jin and sridhar 2010 sridhar et al 2013 hokema and sridhar 2013 surface and groundwater modeling sridhar et al 2017 drought analysis kang and sridhar 2017 kang and sridhar 2018 mishra et al 2017 climate change impact assessment guo et al 2009 hydropower evaluation vicuňa et al 2011 and determination of anthropogenic effect on water and energy balance simulation haddleland et al 2007 the vic model solves water and energy fluxes for each grid to enable the estimation of runoff and baseflow the arno model conceptualization todini 1996 was used for the calculation of baseflow and excess precipitation related runoff generation based on the infiltration mechanism outlined in the xinanjiang model ren jun 1992 the vic model was implemented at 1 16th degree spatial resolution from 1991 to 2016 using monthly time steps for both the calibration and evaluation periods the meteorological forcing data included precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and wind speed the prism derived daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature data the national centers for environmental prediction and the national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis based wind data were all used in these simulations the data were processed using the linear interpolation technique to generate the gridded inputs with a spatial resolution of 1 16th of a degree the required soil and vegetation data were obtained from the land data assimilation systems ldas http ldas gsfc nasa gov at the same spatial resolution as the meteorological data the soil datasets obtained from ldas were derived from the 1 km penn state statsgo data and contained 11 individual layers up to a depth of 2 5 m and 16 soil texture classifications ranging from sand to bedrock the vic model contained three soil layers and were initially set to 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm for the top middle and deep layers respectively we selected the soil layer depths in part due to the model calibration and validation procedure described in the following paragraph the vegetation parameter file was generated from the ldas vegetation data which contained 11 vegetation classes at 1 16th of a degree the routing of the grid simulated runoff and baseflow was performed using a model developed by lohmann et al 1998 1996 which uses unit hydrograph describing the time travel information of water from each grid to the channel the linearized saint venant s equation guides the routing of flux from each grid through the channel network the vic model parameters used for the calibration include variable infiltration curve binf maximum baseflow velocity dsmax fraction of maximum base flow velocity where base flow occurred ds fraction of maximum soil moisture content above which nonlinear base flow occurred ws and top d1 mid d2 and deep d3 soil layer depth abdulla and lettenmaier 1997a 1997b crow et al 2003 troy et al 2008 ds and dsmax are linked with the control of baseflow whereas ws and binf play a role in the surface runoff the thickness of the soil layer is associated with the runoff peak and evapotranspiration 2 4 1 model calibration and evaluation the calibration of the vic model was carried out by comparing the monthly simulated streamflow with the observed usgs streamflow data at 19 gauge stations fig 1 table 2 during the period 1991 2000 the ability of the vic model to depict the observed streamflow was quantified by the calculation of nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation coefficient r values the nse is defined as 3 nse 1 q o t q m t 2 q o t q o 2 and correlation coefficient r is defined as 4 r n q o t q m t q o t q m t n q o t 2 q m t 2 n q m t 2 q m t 2 where q o is the mean of observed streamflow q o t is observed streamflow at time t q m t is modeled streamflow at time t and n is number of observations 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparisons of modis and vic simulated evapotranspiration evapotranspiration is one of the important components of the water budget and plays a primary role in the estimation of tws for this region evapotranspiration is dominant in areas covered with forest due to canopy interception and increased soil moisture with less surface runoff over the ground fig 3 a b shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual evapotranspiration with values ranging between 50 to 1000 mm over the entire watershed as simulated by the vic model and the modis derived product respectively the vic model exhibited a wider range in the simulated evapotranspiration values than the modis derived product especially in the northern region of the watershed the susquehanna and potomac basins demonstrated some heterogeneity with simulated evapotranspiration values from 400 mm to 700 mm and also showed some discrepancies with the modis derived product the difference in vic simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration estimates varied between 300 mm to 300 mm fig 3 c the vic model underestimated the evapotranspiration in large sections of susquehanna potomac and patuxent basins when compared with the modis values the overestimation from the vic model was minimal with most of the region showing values below 150 mm more than 25 of the watershed showed some differences in evapotranspiration within 50 mm between vic simulated and modis derived estimates seasonal variations in evapotranspiration over the chesapeake bay watershed and the 7 sub basins were estimated using the mean monthly values for the same period fig 3 b c the evapotranspiration was the highest in july and then decreased until december the annual cycle of evapotranspiration was mainly governed by temperature variations that closely resembled those in the annual temperature evapotranspiration was greater during the growing season may to august and decreased as the temperature decreased the peak of the evapotranspiration during july was higher for the modis derived product when compared with vic simulated values with all 7 sub basins exhibiting a similar pattern throughout the year mean monthly variation in the estimates from the vic model and the modis derived product showed the underestimation by the vic model was dominant between june and august fig 3 f clearly the differences in et between vic and modis during the peak et periods suggest that modeling et is important for twsc assessment from fig 3f it is evident that vic was overestimating et for the northern and southern portions of the watershed while central and eastern parts showed underestimations of et due to these overestimations in most areas especially during drought years discrepancies in twsc for the regions including the james susquehanna patuxent and eastern shore sub watersheds were noticeable differences in mean monthly values varied from 15 mm to 25 mm with standard deviations of 13 mm the overall comparison between them demonstrated the ability of the vic model to simulate the evapotranspiration more closely and hence provided the justification for the usefulness of these datasets in estimating twsc to better understand basin water availability 3 2 streamflow analysis the calibration of the vic model was performed by comparing simulated and observed monthly streamflow with the aim of achieving both nse and r values closest to unity the parameter used in the calibration the allowable range of values and the range of the final values of the parameters obtained from the calibration are provided in table 3 fig 4 s1 and s2 show the comparison between the simulated monthly streamflow from the vic model and the observed streamflow at multiple gauge locations during the calibration period the nse and r values obtained for each of the gauge station locations are shown in table 4 the vic model was able to simulate the observed streamflow accurately for each of the basins with nse values for most of the stations greater than 0 7 and r values greater than 0 85 for the period between 1991 and 2000 the vic model was evaluated using the monthly streamflow observations for the same locations where the model was calibrated but for the period between 2001 and 2010 the evaluation of the streamflow was found to be satisfactory using the model classification scheme proposed by moriasi et al 2007 it should be noted that the validation period for es2 usgs01485000 gauge station was discontinuous for two years 2005 2006 when there was no data 3 3 estimation of terrestrial water storage change using the three methods the hydrological response of the watershed analyzed using different combinations to estimate twsc was presented as the mean monthly values for the period from 2003 to 2016 fig 5 the monthly variations in the prism precipitation fig 5a vic simulated evapotranspiration fig 5b modis evapotranspiration fig 5c vic simulated runoff fig 5d and usgs runoff fig 5e were used in the combinations specified earlier in order to estimate twsc the comparison of the vic simulated and modis evapotranspiration revealed similar patterns but the modis values were slightly better throughout the study period fig 5b 5c however the monthly vic simulated and usgs runoff series were in close agreement fig 5d 5e as mentioned in section 2 2 spatial analysis of twsc using the three methods was performed with the grace derived twsc estimates fig 6 and monthly time series fig 7 fig 6a shows the mean annual twsc during 2003 2016 as estimated using the prism precipitation vic simulated evapotranspiration and vic simulated runoff mean annual estimates of twsc varied between 30 mm and 30 mm with the lowest value observed in the james basin and the highest value in the eastern shore as estimated by the grace derived twsc mean monthly variations in twsc using method 1 with 1 standard deviation are shown in fig 7a the correlation between twsc estimated using method 1 and grace suggested the overall pattern and magnitudes of change were captured reasonably well over the entire period of 13 years the mean monthly twsc using method 1 varied between 70 mm and 90 mm the twsc calculated using method 2 i e by replacing the vic simulated evapotranspiration in method 1with the modis derived evapotranspiration is shown in fig 6b mean annual twsc estimates were found to be higher when using method 2 with a considerable portion of the watershed having values greater than 40 mm or less than 40 mm deficit storages from the estimates of twsc was evident in several sub basins including susquehanna potomac and patuxent while other areas of the watershed showed surplus values mean annual twsc for the entire chesapeake bay watershed was determined as 6 67 mm using method 2 as compared to the 0 26 mm estimated from method 1 since method 2 differed from method 1 with the use of modis derived evapotranspiration instead of vic simulated evapotranspiration the difference was primarily from modis data the spatial patterns of twsc using method 2 were similar to the spatial distribution of the difference between vic simulated and modis derived evapotranspiration vic simulated minus modis derived evapotranspiration fig 3c the evapotranspiration values fig 3c 5 b 5 c for the susquehanna potomac and patuxent basins were higher with the modis product than the vic simulated result but the twsc values for these areas were lower when calculated with method 2 when than the estimates obtained with method 1 in addition the twsc variations calculated using method 2 were more accurate than those calculated using method 1 in depicting the grace derived twsc with a correlation coefficient value of 0 52 during 2003 2016 method 2 performed better due to averaging that removed some spikes in the data resulting in mean monthly twsc values between 80 mm and 110 mm to increase understanding of the role of surface runoff in estimating twsc method 3 was developed by replacing the vic simulated runoff in method 2 with the usgs runoff so that the components became prism precipitation modis derived evapotranspiration and usgs runoff fig 6c shows the spatial variation of the mean annual twsc for the period 2003 2016 there are more regions of deficit evident in fig 6c than in fig 6b reflecting the effect of observed streamflow from usgs higher deficits were observed in the susquehanna and eastern shore basins and surplus was evident in the york basin marking the western half of the chesapeake bay watershed as a tws deficit region the comparison of the mean monthly vic simulated runoff and the usgs runoff showed a similar pattern but the magnitude of runoff was greater for the usgs data fig 5d e the inclusion of the higher runoff value in eq 1 caused the model to show a twsc deficit over several regions within the watershed even though the area with the tws deficit expanded the intensity of the tws deficiency decreased resulting in an average annual twsc of 14 2 mm for the chesapeake bay watershed fig 7c shows the mean monthly variation in twsc for the watershed from 2003 to 2016 method 3 was able to capture twsc reasonably well however the correlation coefficient between the twsc simulated using this method and the grace derived twsc was 0 45 which was least among the three methods the magnitudes of grace derived annual twsc varied spatially with the lowest value of 10 mm occurring over the james river basin while the highest values were present mostly in the eastern shore basin fig 6 d fig 7 bar plots shows the monthly variation of grace derived twsc for the chesapeake bay watershed from 2003 to 2016 with values ranging from 100 mm to 95 mm grace derived tws estimates showed deficit storage between june and september while the remaining months were marked with surpluses seasonal variations in twsc suggested that seasonal temperatures had opposite effects on twsc fig s3 the region is typically warmer in the months between june and september and cooler during the other months the variation in twsc explained these characteristics it can be suggested that twsc dynamics appeared to be governed primarily by temperature and precipitation anomalies 3 4 terrestrial water storage change for drought and non drought years terrestrial water storage change has been used for the evaluation of drought in various countries including the us jin and zhang 2016 india sinha et al 2017 and china sun et al 2018 while the average or normal year in terms of climatology or hydrology can be useful in understanding how grace data can help in mapping water availability over large areas it can also be effective for water management during drought and non drought years in order to investigate its utility an additional assessment was performed using the data generated from method 1 and compared with the estimates of grace derived twsc the period of the drought in the chesapeake bay watershed from 2003 to 2016 was adopted from the study performed by kang and sridhar 2018 which involved identifying moderate to extreme drought condition events using precipitation and the palmer drought severity index pdsi a total of four years 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 were used for the drought period while the remaining years were categorized as non drought years method 1 was employed to estimate twsc for both drought and non drought years using prism precipitation vic simulated evapotranspiration and vic simulated runoff data fig 8 a shows the spatial distribution of the mean annual twsc during the non drought period the mean annual tws remained relatively high for most of the watershed area with an average value of 13 2 mm twsc estimates within the susquehanna basin were negative while the highest value of twsc over 80 mm was evident in the potomac and eastern shore basins deficits in tws for the drought period were evident in the area with a mean annual twsc of 32 mm fig 8b the region with the lowest twsc included the james basin along with some areas of the potomac york and eastern shore basins as well a considerable portion of the susquehanna basin exhibited surpluses with twsc estimates up to 40 mm the difference between the twsc for the drought period and that for the non drought period highlighted the impact of drought as shown in fig 8c although the drought had an effect on the entire chesapeake bay watershed the severity was obvious in the james and the eastern shore potomac york patuxent and susquehanna river basins since the classification of the years into drought and non drought periods was based on precipitation the spatial variation in precipitation over the region influenced the heterogeneous response of the different basins monthly variations in prism precipitation fig 5a vic simulated evapotranspiration fig 5b and vic simulated runoff fig 5d explained the deficit in tws during the drought period similar patterns were seen in the monthly variations of the vic simulated evapotranspiration between 2003 and 2016 however vic simulated runoff had no discernable pattern during the drought years perhaps the prism precipitation was lower in the drought period 2007 2008 2010 and 2012 than in other years resulting in the deficit tws during these years fig 8d shows the mean monthly variations in twsc for the entire chesapeake bay watershed during the drought and non drought periods as estimated using method 1 fig 9 shows the results for each sub basin in the watershed the twsc variation between the drought and non drought periods remained similar for most months during the year but the contrast was obvious from may to july besides the negative values of twsc during both drought and non drought period twsc during the drought period was lower than 40 mm and reached its minimum in june on the other hand the twsc for the non drought months may to july remained greater than 40 mm the difference in the estimated twsc during the non drought and drought periods was also the highest in june at 40 mm fig 8e shows the mean monthly twsc estimated using the grace product which remained lower during the drought periods for the chesapeake bay watershed however the difference between the drought and non drought periods varied widely over the year and by each sub basin causing some challenges in determining a threshold value of twsc by which to distinguish the responses between them as is evident from fig 9a method 1 based twsc estimates were very close to grace for each sub basin and the entire watershed from fig 9b it is clear that the eastern shore york and james basins showed big differences between grace and twsc estimates obtained with method 1 it can be suggested that in these sub basins where streamflows and land cover are managed twsc estimates that do not consider anthropogenic factors can introduce some uncertainties 4 conclusions this study emphasizes the use of satellite in situ and simulation data for assessing the hydrologic budget and water availability in the chesapeake bay watershed the investigation offered insights into employing observed streamflow to calibrate vic thus providing better streamflow estimates and ultimately et this in combination with prism precipitation data and vic simulated et or modis derived et enhanced twsc predictions for the watershed it was also noted that predicting et is critical for twsc especially from june to august and that vic simulated twsc could be a reliable proxy for grace data in the assessment of water availability major portions of the region exhibited water excess conditions however the james river basin was marked with deficits in storage the mean annual twsc varied from 30 mm to 30 mm but the monthly values fluctuated between 70 mm and 90 mm with deficits occurring between june and september while the remaining months were identified to have higher storage levels than tws estimates indicated the anthropogenic effect was not considered in this analysis but can play a major role in altering the estimates of twsc over the study area therefore future studies can focus on anthropogenic impacts with long term simulations and forecasts using better climate forcing to predict the water resources for this climatologically sensitive region in the united states the assessment of water resources in a heterogeneous region also warrants the use of multiple sources of data such as in situ satellite based and hydrological model simulated states and fluxes when available when high resolution information is needed for decision making at the watershed scale vic simulated twsc data can reliably fill gaps in time and space this is especially true when localized extreme events such as meteorological or hydrological droughts occur and vic derived twsc can be provided as forecasts with proper state variables including environmental vegetation and soil moisture conditions the southern region of the chesapeake bay watershed and eastern shore were identified as more drought prone and they can be effectively monitored by a combination of vic and grace estimates of twsc during may july since a single source assessment of water resource availability and drought can lead to uncertainties declaration of interests none acknowledgements this project was funded in part by the virginia agricultural experiment station

8427,study region great lakes region of north america study focus reference evapotranspiration eto is a key variable in water use management and irrigation of agricultural crops this study describes the development of a gridded historical eto dataset for the period 1983 2012 derived from north american data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 forcing fields for the great lakes region of north america the gridded dataset is intended to fill a gap in the resource toolbox available to growers in this region of rapidly expanding irrigation as a prerequisite for development of the eto dataset a correction procedure is applied to the nldas 2 downward solar radiation to account for overall bias and a tendency to underestimate the range of solar radiation on hourly and daily timescales new hydrological insights analyses of spatial and temporal variability reveal that the lakes play an important role in modulating seasonal and geographical variability in evaporative demand an example application of the gridded historical eto dataset to irrigation management is provided a 30 year climatology of crop irrigation for field maize is developed from the eto dataset and is applied in a hypothetical irrigation scheduling scenario overall the study illustrates the utility of the nldas 2 eto dataset in describing spatial and temporal patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region and as a source of reference climatological information for irrigation management keywords reference evapotranspiration potential evaporative demand climate great lakes gridded dataset 1 introduction at a minimum irrigation managers have three primary decisions to make during the growing season how much irrigation water to apply when to begin application and how long during the season to apply for these three questions apply to irrigation in humid as well as arid climates however irrigation decision making in humid climates is arguably more complex than in arid climates due to factors both meteorological climatological e g higher rainfall frequency higher humidity greater cloud cover and structural e g lack of large scale irrigation water projects in nature yoon et al 1993 sadler et al 2003 first irrigation managers in humid regions must to a much greater degree than for production systems located in arid regions consider the possibility of rain occurring during or shortly after irrigation care must be taken to avoid irrigating prior to a substantial rainfall event due to an increased risk of overwatering or flooding the crop and leaching nutrients and or chemicals from the plants and the rooting zone second a cloudier and more humid climate implies lower evaporative demand by the atmosphere however during periods without rain the weather in humid regions largely mirrors that of arid regions thus understanding how evaporative demand varies both temporally and spatially is of great importance for irrigation managers particularly in humid climates evapotranspiration et is the combined process through which water evaporates from soil surfaces evaporation and through plant stomata transpiration et is sensitive to a variety of factors both meteorological e g downward solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed and non meteorological e g crop type development stage management practices reference et eto is a form of et in which purely meteorological factors are isolated using a standardized reference grass covered surface which is not shaded nor for which water is limiting in other words eto is a measure of the potential evaporative power of the atmosphere for the specified reference surface at a given location and time the standard method of computing eto is the modified penman monteith equation presented in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 hereafter fao 56 allen et al 1998 which considers all parameters that control energy exchange and corresponding evapotranspiration from uniform vegetation traditionally eto is computed from data collected at individual weather station sites however with the rapid development of gridded weather analyses over the past two decades e g the national centers for environmental prediction ncep national corporation for atmospheric research ncar global reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 and the real time mesoscale analysis rtma de pondeca et al 2011 the availability of gridded eto products has become a reality in 2001 the u s geological survey usgs center for earth resources observation and science eros began generating a global 1 degree resolution daily eto product based on the global data assimilation system gdas senay et al 2008 beginning in 2013 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa began producing a continental u s daily eto product based on the 0 125 degree resolution north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 hobbins et al 2013 moorhead et al 2015 in addition to these near real time products abatzoglou 2013 introduced a 4 km resolution gridded hybrid analysis for the period 1979 2010 based on nldas 2 and the 4 km resolution parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 as an example of the use of the hybrid dataset in ecological modeling abatzoglou 2013 produced gridded eto using the fao 56 modified penman monteith method validation of each of the earlier gridded eto datasets has been reported in previous studies usgs senay et al 2008 liu et al 2011 noaa moorhead et al 2015 nldas prism abatzoglou 2013 validation of the usgs eto product at sites in california senay et al 2008 and oklahoma liu et al 2011 did not show any systematic biases however senay et al 2008 did identify considerable positive biases at coastal sites attributing the overestimation to the inability of the 1 degree gdas to resolve the sharp temperature gradients between the coast and interior the inability of gdas to resolve spatial gradients of eto input variables and thus eto itself near coastlines is a major limitation of the usgs eto product the finer resolution of nldas 2 is more suitable for studying eto in coastal regions e g the great lakes region of north america however validation of nldas 2 derived eto products has revealed a systematic positive bias at sites in the central and western u s including the texas high plains noaa moorhead et al 2015 and pacific northwest nldas prism abatzoglou 2013 assessing eto during the growing season defined therein as may september abatzoglou 2013 found an average positive bias of 0 5 mm day 1 although a bias of 1 2 mm day 1 was reported at some sites moorhead et al 2015 qualitatively described a positive eto bias in the noaa product but only presented a limited suite of statistics furthermore since moorhead et al 2015 presented statistics for the whole year including the dormant season caution must be exercised when comparing their results to other studies in both studies the overestimation of eto was primarily attributed to variables other than downward solar radiation i e humidity wind speed and temperature the possible impact on eto estimates of a positive downward solar radiation bias in nldas 2 as reported in sakamoto et al 2011 lewis et al 2014 and slater 2016 was not addressed nor was any effort made to correct for such a bias the primary goal of this study is the development of a gridded historical hourly and daily eto dataset for the period 1983 2012 suitable for application in the great lakes region of north america the gridded dataset developed herein is intended to fill a gap in the resource toolbox available to growers in this region existing historical datasets are generally station based or if they are gridded lack the spatial resolution needed to resolve climatic gradients resulting from the presence of land water contrasts and complex coastlines the presence of complex coastlines in the great lakes region motivates the choice of the higher resolution nldas 2 as opposed to the coarser resolution gdas as the source of gridded meteorological data for the calculation of eto the secondary goal of this study is the evaluation of nldas 2 downward solar radiation and the development of a correction procedure to account for solar radiation bias and underestimation of temporal variability this secondary goal is motivated by findings of a positive nldas 2 solar radiation bias in earlier studies e g sakamoto et al 2011 and knowledge of the moderating effect of grid cell averaging on the representation of weather extrema in gridded datasets e g daley 1991 kitchen and blackall 1992 the premise underlying this secondary goal is that use of corrected nldas 2 solar radiation will result in a more accurate eto dataset compared to one computed using uncorrected data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study is focused on the great lakes region of north america this region contains one of the largest fresh water resources in the world and is characterized by strong physiographic gradients of soils vegetation and climate andresen and winkler 2009 although the region s climate is categorized as humid irrigation for agriculture has expanded rapidly during the past few decades for example in the state of michigan irrigated area increased from just over 115 000 ha in 1982 bureau of the census 1986 to more than 239 000 ha in 2012 national agricultural statistics service 2014 in this study the great lakes region is defined as a rectangle with lower left coordinates of 38 94 n 95 06 w and upper right coordinates of 50 06 n 74 94 w fig 1 the study area consists of approximately 1 84e8 ha of which

nldas 2 variables into an hourly and daily eto dataset a diagrammatic summary of the procedure is provided in fig 2 the procedure consisted mainly of the assessment and subsequent correction of nldas 2 downward solar radiation using climate station data downward solar radiation is a primary input variable in the series of semi physical and semi empirical equations used to compute variables in the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as discussed in greater detail in section 2 4 prior to the formal assessment of nldas 2 downward solar radiation at climate station sites a preliminary assessment of spatial patterns of nldas 2 downward solar radiation near the great lakes revealed a pattern in which artificially high values of solar radiation over the lakes extended 20 30 km inland in turn creating strong gradients of solar radiation inland of the lakeshore fig s1a b in supplementary material this pattern originates not with narr but with the srb data and appears to be an artifact of the coarse resolution of the underlying goes dataset 0 5 a nearest neighbor approach was utilized to replace erroneous values of nldas 2 downward solar radiation at grid points adjacent to the lakes with values one grid point inland a similar approach was taken to correct for anomalously high temperatures in far southwestern ontario fig s1c d in supplementary material that result from

temperature yielded a set of artifact removed nldas 2 variables fig 2a the secondary research goal of this study as stated in section 1 is the evaluation and correction of nldas 2 solar radiation bias and underestimation of temporal variability thus the artifact removed nldas 2 downward solar radiation was validated using hourly global solar flux measurements from the noaa u s climate reference network uscrn hubbard et al 2005 uscrn is a system of climate observing stations developed to provide long term air temperature precipitation and soil moisture and temperature observations that are both high quality and collected in stable settings validation was performed at four uscrn stations within the great lakes region necedah wi shabbona il chatham mi and gaylord mi during four growing seasons 2008 2011 fig 1 table 1 however before proceeding a word of caution is in order regarding comparisons of point observations and gridded estimates when comparing primary variables e g downward solar radiation or derived quantities e g eto at a weather climate station to those extracted at a nearby grid point as is done in this study it is important to keep in mind that point values are being compared to spatial averages thus an unknown portion of the differences between the station observations and gridded estimates quoted herein can be attributed to sub grid variability i e representativeness error daley 1991 kitchen and blackall 1992 the reader should keep this in mind particularly when terms such as error and bias are used upon initial validation of the nldas 2 downward solar radiation a substantial positive bias was discovered at all four stations although the focus of the validation was on the hourly timescale positive bias was also found in the daily solar radiation time series 1 27 2 35 mj m 2 day 1 see square marker edge color in fig 1 in the four station pooled daily solar radiation scatter plot in fig 3 a a mean bias bias of 1 70 mj m 2 day 1 is evident with the positive bias entirely associated with the left side of the observed distribution bias of 3 40 mj m 2 day 1 for the bottom 20 of the distribution but 0 15 mj m 2 day 1 for the top 20 thus a decision was made to correct at the hourly timescale for bias and the tendency of nldas 2 to overestimate underestimate solar radiation values on the left right side of the observed distribution the latter correction is referred to hereafter as a variance correction since it accounts for the underprediction of the variance of solar around the median i e the range of solar values on both hourly and daily timescales is narrower in nldas 2 than the observations suggest for irrigation scheduling one must consider not only days within the middle of the distribution but low and high eto days as well kloss et al 2012 before proceeding a brief review of existing solar radiation correction methods is in order in general existing correction methods reduce bias but do not correct underestimation of temporal variability e g diurnal seasonal a common method of bias correction involves the multiplication of uncorrected solar radiation values by the ratio of a desired mean value to an uncorrected mean value e g cosgrove et al 2003 ngo duc et al 2005 more sophisticated approaches have also been used in which regression models are linked with observed cloud cover to compute bias correction coefficients e g sheffield et al 2006 weedon et al 2010 alternatively empirical models have been used to rescale downward shortwave radiation using other atmospheric surface variables e g daily maximum temperature as inputs e g wei et al 2014 lastly methods have been developed that combine bias correction with corrections for over or under estimation of clear sky radiation and over or under estimation of cloudiness e g slater 2016 the desire to control both solar radiation bias and variance and to limit the variables necessary for the correction procedure to solar radiation alone as opposed to for example solar radiation and cloud cover motivates the development of a correction procedure distinct from those reviewed here the correction procedure restricted to approximate daylight hours 1100 0000 utc 0700 2000 edt during the 1 april 30 september growing season applicable to corn and soybeans primary crops in the great lakes region was developed for each hour as follows first four year mean values for each growing season day and each station were pooled together yielding a total of 732 points 183 growing season days x 4 stations second a linear regression model was developed with the four year mean artifact removed nldas 2 downward solar radiation s n as the independent variable and the four year mean observed downward solar radiation s o as the dependent variable 1 s o a b s n where a and b are the interecept and slope of the linear regression line respectively provided in table s1 in supplementary material third the linear regression model was applied to s n to yield a bias corrected nldas 2 downward solar radiation s n b using slope and intercept values calculated from eq 1 2 s n b a b s n fig 2b fourth an updated linear regression model was developed with s o as the independent variable s n b as the dependent variable and data points limited to 1800 utc time of approximate peak solar radiation 3 s n b a b s o where coefficients a and b are 1 2731 and 0 4422 respectively this step was performed to evaluate the magnitude of over and under estimation of solar radiation near the tails of the distribution around the time of peak solar radiation fifth an adjustment factor was calculated as the ratio of s n b at the particular hour and s n b at the pivot point of the 1 1 and linear regression lines s p i v calculated as 2 28 mj m 2 in the previous step this adjustment factor was then applied to s n b to yield a bias and variance corrected solar radiation s n b v 4 s n b v s n b s n b s p i v fig 2c this step was performed to reduce the bias for points closer to the tails of the observed distribution and was only applied between 1700 and 2000 utc 1300 and 1600 edt peak heating window when the pivot point is approximately constant finally the hour specific bias and variance correction procedure was applied to the downward solar radiation variable at all grid points in the nldas 2 dataset and the correction process then advanced to the next hour before proceeding to a description of the fao 56 eto calculation a few words of clarification are in order regarding the solar correction procedure first the slope and intercepts used to bias correct the raw nldas 2 downward solar radiation are functions of time of day but not day of year the underlying assumption of constant bias during the growing season likely limits our ability to eliminate bias but has some support in the time series of the ratio of nldas 2 and uscrn downward solar radiation during the growing season fig s2 in supplementary material second the correction procedure is based on only four years of data increasing the likelihood that anomalous conditions in one year influence the corrections applied to all 30 years of data 2 4 fao 56

al 1998 in short downward solar radiation and 2 m temperature were used to estimate net radiation using an albedo appropriate to a short grass surface 0 23 the stefan boltzmann law and formulas for estimating atmospheric absorption of outgoing longwave radiation 10 m wind speed was extrapolated to the 2 m level assuming a logarithmic wind profile and 2 m saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure were derived from 2 m temperature and specific humidity using empirical formulas based on the clausius clapeyron equation variables were then calculated and input to eq 5 for each hour of the 1983 2012 dataset finally for analyzing evaporative demand during the growing season daily eto was computed by integrating hourly values over a 0400 utc 0400 utc midnight midnight edt day the process of deriving hourly and daily eto is summarized in fig 2d before proceeding it is important to point out that strictly speaking weather data used to compute eto should be collected over or downwind of dense fully transpiring grass or similar vegetation exhibiting behavior similar to the definition of the reference surface condition pereira et al 2015 gridded eto products cannot satisfy this requirement furthermore effects of local irrigation on temperature and humidity and thus eto are not accounted for in the development of gridded eto products this is true for all gridded eto datasets including the dataset developed in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 corrected solar and eto assessment the impact of the hourly bias and variance correction procedure on the nldas 2 daily downward solar radiation at the four uscrn stations is seen in figs 1 and 3 first note that bias at all four stations is constrained to 1 mj m 2 day 1 although the correction procedure has introduced negative bias at some stations e g necedah compare square marker edge and fill colors in fig 1 second comparing the full pooled dataset before and after bias corrections it is apparent that the bias correction procedure was successful in eliminating mean bias bias while also reducing root mean square error rmse from 3 00 mj m 2 day 1 to 2 46 mj m 2 day 1 cf fig 3a and b nevertheless the slope of the regression line s remains much less than 1 0 s 0 69 and consequently bias for the bottom and top 20 of the observed distribution is 1 82 and 1 97 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the impact of the combined bias and variance corrections is seen in fig 3c bias for the bottom and top 20 of the observed distribution has been reduced to 0 38 and 0 82 mj m 2 day 1 respectively and s has been increased to 0 9 the improvement of the statistics at the shoulders of the distribution does come at a price however as rmse and bias for the entire distribution are degraded somewhat compared to the bias correction step alone cf fig 3b and c as this initial assessment was performed at the same sites and with the same dataset used to develop the correction procedure analysis proceeds to further evaluation of the bias and variance corrected downward solar radiation at eight weather stations within the enviro weather ew mesonetwork in michigan fig 1 tables 1 and 2 ew is an interactive information system linking real time weather data forecasts and biological and other process based models for assistance in operational decision making and risk management associated with michigan s agriculture and natural resource industries andresen et al 2012 the need for weather station datasets containing downward solar radiation and the other components of eq 5 led to the choice of the ew network as the source of observations for this validation procedure the earliest records in the ew mesonetwork date back to 1996 comparison of the bias columns in table 2 reveals that the eight station median daily solar radiation bias has been reduced from 2 04 mj m 2 day 1 11 23 of mean to 0 42 mj m 2 day 1 2 34 of mean prior to the correction procedure all stations exhibited a positive bias after the procedure the sign of bias is evenly split between the eight stations although a small positive overall bias remains fig 1 table 2 to assess changes to daily solar radiation variance due to the correction procedure the ratio of nldas 2 to observed standard deviation sd is computed referred to hereafter as the sd ratio sdr comparison of the sdr columns in table 2 indicates that the correction procedure has indeed increased the variance of nldas 2 daily solar radiation prior to the correction the nldas 2 standard deviation was 81 of the observed value as judged by the eight station median sdr whereas after the correction this statistic is 100 regarding rmse the correction procedure has had a smaller impact reducing the eight station median rmse from 4 50 mj m 2 day 1 24 25 of mean to 4 35 mj m 2 day 1 23 27 of mean two sample t tests confirm the statistical significance of the changes to bias and sdr at all stations however changes to rmse are not universally significant not shown proceeding to an assessment of nldas 2 daily eto at the ew stations table 3 the bias and variance correction of downward solar radiation is found to have a beneficial impact on all eto statistics most notably the correction procedure has reduced the eight station median bias from 0 21 mm day 1 6 25 of mean to 0 06 mm day 1 1 81 of mean following the correction procedure all but two sites feature bias less than 10 of the mean value with all sites exhibiting bias smaller than what was reported in abatzoglou 2013 less than the median value of 0 5 mm day 1 reported therein comparison of the sdr columns indicates that the correction procedure has increased the variance of nldas 2 daily eto prior to the correction the nldas 2 standard deviation was 89 of the observed value as judged by the eight station median sdr whereas after the correction this statistic is 95 additionally the eight station median rmse has been reduced slightly from 0 87 mm day 1 24 98 of mean to 0 84 mm day 1 23 80 of mean rmse of about 20 30 has been reported for both usgs and nldas 2 daily eto products liu et al 2011 moorhead et al 2015 as with solar radiation two sample t tests confirm the universal statistical significance of the changes to bias and sdr but not the change to rmse not shown in conclusion the preceding evaluation of nldas 2 solar radiation and eto confirms that the secondary goal of this study has been achieved that is the correction of nldas 2 solar radiation has yielded a more accurate nldas 2 eto dataset than one computed from uncorrected solar radiation 3 2 spatial analysis analysis of the nldas 2 eto dataset begins with contoured plots of growing season mean daily eto before and after application of the solar radiation correction fig 4 recall that the growing season is defined here as 1 april 30 september unless otherwise specified all figures presented in this study display data averaged over the period of record 1983 2012 the bias and variance correction steps described in section 2 3 reduced mean daily eto by an average of 5 49 0 19 mm day 1 across the domain with the percent reduction varying from a minimum of 2 25 0 09 mm day 1 in northern missouri to a maximum of 8 89 0 26 mm day 1 across central new york see contoured lines in fig 4a in general mean daily eto tends to decrease in a southwest to northeast gradient across the region with highest values in northern missouri and lowest values in southwestern quebec the influence of water bodies and surface elevation on this pattern is evident as well with relatively low values near the lakes especially the northern lakes e g superior and across the higher terrain from west virginia to upstate new york cf figs 1 and 4 in addition a ridge of higher mean eto is apparent across southern ontario north of lakes erie and ontario overall these results suggest greatest potential vegetative water needs in southern and western portions of the region where modification of weather and climate by either large bodies of water or high terrain is minimal the results also suggest that the great lakes play an important role in modulating spatial patterns of evaporative water demand it is important to note that the spatial resolution of the new nldas 2 eto dataset combined with the increased accuracy resulting from the solar correction procedure allows for analysis of spatiotemporal variability of eto in the great lakes region in unprecedented detail analysis now proceeds to an examination of subseasonal variability with monthly averages of daily eto during the growing season fig 5 comparing the april and july panels observe that mean daily eto increases from a domain average of 2 41 mm day 1 in april to a peak of 4 30 mm day 1 in july the influence of the northern lakes e g superior on daily eto is particularly evident during june and july when the relatively cool water temperatures not shown reduce evaporative demand across the northern great lakes region percent differences between july and april mean daily eto contoured lines in the july panel vary from 50 to 95 across the domain with no clear relationship between percent difference and proximity to water however the july april percent differences are reduced at higher elevations for example percent differences in central pennsylvania are 60 65 compared to 65 75 in the lower elevation eastern and western portions of the state cf figs 1 and 5 lastly evidence of the impact of the solar correction procedure on monthly mean eto and analyses of the spatial patterns of mean solar radiation and 2 m temperature primary drivers of eto eq 5 are shown in figs s3 s5 respectively in the supplementary material with the considerable spatial and subseasonal variability of daily eto now established patterns of submonthly variability are examined with contoured maps of sd normalized by the monthly mean fig 6 overall the highest lowest normalized sd occurs in april july with normalized sd generally increasing from southwest to northeast across the domain outside of the northeast 20 of the domain where values are consistently higher normalized sd decreases from 0 35 0 5 during april to 0 25 or less during july and increases again to 0 3 0 4 during september this cycle in submonthly variability is closely related to the corresponding cycle in the magnitude and frequency of shortwave troughs and frontal systems sanders and hoffman 2002 payer et al 2011 as the jet stream weakens and translates northward during the transition from spring to summer shortwave troughs and frontal systems become weaker and their passage less frequent and day to day variability of the drivers of eto e g downward solar radiation eq 5 decreases with time the opposite trend occurs as the jet stream strengthens and translates southward again during the transition from summer to autumn on the other hand the influence of the lakes on normalized sd is generally difficult to discern except for september when normalized eto is noticeably lower near the lakes lower normalized sd near the lakes in autumn reflects the muting effect of the relatively high heat capacity of the lakes on day to day variability of the drivers of eto 3 3 point analysis examination of the nldas 2 eto dataset now proceeds to analysis of temporal variability of eto on timescales ranging from diurnal to interannual at two locations chosen to represent interior and lakeshore climates east lansing mi and east leland mi fig 7 see fig 1 and table 1 for locations east lansing is in the south central part of michigan s lower peninsula approximately 100 km from the nearest great lake whereas east leland is in the center of the leelanau peninsula in northwest michigan and is about equidistant 5 km from lake michigan to the west and grand traverse bay to the east see inset panel in fig 1 before proceeding it important to note that the nldas 2 grid resolution 1 8 about 12 km is approximately equal to the width of the leelanau peninsula at east leland thus caution must be exercised as the peninsula is represented by at most 3 4 grid cells some of which extend partially over water although this study is concerned primarily with daily eto it is important to recall that the nldas 2 eto dataset is an hourly product to help visualize the dataset at the hourly timescale box and whisker plot time series of hourly eto are presented in fig 7a examination of fig 7a reveals several prominent characteristics first a simple diurnal cycle of eto is evident at both sites consisting of a minimum in median eto and box and whisker plot length between 0900 and 1000 utc 0500 and 0600 edt around sunrise and a maximum in median eto and box and whisker plot length at 1800 utc 1400 edt around solar noon second during the day the median hourly eto as well as the box and whisker plot length is greater at east lansing than east leland the longer plots indicate greater subseasonal and or interannual variability at the inland station the weaker variability at east leland can be attributed to the proximity of the station to bodies of water to its west and east the relatively high heat capacity of water moderates the temperature variability at adjacent land points legates and willmott 1990 maximum hourly eto values are just under 1 mm hr 1 at east lansing and just under 0 8 mm hr 1 at east leland such high values are associated with abnormally warm days during mid summer lastly the kink in the time series between 2000 and 2200 utc 1600 and 1800 edt is an artifact of the variance correction procedure section 2 3 the adjustment was only applied between 1700 and 2000 utc 1300 and 1600 edt i e during the period of approximate peak heating to compare the growing season cycle of daily eto at inland and coastal stations box and whisker plot time series of daily eto from 1 april to 30 september are presented in fig 7b consistent with the growing season solar radiation cycle not shown the 30 year median daily eto increases from 1 april until approximately early june exhibits weak month to month variation through approximately early august and steadily declines thereafter submonthly variability of 30 year median daily eto is highest from about mid april to early june and is lower at east leland than east lansing consistent with the closer proximity of east leland to the stabilizing influence of lake michigan the larger fluctuations in 30 year median daily eto during spring reflect both the influence of large scale weather patterns and the impact of one or two anomalous years in the 30 year study period on the trends the fluctuations of the 30 year median daily eto as well as the longer boxes and whiskers suggest a greater influence of shortwave troughs and frontal systems on submonthly eto variability during spring recall the discussion of normalized sd fig 6 and shortwave troughs in section 3 2 such variability is reduced during the second half of the growing season most prominently at east leland lastly scattered daily eto values of 7 10 mm day 1 evident from late june to mid july occurred in two years only 1988 and 2012 both of which were substantially impacted by extended drought fuchs et al 2015 next histograms are presented in fig 7c to examine the distribution of daily eto during the growing season a comparison of the histograms at east lansing and east leland reveals considerable differences between inland and coastal station sites first both the median and mean daily eto are about 15 lower at east leland than east lansing a reflection of the spatial gradient of daily eto between the lakeshore and interior fig 4b second the distribution appears quasi normal at east lansing and skewed at east leland the skewness statistic confirms this observation with a value of 0 63 at east lansing and 0 72 at east leland the distribution at east leland is biased toward lower daily eto values with a sharp drop off on the right side of the distribution the quasi normal and skewed distributions at east lansing and east leland respectively were also observed at other inland and coastal station sites examined in this study not shown and highlight the importance of lake proximity to weather and climate legates and willmott 1990 note also that despite the quasi normal distribution at east lansing a long tail is present on the right side of the distribution the daily eto values in the tail are representative of hot sunny days during drought years conditions generally absent at east leland station sites adjacent to the lakeshore are less likely to experience hot full sun days during summer than station sites well inland lastly questions regarding interannual variability and multi year trends are addressed with box and whisker plot time series of daily eto during the period 1983 2012 fig 7d examination of the time series at east lansing reveals two anomalous growing seasons 1988 and 2012 in which the box and whisker plots extend well above those of the other 28 years recall earlier discussion of fig 7b record warmth and notable droughts occurred during both growing seasons the combination of minimal cloud cover and high temperatures yielded anomalously high daily eto values although evidence of the 1988 anomalous growing season is present in the east leland time series the 2012 box and whisker plot is unremarkable compared to other years a somewhat less obvious feature of fig 7d is a period of reduced daily eto from 1992 to 1997 best seen in the 75th percentiles at east lansing note that the minimum in the 9 year moving average cyan and yellow lines occurs in 1993 at both east lansing and east leland for clarification the 9 year period was chosen to filter out higher frequency noise from the annual data and help identify decadal or longer period trends beginning with 1993 a positive trend in 9 year average daily eto is evident through 2008 the last year for which the 9 year moving average is computed however the trend appears to continue through the end of the study period in 2012 3 4 crop irrigation example an example application of the nldas 2 eto dataset in irrigation management is now provided an irrigation climatology for field maize grown for grain at east lansing mi such information may be useful in planning to determine potential irrigation water needs system design and operational capacity use of eto in managing irrigation for a specific crop requires the use of a crop coefficient kc to account for differences in the crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance between the crop in question and the grass reference crop allen et al 1998 the product of eto and kc is referred to as crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc where standard conditions are defined as large fields optimum soil water excellent management practices and environmental conditions and full production in this example the following timeline is assumed planting date 1 may beginning of crop cover 10 may effective full cover 10 july 1 august maturity 31 august following the procedure outlined in allen et al 1998 a crop coefficient curve is constructed using three values of kc kcini initial beginning of crop cover kcmid mid season effective full crop cover and kcend end of season maturity harvest using table 12 in allen et al 1998 and assuming the crop is harvested dry the three values of kc are as follows kcini 0 3 kcmid 1 2 and kcend 0 35 linear interpolation of kc between stages yields the crop coefficient curve presented in fig 8 a compare to fig 34 in allen et al 1998 multiplication of the daily eto values at east lansing in fig 7b by the kc values in fig 8a yields the box and whisker plot time series of daily etc in fig 8b application of the kc scaling factor results in decreased variability during the early and late portions of the growing season and increased variability during the heart of the growing season in june and july next accumulated irrigation during the field maize season is examined for a wet and a dry season 2004 and 2012 respectively first daily eto and precipitation measured at the east lansing ew station during the 2004 and 2012 seasons are input into microsoft excel based irrigation scheduling software available from http www agweather geo msu edu mawn irrigation irr cbook june2014 xls yielding daily irrigation as output the software used in this example is based on an irrigation scheduling spreadsheet presented in allen et al 1998 annex 8 and assumes that available water in the root zone is partially depleted before irrigation water is applied i e management allowed depletion of root zone water the software indicates when supplemental water must be added to match the irrigation demand for a specific crop type and growing season stage in this exercise simulated irrigation applications of 25 4 mm on a given day are initiated whenever daily volumetric soil moisture in the plant rooting zone drops to 50 or less of its maximum value the soil profile used is spinks loamy sand a coarse textured commonly irrigated soil type in michigan with a total of 116 mm of plant extractable water in the top 100 cm of the soil profile the software internally computes daily etc from daily eto using kc values similar but not identical to those in fig 8a second nldas 2 daily eto and precipitation are input for each season between 1983 and 2012 into the irrigation scheduling software yielding a 30 year climatology of daily irrigation accumulation of the daily irrigation totals yields the time series of accumulated irrigation seen in fig 9 with the 2004 green line and 2012 brown line station data driven accumulated irrigation overlaid on the nldas 2 driven accumulated irrigation climatology box and whisker plots in the following discussion it is assumed that a hypothetical irrigation manager applies water based only on the station data driven software output the user compares the irrigation progress at various points in the 2004 and 2012 seasons to the 30 year climatology provided by nldas 2 examination of fig 9 reveals several notable features first a comparison of the station data driven irrigation time series shows that considerably more irrigation water was applied during 2012 279 4 mm than 2004 101 6 mm for reference the statewide average applied irrigation reported in the 2003 2008 and 2013 farm and ranch irrigation surveys varied between 152 4 and 182 9 mm national agricultural statistics service 2004 2009 2014 the anomalously large amount of water applied in 2012 is consistent with the much higher eto during the 2012 season compare 2004 and 2012 in fig 7d as well as much lower rainfall amounts observed 1 may 31 august precipitation at east lansing was 482 87 mm in 2004 but only 214 37 mm in 2012 comparison of the 2004 and 2012 observed precipitation at east lansing to the 1981 2010 average of 327 15 mm at the lansing capital city airport about 14 km northwest of east lansing at 42 779 n 84 587 w reveals the scale of the precipitation anomalies in 2004 and 2012 second it appears that differences between the two years develop early in the season specifically the first application of water in 2012 occurs in early june about one month earlier than in 2004 well before the median initial application date of 2 july see thick black line in fig 9 this suggests that early application of irrigation water may be at least in some cases a precursor to a dry season with heavy irrigation need third variability in the nldas 2 driven irrigation climatology increases noticeably during the later portion of the season on or about 21 july such knowledge of increased temporal variability during the later stages of the growing season may be of use in anticipating water needs for an upcoming season and or planning the capacity of an irrigation system 4 conclusions in this study a gridded great lakes region historical reference evapotranspiration dataset for the period 1983 2012 was developed by inputting nldas 2 forcing fields into the fao 56 eto equation correction of nldas 2 solar radiation was shown to yield a more accurate nldas 2 eto dataset than one computed from uncorrected solar radiation the spatial resolution of the new nldas 2 eto dataset combined with the increased accuracy resulting from the solar correction procedure allowed for analysis of spatiotemporal variability of eto in the great lakes region in unprecedented detail an analysis of the spatial patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region depicted spatial patterns heretofore unseen with relatively low eto values near the lakes and highest values in southern and western portions of the great lakes region where modification of weather and climate by either large bodies of water or high terrain was minimal consistent with the utility of the new eto dataset to depict spatial variability of evaporative demand point analysis at two locations chosen to depict lakeshore and interior climates provided insight into temporal variability of eto not possible with existing station and gridded eto datasets this study has shown the utility of the nldas 2 eto dataset in describing spatial and temporal patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region however the limitations of the study must be kept in mind first the correction procedure utilized climate station data from only four stations and was limited to a four year period and the coefficients used to bias correct nldas 2 solar radiation were functions of hour of day but not day of year second the 1 8 degree grid spacing limits the accuracy of the nldas 2 eto dataset especially near strong physiographic gradients of soils vegetation and climate third no gridded dataset can satisfy the requirement that weather data used to compute eto be collected over or downwind of vegetation with similar behavior to the fao 56 reference grass definition however despite these limitations the nldas 2 eto dataset is expected to be of use to the agricultural and hydrological communities future work includes designing and developing a data extraction utility linking the eto dataset with irrigation water scheduling management applications for on line user access developing additional gridded integrative variables e g leaf wetness and considering projected future trends efforts are underway at the time of publication to develop an online access portal on the great lakes integrated sciences assessments glisa website http glisa umich edu those interested in accessing the nldas 2 eto dataset are encouraged to check the glisa news and events page http glisa umich edu news for updates until the data portal is active all data requests should be forwarded to enviro weather at eweather msu edu finally potential applications of the new eto dataset include but are not limited to use in agriculture as a tool for estimating potential irrigation water needs and informing irrigation system design use in hydrology as a tool for managing groundwater supplies and assessing drought potential and in both disciplines as a baseline for assessing surface and groundwater changes under future climate scenarios more broadly the nldas 2 eto dataset presented here has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for

the development of a gridded historical eto dataset for the period 1983 2012 derived from north american data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 forcing fields for the great lakes region of north america the gridded dataset is intended to fill a gap in the resource toolbox available to growers in this region of rapidly expanding irrigation as a prerequisite for development of the eto dataset a correction procedure is applied to the nldas 2 downward solar radiation to account for overall bias and a tendency to underestimate the range of solar radiation on hourly and daily timescales new hydrological insights analyses of spatial and temporal variability reveal that the lakes play an important role in modulating seasonal and geographical variability in evaporative demand an example application of the gridded historical eto dataset to irrigation management is provided a 30 year climatology of crop irrigation for field maize is developed from the eto dataset and is applied in a hypothetical irrigation scheduling scenario overall the study illustrates the utility of the nldas 2 eto dataset in describing spatial and temporal patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region and as a source of reference climatological information for irrigation management keywords reference evapotranspiration potential evaporative demand climate great lakes gridded dataset 1 introduction at a minimum irrigation managers have three primary decisions to make during the growing season how much irrigation water to apply when to begin application and how long during the season to apply for these three questions apply to irrigation in humid as well as arid climates however irrigation decision making in humid climates is arguably more complex than in arid climates due to factors both meteorological climatological e g higher rainfall frequency higher humidity greater cloud cover and structural e g lack of large scale irrigation water projects in nature yoon et al 1993 sadler et al 2003 first irrigation managers in humid regions must to a much greater degree than for production systems located in arid regions consider the possibility of rain occurring during or shortly after irrigation care must be taken to avoid irrigating prior to a substantial rainfall event due to an increased risk of overwatering or flooding the crop and leaching nutrients and or chemicals from the plants and the rooting zone second a cloudier and more humid climate implies lower evaporative demand by the atmosphere however during periods without rain the weather in humid regions largely mirrors that of arid regions thus understanding how evaporative demand varies both temporally and spatially is of great importance for irrigation managers particularly in humid climates evapotranspiration et is the combined process through which water evaporates from soil surfaces evaporation and through plant stomata transpiration et is sensitive to a variety of factors both meteorological e g downward solar radiation air temperature humidity and wind speed and non meteorological e g crop type development stage management practices reference et eto is a form of et in which purely meteorological factors are isolated using a standardized reference grass covered surface which is not shaded nor for which water is limiting in other words eto is a measure of the potential evaporative power of the atmosphere for the specified reference surface at a given location and time the standard method of computing eto is the modified penman monteith equation presented in the food and agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 hereafter fao 56 allen et al 1998 which considers all parameters that control energy exchange and corresponding evapotranspiration from uniform vegetation traditionally eto is computed from data collected at individual weather station sites however with the rapid development of gridded weather analyses over the past two decades e g the national centers for environmental prediction ncep national corporation for atmospheric research ncar global reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 the north american regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 and the real time mesoscale analysis rtma de pondeca et al 2011 the availability of gridded eto products has become a reality in 2001 the u s geological survey usgs center for earth resources observation and science eros began generating a global 1 degree resolution daily eto product based on the global data assimilation system gdas senay et al 2008 beginning in 2013 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa began producing a continental u s daily eto product based on the 0 125 degree resolution north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 hobbins et al 2013 moorhead et al 2015 in addition to these near real time products abatzoglou 2013 introduced a 4 km resolution gridded hybrid analysis for the period 1979 2010 based on nldas 2 and the 4 km resolution parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 as an example of the use of the hybrid dataset in ecological modeling abatzoglou 2013 produced gridded eto using the fao 56 modified penman monteith method validation of each of the earlier gridded eto datasets has been reported in previous studies usgs senay et al 2008 liu et al 2011 noaa moorhead et al 2015 nldas prism abatzoglou 2013 validation of the usgs eto product at sites in california senay et al 2008 and oklahoma liu et al 2011 did not show any systematic biases however senay et al 2008 did identify considerable positive biases at coastal sites attributing the overestimation to the inability of the 1 degree gdas to resolve the sharp temperature gradients between the coast and interior the inability of gdas to resolve spatial gradients of eto input variables and thus eto itself near coastlines is a major limitation of the usgs eto product the finer resolution of nldas 2 is more suitable for studying eto in coastal regions e g the great lakes region of north america however validation of nldas 2 derived eto products has revealed a systematic positive bias at sites in the central and western u s including the texas high plains noaa moorhead et al 2015 and pacific northwest nldas prism abatzoglou 2013 assessing eto during the growing season defined therein as may september abatzoglou 2013 found an average positive bias of 0 5 mm day 1 although a bias of 1 2 mm day 1 was reported at some sites moorhead et al 2015 qualitatively described a positive eto bias in the noaa product but only presented a limited suite of statistics furthermore since moorhead et al 2015 presented statistics for the whole year including the dormant season caution must be exercised when comparing their results to other studies in both studies the overestimation of eto was primarily attributed to variables other than downward solar radiation i e humidity wind speed and temperature the possible impact on eto estimates of a positive downward solar radiation bias in nldas 2 as reported in sakamoto et al 2011 lewis et al 2014 and slater 2016 was not addressed nor was any effort made to correct for such a bias the primary goal of this study is the development of a gridded historical hourly and daily eto dataset for the period 1983 2012 suitable for application in the great lakes region of north america the gridded dataset developed herein is intended to fill a gap in the resource toolbox available to growers in this region existing historical datasets are generally station based or if they are gridded lack the spatial resolution needed to resolve climatic gradients resulting from the presence of land water contrasts and complex coastlines the presence of complex coastlines in the great lakes region motivates the choice of the higher resolution nldas 2 as opposed to the coarser resolution gdas as the source of gridded meteorological data for the calculation of eto the secondary goal of this study is the evaluation of nldas 2 downward solar radiation and the development of a correction procedure to account for solar radiation bias and underestimation of temporal variability this secondary goal is motivated by findings of a positive nldas 2 solar radiation bias in earlier studies e g sakamoto et al 2011 and knowledge of the moderating effect of grid cell averaging on the representation of weather extrema in gridded datasets e g daley 1991 kitchen and blackall 1992 the premise underlying this secondary goal is that use of corrected nldas 2 solar radiation will result in a more accurate eto dataset compared to one computed using uncorrected data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study is focused on the great lakes region of north america this region contains one of the largest fresh water resources in the world and is characterized by strong physiographic gradients of soils vegetation and climate andresen and winkler 2009 although the region s climate is categorized as humid irrigation for agriculture has expanded rapidly during the past few decades for example in the state of michigan irrigated area increased from just over 115 000 ha in 1982 bureau of the census 1986 to more than 239 000 ha in 2012 national agricultural statistics service 2014 in this study the great lakes region is defined as a rectangle with lower left coordinates of 38 94 n 95 06 w and upper right coordinates of 50 06 n 74 94 w fig 1 the study area consists of approximately 1 84e8 ha of which about 85 is land and 15 is water topography across the study area fig 1 falls mainly into three categories plains e g iowa illinois hills and low mountains e g northeast minnesota michigan s western upper peninsula and appalachian mountains topography e g central pennsylvania the lowest surface elevations are found across southern illinois and northern ontario north of inset panel in fig 1 where surface elevations below 200 m above mean sea level are common highest elevations in the study area are located along an axis from northern west virginia to southwestern new york where surface elevations of 500 m above mean sea level or greater are common 2 2 data nldas 2 xia et al 2012a b is an atmosphere and land surface hydrology dataset covering the period 1979 present consisting of forcing fields derived from narr e g downward solar radiation 2 m temperature and output from four land surface models driven by the forcing fields the grid spacing is 0 125 12 km and the domain covers the continental us and portions of canada and mexico the nldas 2 forcing fields are derived by interpolating 32 km narr data to the 0 125 degree nldas 2 grid adjusting for elevation differences and disaggregating the three hourly narr to an hourly time scale the narr downward solar radiation is bias corrected using university of maryland surface radiation budget srb monthly solar data itself

daylight time edt utc 4 31 december 1982 to 1900 edt 31 december 2012 2 3 nldas 2 solar correction procedure the remainder of section 2 focuses on the sequence of steps taken to transform unprocessed nldas 2 variables into an hourly and daily eto dataset a diagrammatic summary of the procedure is provided in fig 2 the procedure consisted mainly of the assessment and subsequent correction of nldas 2 downward solar radiation using climate station data downward solar radiation is a primary input variable in the series of semi physical and semi empirical equations used to compute variables in the fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as discussed in greater detail in section 2 4 prior to the formal assessment of nldas 2 downward solar radiation at climate station sites a preliminary assessment of spatial patterns of nldas 2 downward solar radiation near the great lakes revealed a pattern in which artificially high values of solar radiation over the lakes extended 20 30 km inland in turn creating strong gradients of solar radiation inland of the lakeshore fig s1a b in supplementary material this pattern originates not with narr but with the srb data and appears to be an artifact of the coarse resolution of the underlying goes dataset 0 5 a nearest neighbor approach was utilized to replace erroneous values of nldas 2 downward solar radiation at grid points adjacent to the lakes with values one grid point inland a similar approach was taken to correct for anomalously high temperatures in far southwestern ontario fig s1c d in supplementary material that result from interpolation of narr data to the nldas 2 grid at land points between lakes erie huron and st clair a small lake between erie and huron the modification of the raw nldas 2 downward solar radiation and temperature yielded a set of artifact removed nldas 2 variables fig 2a the secondary research goal of this study as stated in section 1 is the evaluation and correction of nldas 2 solar radiation bias and underestimation of temporal variability thus the artifact removed nldas 2 downward solar radiation was validated using hourly global solar flux measurements from the noaa u s climate reference network uscrn hubbard et al 2005 uscrn is a system of climate observing stations developed to provide long term air temperature precipitation and soil moisture and temperature observations that are both high quality and collected in stable settings validation was performed at four uscrn stations within the great lakes region necedah wi shabbona il chatham mi and gaylord mi during four growing seasons 2008 2011 fig 1 table 1 however before proceeding a word of caution is in order regarding comparisons of point observations and gridded estimates when comparing primary variables e g downward solar radiation or derived quantities e g eto at a weather climate station to those extracted at a nearby grid point as is done in this study it is important to keep in mind that point values are being compared to spatial averages thus an unknown portion of the differences between the station observations and gridded estimates quoted herein can be attributed to sub grid variability i e representativeness error daley 1991 kitchen and blackall 1992 the reader should keep this in mind particularly when terms such as error and bias are used upon initial validation of the nldas 2 downward solar radiation a substantial positive bias was discovered at all four stations although the focus of the validation was on the hourly timescale positive bias was also found in the daily solar radiation time series 1 27 2 35 mj m 2 day 1 see square marker edge color in fig 1 in the four station pooled daily solar radiation scatter plot in fig 3 a a mean bias bias of 1 70 mj m 2 day 1 is evident with the positive bias entirely associated with the left side of the observed distribution bias of 3 40 mj m 2 day 1 for the bottom 20 of the distribution but 0 15 mj m 2 day 1 for the top 20 thus a decision was made to correct at the hourly timescale for bias and the tendency of nldas 2 to overestimate underestimate solar radiation values on the left right side of the observed distribution the latter correction is referred to hereafter as a variance correction since it accounts for the underprediction of the variance of solar around the median i e the range of solar values on both hourly and daily timescales is narrower in nldas 2 than the observations suggest for irrigation scheduling one must consider not only days within the middle of the distribution but low and high eto days as well kloss et al 2012 before proceeding a brief review of existing solar radiation correction methods is in order in general existing correction methods reduce bias but do not correct underestimation of temporal variability e g diurnal seasonal a common method of bias correction involves the multiplication of uncorrected solar radiation values by the ratio of a desired mean value to an uncorrected mean value e g cosgrove et al 2003 ngo duc et al 2005 more sophisticated approaches have also been used in which regression models are linked with observed cloud cover to compute bias correction coefficients e g sheffield et al 2006 weedon et al 2010 alternatively empirical models have been used to rescale downward shortwave radiation using other atmospheric surface variables e g daily maximum temperature as inputs e g wei et al 2014 lastly methods have been developed that combine bias correction with corrections for over or under estimation of clear sky radiation and over or under estimation of cloudiness e g slater 2016 the desire to control both solar radiation bias and variance and to limit the variables necessary for the correction procedure to solar radiation alone as opposed to for example solar radiation and cloud cover motivates the development of a correction procedure distinct from those reviewed here the correction procedure restricted to approximate daylight hours 1100 0000 utc 0700 2000 edt during the 1 april 30 september growing season applicable to corn and soybeans primary crops in the great lakes region was developed for each hour as follows first four year mean values for each growing season day and each station were pooled together yielding a total of 732 points 183 growing season days x 4 stations second a linear regression model was developed with the four year mean artifact removed nldas 2 downward solar radiation s n as the independent variable and the four year mean observed downward solar radiation s o as the dependent variable 1 s o a b s n where a and b are the interecept and slope of the linear regression line respectively provided in table s1 in supplementary material third the linear regression model was applied to s n to yield a bias corrected nldas 2 downward solar radiation s n b using slope and intercept values calculated from eq 1 2 s n b a b s n fig 2b fourth an updated linear regression model was developed with s o as the independent variable s n b as the dependent variable and data points limited to 1800 utc time of approximate peak solar radiation 3 s n b a b s o where coefficients a and b are 1 2731 and 0 4422 respectively this step was performed to evaluate the magnitude of over and under estimation of solar radiation near the tails of the distribution around the time of peak solar radiation fifth an adjustment factor was calculated as the ratio of s n b at the particular hour and s n b at the pivot point of the 1 1 and linear regression lines s p i v calculated as 2 28 mj m 2 in the previous step this adjustment factor was then applied to s n b to yield a bias and variance corrected solar radiation s n b v 4 s n b v s n b s n b s p i v fig 2c this step was performed to reduce the bias for points closer to the tails of the observed distribution and was only applied between 1700 and 2000 utc 1300 and 1600 edt peak heating window when the pivot point is approximately constant finally the hour specific bias and variance correction procedure was applied to the downward solar radiation variable at all grid points in the nldas 2 dataset and the correction process then advanced to the next hour before proceeding to a description of the fao 56 eto calculation a few words of clarification are in order regarding the solar correction procedure first the slope and intercepts used to bias correct the raw nldas 2 downward solar radiation are functions of time of day but not day of year the underlying assumption of constant bias during the growing season likely limits our ability to eliminate bias but has some support in the time series of the ratio of nldas 2 and uscrn downward solar radiation during the growing season fig s2 in supplementary material second the correction procedure is based on only four years of data increasing the likelihood that anomalous conditions in one year influence the corrections applied to all 30 years of data 2 4 fao 56

surface atmospheric variables corrected downward solar radiation 2 m temperature 2 m specific humidity and 10 m wind speed following the method and procedure described in chapters 3 and 4 of allen et al 1998 in short downward solar radiation and 2 m temperature were used to estimate net radiation using an albedo appropriate to a short grass surface 0 23 the stefan boltzmann law and formulas for estimating atmospheric absorption of outgoing longwave radiation 10 m wind speed was extrapolated to the 2 m level assuming a logarithmic wind profile and 2 m saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure were derived from 2 m temperature and specific humidity using empirical formulas based on the clausius clapeyron equation variables were then calculated and input to eq 5 for each hour of the 1983 2012 dataset finally for analyzing evaporative demand during the growing season daily eto was computed by integrating hourly values over a 0400 utc 0400 utc midnight midnight edt day the process of deriving hourly and daily eto is summarized in fig 2d before proceeding it is important to point out that strictly speaking weather data used to compute eto should be collected over or downwind of dense fully transpiring grass or similar vegetation exhibiting behavior similar to the definition of the reference surface condition pereira et al 2015 gridded eto products cannot satisfy this requirement furthermore effects of local irrigation on temperature and humidity and thus eto are not accounted for in the development of gridded eto products this is true for all gridded eto datasets including the dataset developed in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 corrected solar and eto assessment the impact of the hourly bias and variance correction procedure on the nldas 2 daily downward solar radiation at the four uscrn stations is seen in figs 1 and 3 first note that bias at all four stations is constrained to 1 mj m 2 day 1 although the correction procedure has introduced negative bias at some stations e g necedah compare square marker edge and fill colors in fig 1 second comparing the full pooled dataset before and after bias corrections it is apparent that the bias correction procedure was successful in eliminating mean bias bias while also reducing root mean square error rmse from 3 00 mj m 2 day 1 to 2 46 mj m 2 day 1 cf fig 3a and b nevertheless the slope of the regression line s remains much less than 1 0 s 0 69 and consequently bias for the bottom and top 20 of the observed distribution is 1 82 and 1 97 mj m 2 day 1 respectively the impact of the combined bias and variance corrections is seen in fig 3c bias for the bottom and top 20 of the observed distribution has been reduced to 0 38 and 0 82 mj m 2 day 1 respectively and s has been increased to 0 9 the improvement of the statistics at the shoulders of the distribution does come at a price however as rmse and bias for the entire distribution are degraded somewhat compared to the bias correction step alone cf fig 3b and c as this initial assessment was performed at the same sites and with the same dataset used to develop the correction procedure analysis proceeds to further evaluation of the bias and variance corrected downward solar radiation at eight weather stations within the enviro weather ew mesonetwork in michigan fig 1 tables 1 and 2 ew is an interactive information system linking real time weather data forecasts and biological and other process based models for assistance in operational decision making and risk management associated with michigan s agriculture and natural resource industries andresen et al 2012 the need for weather station datasets containing downward solar radiation and the other components of eq 5 led to the choice of the ew network as the source of observations for this validation procedure the earliest records in the ew mesonetwork date back to 1996 comparison of the bias columns in table 2 reveals that the eight station median daily solar radiation bias has been reduced from 2 04 mj m 2 day 1 11 23 of mean to 0 42 mj m 2 day 1 2 34 of mean prior to the correction procedure all stations exhibited a positive bias after the procedure the sign of bias is evenly split between the eight stations although a small positive overall bias remains fig 1 table 2 to assess changes to daily solar radiation variance due to the correction procedure the ratio of nldas 2 to observed standard deviation sd is computed referred to hereafter as the sd ratio sdr comparison of the sdr columns in table 2 indicates that the correction procedure has indeed increased the variance of nldas 2 daily solar radiation prior to the correction the nldas 2 standard deviation was 81 of the observed value as judged by the eight station median sdr whereas after the correction this statistic is 100 regarding rmse the correction procedure has had a smaller impact reducing the eight station median rmse from 4 50 mj m 2 day 1 24 25 of mean to 4 35 mj m 2 day 1 23 27 of mean two sample t tests confirm the statistical significance of the changes to bias and sdr at all stations however changes to rmse are not universally significant not shown proceeding to an assessment of nldas 2 daily eto at the ew stations table 3 the bias and variance correction of downward solar radiation is found to have a beneficial impact on all eto statistics most notably the correction procedure has reduced the eight station median bias from 0 21 mm day 1 6 25 of mean to 0 06 mm day 1 1 81 of mean following the correction procedure all but two sites feature bias less than 10 of the mean value with all sites exhibiting bias smaller than what was reported in abatzoglou 2013 less than the median value of 0 5 mm day 1 reported therein comparison of the sdr columns indicates that the correction procedure has increased the variance of nldas 2 daily eto prior to the correction the nldas 2 standard deviation was 89 of the observed value as judged by the eight station median sdr whereas after the correction this statistic is 95 additionally the eight station median rmse has been reduced slightly from 0 87 mm day 1 24 98 of mean to 0 84 mm day 1 23 80 of mean rmse of about 20 30 has been reported for both usgs and nldas 2 daily eto products liu et al 2011 moorhead et al 2015 as with solar radiation two sample t tests confirm the universal statistical significance of the changes to bias and sdr but not the change to rmse not shown in conclusion the preceding evaluation of nldas 2 solar radiation and eto confirms that the secondary goal of this study has been achieved that is the correction of nldas 2 solar radiation has yielded a more accurate nldas 2 eto dataset than one computed from uncorrected solar radiation 3 2 spatial analysis analysis of the nldas 2 eto dataset begins with contoured plots of growing season mean daily eto before and after application of the solar radiation correction fig 4 recall that the growing season is defined here as 1 april 30 september unless otherwise specified all figures presented in this study display data averaged over the period of record 1983 2012 the bias and variance correction steps described in section 2 3 reduced mean daily eto by an average of 5 49 0 19 mm day 1 across the domain with the percent reduction varying from a minimum of 2 25 0 09 mm day 1 in northern missouri to a maximum of 8 89 0 26 mm day 1 across central new york see contoured lines in fig 4a in general mean daily eto tends to decrease in a southwest to northeast gradient across the region with highest values in northern missouri and lowest values in southwestern quebec the influence of water bodies and surface elevation on this pattern is evident as well with relatively low values near the lakes especially the northern lakes e g superior and across the higher terrain from west virginia to upstate new york cf figs 1 and 4 in addition a ridge of higher mean eto is apparent across southern ontario north of lakes erie and ontario overall these results suggest greatest potential vegetative water needs in southern and western portions of the region where modification of weather and climate by either large bodies of water or high terrain is minimal the results also suggest that the great lakes play an important role in modulating spatial patterns of evaporative water demand it is important to note that the spatial resolution of the new nldas 2 eto dataset combined with the increased accuracy resulting from the solar correction procedure allows for analysis of spatiotemporal variability of eto in the great lakes region in unprecedented detail analysis now proceeds to an examination of subseasonal variability with monthly averages of daily eto during the growing season fig 5 comparing the april and july panels observe that mean daily eto increases from a domain average of 2 41 mm day 1 in april to a peak of 4 30 mm day 1 in july the influence of the northern lakes e g superior on daily eto is particularly evident during june and july when the relatively cool water temperatures not shown reduce evaporative demand across the northern great lakes region percent differences between july and april mean daily eto contoured lines in the july panel vary from 50 to 95 across the domain with no clear relationship between percent difference and proximity to water however the july april percent differences are reduced at higher elevations for example percent differences in central pennsylvania are 60 65 compared to 65 75 in the lower elevation eastern and western portions of the state cf figs 1 and 5 lastly evidence of the impact of the solar correction procedure on monthly mean eto and analyses of the spatial patterns of mean solar radiation and 2 m temperature primary drivers of eto eq 5 are shown in figs s3 s5 respectively in the supplementary material with the considerable spatial and subseasonal variability of daily eto now established patterns of submonthly variability are examined with contoured maps of sd normalized by the monthly mean fig 6 overall the highest lowest normalized sd occurs in april july with normalized sd generally increasing from southwest to northeast across the domain outside of the northeast 20 of the domain where values are consistently higher normalized sd decreases from 0 35 0 5 during april to 0 25 or less during july and increases again to 0 3 0 4 during september this cycle in submonthly variability is closely related to the corresponding cycle in the magnitude and frequency of shortwave troughs and frontal systems sanders and hoffman 2002 payer et al 2011 as the jet stream weakens and translates northward during the transition from spring to summer shortwave troughs and frontal systems become weaker and their passage less frequent and day to day variability of the drivers of eto e g downward solar radiation eq 5 decreases with time the opposite trend occurs as the jet stream strengthens and translates southward again during the transition from summer to autumn on the other hand the influence of the lakes on normalized sd is generally difficult to discern except for september when normalized eto is noticeably lower near the lakes lower normalized sd near the lakes in autumn reflects the muting effect of the relatively high heat capacity of the lakes on day to day variability of the drivers of eto 3 3 point analysis examination of the nldas 2 eto dataset now proceeds to analysis of temporal variability of eto on timescales ranging from diurnal to interannual at two locations chosen to represent interior and lakeshore climates east lansing mi and east leland mi fig 7 see fig 1 and table 1 for locations east lansing is in the south central part of michigan s lower peninsula approximately 100 km from the nearest great lake whereas east leland is in the center of the leelanau peninsula in northwest michigan and is about equidistant 5 km from lake michigan to the west and grand traverse bay to the east see inset panel in fig 1 before proceeding it important to note that the nldas 2 grid resolution 1 8 about 12 km is approximately equal to the width of the leelanau peninsula at east leland thus caution must be exercised as the peninsula is represented by at most 3 4 grid cells some of which extend partially over water although this study is concerned primarily with daily eto it is important to recall that the nldas 2 eto dataset is an hourly product to help visualize the dataset at the hourly timescale box and whisker plot time series of hourly eto are presented in fig 7a examination of fig 7a reveals several prominent characteristics first a simple diurnal cycle of eto is evident at both sites consisting of a minimum in median eto and box and whisker plot length between 0900 and 1000 utc 0500 and 0600 edt around sunrise and a maximum in median eto and box and whisker plot length at 1800 utc 1400 edt around solar noon second during the day the median hourly eto as well as the box and whisker plot length is greater at east lansing than east leland the longer plots indicate greater subseasonal and or interannual variability at the inland station the weaker variability at east leland can be attributed to the proximity of the station to bodies of water to its west and east the relatively high heat capacity of water moderates the temperature variability at adjacent land points legates and willmott 1990 maximum hourly eto values are just under 1 mm hr 1 at east lansing and just under 0 8 mm hr 1 at east leland such high values are associated with abnormally warm days during mid summer lastly the kink in the time series between 2000 and 2200 utc 1600 and 1800 edt is an artifact of the variance correction procedure section 2 3 the adjustment was only applied between 1700 and 2000 utc 1300 and 1600 edt i e during the period of approximate peak heating to compare the growing season cycle of daily eto at inland and coastal stations box and whisker plot time series of daily eto from 1 april to 30 september are presented in fig 7b consistent with the growing season solar radiation cycle not shown the 30 year median daily eto increases from 1 april until approximately early june exhibits weak month to month variation through approximately early august and steadily declines thereafter submonthly variability of 30 year median daily eto is highest from about mid april to early june and is lower at east leland than east lansing consistent with the closer proximity of east leland to the stabilizing influence of lake michigan the larger fluctuations in 30 year median daily eto during spring reflect both the influence of large scale weather patterns and the impact of one or two anomalous years in the 30 year study period on the trends the fluctuations of the 30 year median daily eto as well as the longer boxes and whiskers suggest a greater influence of shortwave troughs and frontal systems on submonthly eto variability during spring recall the discussion of normalized sd fig 6 and shortwave troughs in section 3 2 such variability is reduced during the second half of the growing season most prominently at east leland lastly scattered daily eto values of 7 10 mm day 1 evident from late june to mid july occurred in two years only 1988 and 2012 both of which were substantially impacted by extended drought fuchs et al 2015 next histograms are presented in fig 7c to examine the distribution of daily eto during the growing season a comparison of the histograms at east lansing and east leland reveals considerable differences between inland and coastal station sites first both the median and mean daily eto are about 15 lower at east leland than east lansing a reflection of the spatial gradient of daily eto between the lakeshore and interior fig 4b second the distribution appears quasi normal at east lansing and skewed at east leland the skewness statistic confirms this observation with a value of 0 63 at east lansing and 0 72 at east leland the distribution at east leland is biased toward lower daily eto values with a sharp drop off on the right side of the distribution the quasi normal and skewed distributions at east lansing and east leland respectively were also observed at other inland and coastal station sites examined in this study not shown and highlight the importance of lake proximity to weather and climate legates and willmott 1990 note also that despite the quasi normal distribution at east lansing a long tail is present on the right side of the distribution the daily eto values in the tail are representative of hot sunny days during drought years conditions generally absent at east leland station sites adjacent to the lakeshore are less likely to experience hot full sun days during summer than station sites well inland lastly questions regarding interannual variability and multi year trends are addressed with box and whisker plot time series of daily eto during the period 1983 2012 fig 7d examination of the time series at east lansing reveals two anomalous growing seasons 1988 and 2012 in which the box and whisker plots extend well above those of the other 28 years recall earlier discussion of fig 7b record warmth and notable droughts occurred during both growing seasons the combination of minimal cloud cover and high temperatures yielded anomalously high daily eto values although evidence of the 1988 anomalous growing season is present in the east leland time series the 2012 box and whisker plot is unremarkable compared to other years a somewhat less obvious feature of fig 7d is a period of reduced daily eto from 1992 to 1997 best seen in the 75th percentiles at east lansing note that the minimum in the 9 year moving average cyan and yellow lines occurs in 1993 at both east lansing and east leland for clarification the 9 year period was chosen to filter out higher frequency noise from the annual data and help identify decadal or longer period trends beginning with 1993 a positive trend in 9 year average daily eto is evident through 2008 the last year for which the 9 year moving average is computed however the trend appears to continue through the end of the study period in 2012 3 4 crop irrigation example an example application of the nldas 2 eto dataset in irrigation management is now provided an irrigation climatology for field maize grown for grain at east lansing mi such information may be useful in planning to determine potential irrigation water needs system design and operational capacity use of eto in managing irrigation for a specific crop requires the use of a crop coefficient kc to account for differences in the crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance between the crop in question and the grass reference crop allen et al 1998 the product of eto and kc is referred to as crop evapotranspiration under standard conditions etc where standard conditions are defined as large fields optimum soil water excellent management practices and environmental conditions and full production in this example the following timeline is assumed planting date 1 may beginning of crop cover 10 may effective full cover 10 july 1 august maturity 31 august following the procedure outlined in allen et al 1998 a crop coefficient curve is constructed using three values of kc kcini initial beginning of crop cover kcmid mid season effective full crop cover and kcend end of season maturity harvest using table 12 in allen et al 1998 and assuming the crop is harvested dry the three values of kc are as follows kcini 0 3 kcmid 1 2 and kcend 0 35 linear interpolation of kc between stages yields the crop coefficient curve presented in fig 8 a compare to fig 34 in allen et al 1998 multiplication of the daily eto values at east lansing in fig 7b by the kc values in fig 8a yields the box and whisker plot time series of daily etc in fig 8b application of the kc scaling factor results in decreased variability during the early and late portions of the growing season and increased variability during the heart of the growing season in june and july next accumulated irrigation during the field maize season is examined for a wet and a dry season 2004 and 2012 respectively first daily eto and precipitation measured at the east lansing ew station during the 2004 and 2012 seasons are input into microsoft excel based irrigation scheduling software available from http www agweather geo msu edu mawn irrigation irr cbook june2014 xls yielding daily irrigation as output the software used in this example is based on an irrigation scheduling spreadsheet presented in allen et al 1998 annex 8 and assumes that available water in the root zone is partially depleted before irrigation water is applied i e management allowed depletion of root zone water the software indicates when supplemental water must be added to match the irrigation demand for a specific crop type and growing season stage in this exercise simulated irrigation applications of 25 4 mm on a given day are initiated whenever daily volumetric soil moisture in the plant rooting zone drops to 50 or less of its maximum value the soil profile used is spinks loamy sand a coarse textured commonly irrigated soil type in michigan with a total of 116 mm of plant extractable water in the top 100 cm of the soil profile the software internally computes daily etc from daily eto using kc values similar but not identical to those in fig 8a second nldas 2 daily eto and precipitation are input for each season between 1983 and 2012 into the irrigation scheduling software yielding a 30 year climatology of daily irrigation accumulation of the daily irrigation totals yields the time series of accumulated irrigation seen in fig 9 with the 2004 green line and 2012 brown line station data driven accumulated irrigation overlaid on the nldas 2 driven accumulated irrigation climatology box and whisker plots in the following discussion it is assumed that a hypothetical irrigation manager applies water based only on the station data driven software output the user compares the irrigation progress at various points in the 2004 and 2012 seasons to the 30 year climatology provided by nldas 2 examination of fig 9 reveals several notable features first a comparison of the station data driven irrigation time series shows that considerably more irrigation water was applied during 2012 279 4 mm than 2004 101 6 mm for reference the statewide average applied irrigation reported in the 2003 2008 and 2013 farm and ranch irrigation surveys varied between 152 4 and 182 9 mm national agricultural statistics service 2004 2009 2014 the anomalously large amount of water applied in 2012 is consistent with the much higher eto during the 2012 season compare 2004 and 2012 in fig 7d as well as much lower rainfall amounts observed 1 may 31 august precipitation at east lansing was 482 87 mm in 2004 but only 214 37 mm in 2012 comparison of the 2004 and 2012 observed precipitation at east lansing to the 1981 2010 average of 327 15 mm at the lansing capital city airport about 14 km northwest of east lansing at 42 779 n 84 587 w reveals the scale of the precipitation anomalies in 2004 and 2012 second it appears that differences between the two years develop early in the season specifically the first application of water in 2012 occurs in early june about one month earlier than in 2004 well before the median initial application date of 2 july see thick black line in fig 9 this suggests that early application of irrigation water may be at least in some cases a precursor to a dry season with heavy irrigation need third variability in the nldas 2 driven irrigation climatology increases noticeably during the later portion of the season on or about 21 july such knowledge of increased temporal variability during the later stages of the growing season may be of use in anticipating water needs for an upcoming season and or planning the capacity of an irrigation system 4 conclusions in this study a gridded great lakes region historical reference evapotranspiration dataset for the period 1983 2012 was developed by inputting nldas 2 forcing fields into the fao 56 eto equation correction of nldas 2 solar radiation was shown to yield a more accurate nldas 2 eto dataset than one computed from uncorrected solar radiation the spatial resolution of the new nldas 2 eto dataset combined with the increased accuracy resulting from the solar correction procedure allowed for analysis of spatiotemporal variability of eto in the great lakes region in unprecedented detail an analysis of the spatial patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region depicted spatial patterns heretofore unseen with relatively low eto values near the lakes and highest values in southern and western portions of the great lakes region where modification of weather and climate by either large bodies of water or high terrain was minimal consistent with the utility of the new eto dataset to depict spatial variability of evaporative demand point analysis at two locations chosen to depict lakeshore and interior climates provided insight into temporal variability of eto not possible with existing station and gridded eto datasets this study has shown the utility of the nldas 2 eto dataset in describing spatial and temporal patterns of evaporative demand across the great lakes region however the limitations of the study must be kept in mind first the correction procedure utilized climate station data from only four stations and was limited to a four year period and the coefficients used to bias correct nldas 2 solar radiation were functions of hour of day but not day of year second the 1 8 degree grid spacing limits the accuracy of the nldas 2 eto dataset especially near strong physiographic gradients of soils vegetation and climate third no gridded dataset can satisfy the requirement that weather data used to compute eto be collected over or downwind of vegetation with similar behavior to the fao 56 reference grass definition however despite these limitations the nldas 2 eto dataset is expected to be of use to the agricultural and hydrological communities future work includes designing and developing a data extraction utility linking the eto dataset with irrigation water scheduling management applications for on line user access developing additional gridded integrative variables e g leaf wetness and considering projected future trends efforts are underway at the time of publication to develop an online access portal on the great lakes integrated sciences assessments glisa website http glisa umich edu those interested in accessing the nldas 2 eto dataset are encouraged to check the glisa news and events page http glisa umich edu news for updates until the data portal is active all data requests should be forwarded to enviro weather at eweather msu edu finally potential applications of the new eto dataset include but are not limited to use in agriculture as a tool for estimating potential irrigation water needs and informing irrigation system design use in hydrology as a tool for managing groundwater supplies and assessing drought potential and in both disciplines as a baseline for assessing surface and groundwater changes under future climate scenarios more broadly the nldas 2 eto dataset presented here has the potential to serve as a valuable tool for

also examined over the arb new hydrological insights for the region precipitation products typically perform better in spring and autumn than in summer and winter overall capa performs best except for a severe underestimation of summer precipitation merra 2 is typically the second best era5 typically outperforms era interim nldas 2 has a fairly low performance jra 55 has the lowest performance

resources under climate change and human activities is increasing the demand for the development application and practical use of predictive tools such as hydrological models in practice accurate and spatially explicit gridded precipitation assets are of crucial concern within the hydrological modeling realm since precipitation is the most crucial hydrological driver e g kitzmiller et al 2011 masih et al 2011 getirana et al 2011 yen et al 2014 gabriel et al 2014 leta et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 accordingly quantitative evaluation of gridded precipitation products is of great importance for the identification of datasets that can offer the greatest benefit toward hydrological modeling and hydro climatological analysis as well as for developing an understanding of the magnitude of potential uncertainties induced via forcing data into the hydrologic model output over the past few decades a suite of gridded precipitation datasets have been developed through the following three

based upon nwp merged with observations using an optimal interpolation was superior to that derived from nwp alone over canada lespinas et al 2015 within alberta canada faramarzi et al 2015 showed

precipitation products how does the precipitation error information vary with the season and precipitation intensity what is the expected impact of precipitation variability among different products on hydro climatological analysis or hydrological simulations the scientific objective of this work is to characterize precipitation variability among different gridded products in the northern great plains providing guidance for the objective selection of gridded precipitation products for use in hydrological modeling activities and or hydro climatological analysis and for understanding the limitations and uncertainties inherent to the climate forcing data over this region this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the study domain precipitation datasets and the verification metrics section 3 presents the evaluation skill of total precipitation products and examines the precipitation budgets and anticipated hydrologic influences while section 4 provides a summary and conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain and reference data the study domain is the arb fig 1 with an area of 162 000 km2 the basin straddling the canada united states border is approximately located within the northern great plains and contains portions of two canadian prairie provinces southeastern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba and one u s state northern north dakota daily total precipitation observations collected at climate stations fig 1 are used as the reference for evaluating the gridded precipitation products the observations are taken from the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station network http climate weather gc ca the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn https ndawn ndsu nodak edu and the global historical climatology network ghcn ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data ghcn daily precipitation was recorded only once per day at most of eccc stations 78 out of 96 squares in fig 1 and the climatological day for daily precipitation observation generally ends at 0700 lst approximately equivalent to 1200 utc over the arb of the following day at other eccc stations 18 out of 96 squares in fig 1 which typically operate on an hourly basis the reported daily precipitation amounts are with respect to the 24 hr period ending at 0600 utc of the following day we did not adjust the daily precipitation for these stations to a common climatological day ending at 1200 utc because the hourly precipitation data from these stations are not available for this study since the number of these station is small the impact of the climatological day difference is expected to be small for the canadian portion at the ndawn stations circles in fig 1 daily precipitation observations are constructed for the climatological day ending at 1200 utc of the following day using the hourly precipitation observations winter precipitation snowfall measurements are not available for the ndawn sites the recording time of daily precipitation is complicated for the ghcn stations menne et al 2012 in the north dakota portion of the arb precipitation was reported only once per day for the ghcn stations triangles in fig 1 and the time of observation is generally unknown menne et al 2012 2 2 gridded precipitation datasets in this work we evaluate six sets of gridded total precipitation i e rain and the water equivalent of frozen or freezing precipitation data including those from capa era interim era5 jra 55 merra 2 and the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 primary forcing for the period of 2002 to 2015 the specifications of these precipitation products are provided in table 1 the capa precipitation was derived from eccc s regional deterministic prediction system rdps nwp forecasts merged with surface and radar precipitation observations using an optimal interpolation technique mahfouf et al 2007 fortin et al 2015 capa precipitation products have been continuously evolving fortin et al 2018 in this study the capa daily precipitation 2002 to 2015 was constructed using the 6 hr products from version 2 4 nwp merged with only gauge observations for the period from january 1 2002 to june 30 2012 and version 3 2 nwp merged with both gauge and radar precipitation for the period from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the two versions represent the latest 6 hr capa products publicly available for the respective time periods era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis with a much improved atmospheric model and assimilation system from those used in era 40 dee et al 2011 era5 is the latest generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis offering a higher spatial resolution than era interim and other improvements jra 55 is the second japanese global atmospheric reanalysis with the tl319 version of jma s operational data assimilation system ebita et al 2011 the merra 2 precipitation product prectotcorr is bias corrected total precipitation with the cpc unified daily precipitation for 42 5 lat 62 5 or the rescaled cpc merged analysis of precipitation over africa derived from an upgraded version of geos 5 atmospheric model and data assimilation system reichle et al 2017 in nldas 2 the hourly spaced precipitation database was generated at 0 125 degree grid spacing over central north america by applying hourly weights to the narr precipitation over canada or the adjusted cpc unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation over conus and mexico xia et al 2012 the rationale for the selection of these total precipitation data sets for evaluation is that they are state of the art gridded precipitation products and represent the latest progress from the various agencies eccc ecmwf jma nasa and noaa in this field it is anticipated that their intercomparison will lead to an insight into the impact of different data sources and or model systems on the variability of gridded precipitation these precipitation data sets are being widely used in a variety of applications related to hydro climatology e g lindsay et al 2014 brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 xu et al 2015 2017 gaborit et al 2017 dhanya and gabriele 2017 boluwade et al 2018 moore and vage 2018 the various precipitation products have different output time steps in this study for all products precipitation is time integrated over a 24 h window i e a 24 h window accumulation of precipitation and then evaluated on a daily 24 h basis since most of the precipitation stations provide only the daily observations section 2 1 to this end daily precipitation amounts for each product are constructed with respect to the 24 h period ending at 1200 utc of the following day which is the common climatological day for most of the reference daily precipitation data section 2 1 the independent reference observations issue has been a challenge to the studies that have assessed gridded precipitation dataset skill relative to point scale observational data e g hutchinson et al 2009 lespinas et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 wong et al 2017 the withheld or leave one out methodology e g hutchinson et al 2009 lespinas et al 2015 is typically applicable only during the development stage of precipitation data sets in this study most of the reference data taken from the eccc ndawn ghcn stations as shown fig 1 are considered independent from all the precipitation products under assessment because i era interim era5 and jra 55 did not incorporated gauge precipitation measurements ii only a small number of stations eccc or ghcn observations were used in the 6 hr capa product over the arb lespinas et al 2015 fig 1 therein iii although the cpc gauge analysis is partially used in the nldas 2 and merra 2 precipitation products only a very limited number of ghcn stations within the arb may be included during the construction of the cpc analysis chen et al 2008 2 3 verification metrics the performance of precipitation products can be measured in terms of categorical or continuous scores practically it is unnecessary to compute a large number of scores brown et al 2008 in accordance with the recommendation of the world meteorological organization wmo brown et al 2008 the metrics of equitable threat score ets frequency bias index fbi mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient r are calculated in this work the definitions of these metrics are provided in table 2 ets measures the proportion of all forecast analysis and or observed precipitation events that were correctly detected by taking away the hits due to random chance while fbi is the ratio of the forecast analysis precipitation frequency to the observed frequency a larger ets means a better performance the best ets score is 1 the fbi measure ranges from 0 to the ideal fbi score is 1 fbi higher lower than 1 indicates that precipitation exceeding a given threshold occurred more less frequently in a precipitation analysis product than in the reference data me measures the mean forecast or analysis and observation difference in precipitation intensity positive negative me denotes an overestimated underestimated mean precipitation intensity the ideal me is 0 mae and rmse measure the error magnitude relative to the reference data smaller mae and rmse indicate better scores the perfect score is 0 for both mae and rmse r is a measure of the degree of linear relationship between the product reference precipitation for characterizing the spatial match between precipitation products forecasts under assessment and reference data the following two approaches are widely used e g brown et al 2008 i comparison against point observations by resampling precipitation products forecasts onto observational stations with a nearest neighbor approach and ii comparison against gridded observations by averaging point observations or fine scale observations derived from an objective analysis such as kriging within the product model grid cells each approach has its advantages and disadvantages brown et al 2008 in this study the evaluation is conducted at an equivalent spatial scale by resampling the precipitation products onto the 23 subcatchment areas of the arb fig 1 which may mitigate the variations in spatial resolution among the products table 1 and is also consistent with the hydrological interests of this study the subcatchment scale precipitation for each gridded product is the average precipitation from the grid cells falling within the subcatchment boundary as shown in fig 1 similarly the reference precipitation for each subcatchment is the average of the station measurements falling within the subcatchment area we also investigated the verification using the nearest neighbor approach or against the inverse distance weighting method based gridded analysis not discussed here and found that the relative performance of the precipitation products was not sensitive to the spatial match approach changes in the resampling approach have little impact on our general conclusions regarding the overall performance of the various products 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of precipitation products with categorical scores to compute the categorical verification scores wet precipitation occurrence days need to be discriminated from dry days using specified precipitation intensity thresholds brown et al 2008 in this study the ets and fbi scores are calculated with respect to different thresholds to examine the ability of the precipitation products to capture occurrence and frequency of different precipitation intensities fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ets scores over the arb the results are based upon the precipitation data from all seasons i e annual scores with respect to precipitation thresholds of 1 5 10 and 20 mm day respectively the utilization of these thresholds is generally consistent with the wmo s recommendation brown et al 2008 as expected the scores vary with the precipitation intensity threshold overall ets decreases as the precipitation threshold increases which reflects the difficulties in analysis of heavy precipitation given a threshold capa typically provides the best ets with merra 2 and era5 following as a collective second best while the ets scores for jra 55 and nldas 2 precipitation are usually the lowest typically best ets scores are observed over the northeastern arb with the exception of nldas 2 where the ets score are highest in the southern usa portion of the basin the remarkable north south ets contrast in nldas 2 precipitation may reflect the influence of different data sources used across the canada us border in the data set narr precipitation over canada and the cpc gauge analysis over conus fig 3 shows the summarized ets scores by pooling the samples from all the arb subcatchments the verification results are stratified by seasons spring summer autumn winter and annual and precipitation intensity thresholds 1 5 10 and 20 mm day the sample sizes of daily precipitation observations are summarized by precipitation rate and season in table 3 in terms of the summarized ets values capa merra 2 and era5 perform better than the other three products across the different precipitation thresholds excluding winter overall jra 55 and nldas 2 provide the lowest ets over the entire arb across different precipitation thresholds and seasons for annual and summer seasons the summarized ets scores from capa are obviously higher than those from other products the differences are statistically significant at a confidence level exceeding 95 based upon a non parametric bootstrap method all precipitation products typically provide higher ets scores in spring and autumn than in summer and winter with the exception that capa exhibits higher ets scores in summer for the lowest threshold 1 mm day used here however with increasing precipitation intensity capa precipitation experiences a substantial reduction in summer ets in summer strong convective precipitation events are more common and due to their localization and spatial complexity generally difficult to capture in a gridded analysis of precipitation although a low density gauge network also has this problem in reality which is then expected to translate into low ets scores for the winter season the summarized scores are not available for the threshold of 20 mm day bottom panel of fig 3 because observed winter daily precipitation rarely exceeds this threshold over the arb table 3 the summarized ets scores are consistently the lowest in winter fig 3 the winter behavior is expected to be adversely affected by a number of factors including i difficulties in measurement and analysis of snowfall ii the smallest sample size of the observed yes events due to the seasonal variation in precipitation intensity table 3 and iii the lowest number of observations used in the precipitation assimilation or adjustment for example for capa lespinas et al 2015 the respective fbi counterparts of figs 2 and 3 are presented in figs 4 and 5 note that the perfect fbi score is 1 for a weak precipitation threshold 1 mm day the fbi annual scores i e from all season data are typically greater than 1 with the largest overestimation of precipitation frequency from jra 55 and especially over the northwestern arb fig 4 the fbi scores typically decrease by crossing the ideal fbi score to below 1 as the precipitation threshold increases from 1 mm day to 20 mm day fig 4 this indicates that the precipitation products typically tend to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation occurrences i e fbi 1 0 but underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation events i e fbi 1 0 consistent with the findings from atmospheric modeling e g mailhot et al 2006 stephens et al 2010 erler and peltier 2016 or gridded analysis e g lespinas et al 2015 the exception is that over the largest subcatchment within the southern arb the fbi scores for heavy precipitation events exceed 1 for all precipitation products fig 4 this may be partially due to the impact of the climatological day difference among the station precipitation measurements reference within the subcatchment section 2 1 reference daily precipitation at eccc and ndawn stations squares and circles in fig 1 is typically with respect to the 24 hr window ending at 1200 utc of the following day whereas the time of daily precipitation observation is typically unknown for the ghcn stations triangles in fig 1 their average within the subcatchment may filter out some heavy precipitation events causing a decrease in observed occurrence frequency and a subsequent fbi greater than 1 in practice the climatological day difference may adversely impact the gridded analysis of precipitation and temperatures e g hutchinson et al 2009 vincent et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 the summarized fbi scores from the different products and different seasons consistently exhibit a decrease as the precipitation threshold increases although their transitions from above 1 overestimation to below 1 underestimation occur at different points as indicated in fig 5 for most of the products the transition from overestimation to underestimation typically occurred for a threshold of about 5 10 mm day or even smaller while jra 55 generally provides the highest overestimation of precipitation occurrence frequency and underestimates only very heavy precipitation events 20 mm day underestimation of heavy precipitation events is more pronounced in summer although winter also shows a notable underestimation of strong precipitation occurrence the number of observed yes events for heavy precipitation is much smaller in winter than in other seasons since summer convective precipitation events due to their localization and spatial complexity are generally difficult to accurately capture or are typically underestimated by atmospheric models e g erler 2015 or gridded analysis data sets e g hutchinson et al 2009 capa consistently underestimates precipitation occurrence frequency in summer fig 5 the severity of summer underestimation in capa increases with the precipitation intensity even with only the version 3 2 of capa i e the addition of radar precipitation to capa for july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the summer fbi behavior is similar not shown which is consistent with the finding of fortin et al 2015 on average capa merra 2 and nldas 2 typically provide larger underestimation than the other products for the frequency of summer heavy precipitation 3 2 total precipitation budget and continuous verification scores fig 6 presents the mean annual precipitation budgets at the basin and subbasin scales and the monthly climatology of basin averaged precipitation the multi year averages are calculated over 2002 2015 the arb basin average annual precipitation as indicated by the various datasets with the exception of jra 55 is about 400 500 mm fig 6 middle which is consistent with the 1971 2000 observations brimelow et al 2015 jra 55 is much wetter with annual precipitation about 100 200 mm higher than other datasets at the basin subbasin scale in jra 55 the northwest arb the qu appelle river subbasin receives more annual precipitation than other portions of the basin in contrast other products typically indicate that the northeast parts of the basin the assiniboine river subbasin is wetter in terms of the seasonal pattern of basin averaged precipitation the various datasets are in good agreement fig 6 bottom as expected a large portion of annual precipitation occurred in the warmer seasons may september with june being the wettest and february being the driest months the precipitation difference between the wettest month and the driest month is about 60 70 mm as compared to capa the jra 55 precipitation monthly climatology is wetter throughout the annual cycle whereas others nldas 2 era interim merra 2 and era5 are typically wetter in summer and drier in winter leading to the overall agreement between them and capa for the mean annual precipitation fig 6 middle fig 7 shows bias in mean daily precipitation analysis for the six precipitation products with respect to mean daily precipitation observation over each of the arb subcatchments within each season the mean daily precipitation fields both analysis and observation are derived from 2002 2015 in terms of long term average with the exception of the summer season and the jra 55 product bias in the precipitation analysis field is typically close to 0 or slightly wet for most of the subcatchments capa severely underestimates summer precipitation amounts i e negative bias over the arb this is consistent with the fbi behavior of capa in summer fig 5 the fbi results demonstrate that the summer dry bias in capa is mainly attributed to underestimation of heavy precipitation even with only the radar version of capa i e version 3 2 from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the notable summer dry bias is not mitigated discussed later fortin et al 2015 also indicated that the additional assimilation of radar precipitation in capa did not change its summer fbi the underestimation of summer precipitation is also seen in merra 2 and nldas 2 for the northwest portions of the basin and in era interim over the southern arb fig 7 jra 55 had a positive bias of precipitation for all seasons the largest wet bias in jra 55 typically occurred in the northwestern arb fig 7 it is important to note that the seasonal and spatial biases exhibited among the precipitation products are expected to translate into biases in simulated hydrographs when these products are used to force hydrologic models for example capa driven hydrologic modeling typically underestimated the flood events as seen in boluwade et al 2018 over the arb and the northern great plains the substantial surface water discharge typically occurs between april september during summer it can be expected that at the basin scale hydrologic analyses forced by jra 55 would have the highest stream discharge whereas capa would be expected to have the lowest stream discharge fig 6 over the southern arb on average the nldas 2 merra 2 and era5 data sets would have comparably higher discharge fig 7 within the northern arb on average the capa and nldas 2 precipitation data sets would be expected to result in substantially lower estimates of stream discharge during summer fig 7 for terrestrial hydrologic analysis focused on the autumn season it would be expected that capa merra 2 and nldas 2 would show similar stream discharge rates that are somewhat lower that era5 and era interim and considerably lower than jra55 fig 8 provides the summarized continuous verification scores from the arb subcatchments the behavior of the summarized me mean error scores is consistent with the bias analysis for the mean daily precipitation fields fig 7 although annual me in capa is close to zero capa typically has an underestimation of summer precipitation and an overestimation of winter precipitation the mean summer bias of around 0 50 mm day fig 8 generally agrees with the performance of the 2009 2012 capa throughout canada lespinas et al 2015 possible explanations for precipitation underestimation in summer capa include i summer convective precipitation systems due to their small scale and spatial complexity are typically difficult to accurately capture or are underestimated by rdps forecasts the background field of capa ii the number of precipitation observation stations merged into capa is very small over the arb region lespinas et al 2015 jra 55 is consistently the wettest additionally on average merra 2 and nldas 2 also underestimate precipitation in summer while era5 and era interim provide a substantial overestimation of spring precipitation mae and rmse are the largest in summer and the smallest in winter showing their sensitivity to precipitation intensity and errors fig 8 middle capa typically has the smallest mae and rmse excluding winter while merra 2 precipitation generally leads to the second smallest mae and rmse we present in fig 9 scatterplots of the observed daily precipitation reference versus the various analysis products for the annual season capa era5 and merra 2 relative to other products under evaluation show better linear relationships with observations reference data precipitation products typically have a better correlation with the reference data in spring and autumn than in summer and winter fig 8 bottom panel similar to the seasonal behavior of ets within each season capa typically excluding after merra 2 in winter relative to other products under evaluation shows a better correlation coefficient in summer the correlation coefficient r of capa is significantly higher than that for other products jra 55 and nldas 2 typically relative to other products exhibited weaker correlation with the reference data as mentioned above in the summer season although capa provides the largest underestimation bias mae and rmse correlation coefficient r are remarkably lower higher for capa statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99 than for other products this may indicate that the smaller underestimation or even overestimation of summer mean precipitation in other products is not due to a better capture of convective precipitation other products also typically severely underestimate the observed convective systems but they additionally generate more notable precipitation events that are not observed or detected by daily sampling i e more false alarms therefore their mean errors me may show smaller underestimation or even overestimation but their performance is inferior to capa regarding the ets mae rmse and correlation for the winter season capa did not exhibit an obvious advantage relative to others which may be related to the fact that less observations are assimilated into capa in winter that in other seasons lespinas et al 2015 as discussed above capa on average severely underestimated summer precipitation the underestimation is related to the scale and spatial complexity of summer convective precipitation systems weather radars hold the advantage of detecting and tracking meso micro scale convective precipitation systems e g xu et al 2005 2006 which are difficult to capture with sparsely distributed rain gauges in this study the version 3 2 capa from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 includes the assimilation of radar precipitation the verification scores summarized from this period i e july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 are compared with those from the period without the radar assimilation in capa i e january 1 2002 to june 30 2012 in fig 10 although the arb is fully covered by the canadian radar network fortin et al 2015 the summer underestimation in capa is not significantly improved by the radar precipitation assimilation fig 10 top panel this is similar to the fbi analysis in fortin et al 2015 the mae rmse and correlation r results fig 10 middle and bottom panels also do not show the added benefit from the assimilation of radar precipitation the possible reason is that radar quantitative precipitation estimation often suffers from a number of factors such as an inappropriate reflectivity rainfall rate relationship range degradation and bright band contamination e g xu et al 2008 2014 zhang et al 2008 further radar data quality control and bias correction are required to improve the effectiveness of the radar precipitation assimilation in capa for this region fig 10 also indicates that the merging of the two time periods 2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2015 has little impact on the overall performance of the capa product 3 3 total liquid water flux analysis for spring and early summer snowmelt plays a critically important role in the spring and early summer flood events over the arb e g brimelow et al 2015 furthermore it is the total liquid water flux tlwf i e sum of liquid precipitation and snowmelt that is the dominant controlling factor for potential biases in the spring early summer hydrological simulations of the arb region accordingly it is important to compare tlwf from the various data sets in order to understand how variability among precipitation products may influence the spring early summer terrestrial hydrologic analysis the methodologies upon which tlwf is calculated are presented as follows for nldas 2 the tlwf is calculated by summing the liquid precipitation and water equivalent snowmelt from the nldas 2 hourly noah data set for era interim era5 and merra 2 each data set provides the water equivalent snowmelt total precipitation and water equivalent snowfall making it straightforward to estimate their tlwf i e total precipitation minus snowfall and then plus snowmelt for jra 55 the daily tlwf is estimated by combining its daily total precipitation and daily changes in snow water equivalent swe capa provides only the total precipitation and the tlwf for capa is estimated as follows capa precipitation is identified as snowfall if the mean daily surface air temperature which in this case is taken from merra 2 the merra 2 temperature data set outperforms other temperature data sets over the arb based upon a comparison against station observations is lower than 0 c and liquid precipitation otherwise snow if any accumulates on the ground after a small fraction i e the sublimation rate of snowfall is deducted to account for the possible sublimation and wind effects the degree day method e g rango and martinec 1995 due to its relatively low data input requirements is then used to estimate the daily snowmelt a physically based energy balance approach is not suitable because measurements of the variables required for the method are not available here initially the sublimation rate was specified as 10 and the degree day ratios seasonally varying were following the wmo s recommendation rango and martinec 1995 table 1 therein these coefficients are then adjusted so that the resulting snowmelt and swe on the ground are generally consistent at the basin scale with the snow data assimilation system snodas data at nsidc https nsidc org data g02158 the tlwf for capa is then the sum of liquid precipitation and the estimated snowmelt changes in the methodology may significantly affect the day to day tlwf estimation because daily snowmelt is hard to estimate however the average daily tlwf within the season period which is presented in this study is little impacted by changes in the methodology to be consistent with the major snowmelt period of the arb we calculated the average daily tlwf values at a subcatchment scale from the various data sets for spring to early summer april june which are presented in fig 11 the april to june averages are taken from the climatology 2002 to 2015 and the three flood years 2011 2013 and 2014 respectively in terms of daily tlwf climatology see fig 11 1 st column at the basin scale jra 55 is again the wettest while merra 2 is the driest in terms of the spatial pattern on average jra 55 presents wetter tlwf in the west northwest part of the basin in contrast other products typically indicate that the west southwest portion is drier than other areas in the basin accordingly in terms of the spring early summer hydrological analysis and modeling it can be expected that on average jra 55 would have the highest stream discharge as compared to the lowest flow for merra 2 as expected the spring early summer tlwf values and their spatial patterns from the various data sets exhibit substantial year to year variations fig 11 for example during the 2011 spring and early summer see fig 11 2nd column wetter tlwf values are typically observed over the southern and northeastern portions of the basin than over the northwestern part era5 jra 55 and capa produced higher tlwf than other data sets the spring and early summer of 2013 see fig 11 3rd column is spatially similar to but notably drier than that of 2011 and merra 2 and jra 55 provide the respective lowest and highest tlwf during this time frame the 2014 spring early summer see fig 11 4th column is spatially different from the 2011 2013 equivalent the quantified year to year variability among the various tlwf data will help characterize sources of uncertainty for hydro climatological analysis for these flood events e g brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 4 summary and conclusions in this work six sets of state of the art gridded total precipitation products were evaluated over the arb the main findings are as follows i precipitation products typically perform better in spring and autumn than in summer and winter over the arb which is in contrast with the claims of wong et al 2017 based upon the evaluation over the whole canada ii the investigated precipitation products typically tend to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation occurrences and underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation events this is common in weather and climate models where precipitation is typically produced more frequently and lightly associated with the model convective parameterizations than observed e g stephens et al 2010 erler and peltier 2016 however different products and different seasons have different transition points from overestimation to underestimation iii overall capa performs best except for a severe underestimation of mean summer precipitation merra 2 is the second best merra 2 and nldas 2 also underestimated mean summer precipitation amounts but to a lesser degree than capa capa and merra 2 typically hold better ability to capture the temporal variability of precipitation occurrence jra 55 and nldas 2 typically relative to other products exhibited weaker time correspondence to the reference which is translated into lower ets and larger rmse the fairly low overall performance of the nldas 2 precipitation product was impacted by its different data sources across the canada united states border the era5 precipitation typically performed better than the era interim precipitation reflecting the latest improvement in the era series jra 55 had the lowest performance with a considerable wet bias throughout all seasons the spatial and seasonal variations among the various precipitation datasets will impact the performance of hydro climatological analysis or hydrological simulations the verification results from this study can provide important guidance for the bias correction and the objective selection of gridded precipitation products for driving hydrological models or other hydro climatological related tasks in the arb further the water and energy budgets of the arb are governed by the complex interactions between the atmosphere and prairie surface features e g the presence of many potholes formed by glaciation the basin represents many of the hydro climatological complexities e g brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 associated with the northern region of the great plains

precipitation datasets can be used for characterizing the hydro climatological behavior of this region much of our knowledge on precipitation variability among different products over this region comes from the coarse scale evaluation studies for the whole canada or conus many of which may under represent the performance of different precipitation products over these areas the present study is intended to fill this gap daily total precipitation data derived from capa era interim era5 jra 55 merra 2 and nldas 2 respectively are evaluated over the assiniboine river basin arb which represents many of the hydro climatological complexities associated with the northern great plains additionally the spatial and year to year variations in total liquid water flux for spring and early summer are also examined over the arb new hydrological insights for the region precipitation products typically perform better in spring and autumn than in summer and winter overall capa performs best except for a severe underestimation of summer precipitation merra 2 is typically the second best era5 typically outperforms era interim nldas 2 has a fairly low performance jra 55 has the lowest performance

resources under climate change and human activities is increasing the demand for the development application and practical use of predictive tools such as hydrological models in practice accurate and spatially explicit gridded precipitation assets are of crucial concern within the hydrological modeling realm since precipitation is the most crucial hydrological driver e g kitzmiller et al 2011 masih et al 2011 getirana et al 2011 yen et al 2014 gabriel et al 2014 leta et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 accordingly quantitative evaluation of gridded precipitation products is of great importance for the identification of datasets that can offer the greatest benefit toward hydrological modeling and hydro climatological analysis as well as for developing an understanding of the magnitude of potential uncertainties induced via forcing data into the hydrologic model output over the past few decades a suite of gridded precipitation datasets have been developed through the following three

that the probability of detection for precipitation occurrence with respect to a threshold of 0 2 mm day in nrcan daily products could exceed 80 across southern canada the capa precipitation which is based upon nwp merged with observations using an optimal interpolation was superior to that derived from nwp alone over canada lespinas et al 2015 within alberta canada faramarzi et al 2015 showed that cfsr remarkably overestimated daily precipitation amounts while the nrcan daily precipitation generally exhibited smaller mean absolute errors and better correlation with observations dhanya and

daily precipitation exhibited the smallest bias relative to the cpc gridded gauge analysis wong et al 2017 conducted a relatively comprehensive assessment over canada of daily precipitation products derived from several different data sources unsurprisingly the observation adjusted nwp or reanalysis data sets typically provided better precipitation estimation the northern great plains and the

climatological behavior of this region e g brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 hanesiak et al 2011 it is not clear how different precipitation products may affect our analysis and understanding of seasonal and extreme hydro climatological characteristics for these areas so far much of our knowledge on precipitation variability among different products over this region originates from the coarse

precipitation products how does the precipitation error information vary with the season and precipitation intensity what is the expected impact of precipitation variability among different products on hydro climatological analysis or hydrological simulations the scientific objective of this work is to characterize precipitation variability among different gridded products in the northern great

limitations and uncertainties inherent to the climate forcing data over this region this paper is organized as follows section 2 outlines the study domain precipitation datasets and the verification

conclusions 2 data and methods 2 1 study domain and reference data the study domain is the arb fig 1 with an area of 162 000 km2 the basin straddling the canada united states border is approximately located within the northern great plains and contains portions of two canadian prairie provinces southeastern saskatchewan and southwestern manitoba and one u s state northern north dakota daily total precipitation observations collected at climate stations fig 1 are used as the reference for evaluating the gridded precipitation products the observations are taken from the environment and climate change canada eccc weather station network http climate weather gc ca the north dakota agricultural weather network ndawn https ndawn ndsu nodak edu and the global historical climatology network ghcn ftp ftp ncdc noaa gov pub data ghcn daily precipitation was recorded only once per day at most of eccc stations 78 out of 96 squares in fig 1 and the climatological day for daily precipitation observation generally ends at 0700 lst approximately equivalent to 1200 utc over the arb of the following day at other eccc stations 18 out of 96 squares in fig 1 which typically operate on an hourly basis the reported daily precipitation amounts are with respect to the 24 hr period ending at 0600 utc of the following day we did not adjust the daily precipitation for these stations to a common climatological day ending at 1200 utc because the hourly precipitation data from these stations are not available for this study since the number of these station is small the impact of the climatological day difference is expected to be small for the canadian portion at the ndawn stations circles in fig 1 daily precipitation observations are constructed for the climatological day ending at 1200 utc of the following day using the hourly precipitation observations winter precipitation snowfall measurements are not available for the ndawn sites the recording time of daily precipitation is complicated for the ghcn stations menne et al 2012 in the north dakota portion of the arb precipitation was reported only once per day for the ghcn stations triangles in fig 1 and the time of observation is generally unknown menne et al 2012 2 2 gridded precipitation datasets in this work we evaluate six sets of gridded total precipitation i e rain and the water equivalent of frozen or freezing precipitation data including those from capa era interim era5 jra 55 merra 2 and the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 primary forcing for the period of 2002 to 2015 the specifications of these precipitation products are provided in table 1 the capa precipitation was derived from eccc s regional deterministic prediction system rdps nwp forecasts merged with surface and radar precipitation observations using an optimal interpolation technique mahfouf et al 2007 fortin et al 2015 capa precipitation products have been continuously evolving fortin et al 2018 in this study the capa daily precipitation 2002 to 2015 was constructed using the 6 hr products from version 2 4 nwp merged with only gauge observations for the period from january 1 2002 to june 30 2012 and version 3 2 nwp merged with both gauge and radar precipitation for the period from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the two versions represent the latest 6 hr capa products publicly available for the respective time periods era interim is a global atmospheric reanalysis with a much improved atmospheric model and assimilation system from those used in era 40 dee et al 2011 era5 is the latest generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis offering a higher spatial resolution than era interim and other improvements jra 55 is the second japanese global atmospheric reanalysis with the tl319 version of jma s operational data assimilation system ebita et al 2011 the merra 2 precipitation product prectotcorr is bias corrected total precipitation with the cpc unified daily

adjusted cpc unified gauge based analysis of daily precipitation over conus and mexico xia et al 2012 the rationale for the selection of these total precipitation data sets for evaluation is that they are state of the art gridded precipitation products and represent the latest progress from the various agencies eccc ecmwf jma nasa and noaa in this field it is anticipated that their intercomparison will lead to an insight into the impact of different data sources and or model systems on the variability of gridded precipitation these precipitation data sets are being widely used in a variety of applications related to hydro climatology e g lindsay et al 2014 brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 xu et al 2015 2017 gaborit et al 2017 dhanya and gabriele 2017 boluwade et al 2018 moore and vage 2018 the various precipitation products have different output time steps in this study for all products precipitation is time integrated over a 24 h window i e a 24 h window accumulation of precipitation and then evaluated on a daily 24 h basis since most of the precipitation stations provide only the daily observations section 2 1 to this end daily precipitation amounts for each product are constructed with respect to the 24 h period ending at 1200 utc of the following day which is the common climatological day for most of the reference daily precipitation data section 2 1 the independent reference observations issue has been a challenge to the studies that have assessed gridded precipitation dataset skill relative to point scale observational data e g hutchinson et al 2009 lespinas et al 2015 faramarzi et al 2015 wong et al 2017 the withheld or leave one out methodology e g hutchinson et al 2009 lespinas et al 2015 is typically applicable only during the development stage of precipitation data sets in this study most of the reference data taken from the eccc ndawn ghcn stations as shown fig 1 are considered independent from all the precipitation products under assessment because i era interim era5 and jra 55 did not incorporated gauge precipitation measurements ii only a small number of stations eccc or ghcn observations were used in the 6 hr capa product over the arb lespinas et al 2015 fig 1 therein iii although the cpc gauge analysis is partially used in the nldas 2 and merra 2 precipitation products only a very limited number of ghcn stations within the arb may be included during the construction of the cpc analysis chen et al 2008 2 3 verification metrics the performance of precipitation products can be measured in terms of categorical or continuous scores practically it is unnecessary to compute a large number of scores brown et al 2008 in accordance with the recommendation of the world meteorological organization wmo brown et al 2008 the metrics of equitable threat score ets frequency bias index fbi mean error me mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficient r are calculated in this work the definitions of these metrics are provided in table 2 ets measures the proportion of all forecast analysis and or observed precipitation events that were correctly detected by taking away the hits due to random chance while fbi is the ratio of the forecast analysis precipitation frequency to the observed frequency a larger ets means a better performance the best ets score is 1 the fbi measure ranges from 0 to the ideal fbi score is 1 fbi higher lower than 1 indicates that precipitation exceeding a given threshold occurred more less frequently in a precipitation analysis product than in the reference data me measures the mean forecast or analysis and observation difference in precipitation intensity positive negative me denotes an overestimated underestimated mean precipitation intensity the ideal me is 0 mae and rmse measure the error magnitude relative to the reference data smaller mae and rmse indicate better scores the perfect score is 0 for both mae and rmse r is a measure of the degree of linear relationship between the product reference precipitation for characterizing the spatial match between precipitation products forecasts under assessment and reference data the following two approaches are widely used e g brown et al 2008 i comparison against point observations by resampling precipitation products forecasts onto observational stations with a nearest neighbor approach and ii comparison against gridded observations by averaging point observations or fine scale observations derived from an objective analysis such as kriging within the product model grid cells each approach has its advantages and disadvantages brown et al 2008 in this study the evaluation is conducted at an equivalent spatial scale by resampling the precipitation products onto the 23 subcatchment areas of the arb fig 1 which may mitigate the variations in spatial resolution among the products table 1 and is also consistent with the hydrological interests of this study the subcatchment scale precipitation for each gridded product is the average precipitation from the grid cells falling within the subcatchment boundary as shown in fig 1 similarly the reference precipitation for each subcatchment is the average of the station measurements falling within the subcatchment area we also investigated the verification using the nearest neighbor approach or against the inverse distance weighting method based gridded analysis not discussed here and found that the relative performance of the precipitation products was not sensitive to the spatial match approach changes in the resampling approach have little impact on our general conclusions regarding the overall performance of the various products 3 results and discussion 3 1 verification of precipitation products with categorical scores to compute the categorical verification scores wet precipitation occurrence days need to be discriminated from dry days using specified precipitation intensity thresholds brown et al 2008 in this study the ets and fbi scores are calculated with respect to different thresholds to examine the ability of the precipitation products to capture occurrence and frequency of different precipitation intensities fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of ets scores over the arb the results are based upon the precipitation data from all seasons i e annual scores with respect to precipitation thresholds of 1 5 10 and 20 mm day respectively the utilization of these thresholds is generally consistent with the wmo s recommendation brown et al 2008 as expected the scores vary with the precipitation intensity threshold overall ets decreases as the precipitation threshold increases which reflects the difficulties in analysis of heavy precipitation given a threshold capa typically provides the best ets with merra 2 and era5 following as a collective second best while the ets scores for jra 55 and nldas 2 precipitation are usually the lowest typically best ets scores are observed over the northeastern arb with the exception of nldas 2 where the ets score are highest in the southern usa portion of the basin the remarkable north south ets contrast in nldas 2 precipitation may reflect the influence of different data sources used across the canada us border in the data set narr precipitation over canada and the cpc gauge analysis over conus fig 3 shows the summarized ets scores by pooling the samples from all the arb subcatchments the verification results are stratified by seasons spring summer autumn winter and annual and precipitation intensity thresholds 1 5 10 and 20 mm day the sample sizes of daily precipitation observations are summarized by precipitation rate and season in table 3 in terms of the summarized ets values capa merra 2 and era5 perform better than the other three products across the different precipitation thresholds excluding winter overall jra 55 and nldas 2 provide the lowest ets over the entire arb across different precipitation thresholds and seasons for annual and summer seasons the summarized ets scores from capa are obviously higher than those from other products the differences are statistically significant at a confidence level exceeding 95 based upon a non parametric bootstrap method all precipitation products typically provide higher ets scores in spring and autumn than in summer and winter with the exception that capa exhibits higher ets scores in summer for the lowest threshold 1 mm day used here however with increasing precipitation intensity capa precipitation experiences a substantial reduction in summer ets in summer strong convective precipitation events are more common and due to their localization and spatial complexity generally difficult to capture in a gridded analysis of precipitation although a low density gauge network also has this problem in reality which is then expected to translate into low ets scores for the winter season the summarized scores are not available for the threshold of 20 mm day bottom panel of fig 3 because observed winter daily precipitation rarely exceeds this threshold over the arb table 3 the summarized ets scores are consistently the lowest in winter fig 3 the winter behavior is expected to be adversely affected by a number of factors including i difficulties in measurement and analysis of snowfall ii the smallest sample size of the observed yes events due to the seasonal variation in precipitation intensity table 3 and iii the lowest number of observations used in the precipitation assimilation or adjustment for example for capa lespinas et al 2015 the respective fbi counterparts of figs 2 and 3 are presented in figs 4 and 5 note that the perfect fbi score is 1 for a weak precipitation threshold 1 mm day the fbi annual scores i e from all season data are typically greater than 1 with the largest overestimation of precipitation frequency from jra 55 and especially over the northwestern arb fig 4 the fbi scores typically decrease by crossing the ideal fbi score to below 1 as the precipitation threshold increases from 1 mm day to 20 mm day fig 4 this indicates that the precipitation products typically tend to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation occurrences i e fbi 1 0 but underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation events i e fbi 1 0 consistent with the findings from atmospheric modeling e g mailhot et al 2006 stephens et al 2010 erler and peltier 2016 or gridded analysis e g lespinas et al 2015 the exception is that over the largest subcatchment within the southern arb the fbi scores for heavy precipitation events exceed 1 for all precipitation products fig 4 this may be partially due to the impact of the climatological day difference among the station precipitation measurements reference within the subcatchment section 2 1 reference daily precipitation at eccc and ndawn stations squares and circles in fig 1 is typically with respect to the 24 hr window ending at 1200 utc of the following day whereas the time of daily precipitation observation is typically unknown for the ghcn stations triangles in fig 1 their average within the subcatchment may filter out some heavy precipitation events causing a decrease in observed occurrence frequency and a subsequent fbi greater than 1 in practice the climatological day difference may adversely impact the gridded analysis of precipitation and temperatures e g hutchinson et al 2009 vincent et al 2009 hopkinson et al 2011 the summarized fbi scores from the different products and different seasons consistently exhibit a decrease as the precipitation threshold increases although their transitions from above 1 overestimation to below 1 underestimation occur at different points as indicated in fig 5 for most of the products the transition from overestimation to underestimation typically occurred for a threshold of about 5 10 mm day or even smaller while jra 55 generally provides the highest overestimation of precipitation occurrence frequency and underestimates only very heavy precipitation events 20 mm day underestimation of heavy precipitation events is more pronounced in summer although winter also shows a notable underestimation of strong precipitation occurrence the number of observed yes events for heavy precipitation is much smaller in winter than in other seasons since summer convective precipitation events due to their localization and spatial complexity are generally difficult to accurately capture or are typically underestimated by atmospheric models e g erler 2015 or gridded analysis data sets e g hutchinson et al 2009 capa consistently underestimates precipitation occurrence frequency in summer fig 5 the severity of summer underestimation in capa increases with the precipitation intensity even with only the version 3 2 of capa i e the addition of radar precipitation to capa for july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the summer fbi behavior is similar not shown which is consistent with the finding of fortin et al 2015 on average capa merra 2 and nldas 2 typically provide larger underestimation than the other products for the frequency of summer heavy precipitation 3 2 total precipitation budget and continuous verification scores fig 6 presents the mean annual precipitation budgets at the basin and subbasin scales and the monthly climatology of basin averaged precipitation the multi year averages are calculated over 2002 2015 the arb basin average annual precipitation as indicated by the various datasets with the exception of jra 55 is about 400 500 mm fig 6 middle which is consistent with the 1971 2000 observations brimelow et al 2015 jra 55 is much wetter with annual precipitation about 100 200 mm higher than other datasets at the basin subbasin scale in jra 55 the northwest arb the qu appelle river subbasin receives more annual precipitation than other portions of the basin in contrast other products typically indicate that the northeast parts of the basin the assiniboine river subbasin is wetter in terms of the seasonal pattern of basin averaged precipitation the various datasets are in good agreement fig 6 bottom as expected a large portion of annual precipitation occurred in the warmer seasons may september with june being the wettest and february being the driest months the precipitation difference between the wettest month and the driest month is about 60 70 mm as compared to capa the jra 55 precipitation monthly climatology is wetter throughout the annual cycle whereas others nldas 2 era interim merra 2 and era5 are typically wetter in summer and drier in winter leading to the overall agreement between them and capa for the mean annual precipitation fig 6 middle fig 7 shows bias in mean daily precipitation analysis for the six precipitation products with respect to mean daily precipitation observation over each of the arb subcatchments within each season the mean daily precipitation fields both analysis and observation are derived from 2002 2015 in terms of long term average with the exception of the summer season and the jra 55 product bias in the precipitation analysis field is typically close to 0 or slightly wet for most of the subcatchments capa severely underestimates summer precipitation amounts i e negative bias over the arb this is consistent with the fbi behavior of capa in summer fig 5 the fbi results demonstrate that the summer dry bias in capa is mainly attributed to underestimation of heavy precipitation even with only the radar version of capa i e version 3 2 from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 the notable summer dry bias is not mitigated discussed later fortin et al 2015 also indicated that the additional assimilation of radar precipitation in capa did not change its summer fbi the underestimation of summer precipitation is also seen in merra 2 and nldas 2 for the northwest portions of the basin and in era interim over the southern arb fig 7 jra 55 had a positive bias of precipitation for all seasons the largest wet bias in jra 55 typically occurred in the northwestern arb fig 7 it is important to note that the seasonal and spatial biases exhibited among the precipitation products are expected to translate into biases in simulated hydrographs when these products are used to force hydrologic models for example capa driven hydrologic modeling typically underestimated the flood events as seen in boluwade et al 2018 over the arb and the northern great plains the substantial surface water discharge typically occurs between april september during summer it can be expected that at the basin scale hydrologic analyses forced by jra 55 would have the highest stream discharge whereas capa would be expected to have the lowest stream discharge fig 6 over the southern arb on average the nldas 2 merra 2 and era5 data sets would have comparably higher discharge fig 7 within the northern arb on average the capa and nldas 2 precipitation data sets would be expected to result in substantially lower estimates of stream discharge during summer fig 7 for terrestrial hydrologic analysis focused on the autumn season it would be expected that capa merra 2 and nldas 2 would show similar stream discharge rates that are somewhat lower that era5 and era interim and considerably lower than jra55 fig 8 provides the summarized continuous verification scores from the arb subcatchments the behavior of the summarized me mean error scores is consistent with the bias analysis for the mean daily precipitation fields fig 7 although annual me in capa is close to zero capa typically has an underestimation of summer precipitation and an overestimation of winter precipitation the mean summer bias of around 0 50 mm day fig 8 generally agrees with the performance of the 2009 2012 capa throughout canada lespinas et al 2015 possible explanations for precipitation underestimation in summer capa include i summer convective precipitation systems due to their small scale and spatial complexity are typically difficult to accurately capture or are underestimated by rdps forecasts the background field of capa ii the number of precipitation observation stations merged into capa is very small over the arb region lespinas et al 2015 jra 55 is consistently the wettest additionally on average merra 2 and nldas 2 also underestimate precipitation in summer while era5 and era interim provide a substantial overestimation of spring precipitation mae and rmse are the largest in summer and the smallest in winter showing their sensitivity to precipitation intensity and errors fig 8 middle capa typically has the smallest mae and rmse excluding winter while merra 2 precipitation generally leads to the second smallest mae and rmse we present in fig 9 scatterplots of the observed daily precipitation reference versus the various analysis products for the annual season capa era5 and merra 2 relative to other products under evaluation show better linear relationships with observations reference data precipitation products typically have a better correlation with the reference data in spring and autumn than in summer and winter fig 8 bottom panel similar to the seasonal behavior of ets within each season capa typically excluding after merra 2 in winter relative to other products under evaluation shows a better correlation coefficient in summer the correlation coefficient r of capa is significantly higher than that for other products jra 55 and nldas 2 typically relative to other products exhibited weaker correlation with the reference data as mentioned above in the summer season although capa provides the largest underestimation bias mae and rmse correlation coefficient r are remarkably lower higher for capa statistically significant at a confidence level greater than 99 than for other products this may indicate that the smaller underestimation or even overestimation of summer mean precipitation in other products is not due to a better capture of convective precipitation other products also typically severely underestimate the observed convective systems but they additionally generate more notable precipitation events that are not observed or detected by daily sampling i e more false alarms therefore their mean errors me may show smaller underestimation or even overestimation but their performance is inferior to capa regarding the ets mae rmse and correlation for the winter season capa did not exhibit an obvious advantage relative to others which may be related to the fact that less observations are assimilated into capa in winter that in other seasons lespinas et al 2015 as discussed above capa on average severely underestimated summer precipitation the underestimation is related to the scale and spatial complexity of summer convective precipitation systems weather radars hold the advantage of detecting and tracking meso micro scale convective precipitation systems e g xu et al 2005 2006 which are difficult to capture with sparsely distributed rain gauges in this study the version 3 2 capa from july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 includes the assimilation of radar precipitation the verification scores summarized from this period i e july 1 2012 to december 31 2015 are compared with those from the period without the radar assimilation in capa i e january 1 2002 to june 30 2012 in fig 10 although the arb is fully covered by the canadian radar network fortin et al 2015 the summer underestimation in capa is not significantly improved by the radar precipitation assimilation fig 10 top panel this is similar to the fbi analysis in fortin et al 2015 the mae rmse and correlation r results fig 10 middle and bottom panels also do not show the added benefit from the assimilation of radar precipitation the possible reason is that radar quantitative precipitation estimation often suffers from a number of factors such as an inappropriate reflectivity rainfall rate relationship range degradation and bright band contamination e g xu et al 2008 2014 zhang et al 2008 further radar data quality control and bias correction are required to improve the effectiveness of the radar precipitation assimilation in capa for this region fig 10 also indicates that the merging of the two time periods 2002 to 2010 and 2010 to 2015 has little impact on the overall performance of the capa product 3 3 total liquid water flux analysis for spring and early summer snowmelt plays a critically important role in the spring and early summer flood events over the arb e g brimelow et al 2015 furthermore it is the total liquid water flux tlwf i e sum of liquid precipitation and snowmelt that is the dominant controlling factor for potential biases in the spring early summer hydrological simulations of the arb region accordingly it is important to compare tlwf from the various data sets in order to understand how variability among precipitation products may influence the spring early summer terrestrial hydrologic analysis the methodologies upon which tlwf is calculated are presented as follows for nldas 2 the tlwf is calculated by summing the liquid precipitation and water equivalent snowmelt from the nldas 2 hourly noah data set for era interim era5 and merra 2 each data set provides the water equivalent snowmelt total precipitation and water equivalent snowfall making it straightforward to estimate their tlwf i e total precipitation minus snowfall and then plus snowmelt for jra 55 the daily tlwf is estimated by combining its daily total precipitation and daily changes in snow water equivalent swe capa provides only the total precipitation and the tlwf for capa is estimated as follows capa precipitation is identified as snowfall if the mean daily surface air temperature which in this case is taken from merra 2 the merra 2 temperature data set outperforms other temperature data sets over the arb based upon a comparison against station observations is lower than 0 c and liquid precipitation otherwise snow if any accumulates on the ground after a small fraction i e the sublimation rate of snowfall is deducted to account for the possible sublimation and wind effects the degree day method e g rango and martinec 1995 due to its relatively low data input requirements is then used to estimate the daily snowmelt a physically based energy balance approach is not suitable because measurements of the variables required for the method are not available here initially the sublimation rate was specified as 10 and the degree day ratios seasonally varying were following the wmo s recommendation rango and martinec 1995 table 1 therein these coefficients are then adjusted so that the resulting snowmelt and swe on the ground are generally consistent at the basin scale with the snow data assimilation system snodas data at nsidc https nsidc org data g02158 the tlwf for capa is then the sum of liquid precipitation and the estimated snowmelt changes in the methodology may significantly affect the day to day tlwf estimation because daily snowmelt is hard to estimate however the average daily tlwf within the season period which is presented in this study is little impacted by changes in the methodology to be consistent with the major snowmelt period of the arb we calculated the average daily tlwf values at a subcatchment scale from the various data sets for spring to early summer april june which are presented in fig 11 the april to june averages are taken from the climatology 2002 to 2015 and the three flood years 2011 2013 and 2014 respectively in terms of daily tlwf climatology see fig 11 1 st column at the basin scale jra 55 is again the wettest while merra 2 is the driest in terms of the spatial pattern on average jra 55 presents wetter tlwf in the west northwest part of the basin in contrast other products typically indicate that the west southwest portion is drier than other areas in the basin accordingly in terms of the spring early summer hydrological analysis and modeling it can be expected that on average jra 55 would have the highest stream discharge as compared to the lowest flow for merra 2 as expected the spring early summer tlwf values and their spatial patterns from the various data sets exhibit substantial year to year variations fig 11 for example during the 2011 spring and early summer see fig 11 2nd column wetter tlwf values are typically observed over the southern and northeastern portions of the basin than over the northwestern part era5 jra 55 and capa produced higher tlwf than other data sets the spring and early summer of 2013 see fig 11 3rd column is spatially similar to but notably drier than that of 2011 and merra 2 and jra 55 provide the respective lowest and highest tlwf during this time frame the 2014 spring early summer see fig 11 4th column is spatially different from the 2011 2013 equivalent the quantified year to year variability among the various tlwf data will help characterize sources of uncertainty for hydro climatological analysis for these flood events e g brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 4 summary and conclusions in this work six sets of state of the art gridded total precipitation products were evaluated over the arb the main findings are as follows i precipitation products typically perform better in spring and autumn than in summer and winter over the arb which is in contrast with the claims of wong et al 2017 based upon the evaluation over the whole canada ii the investigated precipitation products typically tend to overestimate the frequency of weak precipitation occurrences and underestimate the frequency of strong precipitation events this is common in weather and climate models where precipitation is typically produced more frequently and lightly associated with the model convective parameterizations than observed e g stephens et al 2010 erler and peltier 2016 however different products and different seasons have different transition points from overestimation to underestimation iii overall capa performs best except for a severe underestimation of mean summer precipitation merra 2 is the second best merra 2 and nldas 2 also underestimated mean summer precipitation amounts but to a lesser degree than capa capa and merra 2 typically hold better ability to capture the temporal variability of precipitation occurrence jra 55 and nldas 2 typically relative to other products exhibited weaker time correspondence to the reference which is translated into lower ets and larger rmse the fairly low overall performance of the nldas 2 precipitation product was impacted by its different data sources across the canada united states border the era5 precipitation typically performed better than the era interim precipitation reflecting the latest improvement in the era series jra 55 had the lowest performance with a considerable wet bias throughout all seasons the spatial and seasonal variations among the various precipitation datasets will impact the performance of hydro climatological analysis or hydrological simulations the verification results from this study can provide important guidance for the bias correction and the objective selection of gridded precipitation products for driving hydrological models or other hydro climatological related tasks in the arb further the water and energy budgets of the arb are governed by the complex interactions between the atmosphere and prairie surface features e g the presence of many potholes formed by glaciation the basin represents many of the hydro climatological complexities e g brimelow et al 2015 szeto et al 2015 associated with the northern region of the great plains and the canada united states prairie region the quantified precipitation variability among these products will help characterize sources of uncertainty for hydro climatological analyses in these regions or similar basins e g the saskatchewan river basin and the mackenzie river basin in canada it is also well known that the gauge only gridded analysis of daily precipitation is one of the most important products used for hydrological studies currently the gauge only gridded precipitation products typically cover conus alone e g the cpc unified gauge based analysis and prism climate products or canada only e g the nrcan daily product in this study this type of precipitation products were not evaluated since the study basin straddles the canada united states border our evaluation will be updated as new products become available e g the nrcan daily precipitation product covering both canada and the united states is being under construction future work also involves hydrological

8429,study region garonne basin france study focus this study analyses water mass variations for the whole garonne basin 50 000 km2 drainage area to do so total water storage anomalies twsa from seven global solutions based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission measurements 300 km spatial resolution are inter compared with twsa from two hydrological models safran isba modcou sim and soil and water assessment tool swat between january 2003 and december 2010 new hydrological insights for the region despite the small size of the garonne basin compared to grace spatial resolution good agreement between grace solutions and hydrological model twsa has been found maximum correlation coefficient 0 9 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 7 these datasets showed that twsa in the garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer to a smaller extent snow also influences garonne twsa open surface water twsa is quite small and twsa from deep aquifer is negligible the most important drought period occurred in 2011 2012 due to low precipitation during the two hydrological years and etr close to previous years important precipitation in 2013 2014 helps to refill the water stocks this study also showed that grace and models mismatches should be due to grace poor spatial resolution but also to its monthly time resolution rarely shown in previous studies keywords garonne grace hydrological model basin water balance cross validation grace spatial resolution 1 introduction studying the water cycle at global and regional scale requires a set of observation tools and models to estimate water and energy stored in different compartments of the water cycle i e atmosphere continental surfaces and oceans and their fluxes over continents it is also important to know water stocks and their variations at the watershed scale and seasonal to multi annual time scales for planning required actions from water managers to satisfy water and energy needs by human population within the basin traditionally it is done with in situ measurements of river discharge water table for ground water snow depth etc these data remain the most precise and accurate measurements available however they are only partial measurement of all water fluxes within a watershed as gauge network are at best heterogeneous in space and time pavelsky et al 2014 since few decades some remote sensing sensors have proven their capabilities to complement in situ measurements and or provide estimates of variables not measured in situ lettenmaier et al 2015 especially the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched in 2002 can be used to estimate total water storage change variations at coarse spatial resolution 300 km and monthly time scale to get homogenous estimates of these fluxes in space and time hydrological models have been developed during the last decades to compute water storage dynamic and fluxes within river watersheds döll et al 2016 however these numerical models are inherently limited by the implemented physical processes the approximation of the chosen equations to model these processes the numerical approximation used to compute solutions to these equations uncertainties in the parameters of the models and in the boundary conditions used as model inputs döll et al 2016 nowadays in situ and satellite observations are commonly used to calibrate validate and even correct models outputs or and parameters lettenmaier et al 2015 estimating the total water storage variations within watershed remains a difficult task as hydrological models are often validated or calibrated only for some variables more frequently against in situ river discharge sometimes using satellite estimates of snow extent or less frequently against water table in situ measurements but not for all variables and storage compartments the use of both grace data and hydrological modeling at watershed scale can help 1 to cross validate a combination of hydrology model outputs and 2 to identify modeled compartment s where the most important variations are occurring however due to grace coarse spatial resolution many previous studies using grace data considered watershed with drainage area much higher than 100 000 km2 e g wouters et al 2014 it is not sure that grace data could be used for medium size river basins like the garonne basin located in south west of france 50 000 km2 drainage area the present study investigates the potential of grace data for this kind of basin especially it focuses on the following two questions how to estimate and validate total water storage variations over the medium size garonne basin using grace data and hydrological model outputs at monthly scale in which hydrology compartments those monthly variations are the most important they are addressed in the following sections which present the study domain section 2 1 grace products section 2 2 and hydrological models inputs and outputs sections 2 3 used the methodology applied to tackle these two questions section 2 4 and finally the results obtained section 3 2 study basin data used and methodology 2 1 garonne basin the study focuses on the garonne river basin fig 1 which is one of the principal fluvial systems in france mainland and located in the southwest of the country the basin black polygon on fig 1 drains 50 000 km² at tonneins the last gauging station uninfluenced by the tidal action 120 km upstream the estuary its watershed consists of three main geographic entities the pyrenees mountains to the south with some peeks exceeding 3000 m the plateau of the massif central to the northeast between 1400 and 1700 m and the plain between them whose elevation is less than a few hundred metres the basin is also at the boundary of different climate zones the mediterranean climate in the east of the basin is characterized by hot and dry southeastern winds the garonne basin near its estuary is impacted by an oceanic climate with western winds causing high precipitation and cool temperatures watershed flows are impacted by these weather conditions especially flows in the central part of the basin are generated by precipitation over the massif central and the pyrenees mountains the average annual precipitation is around 900 mm y 1 over the basin according to https donneespubliques meteofrance fr upstream garonne and ariege rivers discharges during spring are highly influenced by snowmelt from the pyrenees mountains caballero et al 2007 at the outlet of the basin tonneins according to the national gauge measurements database banque hydro http www hydro eaufrance fr the average discharge between 1913 and 2018 is equal to 598 m3 s 1 the highest discharge on record reached 5700 m3 s 1 march 5th 1930 and the lowest 37 5 m3 s 1 august 4th 1989 the hydrological year goes from october to september of the subsequent year monthly discharge is maximum in february 1913 2018 mean 970 m3 s 1 and minimum in august 1913 2018 mean 177 m3 s 1 according to the corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 the mountainous regions are dominated by forest and alpine grassland 37 of the watershed while the plain is dominated by agricultural activities 60 the remaining land is either artificialized land 2 5 or water bodies 0 5 cambisols are the most frequent soil classes covering 55 of the total area and spreading across the watershed different classes of shallow soils are also present in the upper part of the watershed 19 such as lithosols regosols andosols rendzinas and rankers luvisols cover 18 of the watershed mostly on hillsides and in the plain the garonne river mostly flows on fluvisols 7 influence of human activities on monthly discharge values are not transmitted to the downstream hydrologic regime significantly and remain contained in the upper part of the basin grusson et al 2017a 2 2 grace satellites measurements 2 2 1 grace mission the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace is a national aeronautics and space administration nasa and deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr satellite mission to map the global earth gravity field every 30 days tapley et al 2004 it is composed of two twin satellites following each other 220 km apart as the orbit of each satellite is determined by the earth gravity field local variations of this field will affect the satellites motion slightly differently and therefore the distance between them that is why the distance between the two satellites is constantly monitored on board and is then converted by different processing centers to earth gravity field variations called grace solutions for more information and reviews on grace see for example wouters et al 2014 if the principle of grace measurements is quite simple in practice the inversion process is complex and source of multiple errors some grace solutions are computed as stokes coefficients of spherical harmonic functions it is widely assumed that grace solutions should observe physical phenomena with a spatial resolution of about 300 km due to the satellites orbit altitude instrument accuracy the maximum degree of spherical harmonics used and the spatial scale of the filters applied to grace measurements at different processing steps e g landerer and swenson 2012 wouters et al 2014 scanlon et al 2016 most if not all processing centers now provide their solutions rather in spherical harmonic coefficients or recomputed on regular geographic grid because of the different hypotheses and approaches used to inverse gravity fields from grace satellites distance measurements currently available solutions are not identical to get sufficient spatial coverage by the satellite measurements are often integrated over a month to do the inversion wouters et al 2014 even if sub monthly solutions have recently been made available e g kurtenbach et al 2012 ramillien et al 2015 grace satellites are on a quasi polar orbit with an 89 inclination at an altitude around 500 km allowing a global coverage of continental surfaces the satellites were launched simultaneously march 17 2002 the total mission lifetime largely exceeded the initially planned 5 years lifetime as the mission ended science operations in october 2017 https www jpl nasa gov news news php feature 6984 due to a battery failure on one satellite yet since 2011 issue with satellites batteries has led the mission team to collect data only when the sun is positioned favorably to the solar arrays wouters et al 2014 therefore gaps in grace time series are quite important since then there had also been some few missing measurements before 2011 especially in the early times of the mission 2 2 2 grace data used in hydrology and uncertainties at the monthly to interannual time scales observed by the mission variations of earth gravity field can be attributed mainly to redistribution of water in its fluid envelope e g tapley et al 2004 wouters et al 2014 therefore grace solutions are also provided as total water storage tws anomalies twsa at monthly time scale it corresponds to the sum of all water mass variations at the continents surface and in the soil i e the sum of snow water equivalent surface water soil water and groundwater chen et al 2016 grace solutions have been widely used to compute at basin and subbasin scale twsa for big river watersheds like the amazon congo or mekong basins to cite a few see for example wouters et al 2014 for a review these observations have had a wide range of applications in continental hydrology since the last decade to validate improve hydrological models e g niu and yang 2006 correct model s outputs with data assimilation techniques e g zaitchik et al 2008 compute basin scale water budget in combination with other products e g gao et al 2010 estimate groundwater storage change using independent computation of soil and snow water storage variations see chen et al 2016 for a review or investigate trends in tws and their relationships with climate variability and human activities rodell et al 2018 grace data near its spatial resolution limit 300 km has important signal to noise ratio as the noise increase with degrees of the spherical harmonic decomposition toward higher spatial resolution processing centers reduce noise level by applying smoothing filters which tend to reduce and smooth the amplitude of the water mass variations besides because of the processing treatments and the truncation of the spherical harmonic degree grace tws suffers of leakage effects i e water mass tends to be spatially spread and can leak toward nearby other water mass longuevergne et al 2010 wouters et al 2014 because of the orbit orientation grace measurements are more sensitive to variation of mass in the satellite along track north south at low mid latitudes direction than the ones in the across track i e east west direction leading to stripes in the initial release of grace solutions some destriping algorithms have then been developed to significantly reduce this source of error which in turn tend to affect the amplitude of the signal and spatial resolution wouters et al 2014 ancillary data are needed by processing centers to invert twsa over continents like atmosphere and ocean models outputs glacial isostatic adjustment gia model s which have their own source of uncertainties finally long et al 2017 analyzed sixty river basins in the world and found more disparity in twsa trend for medium basins area 200 000 km2 than for bigger ones indicating that differences in grace solutions are more likely to be observed for medium and small watersheds that s why it remains unsure that grace measurements can provide useful data for a 50 000 km2 basin like the garonne river basin 2 2 3 grace solutions seven publicly available monthly global grace solutions have been considered in this study downloaded products correspond to liquid water equivalent thickness in centimeters on regular grid the three first solutions are the grace tellus land release rl05 monthly mass 1 x1 grids available at https grace jpl nasa gov data

retrieved twsa amplitude to overcome this issue landerer and swenson 2012 computed a global grid of time invariant scaling factors using clm4 global hydrological model outputs these scaling factors have been applied to the three solutions in our study hereinafter these solutions are labeled csr gfz and jpl respectively the fourth solution corresponds to grace lageos equivalent water heights 1 x1

solutions release 03 lemoine et al 2016 this solution is labeled grgs in the following sections finally the three last solutions correspond to so called global mascons solutions contrarily to the previous solutions mascons solutions parameterize the earth gravity field using regional mass concentration functions which has some advantages like the decrease of ocean land leakage scanlon et al 2016 the mascons solutions have been computed by csr over a 0 5 x0 5 grid version 1 save et al 2016 nasa goddard space flight center gsfc 1 x1 grid version 2 2 luthcke et al 2013 loomis and luthcke

grace tellus land solutions csr jpl mascon solutions twsa has been computed over january 2004 to december 2009 time span for grgs solution and gsfc mascon solution the mean removed has been computed over january 2004 to december 2015 and over january 2003 to december 2012 time periods respectively furthermore gia corrections have not been considered as gia is negligible on the garonne basin guo et al 2012 fig 1 shows the 1 x1 grid used by most solutions yellow lines correspond to portions of the grid that lie within the studied garonne basin as the intrinsic grace spatial resolution is actually coarser than 1 x1 this figure shows how small the basin is compared to grace resolution this issue is highlighted in many grace solutions documentations for example the csr mascon documentation clearly states that the users must exercise caution when using these solutions in basins smaller than approximately 200 000 km2 moreover these solutions should be used to perform basin level time series analysis and never be used for analysis at a single grid point 2 3 hydrological models this study inter compared twsa from seven global grace solutions with twsa from two hydrological models safran isba modcou sim and soil and water assessment tool swat between 2003 and 2010 sim and swat are the only two operational distributed and physically based hydrological models currently deployed over the garonne watershed that can simulate the different compartments of the water cycle 2 3 1 climate forcing dataset in this study climate dataset used to force the hydrological models comes from the système d analyse fournissant des renseignements a la neige safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 analysis system raimonet et al 2017 have shown that safran currently provides the best estimate of near surface variables over france compared to other existing datasets especially reconstruction of the liquid and solid precipitation fields benefits from the high density network of meteo france local measurements moreover grusson et al 2017a showed that using safran dataset in a hydrological modeling of the garonne basin led to better performances safran performs an analysis of near surface variables by optimal interpolation oi on homogeneous climatic areas i e without strong horizontal climatic gradient the oi method combines upper air atmospheric analysis and in situ observations to calculate the best estimate of total daily precipitation and 6 hly 2 meter air temperature and humidity 10 meter wind speed downward solar and infrared radiation these analyzed variables are then interpolated in space on an 8km mesh regular grid to better take into account topography and in time at an hourly time step more detailed description of safran analyses can be found in durand et al 1993 and quintana seguí et al 2008 safran analyses are computed from 1958 onwards vidal et al 2010 fig 2 shows safran 2000 2014 mean annual total precipitation in south west of france the two hydrological models used in this study which were forced with safran datasets are described in the following sections 2 3 2 sim model safran isba modcou sim is a combination of a meteorological analysis system safran a land surface model interaction soil biosphere atmosphere isba noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 and a hydrogeological model modèle couplé modcou ledoux et al 1989 david et al 2011 it is used operationally at meteo france to monitor water resources over the french territory and can therefore be used to forecast flood risk and to monitor drought risks sim simulates energy and water budgets river discharge and height of the water table in presence of aquifers over natural areas isba land surface model computes water storage based on input safran total precipitation and modeled total evaporation surface runoff and soil infiltration total evaporation is composed of plant evapotranspiration evaporation of bare soil evaporation of water intercepted by the vegetation and snow and ice sublimation the partitioning of local precipitation into runoff and infiltration is parameterized following dümenil and todini 1992 runoff is routed by the modcou surface routing network towards the river network häfliger et al 2015 soil infiltration is diffused through the soil layers up to the vegetation root depth and contributes to the soil water storage and can contribute to aquifers water supply when they are simulated which is not the case in the garonne basin in the current version of the isba model the soil is discretized into 14 layers resulting in a total depth of 12 m the vertical discretization bottom depth of each layer in meters is the following 0 01 0 04 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 5 2 3 5 8 12 as described in decharme et al 2013 the heat transfer is solved over the total depth whereas the moisture transfer is solved over the root depth only which depends on the vegetation types concerning the input data apart from the safran climate dataset sim needs parameters that define the garonne basin in terms of natural ecosystems orography and soil texture for that purpose the ecoclimap database faroux et al 2013 is used to represent land cover at a 1 km horizontal resolution among the hundreds of ecosystems available in ecoclimap vegetation in the model is represented by only 12 plant functional types pfts combining several ecosystems the orography is derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 90 meters farr et al 2007 upscaled at 1 km resolution to be consistent with the ecosystems representation soil texture at 1 km resolution comes from the harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2012 it is used to define model parameters that depend on clay or sand concentration like the field capacity or wilting point soil moisture contents which are commonly used to define thresholds between which plants evapotranspirate at potential rate or are stressed due to a lack of water the evapotranspiration is calculated based on the isba a gs module calvet et al 1998 where a simplified photosynthesis module is applied to represent the exchanges of water and carbon dioxide at the leaf scale a realistic representation of the snowpack behavior is required to accurately represent snow accumulation and melting which are key components of the water cycle especially in mountainous areas for that purpose snow is parameterized using boone and etchevers 2001 explicit multi layer snow model this model has demonstrated its ability to simulate accurately the main snow processes such as the freezing of water that would have percolated within the snow due to surface melting or liquid precipitation surface runoff parameterization requires the calibration of one single parameter b representing the slope of the retention curve the higher b the faster water runs off this parameter was setup uniformly for the garonne basin in the sim operational set up although no specific calibration was made in the current study whether for the land surface model isba or the hydrogeological model modcou the parameters of this latter that were calibrated over the 1974 1982 period boukerma 1987 were not modified table 1 sums up sim input parameters and forcing sources and validation datasets used for this study 2 3 3 swat model soil and water assessment tool swat is a hydro agro environmental model for river and watershed studies jointly developed by usda agricultural research service usda ars and texas a m agrilife research from texas a m university swat is a public domain model which simulate quantity and quality of surface and ground water and predict environmental impact of human practices like agriculture point source dams it has been widely used to simulate distributed hydrology variables at a watershed scale gassman et al 2007 the model is based on hydrologic response units hru aggregated at subbasin level a hru is characterized by a topography slope and soil and land use combination within a subbasin the swat model integrates soil types and properties land cover and agriculture management including automatic irrigation and fertilization where water and fertilizer are applied to avoid plant stress hrus are the base unit to compute the water balance which is composed of four compartments snow soil shallow aquifer and deep aquifer fluxes between these compartments correspond to the following hydrological processes infiltration runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation computation is performed at the hru level and routed within the river network to downstream subbasins down to the outlet the project has been set up with arcswat version 10 4 19 a gis based graphical interface based on arcmap 10 4 helping users to define hrus and generate the associated input files for swat2012 version olivera et al 2006 swat documentation available online explained the theory and details of hydrologic processes integrated in swat model neitsch et al 2009 concerning the input data all swat input files are listed in table 1 the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem tachikawa et al 2011 from nasa and the ministry of economy trade and industry meti of japan available on 90 m global grid was chosen to delineate the watershed and compute the river system land uses are from the corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 map with a 100 m resolution and the soil data originate from the european soil database eea 2007 with a 1 km resolution map soil properties have been adjusted by expertise the swat model setup includes 52 different types of soil over the watershed each soil consists in 1 to 4 layers according each type of soil each layer having a depth of 10 to 1400 cm and its own layer characteristics from these land use soil databases and watershed topography 22 land use 13 soil and 5 slope classes were defined in swat with these classes swat model identified 1320 subbasins with 12 834 hrus for the hrus definition we selected only classes which occupy at least 10 on the subbasin to avoid anecdotal classes the safran atmospheric fields see section 2 3 1 have been used to force swat river discharge observations used for calibration and validation come from banque hydro database monthly stream flow data from 20 selected gauging stations including the outlet tonneins along the river network were used to calibrate and validate the model the selection was made to sample all the hydrology and catchment diversity in soil land use and climate conditions as proposed by grusson et al 2017a for each step validation and calibration three years of initialization are performed the swat model was calibrated over ten years from 2000 to 2010 and validated on the available previous period from 1980 to 1997 calibration procedure are based on previous set up of the model over the same watershed grusson et al 2017a b grusson et al 2015 same sensitive parameters have been considered and the calibrated values from those previous studies have been used as first guess in our calibration procedure as the spatial definition subwatershed and hru is slightly different in the present version of the model calibration has been manually adjusted this manual adjustment was based on watershed characteristics bibliography and expertise 2 3 4 models evaluation the evaluation of sim and swat models performances has been conducted using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 by comparing simulation and observation at monthly and daily time step for swat and sim respectively nse range between minus infinite and 1 a nse of 1 indicates a perfect fit between observation and simulation a value of 0 indicates that the simulation produced by the model is equivalent to the average of the observed data a negative value indicates very poor agreement between simulation and observation for each model an estimation of the bias is also conducted to estimate if discharges are overestimated or underestimated by models concerning sim it was run for the period 1958 2016 over france and was spun up by repeating twice the first year sim evaluation against daily measured discharges was performed over the garonne basin for 34 gauging stations available in the banque hydro database and located along the garonne river and its main tributaries in addition to the nse and in order to investigate over underestimation percent bias pbias has been computed one minus the ration between modeled discharge and in situ discharge it measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts the optimal value of pbias is 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 on average over the entire basin sim gives satisfactory results with an averaged nse of 0 55 and a pbias of 0 04 fig 3 a shows the percentage of sim pixels containing in situ stations as a function of nse 75 of pixels with stations have an nse greater than 0 5 which can be considered as a rather good result moreover more than 50 of pixels have a nse greater than 0 6 which shows the good agreement between sim and in situ measurements pbias fig 3 b indicates that for one third of the stations sim tend to overestimate discharge whereas for one fourth of the stations sim tends to underestimate discharge on average sim is unbiased for the swat model the nash and pbias are calculated for monthly discharge at 20 different gauging stations spread over the watershed see fig 4 the stations have been selected to encompass the diversity of hydrological regime existing over the watershed a soft calibration was led to calibrate the swat model based on previous studies and the expertise of specialists grusson et al 2017a and grusson et al 2017b performed parameters sensitivity analysis over 20 gauging stations within the garonne watershed the uncertainty analysis was done using the swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup tool which is based on the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm all sources of uncertainties driving variables conceptual model parameters measured data were considered uncertainties in the model output variables are driven by parameters uncertainties which can be expressed as the 95 probability distribution also named 95ppu 95 prediction uncertainty to get the best performance the 95ppu envelop has to capture most of observation values and have a small spread in order to evaluate 95ppu performance two statistics are used p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2012 p factor is the percentage of observed data enveloped by our modeling and need to be over 70 to consider a good discharge modeling r factor represents the thickness of the 95ppu envelop and need to be around 1 fig 5 illustrates the 95ppu intervals of simulation and observation during calibration and validation period at the outlet of the basin in this case 73 of observed monthly values were within 95ppu area and r factor is equal 0 66 an average nse value of 0 76 was obtained for the calibration period 2000 2010 table 2 presents nse and pbias for the 20 gauges the rank of nash and pbias evaluation is given according the ranking proposed by moriasi et al 2007 and based on monthly discharge evaluation for the calibration period 14 out of the 20 stations show good to very good performances table 2 only four stations show unsatisfactory performances with an overall average nse of 0 70 the positive pbias indicates that like the sim model swat model tends to globally overestimate the volume of water performances remain steady over the validation period with a good to very good model performance at 14 out of 20 stations table 2 still 4 stations are presenting nse below 0 5 these four stations are not necessarily the same than the four gauges with the lowest nse during the calibration period two stations presenting unsatisfactory results during the calibration are performing well during the validation period the overall tendency of the model is also to overestimate the volume of water compared to observations 2 4 grace and hydrological models cross validation methodology as presented in previous sections on one side grace data are quite coarse and its capability to observe twsa over the garonne basin is questionable on the other side sim and swat hydrological modeling of the basin are the two only operational distributed and physically based hydrological models currently deployed over the garonne watershed and some compartments of their mass budget cannot be validated based on in situ data alone therefore and as stated in the introduction the purpose of this study is to compare grace solutions and sim swat models outputs in order to cross validate them and to compute a hydrology water balance at the garonne basin scale the following sections present the methodology used to compare and cross validate grace twsa with sim and swat twsa section 2 4 1 and to compute garonne basin water balance section 2 4 2 2 4 1 grace and hydrological models outputs comparisons twsa from grace are computed by selecting all pixels that lie even partially in the garonne basin then for each of these pixels grace solutions liquid water equivalent thicknesses are multiplied by the area of the pixel portion which intersects the basin polygon to compute pixel twsa in m3 then all pixels twsa are summed to get grace twsa over the whole basin for each grace solution time series its time mean over the time period january 2003 to december 2010 is removed this removal is needed as the reference of twsa is not common for all solutions see section 2 2 3 and this time period has very few missing grace measurements as explained in section 2 2 1 modeled twsa are computed in three steps first for each pixel liquid water equivalent volumes stored in all modeled hydrology compartments are summed for sim these compartments correspond to snow water intercepted by the vegetation river network and all soil layers for swat they correspond to snow river network all soil layers shallow aquifer connected to the river and the deep confined aquifer then tws of all pixels within the basin are summed weighted by the proportion of pixels area within the basin polygon finally the mean of this sum between january 2003 and december 2010 for consistency with garonne grace twsa time series is removed to obtain twsa for the whole basin quantitative comparison between monthly grace solutions and monthly hydrological models outputs has been performed only from january 2003 to december 2010 time span as before and after grace time series have important gaps for all datasets the mean annual cycle has also been computed for each month january to december the mean twsa is computed for all corresponding month between 2003 and 2010 time series without the mean annual cycle have also been calculated for each month the corresponding mean month value has been removed the comparison is done by computing the correlation coefficient and the nse between grace solutions and models full time series their mean annual cycle and time series without their mean annual cycle twsa time series and hydrology budget have been interpreted qualitatively for all datasets over their whole common time period i e august 2002 to july 2014 corresponding to twelve hydrological years hydrological model outputs have also been analyzed to identify the main hydrology compartment s contributing to twsa observed by grace 2 4 2 garonne basin water balance after the intercomparison of all datasets the basin hydrology water balance has been estimated it corresponds to a water mass balance or continuity equation for a closed system translating the fact that variations of tws during a certain period of time is equal to the quantity of water received and lost during that period of time for a watershed water is gained via precipitation p and lost via evapotranspiration sum of the soil evaporation evaporation of the precipitation intercepted by the canopy and the vegetation transpiration this sum is noted etr and water discharge at the outlet of the basin q often approximated to river outflows as aquifer outflows is neglected and not known therefore the generic water balance equation for a watershed is 1 d t w s d t t p t e t r t q t for a hydrological model which provides only discrete estimations of variables in time and space eq 1 can be integrated during the month m whose first and last time steps are noted t1 and t2 respectively and the model numerical time step is noted δt over the n pixels or hru within the watershed eq 2 2 δ t w s m t w s t 2 t w s t 1 s 1 n t t 1 t 2 p s t e t r s t q s t δ t some studies see wouters et al 2014 for a review have used this equation to compare tws change δtws estimated from grace and p etr q from models or from other satellite or in situ observations to rather assess the quality of grace measurements or to get bounds from grace in estimated p etr q however as grace provides mean monthly twsa and not twsa between the first and last day of the month it is not possible to compute directly δtws from grace even if its measurements were perfects grace δtws is often approximated using a twsa difference between two consecutive months in this study we used a second order central difference eq 3 to compute it as it is more numerically stable than forward or backward difference this approximated δtws is noted δ t w s hereafter to clearly show that it is based on monthly average of tws 3 δ t w s m t w s a m 1 t w s a m 1 2 the purpose of this work is to compare δ t w s from grace solutions to the right hand side of eq 2 computed from sim swat models inputs outputs it is done to evaluate the usefulness of grace solutions to provide information for computing the water balance of a basin like the garonne and to assess how p etr and q affect tws variations for the garonne 3 results and discussions 3 1 grace solutions and models outputs cross validation grace solutions and hydrological models twsa time series in m3 over the garonne basin their mean annual cycle 2003 2010 average and twsa without this mean annual cycle time series are presented on fig 6 they show very good agreements between grace solutions and hydrological models fig 6a especially their mean annual cycles fig 6b have similar amplitude and phasing however it should be noted that grace solutions mean annual cycles are 1 month delayed compared to hydrological models grace time series have their maximum values in march except for grgs solution which is in february and minimum values in september whereas for both sim and swat the minimum and maximum occur in february and august respectively times series without their mean annual cycle fig 6c are also quite coherent between satellite and models time series even if grace solutions especially grgs solution have more variations at highest frequencies than hydrological models grgs solution does not apply some post processing smoothing than other solutions use which could explain its more important variability tables 3 and 4 present correlation coefficient and nse computed over 2003 2010 time period between grace solutions and models time series with and without their mean annual cycle respectively as recommended in the grace tellus land documentation statistics for the mean of the three solutions are also provided table 3 shows the overall good agreement between grace solutions and model outputs grgs solution has the lowest correlation and nse 0 77 and 0 27 with sim respectively and 0 79 and 0 32 with swat respectively other solutions have correlation and nse above 0 80 and 0 50 respectively with both sim and swat especially the best comparison is obtained for mascon solutions correlation and nse between csr mascon and sim swat outputs are above 0 90 and 0 80 respectively gsfc mascon is the second solution that best match model outputs with slightly lower coefficients concerning time series without mean annual cycle csr and gsfc mascon also provides the best correlation and nse which are between 0 78 and 0 80 for correlation and 0 33 and 0 54 for nse the jpl mascon solution also compares well to model outputs but with lower coefficients than the two other mascon solutions especially for time series without mean annual cycle overall gsfc mascon seems to provide generally slightly better results than csr mascon but the best correlation coefficient is obtained between csr mascon and sim time series it was expected to get better results with mascon solutions as they decrease leakage errors and are more adapted locally than solution based on spherical harmonics scanlon et al 2016 it is consistent with the results obtained by long et al 2017 over sixty basins worse results were also expected with time series without mean annual cycle table 4 as noise is proportionally more important in these time series than with the ones with the annual cycle these comparisons cross validate grace solutions and model outputs all datasets are quite coherent between themselves even without their mean annual cycle indicating similar interannual variability the mean annual cycles are very close with similar amplitudes but with 1 month delay between grace and hydrological models it shows that grace is actually capable to provide twsa for a 50 000 km2 temperate basin like the garonne basin especially csr mascon and gsfc mascon solutions are the most suitable for this basin similarly these good results seem to indicate that hydrological models have enough physics and good enough forcing data to match independent satellite measurements of twsa quite logically for the garonne basin the mean annual cycle fig 6 b is positive during winter and spring maxima in february march when the precipitation is the highest and negative in summer and autumn minima in august september when the precipitation is at its lowest rate martin et al 2016 fig 6 c shows that twsa on the garonne basin has important interannual variability with high positive twsa hydrological years 2003 2004 and 2013 and low negative twsa years 2005 2006 2008 2011 and 2012 it should also be noted that the most important depletion of tws during the time period occurred in 2012 followed by an important refill of tws during hydrological year 2013 these results complement previously published studies if grace spatial resolution is widely recognized to be around 300 km the minimum size of the river basin to which grace data can be applied has been investigated by few studies rodell et al 2007 investigated the potential to estimate mississippi groundwater mass variations with grace data and soil moisture and snow water equivalent outputs from global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 models they found that they could not retrieve the groundwater seasonal cycle correctly for basins smaller than 900 000 km2 however as highlighted by wouters et al 2014 this study was done with the first release of grace products and rodell et al 2007 considered that the main source of error was due to the grace product itself since then grace data processing has been quite improved and new techniques have been developed to study smaller basins for example longuevergne et al 2010 have developed a methodology to derive grace tws for some basins with drainage area close to mission resolution limit this method has shown improvements on tws estimation for a 200 000 km2 aquifer in the us high plains aquifer compared to grace global solutions lorenz et al 2014 estimated that smaller catchments could be observed as long as the tws annual cycle has important amplitude variations vishwakarma et al 2018 investigated the issue of grace spatial resolution for hydrology studies they demonstrated that if theoretically the spatial resolution is related to the band limit of the spherical harmonic spectrum of the grace datasets in practice because of the noise and corrections applied to grace data the complete band limited signal cannot be retrieved and the spatial resolution of grace cannot be clearly set they estimated that for a catchment size around 63 000 km2 observation error should be at a level of 2 cm in equivalent water height so accuracy around 1 26 km3 of equivalent water volume our results are coherent with lorenz et al 2014 and vishwakarma et al 2018 findings twsa important seasonal and interannual variability is the reason why grace solutions compare well to sim and swat model outputs over the 50 000 km2 garonne basin 3 2 analysis of modeled hydrology compartments contrarily to grace hydrological models provide estimates of water stored in all modeled hydrology compartments fig 7 shows contribution of water stored in all modeled compartments to the 2003 2010 twsa mean annual cycle for sim fig 7 a and swat fig 7 b most twsa is due to soil water among which the shallow aquifer connected to the river stores an important quantity of water according to swat swat deep aquifer contribution to twsa is one order of magnitude lower than other compartments despite the fact that its mean absolute water storage is the most important one rivers contribution to twsa is quite small compared to other compartments as floodplain storage is quite limited and does not last more than a few days sim and swat do not model lakes and reservoirs in this study however lakes and reservoirs contribution to twsa might not be that important as there are no big reservoirs or lakes within the basin snow has more impact on twsa during winter logically water intercepted by vegetation is negligible so in summary most of the garonne twsa is due to the first dozen meters of soil and to the shallow aquifer connected to the river the small contribution of surface water mainly from snow to twsa for the garonne basin must be due to the size of the basin which cannot store important mass of water in floodplains or in the river network at monthly time scale unlike big river basins some previous studies using grace data on big river basins indicated that surface water has more impact on twsa for example becker et al 2018 estimated that water stored in surface water bodies floodplains lakes rivers and wetlands contributes to 19 5 of the annual variations of grace twsa in the congo river basin during the time period 2003 2007 as summarize by frappart and ramilien 2018 surface water bodies could even be responsible of 40 to 50 of the twsa annual variations for basin with important floodplains like the amazon papa et al 2013 orinoco frappart et al 2015 or ganges brahmaputra papa et al 2015 basins these results are actually coherent with the results obtained for the garonne basin indeed the main compartments contributing to garonne twsa are the first dozen meters of soil and the shallow aquifer connected to the river so compartments closely connected to surface waters and the atmosphere interface 3 3 basin scale water balance as described in section 2 4 2 the possibility to compute garonne basin water balance using both grace data and sim swat inputs and outputs has been investigated correlation coefficient and nse between grace solutions δ t w s and p etr q from models have been computed to assess their consistency table 5 as they should be similar eq 2 different p etr q have been tested only from sim inputs outputs first line of table 5 only from swat inputs outputs second line of table 5 p etr from sim or swat and in situ q at tonneins from banque hydro database third and fourth line of table 5 respectively and a composite estimate of p etr q with p from safran etr the mean between sim and swat etr and q from in situ gauge fifth line of table 5 only δ t w s from csr and gsfc mascons solutions have been considered as section 3 1 showed they best compare to sim and swat twsa δ t w s from sim and swat is also computed and compared to grace ones last lines of table 5 δ t w s from csr mascon solutions has a correlation coefficient around 0 7 with the different p etr q estimates but exhibits poor nse they are all negative much better results are obtained with δ t w s from gsfc mascon solution which has correlation coefficient around 0 8 and nse around 0 4 with the different p etr q estimates correlation and nse are pretty similar for the four p etr q estimates correlation and nse are better between grace mascon solutions δ t w s and models δ t w s around 0 86 and 0 68 for csr mascon solution respectively and 0 9 and 0 8 for gsfc mascon solution respectively surprisingly correlation and nse are slightly worse between csr mascon and gsfc mascon 0 88 and 0 59 respectively than between the mascon solutions and the models this highlights the spread of the grace solutions because of differences in their processing even if they are based on the same raw measurements these differences are exacerbated by the small size of the basin compared to the grace products resolutions it also shows that at least for the garonne basin the gsfc mascon solution seems to be the best suitable solution for basin scale water balance study fig 8 a shows sim and swat p etr q time series along with csr and gsfc mascon solutions δ t w s it shows the overall good agreement between the datasets and some high frequency variations in swat p etr q which are not present in other datasets this could explain why nse between swat and gsfc mascon is lower than for sim fig 8 b presents monthly accumulated safran precipitation time series over the basin along with sim and swat etr and q if models etr and q are similar sim q and etr are slightly more correlated to safran precipitation that s why swat p etr q has more high frequency variations than sim p etr q in order to analyze more easily interannual variations of precipitation evapotranspiration and discharge their hydrological yearly mean has been computed for both models fig 8 c swat evapotranspiration in average is always lower than sim their discharges have similar values even if sim discharge is more correlated to precipitation than swat from fig 8 c it appears that important precipitation that occur during hydrological years 2004 2009 and 2013 have relatively low impact on evapotranspiration whereas river discharge increased during these years on the contrary important precipitation during year 2007 was concomitant with higher evapotranspiration and lower discharge concerning 2005 2011 and 2012 dry years evapotranspiration did not exhibit important increase or drop compared to other years even if its lowest value occurred during hydrological year 2011 it should be highlighted that small variations of etr at yearly time scale does not mean that etr could not have important variations at seasonal time scale grusson et al 2018 besides some important rain events if they occur over a short time period might saturate the soil very quickly and or might increase runoff with few impacts on vegetation and etr explaining the difference between etr and precipitation on fig 8 c concerning discharge it drops significantly in 2011 and 2012 so the minimum twsa observed in 2012 see section 3 1 and fig 6 is mainly due to an important precipitation drop an evapotranspiration rate that was close to other years and the fact that preceding year was also very dry i e memory effect of tws during this drought period the most important one within the studied period the situation was so critical that many localities in the basin have been officially recognized by the french government as having experienced natural disaster république française 2012 table 6 gives correlation and nse for time series without their mean annual cycle between csr and gsfc mascon solutions δ t w s and the different p etr q estimates gsfc mascon solution still provides the best correlation coefficient around 0 55 but the nse remains quite low 2 3 for csr mascon and 1 for gsfc mascon gsfc mascon and models δ t w s remains well correlated even without their mean annual cycles with a good nse 0 6 again gsfc mascon δ t w s better compares with models than with csr mascon δ t w s from these comparisons it is clear that gsfc mascon solution is better suited than csr mascon solution for computing δ t w s to study the garonne basin water balance they compare well to models p etr q however when the mean annual cycle is removed the nse is pretty low this must be due to low spatial resolution of grace data leading to noisy water mass estimates which are quite coarse compared to garonne basin size the fact that the temporal derivative from eq 1 is approximated by a second order central difference eq 3 might also add errors but another source of error is the use of δ t w s instead of more accurate δtws see section 2 4 2 for example correlation and nse between sim p etr q and sim δ t w s are equal to 0 87 and 0 59 respectively if these results are better than the ones obtained between sim p etr q and grace mascon solutions they are not that far from the comparison between gsfc mascon δ t w s and sim p etr q correlation coefficient and nse equal to 0 76 and 0 44 respectively see table 5 for grace solutions evaluated in this study only δ t w s are available however for models the more accurate δtws could be computed to check the uncertainty due to this approximation for example fig 9 a shows sim p etr q orange line and sim δ t w s dashed blue line clearly p etr q has more variability than δ t w s which is smoother however p etr q and δtws are almost identical fig 9 b their correlation coefficient and nse are almost 1 0 999 and 0 998 respectively therefore results from table 5 and 6 are mainly due to grace coarse resolution both in space and time the fact that δ t w s tends to be smoother than p etr q fig 9 a might not be an issue for big river basins analyzed in previous studies however for 50 000 km2 basins like the garonne using monthly mean twsa will prevent to properly close the water balance equation some mismatch between grace mascon δ t w s and models p etr q could also be due to model issue especially sim and swat models do not consider actual irrigation reservoirs and lakes finally if precipitation comes from the most accurate database available over france mainland safran it still has some errors that could impact the comparison 4 conclusions and perspectives this study inter compared twsa from seven grace satellite mission solutions with twsa computed from two hydrological models sim and swat over the 50 000 km2 garonne basin between august 2002 and july 2014 despite that the garonne basin is smaller than estimated grace spatial resolution a good agreement between grace solutions and hydrological model twsa has been found especially grace mascon solutions from csr and gsfc best match sim and swat models twsa with correlation and nse above 0 9 and 0 7 respectively it also validates that sim and swat models have enough physical processes to model correctly twsa at basin scale this good agreement is due to the important amplitude of the garonne annual cycle even if grace solutions and models annual cycle are 1 month shifted overall it seems that some grace solutions provide meaningful observation for the garonne basin despite its small size compared to grace resolution the analysis of models outputs showed twsa in the garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer connected to the river to a smaller extent snow also influences garonne twsa open surface water river network twsa is quite small and twsa from deep aquifer and vegetation is negligible grace gsfc mascon solution δ t w s best matches models p etr q yet the basin scale water balance is not close it is due to grace poor spatial resolution compared to garonne basin size but also as shown in this study because of its monthly time resolution preventing the computation of accurate δtws this issue might not be important for big river basins but for the garonne basin δ t w s is too smooth compared to monthly accumulated p etr q more work is needed to assess the reasons of the differences between grace and hydrological models it is needed to better characterize sources of errors in grace solutions like leakage error and maybe to apply more local processing techniques like the one proposed by longuevergne et al 2010 using recently released sub monthly grace solutions e g kurtenbach et al 2012 ramillien et al 2015 might also help to compute a more accurate garonne basin water balance sim and swat models used in this study currently represent state of the art hydrological modeling of the garonne basin yet they do not take into account lakes reservoirs and irrigation taking these effects into account would be important to improve our understanding of water fluxes within the basin doing a thorough sensitivity study on the models parameters and forcing should also help to better quantify models uncertainties garonne basin is quite impacted by human activities reservoirs irrigated agriculture especially during low flow sauquet et al 2009 their impact on tws at basin scale is still unclear and more ancillary data should be collected to investigate this link and to determine if grace data are accurate enough to observe these impacts finally grace follow on grace fo grace successor was launched may 22nd 2018 validating grace fo accuracy on the garonne basin and its potential improvement compared to grace would be valuable to extend twsa observation time series as the basin is still experiencing important drought

8429,study region garonne basin france study focus this study analyses water mass variations for the whole garonne basin 50 000 km2 drainage area to do so total water storage anomalies twsa from seven global solutions based on the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission measurements 300 km spatial resolution are inter compared with twsa from two hydrological models safran isba modcou sim and soil and water assessment tool swat between january 2003 and december 2010 new hydrological insights for the region despite the small size of the garonne basin compared to grace spatial resolution good agreement between grace solutions and hydrological model twsa has been found maximum correlation coefficient 0 9 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 7 these datasets showed that twsa in the garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer to a smaller extent snow also influences garonne twsa open surface water twsa is quite small and twsa from deep aquifer is negligible the most important drought period occurred in 2011 2012 due to low precipitation during the two hydrological years and etr close to previous years important precipitation in 2013 2014 helps to refill the water stocks this study also showed that grace and models mismatches should be due to grace poor spatial resolution but also to its monthly time resolution rarely shown in previous studies keywords garonne grace hydrological model basin water balance cross validation grace spatial resolution 1 introduction studying the water cycle at global and regional scale requires a set of observation tools and models to estimate water and energy stored in different compartments of the water cycle i e atmosphere continental surfaces and oceans and their fluxes over continents it is also important to know water stocks and their variations at the watershed scale and seasonal to multi annual time scales for planning required actions from water managers to satisfy water and energy needs by human population within the basin traditionally it is done with in situ measurements of river discharge water table for ground water snow depth etc these data remain the most precise and accurate measurements available however they are only partial measurement of all water fluxes within a watershed as gauge network are at best heterogeneous in space and time pavelsky et al 2014 since few decades some remote sensing sensors have proven their capabilities to complement in situ measurements and or provide estimates of variables not measured in situ lettenmaier et al 2015 especially the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite mission launched in 2002 can be used to estimate total water storage change variations at coarse spatial resolution 300 km and monthly time scale to get homogenous estimates of these fluxes in space and time hydrological models have been developed during the last decades to compute water storage dynamic and fluxes within river watersheds döll et al 2016 however these numerical models are inherently limited by the implemented physical processes the approximation of the chosen equations to model these processes the numerical approximation used to compute solutions to these equations uncertainties in the parameters of the models and in the boundary conditions used as model inputs döll et al 2016 nowadays in situ and satellite observations are commonly used to calibrate validate and even correct models outputs or and parameters lettenmaier et al 2015 estimating the total water storage variations within watershed remains a difficult task as hydrological models are often validated or calibrated only for some variables more frequently against in situ river discharge sometimes using satellite estimates of snow extent or less frequently against water table in situ measurements but not for all variables and storage compartments the use of both grace data and hydrological modeling at watershed scale can help 1 to cross validate a combination of hydrology model outputs and 2 to identify modeled compartment s where the most important variations are occurring however due to grace coarse spatial resolution many previous studies using grace data considered watershed with drainage area much higher than 100 000 km2 e g wouters et al 2014 it is not sure that grace data could be used for medium size river basins like the garonne basin located in south west of france 50 000 km2 drainage area the present study investigates the potential of grace data for this kind of basin especially it focuses on the following two questions how to estimate and validate total water storage variations over the medium size garonne basin using grace data and hydrological model outputs at monthly scale in which hydrology compartments those monthly variations are the most important they are addressed in the following sections which present the study domain section 2 1 grace products section 2 2 and hydrological models inputs and outputs sections 2 3 used the methodology applied to tackle these two questions section 2 4 and finally the results obtained section 3 2 study basin data used and methodology 2 1 garonne basin the study focuses on the garonne river basin fig 1 which is one of the principal fluvial systems in france mainland and located in the southwest of the country the basin black polygon on fig 1 drains 50 000 km² at tonneins the last gauging station uninfluenced by the tidal action 120 km upstream the estuary its watershed consists of three main geographic entities the pyrenees mountains to the south with some peeks exceeding 3000 m the plateau of the massif central to the northeast between 1400 and 1700 m and the plain between them whose elevation is less than a few hundred metres the basin is also at the boundary of different climate zones the mediterranean climate in the east of the basin is characterized by hot and dry southeastern winds the garonne basin near its estuary is impacted by an oceanic climate with western winds causing high precipitation and cool temperatures watershed flows are impacted by these weather conditions especially flows in the central part of the basin are generated by precipitation over the massif central and the pyrenees mountains the average annual precipitation is around 900 mm y 1 over the basin according to https donneespubliques meteofrance fr upstream garonne and ariege rivers discharges during spring are highly influenced by snowmelt from the pyrenees mountains caballero et al 2007 at the outlet of the basin tonneins according to the national gauge measurements database banque hydro http www hydro eaufrance fr the average discharge between 1913 and 2018 is equal to 598 m3 s 1 the highest discharge on record reached 5700 m3 s 1 march 5th 1930 and the lowest 37 5 m3 s 1 august 4th 1989 the hydrological year goes from october to september of the subsequent year monthly discharge is maximum in february 1913 2018 mean 970 m3 s 1 and minimum in august 1913 2018 mean 177 m3 s 1 according to the corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 the mountainous regions are dominated by forest and alpine grassland 37 of the watershed while the plain is dominated by agricultural activities 60 the remaining land is either artificialized land 2 5 or water bodies 0 5 cambisols are the most frequent soil classes covering 55 of the total area and spreading across the watershed different classes of shallow soils are also present in the upper part of the watershed 19 such as lithosols regosols andosols rendzinas and rankers luvisols cover 18 of the watershed mostly on hillsides and in the plain the garonne river mostly flows on fluvisols 7 influence of human activities on monthly discharge values are not transmitted to the downstream hydrologic regime significantly and remain contained in the upper part of the basin grusson et al 2017a 2 2 grace satellites measurements 2 2 1 grace mission the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace is a national aeronautics and space administration nasa and deutsches zentrum für luft und raumfahrt dlr satellite mission to map the global earth gravity field every 30 days tapley et al 2004 it is composed of two twin satellites following each other 220 km apart as the orbit of each satellite is determined by the earth gravity field local variations of this field will affect the satellites motion slightly differently and therefore the distance between them that is why the distance between the two satellites is constantly monitored on board and is then converted by different processing centers to earth gravity field variations called grace solutions for more information and reviews on grace see for example wouters et al 2014 if the principle of grace measurements is quite simple in practice the inversion process is complex and source of multiple errors some grace solutions are computed as stokes coefficients of spherical harmonic functions it is widely assumed that grace solutions should observe physical phenomena with a spatial resolution of about 300 km due to the satellites orbit altitude instrument accuracy the maximum degree of spherical harmonics used and the spatial scale of the filters applied to grace measurements at different processing steps e g landerer and swenson 2012 wouters et al 2014 scanlon et al 2016 most if not all processing centers now provide their solutions rather in spherical harmonic coefficients or recomputed on regular geographic grid because of the different hypotheses and approaches used to inverse gravity fields from grace satellites distance measurements currently available solutions are not identical to get sufficient spatial coverage by the satellite measurements are often integrated over a month to do the inversion wouters et al 2014 even if sub monthly solutions have recently been made available e g kurtenbach et al 2012 ramillien et al 2015 grace satellites are on a quasi polar orbit with an 89 inclination at an altitude around 500 km allowing a global coverage of continental surfaces the satellites were launched simultaneously march 17 2002 the total mission lifetime largely exceeded the initially planned 5 years lifetime as the mission ended science operations in october 2017 https www jpl nasa gov news news php feature 6984 due to a battery failure on one satellite yet since 2011 issue with satellites batteries has led the mission team to collect data only when the sun is positioned favorably to the solar arrays wouters et al 2014 therefore gaps in grace time series are quite important since then there had also been some few missing measurements before 2011 especially in the early times of the mission 2 2 2 grace data used in hydrology and uncertainties at the monthly to interannual time scales observed by the mission variations of earth gravity field can be attributed mainly to redistribution of water in its fluid envelope e g tapley et al 2004 wouters et al 2014 therefore grace solutions are also provided as total water storage tws anomalies twsa at monthly time scale it corresponds to the sum of all water mass variations at the continents surface and in the soil i e the sum of snow water equivalent surface water soil water and groundwater chen et al 2016 grace solutions have been widely used to compute at basin and subbasin scale twsa for big river watersheds like the amazon congo or mekong basins to cite a few see for example wouters et al 2014 for a review these observations have had a wide range of applications in continental hydrology since the last decade to validate improve hydrological models e g niu and yang 2006 correct model s outputs with data assimilation techniques e g zaitchik et al 2008 compute basin scale water budget in combination with other products e g gao et al 2010 estimate groundwater storage change using independent computation of soil and snow water storage variations see chen et al 2016 for a review or investigate trends in tws and their relationships with climate variability and human activities rodell et al 2018 grace data near its spatial resolution limit 300 km has important signal to noise ratio as the noise increase with degrees of the spherical harmonic decomposition toward higher spatial resolution processing centers reduce noise level by applying smoothing filters which tend to reduce and smooth the amplitude of the water mass variations besides because of the processing treatments and the truncation of the spherical harmonic degree grace tws suffers of leakage effects i e water mass tends to be spatially spread and can leak toward nearby other water mass longuevergne et al 2010 wouters et al 2014 because of the orbit orientation grace measurements are more sensitive to variation of mass in the satellite along track north south at low mid latitudes direction than the ones in the across track i e east west direction leading to stripes in the initial release of grace solutions some destriping algorithms have then been developed to significantly reduce this source of error which in turn tend to affect the amplitude of the signal and spatial resolution wouters et al 2014 ancillary data are needed by processing centers to invert twsa over continents like atmosphere and ocean models outputs glacial isostatic adjustment gia model s which have their own source of uncertainties finally long et al 2017 analyzed sixty river basins in the world and found more disparity in twsa trend for medium basins area 200 000 km2 than for bigger ones indicating that differences in grace solutions are more likely to be observed for medium and small watersheds that s why it remains unsure that grace measurements can provide useful data for a 50 000 km2 basin like the garonne river basin 2 2 3 grace solutions seven publicly available monthly global grace solutions have been considered in this study downloaded products correspond to liquid water equivalent thickness in centimeters on regular grid the three first solutions are the grace tellus land release rl05 monthly mass 1 x1 grids available at https grace jpl nasa gov data

version dstvscs1411 processing centers swenson and wahr 2006 landerer and swenson 2012 swenson 2012 the filtering used during the processing steps of these grace tellus land solutions tends to reduce retrieved twsa amplitude to overcome this issue landerer and swenson 2012 computed a global grid of time invariant scaling factors using clm4 global hydrological model outputs these scaling factors have been applied to the three solutions in our study hereinafter these solutions are labeled csr gfz and jpl respectively the fourth solution corresponds to grace lageos equivalent water heights 1 x1

solutions release 03 lemoine et al 2016 this solution is labeled grgs in the following sections finally the three last solutions correspond to so called global mascons solutions contrarily to the previous solutions mascons solutions parameterize the earth gravity field using regional mass concentration functions which has some advantages like the decrease of ocean land leakage scanlon et al 2016 the mascons solutions have been computed by csr over a 0 5 x0 5 grid version 1 save et al 2016 nasa goddard space flight center gsfc 1 x1 grid version 2 2 luthcke et al 2013 loomis and luthcke

respectively time invariant scaling factors are recommended and provided only for the jpl mascon solution documentation for this solution also clearly mentioned that the native resolution is the size of a single mascon which are 3 degrees in size https grace jpl nasa gov data get data jpl global mascons despite the solution is provided on a 0 5 x0 5 grid the time mean value removed to the provided grace tellus land solutions csr jpl mascon solutions twsa has been computed over january 2004 to december 2009 time span for grgs solution and gsfc mascon solution the mean removed has been computed over january 2004 to december 2015 and over january 2003 to december 2012 time periods respectively furthermore gia corrections have not been considered as gia is negligible on the garonne basin guo et al 2012 fig 1 shows the 1 x1 grid used by most solutions yellow lines correspond to portions of the grid that lie within the studied garonne basin as the intrinsic grace spatial resolution is actually coarser than 1 x1 this figure shows how small the basin is compared to grace resolution this issue is highlighted in many grace solutions documentations for example the csr mascon documentation clearly states that the users must exercise caution when using these solutions in basins smaller than approximately 200 000 km2 moreover these solutions should be used to perform basin level time series analysis and never be used for analysis at a single grid point 2 3 hydrological models this study inter compared twsa from seven global grace solutions with twsa from two hydrological models safran isba modcou sim and soil and water assessment tool swat between 2003 and 2010 sim and swat are the only two operational distributed and physically based hydrological models currently deployed over the garonne watershed that can simulate the different compartments of the water cycle 2 3 1 climate forcing dataset in this study climate dataset used to force the hydrological models comes from the système d analyse fournissant des renseignements a la neige safran durand et al 1993 quintana seguí et al 2008 analysis system raimonet et al 2017 have shown that safran currently provides the best estimate of near surface variables over france compared to other existing datasets especially reconstruction of the liquid and solid precipitation fields benefits from the high density network of meteo france local measurements moreover grusson et al 2017a showed that using safran dataset in a hydrological modeling of the garonne basin led to better performances safran performs an analysis of near surface variables by optimal interpolation oi on homogeneous climatic areas i e without strong horizontal climatic gradient the oi method combines upper air atmospheric analysis and in situ observations to calculate the best estimate of total daily precipitation and 6 hly 2 meter air temperature and humidity 10 meter wind speed downward solar and infrared radiation these analyzed variables are then interpolated in space on an 8km mesh regular grid to better take into account topography and in time at an hourly time step more detailed description of safran analyses can be found in durand et al 1993 and quintana seguí et al 2008 safran analyses are computed from 1958 onwards vidal et al 2010 fig 2 shows safran 2000 2014 mean annual total precipitation in south west of france the two hydrological models used in this study which were forced with safran datasets are described in the following sections 2 3 2 sim model safran isba modcou sim is a combination of a meteorological analysis system safran a land surface model interaction soil biosphere atmosphere isba noilhan and planton 1989 noilhan and mahfouf 1996 and a hydrogeological model modèle couplé modcou ledoux et al 1989 david et al 2011 it is used operationally at meteo france to monitor water resources over the french territory and can therefore be used to forecast flood risk and to monitor drought risks sim simulates energy and water budgets river discharge and height of the water table in presence of aquifers over natural areas isba land surface model computes water storage based on input safran total precipitation and modeled total evaporation surface runoff and soil infiltration total evaporation is composed of plant evapotranspiration evaporation of bare soil evaporation of water intercepted by the vegetation and snow and ice sublimation the partitioning of local precipitation into runoff and infiltration is parameterized following dümenil and todini 1992 runoff is routed by the modcou surface routing network towards the river network häfliger et al 2015 soil infiltration is diffused through the soil layers up to the vegetation root depth and contributes to the soil water storage and can contribute to aquifers water supply when they are simulated which is not the case in the garonne basin in the current version of the isba model the soil is discretized into 14 layers resulting in a total depth of 12 m the vertical discretization bottom depth of each layer in meters is the following 0 01 0 04 0 1 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 1 5 2 3 5 8 12 as described in decharme et al 2013 the heat transfer is solved over the total depth whereas the moisture transfer is solved over the root depth only which depends on the vegetation types concerning the input data apart from the safran climate dataset sim needs parameters that define the garonne basin in terms of natural ecosystems orography and soil texture for that purpose the ecoclimap database faroux et al 2013 is used to represent land cover at a 1 km horizontal resolution among the hundreds of ecosystems available in ecoclimap vegetation in the model is represented by only 12 plant functional types pfts combining several ecosystems the orography is derived from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm at 90 meters farr et al 2007 upscaled at 1 km resolution to be consistent with the ecosystems representation soil texture at 1 km resolution comes from the harmonized world soil database nachtergaele et al 2012 it is used to define model parameters that depend on clay or sand concentration like the field capacity or wilting point soil moisture contents which are commonly used to define thresholds between which plants evapotranspirate at potential rate or are stressed due to a lack of water the evapotranspiration is calculated based on the isba a gs module calvet et al 1998 where a simplified photosynthesis module is applied to represent the exchanges of water and carbon dioxide at the leaf scale a realistic representation of the snowpack behavior is required to accurately represent snow accumulation and melting which are key components of the water cycle especially in mountainous areas for that purpose snow is parameterized using boone and etchevers 2001 explicit multi layer snow model this model has demonstrated its ability to simulate accurately the main snow processes such as the freezing of water that would have percolated within the snow due to surface melting or liquid precipitation surface runoff parameterization requires the calibration of one single parameter b representing the slope of the retention curve the higher b the faster water runs off this parameter was setup uniformly for the garonne basin in the sim operational set up although no specific calibration was made in the current study whether for the land surface model isba or the hydrogeological model modcou the parameters of this latter that were calibrated over the 1974 1982 period boukerma 1987 were not modified table 1 sums up sim input parameters and forcing sources and validation datasets used for this study 2 3 3 swat model soil and water assessment tool swat is a hydro agro environmental model for river and watershed studies jointly developed by usda agricultural research service usda ars and texas a m agrilife research from texas a m university swat is a public domain model which simulate quantity and quality of surface and ground water and predict environmental impact of human practices like agriculture point source dams it has been widely used to simulate distributed hydrology variables at a watershed scale gassman et al 2007 the model is based on hydrologic response units hru aggregated at subbasin level a hru is characterized by a topography slope and soil and land use combination within a subbasin the swat model integrates soil types and properties land cover and agriculture management including automatic irrigation and fertilization where water and fertilizer are applied to avoid plant stress hrus are the base unit to compute the water balance which is composed of four compartments snow soil shallow aquifer and deep aquifer fluxes between these compartments correspond to the following hydrological processes infiltration runoff evapotranspiration lateral flow and percolation computation is performed at the hru level and routed within the river network to downstream subbasins down to the outlet the project has been set up with arcswat version 10 4 19 a gis based graphical interface based on arcmap 10 4 helping users to define hrus and generate the associated input files for swat2012 version olivera et al 2006 swat documentation available online explained the theory and details of hydrologic processes integrated in swat model neitsch et al 2009 concerning the input data all swat input files are listed in table 1 the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer global digital elevation model aster gdem tachikawa et al 2011 from nasa and the ministry of economy trade and industry meti of japan available on 90 m global grid was chosen to delineate the watershed and compute the river system land uses are from the corine land cover 2012 büttner et al 2014 map with a 100 m resolution and the soil data originate from the european soil database eea 2007 with a 1 km resolution map soil properties have been adjusted by expertise the swat model setup includes 52 different types of soil over the watershed each soil consists in 1 to 4 layers according each type of soil each layer having a depth of 10 to 1400 cm and its own layer characteristics from these land use soil databases and watershed topography 22 land use 13 soil and 5 slope classes were defined in swat with these classes swat model identified 1320 subbasins with 12 834 hrus for the hrus definition we selected only classes which occupy at least 10 on the subbasin to avoid anecdotal classes the safran atmospheric fields see section 2 3 1 have been used to force swat river discharge observations used for calibration and validation come from banque hydro database monthly stream flow data from 20 selected gauging stations including the outlet tonneins along the river network were used to calibrate and validate the model the selection was made to sample all the hydrology and catchment diversity in soil land use and climate conditions as proposed by grusson et al 2017a for each step validation and calibration three years of initialization are performed the swat model was calibrated over ten years from 2000 to 2010 and validated on the available previous period from 1980 to 1997 calibration procedure are based on previous set up of the model over the same watershed grusson et al 2017a b grusson et al 2015 same sensitive parameters have been considered and the calibrated values from those previous studies have been used as first guess in our calibration procedure as the spatial definition subwatershed and hru is slightly different in the present version of the model calibration has been manually adjusted this manual adjustment was based on watershed characteristics bibliography and expertise 2 3 4 models evaluation the evaluation of sim and swat models performances has been conducted using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 by comparing simulation and observation at monthly and daily time step for swat and sim respectively nse range between minus infinite and 1 a nse of 1 indicates a perfect fit between observation and simulation a value of 0 indicates that the simulation produced by the model is equivalent to the average of the observed data a negative value indicates very poor agreement between simulation and observation for each model an estimation of the bias is also conducted to estimate if discharges are overestimated or underestimated by models concerning sim it was run for the period 1958 2016 over france and was spun up by repeating twice the first year sim evaluation against daily measured discharges was performed over the garonne basin for 34 gauging stations available in the banque hydro database and located along the garonne river and its main tributaries in addition to the nse and in order to investigate over underestimation percent bias pbias has been computed one minus the ration between modeled discharge and in situ discharge it measures the average tendency of the simulated data to be larger or smaller than their observed counterparts the optimal value of pbias is 0 with low magnitude values indicating accurate model simulation positive values indicate model underestimation bias and negative values indicate model overestimation bias gupta et al 1999 on average over the entire basin sim gives satisfactory results with an averaged nse of 0 55 and a pbias of 0 04 fig 3 a shows the percentage of sim pixels containing in situ stations as a function of nse 75 of pixels with stations have an nse greater than 0 5 which can be considered as a rather good result moreover more than 50 of pixels have a nse greater than 0 6 which shows the good agreement between sim and in situ measurements pbias fig 3 b indicates that for one third of the stations sim tend to overestimate discharge whereas for one fourth of the stations sim tends to underestimate discharge on average sim is unbiased for the swat model the nash and pbias are calculated for monthly discharge at 20 different gauging stations spread over the watershed see fig 4 the stations have been selected to encompass the diversity of hydrological regime existing over the watershed a soft calibration was led to calibrate the swat model based on previous studies and the expertise of specialists grusson et al 2017a and grusson et al 2017b performed parameters sensitivity analysis over 20 gauging stations within the garonne watershed the uncertainty analysis was done using the swat calibration and uncertainty procedure swat cup tool which is based on the sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 algorithm all sources of uncertainties driving variables conceptual model parameters measured data were considered uncertainties in the model output variables are driven by parameters uncertainties which can be expressed as the 95 probability distribution also named 95ppu 95 prediction uncertainty to get the best performance the 95ppu envelop has to capture most of observation values and have a small spread in order to evaluate 95ppu performance two statistics are used p factor and r factor abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour 2012 p factor is the percentage of observed data enveloped by our modeling and need to be over 70 to consider a good discharge modeling r factor represents the thickness of the 95ppu envelop and need to be around 1 fig 5 illustrates the 95ppu intervals of simulation and observation during calibration and validation period at the outlet of the basin in this case 73 of observed monthly values were within 95ppu area and r factor is equal 0 66 an average nse value of 0 76 was obtained for the calibration period 2000 2010 table 2 presents nse and pbias for the 20 gauges the rank of nash and pbias evaluation is given according the ranking proposed by moriasi et al 2007 and based on monthly discharge evaluation for the calibration period 14 out of the 20 stations show good to very good performances table 2 only four stations show unsatisfactory performances with an overall average nse of 0 70 the positive pbias indicates that like the sim model swat model tends to globally overestimate the volume of water performances remain steady over the validation period with a good to very good model performance at 14 out of 20 stations table 2 still 4 stations are presenting nse below 0 5 these four stations are not necessarily the same than the four gauges with the lowest nse during the calibration period two stations presenting unsatisfactory results during the calibration are performing well during the validation period the overall tendency of the model is also to overestimate the volume of water compared to observations 2 4 grace and hydrological models cross validation methodology as presented in previous sections on one side grace data are quite coarse and its capability to observe twsa over the garonne basin is questionable on the other side sim and swat hydrological modeling of the basin are the two only operational distributed and physically based hydrological models currently deployed over the garonne watershed and some compartments of their mass budget cannot be validated based on in situ data alone therefore and as stated in the introduction the purpose of this study is to compare grace solutions and sim swat models outputs in order to cross validate them and to compute a hydrology water balance at the garonne basin scale the following sections present the methodology used to compare and cross validate grace twsa with sim and swat twsa section 2 4 1 and to compute garonne basin water balance section 2 4 2 2 4 1 grace and hydrological models outputs comparisons twsa from grace are computed by selecting all pixels that lie even partially in the garonne basin then for each of these pixels grace solutions liquid water equivalent thicknesses are multiplied by the area of the pixel portion which intersects the basin polygon to compute pixel twsa in m3 then all pixels twsa are summed to get grace twsa over the whole basin for each grace solution time series its time mean over the time period january 2003 to december 2010 is removed this removal is needed as the reference of twsa is not common for all solutions see section 2 2 3 and this time period has very few missing grace measurements as explained in section 2 2 1 modeled twsa are computed in three steps first for each pixel liquid water equivalent volumes stored in all modeled hydrology compartments are summed for sim these compartments correspond to snow water intercepted by the vegetation river network and all soil layers for swat they correspond to snow river network all soil layers shallow aquifer connected to the river and the deep confined aquifer then tws of all pixels within the basin are summed weighted by the proportion of pixels area within the basin polygon finally the mean of this sum between january 2003 and december 2010 for consistency with garonne grace twsa time series is removed to obtain twsa for the whole basin quantitative comparison between monthly grace solutions and monthly hydrological models outputs has been performed only from january 2003 to december 2010 time span as before and after grace time series have important gaps for all datasets the mean annual cycle has also been computed for each month january to december the mean twsa is computed for all corresponding month between 2003 and 2010 time series without the mean annual cycle have also been calculated for each month the corresponding mean month value has been removed the comparison is done by computing the correlation coefficient and the nse between grace solutions and models full time series their mean annual cycle and time series without their mean annual cycle twsa time series and hydrology budget have been interpreted qualitatively for all datasets over their whole common time period i e august 2002 to july 2014 corresponding to twelve hydrological years hydrological model outputs have also been analyzed to identify the main hydrology compartment s contributing to twsa observed by grace 2 4 2 garonne basin water balance after the intercomparison of all datasets the basin hydrology water balance has been estimated it corresponds to a water mass balance or continuity equation for a closed system translating the fact that variations of tws during a certain period of time is equal to the quantity of water received and lost during that period of time for a watershed water is gained via precipitation p and lost via evapotranspiration sum of the soil evaporation evaporation of the precipitation intercepted by the canopy and the vegetation transpiration this sum is noted etr and water discharge at the outlet of the basin q often approximated to river outflows as aquifer outflows is neglected and not known therefore the generic water balance equation for a watershed is 1 d t w s d t t p t e t r t q t for a hydrological model which provides only discrete estimations of variables in time and space eq 1 can be integrated during the month m whose first and last time steps are noted t1 and t2 respectively and the model numerical time step is noted δt over the n pixels or hru within the watershed eq 2 2 δ t w s m t w s t 2 t w s t 1 s 1 n t t 1 t 2 p s t e t r s t q s t δ t some studies see wouters et al 2014 for a review have used this equation to compare tws change δtws estimated from grace and p etr q from models or from other satellite or in situ observations to rather assess the quality of grace measurements or to get bounds from grace in estimated p etr q however as grace provides mean monthly twsa and not twsa between the first and last day of the month it is not possible to compute directly δtws from grace even if its measurements were perfects grace δtws is often approximated using a twsa difference between two consecutive months in this study we used a second order central difference eq 3 to compute it as it is more numerically stable than forward or backward difference this approximated δtws is noted δ t w s hereafter to clearly show that it is based on monthly average of tws 3 δ t w s m t w s a m 1 t w s a m 1 2 the purpose of this work is to compare δ t w s from grace solutions to the right hand side of eq 2 computed from sim swat models inputs outputs it is done to evaluate the usefulness of grace solutions to provide information for computing the water balance of a basin like the garonne and to assess how p etr and q affect tws variations for the garonne 3 results and discussions 3 1 grace solutions and models outputs cross validation grace solutions and hydrological models twsa time series in m3 over the garonne basin their mean annual cycle 2003 2010 average and twsa without this mean annual cycle time series are presented on fig 6 they show very good agreements between grace solutions and hydrological models fig 6a especially their mean annual cycles fig 6b have similar amplitude and phasing however it should be noted that grace solutions mean annual cycles are 1 month delayed compared to hydrological models grace time series have their maximum values in march except for grgs solution which is in february and minimum values in september whereas for both sim and swat the minimum and maximum occur in february and august respectively times series without their mean annual cycle fig 6c are also quite coherent between satellite and models time series even if grace solutions especially grgs solution have more variations at highest frequencies than hydrological models grgs solution does not apply some post processing smoothing than other solutions use which could explain its more important variability tables 3 and 4 present correlation coefficient and nse computed over 2003 2010 time period between grace solutions and models time series with and without their mean annual cycle respectively as recommended in the grace tellus land documentation statistics for the mean of the three solutions are also provided table 3 shows the overall good agreement between grace solutions and model outputs grgs solution has the lowest correlation and nse 0 77 and 0 27 with sim respectively and 0 79 and 0 32 with swat respectively other solutions have correlation and nse above 0 80 and 0 50 respectively with both sim and swat especially the best comparison is obtained for mascon solutions correlation and nse between csr mascon and sim swat outputs are above 0 90 and 0 80 respectively gsfc mascon is the second solution that best match model outputs with slightly lower coefficients concerning time series without mean annual cycle csr and gsfc mascon also provides the best correlation and nse which are between 0 78 and 0 80 for correlation and 0 33 and 0 54 for nse the jpl mascon solution also compares well to model outputs but with lower coefficients than the two other mascon solutions especially for time series without mean annual cycle overall gsfc mascon seems to provide generally slightly better results than csr mascon but the best correlation coefficient is obtained between csr mascon and sim time series it was expected to get better results with mascon solutions as they decrease leakage errors and are more adapted locally than solution based on spherical harmonics scanlon et al 2016 it is consistent with the results obtained by long et al 2017 over sixty basins worse results were also expected with time series without mean annual cycle table 4 as noise is proportionally more important in these time series than with the ones with the annual cycle these comparisons cross validate grace solutions and model outputs all datasets are quite coherent between themselves even without their mean annual cycle indicating similar interannual variability the mean annual cycles are very close with similar amplitudes but with 1 month delay between grace and hydrological models it shows that grace is actually capable to provide twsa for a 50 000 km2 temperate basin like the garonne basin especially csr mascon and gsfc mascon solutions are the most suitable for this basin similarly these good results seem to indicate that hydrological models have enough physics and good enough forcing data to match independent satellite measurements of twsa quite logically for the garonne basin the mean annual cycle fig 6 b is positive during winter and spring maxima in february march when the precipitation is the highest and negative in summer and autumn minima in august september when the precipitation is at its lowest rate martin et al 2016 fig 6 c shows that twsa on the garonne basin has important interannual variability with high positive twsa hydrological years 2003 2004 and 2013 and low negative twsa years 2005 2006 2008 2011 and 2012 it should also be noted that the most important depletion of tws during the time period occurred in 2012 followed by an important refill of tws during hydrological year 2013 these results complement previously published studies if grace spatial resolution is widely recognized to be around 300 km the minimum size of the river basin to which grace data can be applied has been investigated by few studies rodell et al 2007 investigated the potential to estimate mississippi groundwater mass variations with grace data and soil moisture and snow water equivalent outputs from global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 models they found that they could not retrieve the groundwater seasonal cycle correctly for basins smaller than 900 000 km2 however as highlighted by wouters et al 2014 this study was done with the first release of grace products and rodell et al 2007 considered that the main source of error was due to the grace product itself since then grace data processing has been quite improved and new techniques have been developed to study smaller basins for example longuevergne et al 2010 have developed a methodology to derive grace tws for some basins with drainage area close to mission resolution limit this method has shown improvements on tws estimation for a 200 000 km2 aquifer in the us high plains aquifer compared to grace global solutions lorenz et al 2014 estimated that smaller catchments could be observed as long as the tws annual cycle has important amplitude variations vishwakarma et al 2018 investigated the issue of grace spatial resolution for hydrology studies they demonstrated that if theoretically the spatial resolution is related to the band limit of the spherical harmonic spectrum of the grace datasets in practice because of the noise and corrections applied to grace data the complete band limited signal cannot be retrieved and the spatial resolution of grace cannot be clearly set they estimated that for a catchment size around 63 000 km2 observation error should be at a level of 2 cm in equivalent water height so accuracy around 1 26 km3 of equivalent water volume our results are coherent with lorenz et al 2014 and vishwakarma et al 2018 findings twsa important seasonal and interannual variability is the reason why grace solutions compare well to sim and swat model outputs over the 50 000 km2 garonne basin 3 2 analysis of modeled hydrology compartments contrarily to grace hydrological models provide estimates of water stored in all modeled hydrology compartments fig 7 shows contribution of water stored in all modeled compartments to the 2003 2010 twsa mean annual cycle for sim fig 7 a and swat fig 7 b most twsa is due to soil water among which the shallow aquifer connected to the river stores an important quantity of water according to swat swat deep aquifer contribution to twsa is one order of magnitude lower than other compartments despite the fact that its mean absolute water storage is the most important one rivers contribution to twsa is quite small compared to other compartments as floodplain storage is quite limited and does not last more than a few days sim and swat do not model lakes and reservoirs in this study however lakes and reservoirs contribution to twsa might not be that important as there are no big reservoirs or lakes within the basin snow has more impact on twsa during winter logically water intercepted by vegetation is negligible so in summary most of the garonne twsa is due to the first dozen meters of soil and to the shallow aquifer connected to the river the small contribution of surface water mainly from snow to twsa for the garonne basin must be due to the size of the basin which cannot store important mass of water in floodplains or in the river network at monthly time scale unlike big river basins some previous studies using grace data on big river basins indicated that surface water has more impact on twsa for example becker et al 2018 estimated that water stored in surface water bodies floodplains lakes rivers and wetlands contributes to 19 5 of the annual variations of grace twsa in the congo river basin during the time period 2003 2007 as summarize by frappart and ramilien 2018 surface water bodies could even be responsible of 40 to 50 of the twsa annual variations for basin with important floodplains like the amazon papa et al 2013 orinoco frappart et al 2015 or ganges brahmaputra papa et al 2015 basins these results are actually coherent with the results obtained for the garonne basin indeed the main compartments contributing to garonne twsa are the first dozen meters of soil and the shallow aquifer connected to the river so compartments closely connected to surface waters and the atmosphere interface 3 3 basin scale water balance as described in section 2 4 2 the possibility to compute garonne basin water balance using both grace data and sim swat inputs and outputs has been investigated correlation coefficient and nse between grace solutions δ t w s and p etr q from models have been computed to assess their consistency table 5 as they should be similar eq 2 different p etr q have been tested only from sim inputs outputs first line of table 5 only from swat inputs outputs second line of table 5 p etr from sim or swat and in situ q at tonneins from banque hydro database third and fourth line of table 5 respectively and a composite estimate of p etr q with p from safran etr the mean between sim and swat etr and q from in situ gauge fifth line of table 5 only δ t w s from csr and gsfc mascons solutions have been considered as section 3 1 showed they best compare to sim and swat twsa δ t w s from sim and swat is also computed and compared to grace ones last lines of table 5 δ t w s from csr mascon solutions has a correlation coefficient around 0 7 with the different p etr q estimates but exhibits poor nse they are all negative much better results are obtained with δ t w s from gsfc mascon solution which has correlation coefficient around 0 8 and nse around 0 4 with the different p etr q estimates correlation and nse are pretty similar for the four p etr q estimates correlation and nse are better between grace mascon solutions δ t w s and models δ t w s around 0 86 and 0 68 for csr mascon solution respectively and 0 9 and 0 8 for gsfc mascon solution respectively surprisingly correlation and nse are slightly worse between csr mascon and gsfc mascon 0 88 and 0 59 respectively than between the mascon solutions and the models this highlights the spread of the grace solutions because of differences in their processing even if they are based on the same raw measurements these differences are exacerbated by the small size of the basin compared to the grace products resolutions it also shows that at least for the garonne basin the gsfc mascon solution seems to be the best suitable solution for basin scale water balance study fig 8 a shows sim and swat p etr q time series along with csr and gsfc mascon solutions δ t w s it shows the overall good agreement between the datasets and some high frequency variations in swat p etr q which are not present in other datasets this could explain why nse between swat and gsfc mascon is lower than for sim fig 8 b presents monthly accumulated safran precipitation time series over the basin along with sim and swat etr and q if models etr and q are similar sim q and etr are slightly more correlated to safran precipitation that s why swat p etr q has more high frequency variations than sim p etr q in order to analyze more easily interannual variations of precipitation evapotranspiration and discharge their hydrological yearly mean has been computed for both models fig 8 c swat evapotranspiration in average is always lower than sim their discharges have similar values even if sim discharge is more correlated to precipitation than swat from fig 8 c it appears that important precipitation that occur during hydrological years 2004 2009 and 2013 have relatively low impact on evapotranspiration whereas river discharge increased during these years on the contrary important precipitation during year 2007 was concomitant with higher evapotranspiration and lower discharge concerning 2005 2011 and 2012 dry years evapotranspiration did not exhibit important increase or drop compared to other years even if its lowest value occurred during hydrological year 2011 it should be highlighted that small variations of etr at yearly time scale does not mean that etr could not have important variations at seasonal time scale grusson et al 2018 besides some important rain events if they occur over a short time period might saturate the soil very quickly and or might increase runoff with few impacts on vegetation and etr explaining the difference between etr and precipitation on fig 8 c concerning discharge it drops significantly in 2011 and 2012 so the minimum twsa observed in 2012 see section 3 1 and fig 6 is mainly due to an important precipitation drop an evapotranspiration rate that was close to other years and the fact that preceding year was also very dry i e memory effect of tws during this drought period the most important one within the studied period the situation was so critical that many localities in the basin have been officially recognized by the french government as having experienced natural disaster république française 2012 table 6 gives correlation and nse for time series without their mean annual cycle between csr and gsfc mascon solutions δ t w s and the different p etr q estimates gsfc mascon solution still provides the best correlation coefficient around 0 55 but the nse remains quite low 2 3 for csr mascon and 1 for gsfc mascon gsfc mascon and models δ t w s remains well correlated even without their mean annual cycles with a good nse 0 6 again gsfc mascon δ t w s better compares with models than with csr mascon δ t w s from these comparisons it is clear that gsfc mascon solution is better suited than csr mascon solution for computing δ t w s to study the garonne basin water balance they compare well to models p etr q however when the mean annual cycle is removed the nse is pretty low this must be due to low spatial resolution of grace data leading to noisy water mass estimates which are quite coarse compared to garonne basin size the fact that the temporal derivative from eq 1 is approximated by a second order central difference eq 3 might also add errors but another source of error is the use of δ t w s instead of more accurate δtws see section 2 4 2 for example correlation and nse between sim p etr q and sim δ t w s are equal to 0 87 and 0 59 respectively if these results are better than the ones obtained between sim p etr q and grace mascon solutions they are not that far from the comparison between gsfc mascon δ t w s and sim p etr q correlation coefficient and nse equal to 0 76 and 0 44 respectively see table 5 for grace solutions evaluated in this study only δ t w s are available however for models the more accurate δtws could be computed to check the uncertainty due to this approximation for example fig 9 a shows sim p etr q orange line and sim δ t w s dashed blue line clearly p etr q has more variability than δ t w s which is smoother however p etr q and δtws are almost identical fig 9 b their correlation coefficient and nse are almost 1 0 999 and 0 998 respectively therefore results from table 5 and 6 are mainly due to grace coarse resolution both in space and time the fact that δ t w s tends to be smoother than p etr q fig 9 a might not be an issue for big river basins analyzed in previous studies however for 50 000 km2 basins like the garonne using monthly mean twsa will prevent to properly close the water balance equation some mismatch between grace mascon δ t w s and models p etr q could also be due to model issue especially sim and swat models do not consider actual irrigation reservoirs and lakes finally if precipitation comes from the most accurate database available over france mainland safran it still has some errors that could impact the comparison 4 conclusions and perspectives this study inter compared twsa from seven grace satellite mission solutions with twsa computed from two hydrological models sim and swat over the 50 000 km2 garonne basin between august 2002 and july 2014 despite that the garonne basin is smaller than estimated grace spatial resolution a good agreement between grace solutions and hydrological model twsa has been found especially grace mascon solutions from csr and gsfc best match sim and swat models twsa with correlation and nse above 0 9 and 0 7 respectively it also validates that sim and swat models have enough physical processes to model correctly twsa at basin scale this good agreement is due to the important amplitude of the garonne annual cycle even if grace solutions and models annual cycle are 1 month shifted overall it seems that some grace solutions provide meaningful observation for the garonne basin despite its small size compared to grace resolution the analysis of models outputs showed twsa in the garonne basin is mainly due to water stored in the first dozen meters of soil and in the shallow aquifer connected to the river to a smaller extent snow also influences garonne twsa open surface water river network twsa is quite small and twsa from deep aquifer and vegetation is negligible grace gsfc mascon solution δ t w s best matches models p etr q yet the basin scale water balance is not close it is due to grace poor spatial resolution compared to garonne basin size but also as shown in this study because of its monthly time resolution preventing the computation of accurate δtws this issue might not be important for big river basins but for the garonne basin δ t w s is too smooth compared to monthly accumulated p etr q more work is needed to assess the reasons of the differences between grace and hydrological models it is needed to better characterize sources of errors in grace solutions like leakage error and maybe to apply more local processing techniques like the one proposed by longuevergne et al 2010 using recently released sub monthly grace solutions e g kurtenbach et al 2012 ramillien et al 2015 might also help to compute a more accurate garonne basin water balance sim and swat models used in this study currently represent state of the art hydrological modeling of the garonne basin yet they do not take into account lakes reservoirs and irrigation taking these effects into account would be important to improve our understanding of water fluxes within the basin doing a thorough sensitivity study on the models parameters and forcing should also help to better quantify models uncertainties garonne basin is quite impacted by human activities reservoirs irrigated agriculture especially during low flow sauquet et al 2009 their impact on tws at basin scale is still unclear and more ancillary data should be collected to investigate this link and to determine if grace data are accurate enough to observe these impacts finally grace follow on grace fo grace successor was launched may 22nd 2018 validating grace fo accuracy on the garonne basin and its potential improvement compared to grace would be valuable to extend twsa observation time series as the basin is still experiencing important drought
