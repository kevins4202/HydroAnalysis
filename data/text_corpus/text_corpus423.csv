2115,under a warmer climate streamflow from the pan arctic river basins exhibits increasing trends in recent years the higher streamflow would have a large impact on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the arctic even the globe however due to the limited observation data and the complex hydrologic processes in the polar river basins it is challenging to simulate and to predict the streamflow under the impact of climate change this study applied support vector regression model svr artificial neural network ann and multi variable regression mlr model to simulate the monthly streamflow of four major pan arctic river basins mackenzie river basin ob river basin lena river basin and yenisei river basin after validating the svms with datasets independent of the calibration experience the svms were used to predict the monthly streamflow of the four large pan arctic river basins under the climate projection scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 of five cmip6 gcms bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr for 2020 2100 results show that 1 the precipitation and temperature are both projected to increase by almost five gcms in almost river basins with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than ssp245 2 with wetter and warmer climate the annual streamflow was projected to increase continuously over the twenty first century for mackenzie lena and yenisei river significantly with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than ssp245 the ob river does not show significant increasing trends in its annual streamflow 3 the higher annual streamflow of lena and yenisei river basins mainly come from the increase in summer streamflow while for meckanzie the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly as its higher winter streamflow compenstates its lower summer streamflow the annual streamflow of the ob river is projected with minimal changes in addition the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate results of this study agree with previous findings that the arctic streamflow is increasing but this study also demonstrate different responses in seasonal streamflow between the river basins to warmer temperature and higher precipitation which is largely controlled by the respectiver terrestrial environment of the river basins keywords climate change arctic amplification pan arctic river basin streamflow modeling climate scenarios of cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with one third of the total freshwater inflow to the arctic ocean the streamflow from pan arctic river basins is one of the main freshwater sources to the arctic ocean shiklomanov et al 2021 white et al 2007 and the variations of this streamflow have large effects on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the arctic for example the streamflow freshens and warms the top layer of the shelf sea that affect the formation and break up of sea ice park et al 2021 it also affects the ecosystem and fishing industry through influencing the vertical mixing of the ocean water that brings heat and mass upward providing essential ingredients to the seasonal phytoplankton blooms bintanja et al 2018 under climate change impact the arctic is warming much faster than the global average known as the arctic amplification bring et al 2016 serreze et al 2009 shiklomanov et al 2021 under a warmer climate the hydroclimatological and terrestrial environment of the polar regions have changed significantly such as higher precipitation extensive permafrost thawing and vegetation greening in the tundra which is one of the significant terrestrial impacts of climate change according to the lattest assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change parmesan et al 2022 the streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the combined effects of simutaneous hydrological climatological and terrestrial changes was observed to increase which in turn affect the arctic atmospheric and oceanic circulations shiklomanov et al 2021 yang et al 2021 it is important to better understand the future variations and mechanism of streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the impact of climate change there have been some recent studies concerning changes of streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the effects of climate change the increase in the total streamflow is large with high heterogeneities resulted from differences between river basins in terms of the ecosystem size of river basins influence of human activities and changes to permafrost regimes feng et al 2021 shiklomanov et al 2013 with the projected warmer climate from gcms the streamflow from pan arctic river basins is projected to increase over the twenty first century bring et al 2017 koirala et al 2014 van vliet et al 2013 the hydrological regimes for some river basins like the mackenzie river basin of canada and the lena river basin of siberia are found to experience substantial changes such as increased winter and spring streamflow at the expense of summer streamflow melnikov et al 2019b scheepers et al 2018 the large scale and extensive degradation of permafrost that feeds the groundwater was found to contribute to higher winter streamflow melnikov et al 2019a wang et al 2021a b but for some river basins like the athabasca river basin in canada changes are different the warmer climate shortens the snowfall season and increases the rate of sublimation resulting in less snowpack in the spring and lower summer streamflow kerkhoven and gan 2011 for the ob river the variation of streamflow in the future can be ambiguous because under a warmer climate the steppe and forest steppe in the river basin would lead to a significant increase in evapotranpiration which with a marginal increase in the projected precipitation the changes to its future streamflow is unclear magritsky et al 2018 to reveal the variations of streamflow pan arctic river basins under the changing climate we analyzed the streamflow from four largest pan arctic river basins mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river that contribute more than half of the total streamflow into the arctic ocean with machine learning models driven by projections of selected cmip6 gcms machine learning models have been widely used in the hydrological field in recent decades because of it is not restricted by assumptions such as normality linearity and variable independency artificial neural networks ann have a strong ability of mapping nonlinearities that are usually found in hydrologic time series cheng et al 2020 which makes it a popular tool in forecasting streamflow at multiple time scales humphrey et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the prediction of streamflow in ungagged catchment meresa 2019 drought forecasting borji et al 2016 khan et al 2020 modeling of groundwater level rajaee et al 2019 and so on however anns have intrinsic drawbacks such as slow convergence possible non consistent performance achieving local instead of global optimum solutions and over fitting problems guo et al 2011 another widely used machine learning method is support vector machine models svms developed by vapnik 1997 and collegues in at t bell laboratory svms convert an original problem into a quadratic programming problem that can obtain the global optimum solution guo et al 2011 and also function as a classification method based on the vapnik chervonenkis theory vapnik and chervonenkis 2015 comparing with the conventional neural network method svms also have advantages of good generalization ability high efficiency and tend to perform better with small training data samples there have been numerous studies conducted using svms such as the extreme streamflow modeling wu et al 2014 regional flood frequency analysis gizaw and gan 2016 downscaling of precipitation for climate change scenarios tripathi et al 2006 and the streamflow forcasting for snowmelt driven catchment kalra et al 2013 this is one of the first studies using machine learning models to model hydrological processes of four main arctic river basins undergoing rapidly changing hydro climatological environment mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river basins it is always challenging to model hyrological processes in large scale polar river basins due to a lack of knowledge about the physical mechnisms and the limited observations bui et al 2020 feng et al 2021 lammers et al 2001 shiklomanov et al 2002 machine learning ml models selected in this study predict the streamflow of large pan arctic river basins using key variables that affect hydro climatological and the terrestrial processes simultaneously the potential of the selected ml model in predicting the streamflow of large polar river basins in response to projected climate change scenarios is demonstrated in this study this paper is organized as follows technical details of models selected for this study are described in section 2 the streamflow data and climate variables as predictors are described in section 3 the training and testing of models are presented in section 4 as well as the projected streamflow under projected climate change scenarios of cmip6 gcms for the arctic the uncertainties of hydrologic projections are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are given in section 6 2 study site and data 2 1 streamflow data four of the largest northern river basins that drain into the arctic ocean mackenzie river in north america ob river yenisei river and lena river in siberia abbreviated as moly are considered in this study starting from here the river names should be interpreted as referring to the entire river basins and not just the watercourse of the river the total drainage area of moly is 10 439 000 km2 in which the mackenzie river basin has an area of 1 805 000 km2 ob river basin of 2 975 000 km2 lena river basin of 2 430 000 km2 and yenisei river basin of 2 554 000 km2 the average total annual streamflow of moly is 57 663 68 m3 s of which mackenzie discharges 9127 48 m3 s of freshwater into the beaufort sea in the arctic ocean ob discharges 12 660 82 m3 s into the kara sea lena discharges 17 221 51 m3 s into laptev sea and yenisei discharges 18 653 88 m3 s into kara sea the above discharges are measured at the respective gauging station closest to the outlet of each river basin of moly as shown in fig 1 the station of mackenzie river basin at tsiigehtchic 67 45 n 133 74 w the station of ob river basin at salekhard 66 63 n 66 60 e the station of lena river basin at kyusyur 70 68 n 127 39 e and the station of yenisei river is located at igarka 67 43 n 86 48 e the observation period differs among moly such that ob river has the longest record since 1930 lena river and yenisei river have records since 1935 while the mackenzie river basin only has records since 1972 the long term monthly streamflow of siberia have been observed systematically subjected to quality controlled and archived by the russian hydrometeorological services until 1999 shiklomanov et al 2000 which are available from the r arcticnet v 2 0 regional hydrographic data network for the pan arctic region cd rom after 1999 under the direction of the arctic and antarctic research institute streamflow data is available from arctic great river observation arcgro shiklomanov et al 2020 the study periods of moly are 1972 2018 1930 2018 1935 2018 and 1936 2018 respectively 2 2 hydroclimatic predictors in this study hydro climatological variables at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution were extracted from the cru ts 4 03 of the university of east anglia harris 2020 although this dataset has less variables than some other reanalysis dataset such as ncep ncar reanalysis i and era interim cru ts 4 03 has longer records from 1901 01 to 2021 12 and has a higher spatial resolution predictors taken from this dataset as inputs to the statistical and machine learning models include monthly precipitation pre mm potential evapotranspiration pet mm near surface temperature ta near surface temperature maximum tmax and near surface temperature minimum tmin time series of each climate variable at grids located within the outlines of the four river basins are extracted from cru ts 4 03 and areally averaged into one time series per basin as the predictors of streamflow 2 3 cmip6 dataset to project the future streamflow of moly five gcms from cmip6 o neill et al 2016 are selected bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr because of their good performance in simulating arctic precipitation and temperature with relatively high spatial resolutions cai et al 2021 davy and outten 2020 dong and dong 2021 lalande et al 2021 precipitation near surface temperature and variables to calculate the pet including the specific humidity 10 m wind speed surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation data at a monthly timescale for two ssp scenarios ssp245and ssp585 were selected historical data is used to estimate the bias corrected parameters ssp245scenarios from cmip6 projects a moderate development shared socioeconomic pathway ssp with a 4 5 w m 2 radiative forcing rcp4 5 in cmip5 o neill et al 2016 ssp585 of cmip6 projects a fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway with a 8 5 w m 2 radiative forcing rcp8 5 in cmip5 under these two ssp scenarios the projected global surface temperature increase in 2081 2100 relative to 1850 1900 will be about 2 6 and 4 5 respectively spm ipcc 2021 under these two ssp climate scenarios the streamflow of moly are simulated using the ml models to investigate the variations of hydrologic impact of climate change over the 21st century 3 research methodology 3 1 support vector regression the support vector regression algorithm svr was firstly developed as a class of nonlinear search algorithm based on a statistical learning theory cortes and vapnik 1995 which was then combined with regression techniques drucker et al 1997 suppose the training data are x i y i n x i is the input vector y i is the output vector svr could be written as 1 f w φ x b where w and b denote a weighting vector and bias respectively φ is a transitive function which maps the input space into a high dimensional space the penalty function is used in svr 2 f i y i ε n o p e n a l t y f i y i ε p e n a l t y when the estimated output is within the ε intensive tube representing the allowable error the loss value will be zero parameters of the regression function could be obtained by optimizing the objective function 3 m i n 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n l ε y i f i 4 m a x 0 ε where the constant c weighs the model complexity and the empirical risk as c increases the relative importance of the empirical risk will increase svr is fine tuned by the bayesian optimization approach implemented through the mlbayesopt package in r adankon et al 2011 details about svr could be found in gizaw and gan 2016 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 liang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 mosavi et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 3 2 artificial neural network artificial neural network ann has been widely used in streamflow simulation and prediction ghumman et al 2011 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 kalteh 2013 among ann feed forward back propagation ffbp network models consist of an input layer any number of hidden layers an output layer and the neuron connections between the three layers the widely used three layer model is satisfactory for most hydrologic applications a typical three layer ffbp network is shown in fig 2 in which a b and c indicate the input the hidden and the output layers respectively and w is the weight assigned to each neuron connection it should be noted that neuron connections exist between neurons from different layers so that neurons within a layer are not interconnected to each other the weights of neuron connections are adjusted iteratively to minimize the difference between the actual output vector and the desired output vector each neuron in the hidden layer could be recognized as a linear regression model that consists of the input weight bias and the output the activation function determines whether the neuron of the hidden layer is activated to transform the information to the next layer the expression for the output of a three layered ffbp model is given in eq 5 5 y k j 1 m w jk h j ε k w i t h h j f j i 1 n w ij x i ε j where w ij is the weight of the connection between jth neuron in the hidden layer and the ith neuron in the input layer ε j is the bias for the jth neuron in the hidden layer f j is the activation function of the hidden neuron w jk is the weight for jth neuron in the hidden layer to the kth neuron in the output layer ε k is the bias for the kth neuron in the output layer 3 3 multiple linear regression another widely used data driven model multiple linear regression mlr model schilling and walter 2005 zhang et al 2018 is also used to simulate monthly streamflow from the four arctic river basins the mlr formula can be expressed as 6 y k β 0 i 1 n β i x i e where y k is the dependent variable β 0 is the y intercept β i is the regression coefficients for each independent variable x i e is the residual term the hydro climatological variables were also input into the mlr to predict the monthly streamflow 3 4 the model training and validating strategy ann mlr and svr models are developed to simulate the monthly streamflow of the four pan arctic river basins selected in this study a grid search algorithm was used to calibrate both the ann and mlr models since the length of streamflow time series of the river basins are different 80 of randomly selected monthly streamflow records of each were used to train the three models and the remaining 20 of monthly streamflow records were used to validate the calibrated models the amount of streamflow data used to train the models for the mackenzie river basin are 449 and 113 months of data independent of the training experience are used to validate the models calibrated for mackenzie river basin in ob river basin 852 monthly data are used to train the models and 214 monthly data used to validate the calibrated models for lena river basin yenisei river basin 805 795 monthly data are used to train the models and 202 199 monthly data are used to validate the calibrated models the accuracy of monthly streamflow data simulated by the models developed for the four pan arctic river basins is assessed using four statistical measures root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nash r squared r2 and the mean absolute error mae models that perform well will have relatively high nash and r2 but low rmse and mae and vice versa 3 5 the projection of future monthly streamflow under climate change impact the validated svm models are further used to predict the future monthly streamflow based on ssp shared social economic pathway climate change scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 of 5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 gcms bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr of the intergovernmental panel of climate change ipcc douville et al 2021 the monthly precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet calculated through the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 of the four pan arctic river basins for climate change scenarios of five cmip6 gcms were used as predictors the prediction of monthly streamflow under climate change impact is from 2020 to 2100 the bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd technique was applied to statistically downscale the hydro climatological variables its advantages are capturing trends in the regional climate and hydrologic interactions and the transient features of emissions scenarios werner 2011 the bcsd technique was conducted by the following steps in this study 1 the cru data at 0 5 0 5 and the cmip6 data at 1 1 was corrected with cru data into 1 1 by a quantile mapping algorithm which is implemented through the qmap package in r 2 the correction factor f at each 1 1 grid in each month were calculated as the ratio of the corrected cmip6 precipitation to the multi year mean precipitation from cru data when calculating precipitation or as the difference between the corrected cmip6 temperature and the corresponding multi year mean temperature from cru when calculating temperature 3 the correlation factor f of the 1 1 grid is interpolated to 0 5 0 5 by bilinear interpolation algorithm in each month 4 the downscaled cmip6 precipitation temperature were obtained by multiplying add up the correction factors correlation factor f of the 0 5 0 5 grid for each by the multi year monthly mean precipitation temperature of 0 5 0 5 details about this procedures could be found in wu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2021 4 results 4 1 comparing performance of svr with ann and mlr models the monthly streamflow simulated by ann mlr and svr for the validation period is shown in fig 3 in which time series of the observed and simulated monthly streamflow and their scatterplots are presented the performance of these three models simulating the monthly streamflow of the moly river basins driven by the selected hydroclimatic predictors are summarised in table 1 in terms of r2 nash mae and rmse the svr model outperforms ann and mlr in simulating the spring peak and the winter low flows with high r2 and nash and low mae and rmse from the time series of monthly streamflow in fig 3 1 it was found that the simulated monthly streamflow from three models could generally match the observed streamflow with similar timing for the spring snowmelt peak and the winter low flow however there are discrepancies between simulated and observed high flow in spring fig 4 it is found that svr has lower relative errors than other two models in simulating the high flow in spring especially for the siberian river basins fig 4b c and d in fig 3 2 the streamflow simulated by mlr deviates the furthest from the 45 line in the scatterplots from the goodness of fit statistics mlr also has the lowest r2 and nash and highest mae and rmse among the three models table 1 as for ann models they have good performance in terms of the goodness of fit statistics table 1 and can model the low and medium flow of mackenzie river well fig 3 a2 but for the three siberian river basins it cannot simulate the variance of streamflow well especially errors of high flows tend to be large fig 3b2 c2 and d2 svm models have similar values of goodness of fit statistics with ann but have an overall better performance in simulating mostly more accurate streamflow than ann models especially for siberian rivers therefore svm models are used to project the future changes of streamflow in moly river basins 4 2 projected streamflow of moly river basins under climate warming impact to analyze the projected streamflow from moly the hydro climatological variables from ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios of five cmip6 gcms were extracted and statistically downscaled through bcsd approach with cru ts 4 03 data as basis therefore the cmip6 climate projections have the same spatial resolution as cru ts 4 03 data which was used to predict the future streamflow through calibrated svr models based on the the ssp245 and ssp585 climate projections of cmip6 gcms the precipitation over the four river basins is projected to increase in most of gcms during the second half of the twenty first century fig 5 1 some of gcms such as fio esm 2 0 cmcc esm2 and mpi esm1 2 hr project less precipitation in the 2080s 2081 2090 than in 2050s 2051 2060 for river basins under ssp 585 such as the mackenzie fig 5a1 ob fig 5b1 and yenisei fig 5d1 while other gcms project continuous increase in the precipitation from 2050s to 2080s under two scenarios fig 5 1 moreover there is also a gcm projecting drier climate in the lena river basin during 2050s than the base period 1970 2000 such as the mpi esm1 2 hr fig 5c1 comparing with the large difference of the projected precipitation within gcms the projected temperature shows consistent variance among gcms all five gcms project continuous increasing temperature from 2050s to 2080s fig 5 2 with different amplitudes some of gcms such as cmcc esm2 and fio esm 2 0 project large increase in temperature especially under ssp585 with the projected wetter climate in most scenarios of selected gcms the streamflow should increase but the evapotranspiration enhanced by a warmer climate vegetation greening and infiltration promoted by the permafrost thawing wound reduce the surface flow and increase the subsurface flow to reveal the projected changes within streamflow due to the projecte increases in the temperature and precipitation the validated svr models driven by statistically downscaled climate projected under ssp245 and ssp585 from five cmip6 gcms were used monthly streamflow under the projected wetter and warmer climate from 2020 to 2100 are therefore projected as shown in fig 6 the projected wetter and warmer climate result in higher streamflow in nearly all river basins for most gcm projections which is consistent with previous studies based on other gcms van vliet et al 2013 for lena river the projected increase in the annual streamflow averaged from projected monthly streamflow is about 6 1 per decades under ssp245 and 14 6 under ssp585 durong 2020 2100 respectively fig 6c which is the fastest among the four river basins for yenisei river the second fastest the annual streamflow is projected to increase by 4 6 per dacade under ssp245 and 9 9 per dacade under ssp585 respectively fig 6d the annual streamflow from the mackenzie river basin also projected to increase by 2 3 per decade under ssp245 and 4 9 per decade under ssp585 respectively fig 6a but for ob river the annual streamflow during 2020 2100 is projected to be consistent with the historical variations for almost gcms under both ssp scenarios fig 6b to further analyze the projected streamflow the flow regime that shows the annual distribution of streamflow were analyzed as shown in fig 7 the streamflow of each month from 2020s to 2090s were presented in radarmaps to show the temporal changes the annual streamflow hydrograph for each river basin is projected to change significantly under most gcms projections for lena and yenisei river basins projecting large increase in annual streamflows the july streamflow which has been the largest will increase further under a wetter and warmer climate while the streamflow in june and august are also projected to increase significantly under all gcms projections fig 7c and d some of gcms such as fio esm 2 0 and cmcc esm2 that both project high increase in precipitation and temperature project large increase in the summer streamflow therefore the projected increase in summer streamflow could be the main contributor of major increase in the annual streamflow for lena and yenisei river for the mackenzie river the streamflow is projected to increase most months by different gcms the ensemble mean shows more obvious increase in january and december streamflows than other months fig 7a6 and the annual distribution of streamflow from the mackenzie river basin is projected to be uniform a few gcms project significant changes in months with largest streamflow such as cmcc esm2 under ssp585 in the end of the 21st century fig 7a3 for the ob river the projected annual hydrographs have large variance among gcms the ensemble mean shows the high flow month advance from july to june due to an earlier snowmelt under a warmer climate kerkhoven and gan 2011 with higher streamflow between january and june at the expense of summer streamflow in july and august fig 7b6 the projected changes in temperature precipitation and streamflow for the four arctic river basins with respect to the 1970 2000 baseline historical periods of the five gcms of cmip6 by the end of the twenty first century 2070 2099 are compared and presented in fig 8 because the arctic is warming much faster than the global average the mean annual temperature in moly is projected to increase by 6 3 7 1 7 7 and 7 2 respectively fig 8a which are significantly higher than the projected global average of about 4 3 under ssp585 while the precipitation by 14 9 24 and 15 respectively fig 8b the streamflow from the four river basins under ssp585 at the end of the twenty first century is projected to increase by 17 4 39 and 48 respectively under ssp245 scenarios the mean annual temperature in four river basins are projected to increase by 3 7 4 3 4 7 and 4 4 respectively at the end of twenty first century which are still higher than the projected global average of about 2 6 under ssp245 fig 7a correspondingly the precipitation in moly is projected to increase by 12 11 16 and 12 respectively fig 7b the corresponding mean streamflow is projected by svrs to increase by 7 1 21 and 28 based on the climate scenarios of four gcms fig 7a it is noted that for the ob river some gcms such as fio esm 2 0 bcc csm2 mr and mpi esm1 2 hr project higher temperature as much as other river basins but the projected increase in precipitation is much lower than other three basins which is consistent with the results of magritsky et al 2018 5 discussions of results the future streamflow of the four pan arctic river basins over the 21st century under the climate change scenarios is projected by the svr model of which three basins show continuous increasing trends for the arctic warming is amplified by about twice to four times rantanen et al 2022 the global rate since the 1980s known as the arctic amplification attributed to several feedback mechanisms namely ice albedo temperature planck lapse rate water vapor co2 and cloud feedbacks with higher air temperature the stronger moisture poleward transport is expected to contribute to significant increase in the arctic precipitation bintanja et al 2020 that makes the arctic wetter as expected all cmip6 gcms selected in this study unanimously project increase in precipitation and temperature under both ssp245 and ssp585 climate scenarios with different amplitudes figs 5 and 8 due to higher precipitation the streamflow from mackenzie lena and yenisei river basins is projected to increase except the ob river these differences are the results of different projected precipitation and different terrestrial conditions the strong warming reduces the streamflow through higher evaporation loss vegetation greening that increases the canopy interception and transpiration berner et al 2020 kerkhoven and gan 2013 myers smith et al 2020 and permafrost thawing that enhances the soil infiltration wang et al 2021a b these hydrological changes could offset the positive effects of higher precipitation on the streamflow with the least increase in projected precipitation the ob river is expected to experience the least changes in its streamflow and for other three river basins lena river is projected with the largest increase in streamflow partly because its projected precipitation is the largest the higher summer streamflow is the main contributor to the projected increase in the annual streamflow the winter streamflow is also projected to increase in some river basins such as the mackenzie ob and lena river basins which could partly because permafrost thawing that enhances the groundwater discharge wang et al 2021a b therefore the variation of future streamflow are responses of the terrestrial environmental to a combination of increasing precipitation and increasing temperature however without adequate observations and site experiments in such large river basins in the pan arctic river basin detailed mechanisms behind the response of terrestrial environment to the climate warming remains unclear the findings of this study demonstrate the increasing trends of streamflow simulated by the svr models for the pan arctic river basins subjected to climate scenarios of five gcms of cmip6 as a major source of freshwater to the arctic ocean shiklomanov et al 2021 the increase in the streamflow of the arctic river basins would have crucial influence on the arctic even the global oceanic and atmospheric circulations studies show that with increasing streamflow the arctic ocean is undergoing a freshening trend mcphee et al 1998 shu et al 2018 that could influence the ocean salinity stratification bintanja et al 2018 yang et al 2016 the heat and mass balance of the arctic atmosphere park et al 2020 and global thermohaline circulation anderson et al 2004 besides the freshwater the river input also brings heat enhancing the early melt of sea ice and sea surface warming park et al 2021 the gigantic global effects brought by shorter and low sea ice cover have been widely known and extensively studied the shrinking of arctic sea ice has been found to have significant relationship to the extreme weather in mid latitude through the rossby wave the polar vortex or large scale cliamte patterns ding and wu 2021 fu et al 2021 li et al 2021 mccrystall and screen 2021 mccrystall et al 2021 smith et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 moreover nutrients organic carbon and other substances brought by higher river input would also have impact on the ecosystem of the arctic holmes et al 2012 torres valdés et al 2013 the uncertainties of the projected climate change impact to moly come from the climate change scenarios projected by the selected cmip6 gcms statistical downscaling techniques the data driven svr models and limitations of available data the uncertainties from the climate projection by gcms could be reduced through using the ensemble means of multi gcms instead of individual gcms and the limitation of available data mainly refers to the limited number of meteorology stations which could provide reliable hydro climatological data but given the reliability of cru data has been demonstrated globally the uncertainty from data sources is acceptable therefore we mainly discusse the uncertainties from the model and downscaling techniques the overall good performance of svms in simulating the streamflow of major arctic river basins is acceptable with nash sutcliffe efficiency and r2 higher than 0 8 in nearly all river basins with limited predictors and training data svm could adequately capture the increasingly dynamic non linear non stationary and chaotic characteristics of the streamflow of the pan arctic river basins the robustness of svm makes it a popular tool in modeling hydrologic processes of river basins worldwide in recent years khoi et al 2022 ren et al 2018 wu et al 2014 however similar with most data driven models it is also challenging for svm to simulate accurate peak flow there have been studies combining the traditional svm with decompose techniques such as wavelet analysis that decompose the monthly streamflow according to frequency characteristics and reduce or eliminate noises that reduces the uncertainties within the simulated peak flow to a certain extent guo et al 2011 kisi and cimen 2011 the occurences of peak flow are extreme conditions possibly related to large scale climate patterns which have been shown to interact with global streamflows therefore relating streamflow to the possible influences of certain large scale climate patterns may improve the simulations of peak flows of arctic river basins besides integrating data driven models with other techniques there are studies using large scale climate patterns to forecast streamflow kalra et al 2013 this study has demonstrated the potential of svms in the simulation of streamflow from pan arctic river basins our future work will focus on improving the performance of svms in the peak flow simulation though coupling with decomposition techniques or by an ensemble framework with extreme value statistical models the statistical downscaling technique bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd is selected to downscale simulated precipitation and temperature of gcms to the local scale of the moly river basins because it has been shown to be skillful in downscaling monthly precipitation and temperature yang et al 2019 simulated precipitation and temperature data of cmip6 downscaled by bcsd are assessed against the cru dataset using statistics such as the correlation coefficients rmse and the ratio of variances fig s1 as expected uncertainties of precipitation data simulated by all five gcms are higher than that of temperature in all four river basins because precipitation is more variable spatially than temperature the application of bcsd could increase the accuracy and reduce the uncertainties of simulated precipitation and temperature at basin scale effectively especially the precipitation data fig s1 a bcsd has also been applied in other studies yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 6 summary and conclusions in this study the impact of climate change on four major pan arctic river basins mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river basin are analyzed the monthly streamflow of these basins are projected by svm models driven by ssp245 and ssp585 climate changes scenarios of five cmip6 gcms three main findings of this study ① the projected temperature of the four river basins are all higher than the global average under two scenarios for all selected cmip6 gcms which is consistent with the arctic amplification phenomenon while precipitation is projected to increase in most gcms with but with large variance overall a wetter and warmer climate is projected in pan arctic river basins from cmip6 gcms ② under this wetter and warmer climate the annual streamflow is projected to increase over 2020 2100 for mackenzie lena and yenisei rivers significantly with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than that under ssp245 scenarios of all gcms however the ob river does not show significant increasing trend in its annual streamflow ③ from the annual streamflow hydrograph it is found that the projected increase in the annual streamflow of lena and yenisei river basins mainly come from higher summer streamflow while for the mackenzie river basin the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly and minimal projected change in the annual streamflow from ob river is due to the offsetting of higher winter streamflow by lower summer streamflow in addition the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies that the arctic streamflow is increasing generally and deepens the understanding about the variations of seasonal streamflow that response differently to warmer temperature and higher precipitation projected by gcms as the variations of streamflow involves active responses of multiple arctic hydrological processes to the climate change long term climate and hydrologic observations in the arctic are essential to better understand the

2115,under a warmer climate streamflow from the pan arctic river basins exhibits increasing trends in recent years the higher streamflow would have a large impact on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the arctic even the globe however due to the limited observation data and the complex hydrologic processes in the polar river basins it is challenging to simulate and to predict the streamflow under the impact of climate change this study applied support vector regression model svr artificial neural network ann and multi variable regression mlr model to simulate the monthly streamflow of four major pan arctic river basins mackenzie river basin ob river basin lena river basin and yenisei river basin after validating the svms with datasets independent of the calibration experience the svms were used to predict the monthly streamflow of the four large pan arctic river basins under the climate projection scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 of five cmip6 gcms bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr for 2020 2100 results show that 1 the precipitation and temperature are both projected to increase by almost five gcms in almost river basins with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than ssp245 2 with wetter and warmer climate the annual streamflow was projected to increase continuously over the twenty first century for mackenzie lena and yenisei river significantly with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than ssp245 the ob river does not show significant increasing trends in its annual streamflow 3 the higher annual streamflow of lena and yenisei river basins mainly come from the increase in summer streamflow while for meckanzie the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly as its higher winter streamflow compenstates its lower summer streamflow the annual streamflow of the ob river is projected with minimal changes in addition the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate results of this study agree with previous findings that the arctic streamflow is increasing but this study also demonstrate different responses in seasonal streamflow between the river basins to warmer temperature and higher precipitation which is largely controlled by the respectiver terrestrial environment of the river basins keywords climate change arctic amplification pan arctic river basin streamflow modeling climate scenarios of cmip6 data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction with one third of the total freshwater inflow to the arctic ocean the streamflow from pan arctic river basins is one of the main freshwater sources to the arctic ocean shiklomanov et al 2021 white et al 2007 and the variations of this streamflow have large effects on the atmospheric and oceanic circulation of the arctic for example the streamflow freshens and warms the top layer of the shelf sea that affect the formation and break up of sea ice park et al 2021 it also affects the ecosystem and fishing industry through influencing the vertical mixing of the ocean water that brings heat and mass upward providing essential ingredients to the seasonal phytoplankton blooms bintanja et al 2018 under climate change impact the arctic is warming much faster than the global average known as the arctic amplification bring et al 2016 serreze et al 2009 shiklomanov et al 2021 under a warmer climate the hydroclimatological and terrestrial environment of the polar regions have changed significantly such as higher precipitation extensive permafrost thawing and vegetation greening in the tundra which is one of the significant terrestrial impacts of climate change according to the lattest assessment report of intergovernmental panel on climate change parmesan et al 2022 the streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the combined effects of simutaneous hydrological climatological and terrestrial changes was observed to increase which in turn affect the arctic atmospheric and oceanic circulations shiklomanov et al 2021 yang et al 2021 it is important to better understand the future variations and mechanism of streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the impact of climate change there have been some recent studies concerning changes of streamflow from pan arctic river basins under the effects of climate change the increase in the total streamflow is large with high heterogeneities resulted from differences between river basins in terms of the ecosystem size of river basins influence of human activities and changes to permafrost regimes feng et al 2021 shiklomanov et al 2013 with the projected warmer climate from gcms the streamflow from pan arctic river basins is projected to increase over the twenty first century bring et al 2017 koirala et al 2014 van vliet et al 2013 the hydrological regimes for some river basins like the mackenzie river basin of canada and the lena river basin of siberia are found to experience substantial changes such as increased winter and spring streamflow at the expense of summer streamflow melnikov et al 2019b scheepers et al 2018 the large scale and extensive degradation of permafrost that feeds the groundwater was found to contribute to higher winter streamflow melnikov et al 2019a wang et al 2021a b but for some river basins like the athabasca river basin in canada changes are different the warmer climate shortens the snowfall season and increases the rate of sublimation resulting in less snowpack in the spring and lower summer streamflow kerkhoven and gan 2011 for the ob river the variation of streamflow in the future can be ambiguous because under a warmer climate the steppe and forest steppe in the river basin would lead to a significant increase in evapotranpiration which with a marginal increase in the projected precipitation the changes to its future streamflow is unclear magritsky et al 2018 to reveal the variations of streamflow pan arctic river basins under the changing climate we analyzed the streamflow from four largest pan arctic river basins mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river that contribute more than half of the total streamflow into the arctic ocean with machine learning models driven by projections of selected cmip6 gcms machine learning models have been widely used in the hydrological field in recent decades because of it is not restricted by assumptions such as normality linearity and variable independency artificial neural networks ann have a strong ability of mapping nonlinearities that are usually found in hydrologic time series cheng et al 2020 which makes it a popular tool in forecasting streamflow at multiple time scales humphrey et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the prediction of streamflow in ungagged catchment meresa 2019 drought forecasting borji et al 2016 khan et al 2020 modeling of groundwater level rajaee et al 2019 and so on however anns have intrinsic drawbacks such as slow convergence possible non consistent performance achieving local instead of global optimum solutions and over fitting problems guo et al 2011 another widely used machine learning method is support vector machine models svms developed by vapnik 1997 and collegues in at t bell laboratory svms convert an original problem into a quadratic programming problem that can obtain the global optimum solution guo et al 2011 and also function as a classification method based on the vapnik chervonenkis theory vapnik and chervonenkis 2015 comparing with the conventional neural network method svms also have advantages of good generalization ability high efficiency and tend to perform better with small training data samples there have been numerous studies conducted using svms such as the extreme streamflow modeling wu et al 2014 regional flood frequency analysis gizaw and gan 2016 downscaling of precipitation for climate change scenarios tripathi et al 2006 and the streamflow forcasting for snowmelt driven catchment kalra et al 2013 this is one of the first studies using machine learning models to model hydrological processes of four main arctic river basins undergoing rapidly changing hydro climatological environment mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river basins it is always challenging to model hyrological processes in large scale polar river basins due to a lack of knowledge about the physical mechnisms and the limited observations bui et al 2020 feng et al 2021 lammers et al 2001 shiklomanov et al 2002 machine learning ml models selected in this study predict the streamflow of large pan arctic river basins using key variables that affect hydro climatological and the terrestrial processes simultaneously the potential of the selected ml model in predicting the streamflow of large polar river basins in response to projected climate change scenarios is demonstrated in this study this paper is organized as follows technical details of models selected for this study are described in section 2 the streamflow data and climate variables as predictors are described in section 3 the training and testing of models are presented in section 4 as well as the projected streamflow under projected climate change scenarios of cmip6 gcms for the arctic the uncertainties of hydrologic projections are discussed in section 5 and conclusions are given in section 6 2 study site and data 2 1 streamflow data four of the largest northern river basins that drain into the arctic ocean mackenzie river in north america ob river yenisei river and lena river in siberia abbreviated as moly are considered in this study starting from here the river names should be interpreted as referring to the entire river basins and not just the watercourse of the river the total drainage area of moly is 10 439 000 km2 in which the mackenzie river basin has an area of 1 805 000 km2 ob river basin of 2 975 000 km2 lena river basin of 2 430 000 km2 and yenisei river basin of 2 554 000 km2 the average total annual streamflow of moly is 57 663 68 m3 s of which mackenzie discharges 9127 48 m3 s of freshwater into the beaufort sea in the arctic ocean ob discharges 12 660 82 m3 s into the kara sea lena discharges 17 221 51 m3 s into laptev sea and yenisei discharges 18 653 88 m3 s into kara sea the above discharges are measured at the respective gauging station closest to the outlet of each river basin of moly as shown in fig 1 the station of mackenzie river basin at tsiigehtchic 67 45 n 133 74 w the station of ob river basin at salekhard 66 63 n 66 60 e the station of lena river basin at kyusyur 70 68 n 127 39 e and the station of yenisei river is located at igarka 67 43 n 86 48 e the observation period differs among moly such that ob river has the longest record since 1930 lena river and yenisei river have records since 1935 while the mackenzie river basin only has records since 1972 the long term monthly streamflow of siberia have been observed systematically subjected to quality controlled and archived by the russian hydrometeorological services until 1999 shiklomanov et al 2000 which are available from the r arcticnet v 2 0 regional hydrographic data network for the pan arctic region cd rom after 1999 under the direction of the arctic and antarctic research institute streamflow data is available from arctic great river observation arcgro shiklomanov et al 2020 the study periods of moly are 1972 2018 1930 2018 1935 2018 and 1936 2018 respectively 2 2 hydroclimatic predictors in this study hydro climatological variables at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution were extracted from the cru ts 4 03 of the university of east anglia harris 2020 although this dataset has less variables than some other reanalysis dataset such as ncep ncar reanalysis i and era interim cru ts 4 03 has longer records from 1901 01 to 2021 12 and has a higher spatial resolution predictors taken from this dataset as inputs to the statistical and machine learning models include monthly precipitation pre mm potential evapotranspiration pet mm near surface temperature ta near surface temperature maximum tmax and near surface temperature minimum tmin time series of each climate variable at grids located within the outlines of the four river basins are extracted from cru ts 4 03 and areally averaged into one time series per basin as the predictors of streamflow 2 3 cmip6 dataset to project the future streamflow of moly five gcms from cmip6 o neill et al 2016 are selected bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr because of their good performance in simulating arctic precipitation and temperature with relatively high spatial resolutions cai et al 2021 davy and outten 2020 dong and dong 2021 lalande et al 2021 precipitation near surface temperature and variables to calculate the pet including the specific humidity 10 m wind speed surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation data at a monthly timescale for two ssp scenarios ssp245and ssp585 were selected historical data is used to estimate the bias corrected parameters ssp245scenarios from cmip6 projects a moderate development shared socioeconomic pathway ssp with a 4 5 w m 2 radiative forcing rcp4 5 in cmip5 o neill et al 2016 ssp585 of cmip6 projects a fossil fueled development socioeconomic pathway with a 8 5 w m 2 radiative forcing rcp8 5 in cmip5 under these two ssp scenarios the projected global surface temperature increase in 2081 2100 relative to 1850 1900 will be about 2 6 and 4 5 respectively spm ipcc 2021 under these two ssp climate scenarios the streamflow of moly are simulated using the ml models to investigate the variations of hydrologic impact of climate change over the 21st century 3 research methodology 3 1 support vector regression the support vector regression algorithm svr was firstly developed as a class of nonlinear search algorithm based on a statistical learning theory cortes and vapnik 1995 which was then combined with regression techniques drucker et al 1997 suppose the training data are x i y i n x i is the input vector y i is the output vector svr could be written as 1 f w φ x b where w and b denote a weighting vector and bias respectively φ is a transitive function which maps the input space into a high dimensional space the penalty function is used in svr 2 f i y i ε n o p e n a l t y f i y i ε p e n a l t y when the estimated output is within the ε intensive tube representing the allowable error the loss value will be zero parameters of the regression function could be obtained by optimizing the objective function 3 m i n 1 2 w 2 c i 1 n l ε y i f i 4 m a x 0 ε where the constant c weighs the model complexity and the empirical risk as c increases the relative importance of the empirical risk will increase svr is fine tuned by the bayesian optimization approach implemented through the mlbayesopt package in r adankon et al 2011 details about svr could be found in gizaw and gan 2016 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 liang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 mosavi et al 2018 tongal and booij 2018 3 2 artificial neural network artificial neural network ann has been widely used in streamflow simulation and prediction ghumman et al 2011 hosseini and mahjouri 2016 kalteh 2013 among ann feed forward back propagation ffbp network models consist of an input layer any number of hidden layers an output layer and the neuron connections between the three layers the widely used three layer model is satisfactory for most hydrologic applications a typical three layer ffbp network is shown in fig 2 in which a b and c indicate the input the hidden and the output layers respectively and w is the weight assigned to each neuron connection it should be noted that neuron connections exist between neurons from different layers so that neurons within a layer are not interconnected to each other the weights of neuron connections are adjusted iteratively to minimize the difference between the actual output vector and the desired output vector each neuron in the hidden layer could be recognized as a linear regression model that consists of the input weight bias and the output the activation function determines whether the neuron of the hidden layer is activated to transform the information to the next layer the expression for the output of a three layered ffbp model is given in eq 5 5 y k j 1 m w jk h j ε k w i t h h j f j i 1 n w ij x i ε j where w ij is the weight of the connection between jth neuron in the hidden layer and the ith neuron in the input layer ε j is the bias for the jth neuron in the hidden layer f j is the activation function of the hidden neuron w jk is the weight for jth neuron in the hidden layer to the kth neuron in the output layer ε k is the bias for the kth neuron in the output layer 3 3 multiple linear regression another widely used data driven model multiple linear regression mlr model schilling and walter 2005 zhang et al 2018 is also used to simulate monthly streamflow from the four arctic river basins the mlr formula can be expressed as 6 y k β 0 i 1 n β i x i e where y k is the dependent variable β 0 is the y intercept β i is the regression coefficients for each independent variable x i e is the residual term the hydro climatological variables were also input into the mlr to predict the monthly streamflow 3 4 the model training and validating strategy ann mlr and svr models are developed to simulate the monthly streamflow of the four pan arctic river basins selected in this study a grid search algorithm was used to calibrate both the ann and mlr models since the length of streamflow time series of the river basins are different 80 of randomly selected monthly streamflow records of each were used to train the three models and the remaining 20 of monthly streamflow records were used to validate the calibrated models the amount of streamflow data used to train the models for the mackenzie river basin are 449 and 113 months of data independent of the training experience are used to validate the models calibrated for mackenzie river basin in ob river basin 852 monthly data are used to train the models and 214 monthly data used to validate the calibrated models for lena river basin yenisei river basin 805 795 monthly data are used to train the models and 202 199 monthly data are used to validate the calibrated models the accuracy of monthly streamflow data simulated by the models developed for the four pan arctic river basins is assessed using four statistical measures root mean squared error rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nash r squared r2 and the mean absolute error mae models that perform well will have relatively high nash and r2 but low rmse and mae and vice versa 3 5 the projection of future monthly streamflow under climate change impact the validated svm models are further used to predict the future monthly streamflow based on ssp shared social economic pathway climate change scenarios ssp245 and ssp585 of 5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 gcms bcc csm2 mr cas esm2 0 cmcc esm2 fio esm 2 0 and mpi esm1 2 hr of the intergovernmental panel of climate change ipcc douville et al 2021 the monthly precipitation maximum and minimum temperature and potential evapotranspiration pet calculated through the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 of the four pan arctic river basins for climate change scenarios of five cmip6 gcms were used as predictors the prediction of monthly streamflow under climate change impact is from 2020 to 2100 the bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd technique was applied to statistically downscale the hydro climatological variables its advantages are capturing trends in the regional climate and hydrologic interactions and the transient features of emissions scenarios werner 2011 the bcsd technique was conducted by the following steps in this study 1 the cru data at 0 5 0 5 and the cmip6 data at 1 1 was corrected with cru data into 1 1 by a quantile mapping algorithm which is implemented through the qmap package in r 2 the correction factor f at each 1 1 grid in each month were calculated as the ratio of the corrected cmip6 precipitation to the multi year mean precipitation from cru data when calculating precipitation or as the difference between the corrected cmip6 temperature and the corresponding multi year mean temperature from cru when calculating temperature 3 the correlation factor f of the 1 1 grid is interpolated to 0 5 0 5 by bilinear interpolation algorithm in each month 4 the downscaled cmip6 precipitation temperature were obtained by multiplying add up the correction factors correlation factor f of the 0 5 0 5 grid for each by the multi year monthly mean precipitation temperature of 0 5 0 5 details about this procedures could be found in wu et al 2022 yang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2021 4 results 4 1 comparing performance of svr with ann and mlr models the monthly streamflow simulated by ann mlr and svr for the validation period is shown in fig 3 in which time series of the observed and simulated monthly streamflow and their scatterplots are presented the performance of these three models simulating the monthly streamflow of the moly river basins driven by the selected hydroclimatic predictors are summarised in table 1 in terms of r2 nash mae and rmse the svr model outperforms ann and mlr in simulating the spring peak and the winter low flows with high r2 and nash and low mae and rmse from the time series of monthly streamflow in fig 3 1 it was found that the simulated monthly streamflow from three models could generally match the observed streamflow with similar timing for the spring snowmelt peak and the winter low flow however there are discrepancies between simulated and observed high flow in spring fig 4 it is found that svr has lower relative errors than other two models in simulating the high flow in spring especially for the siberian river basins fig 4b c and d in fig 3 2 the streamflow simulated by mlr deviates the furthest from the 45 line in the scatterplots from the goodness of fit statistics mlr also has the lowest r2 and nash and highest mae and rmse among the three models table 1 as for ann models they have good performance in terms of the goodness of fit statistics table 1 and can model the low and medium flow of mackenzie river well fig 3 a2 but for the three siberian river basins it cannot simulate the variance of streamflow well especially errors of high flows tend to be large fig 3b2 c2 and d2 svm models have similar values of goodness of fit statistics with ann but have an overall better performance in simulating mostly more accurate streamflow than ann models especially for siberian rivers therefore svm models are used to project the future changes of streamflow in moly river basins 4 2 projected streamflow of moly river basins under climate warming impact to analyze the projected streamflow from moly the hydro climatological variables from ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios of five cmip6 gcms were extracted and statistically downscaled through bcsd approach with cru ts 4 03 data as basis therefore the cmip6 climate projections have the same spatial resolution as cru ts 4 03 data which was used to predict the future streamflow through calibrated svr models based on the the ssp245 and ssp585 climate projections of cmip6 gcms the precipitation over the four river basins is projected to increase in most of gcms during the second half of the twenty first century fig 5 1 some of gcms such as fio esm 2 0 cmcc esm2 and mpi esm1 2 hr project less precipitation in the 2080s 2081 2090 than in 2050s 2051 2060 for river basins under ssp 585 such as the mackenzie fig 5a1 ob fig 5b1 and yenisei fig 5d1 while other gcms project continuous increase in the precipitation from 2050s to 2080s under two scenarios fig 5 1 moreover there is also a gcm projecting drier climate in the lena river basin during 2050s than the base period 1970 2000 such as the mpi esm1 2 hr fig 5c1 comparing with the large difference of the projected precipitation within gcms the projected temperature shows consistent variance among gcms all five gcms project continuous increasing temperature from 2050s to 2080s fig 5 2 with different amplitudes some of gcms such as cmcc esm2 and fio esm 2 0 project large increase in temperature especially under ssp585 with the projected wetter climate in most scenarios of selected gcms the streamflow should increase but the evapotranspiration enhanced by a warmer climate vegetation greening and infiltration promoted by the permafrost thawing wound reduce the surface flow and increase the subsurface flow to reveal the projected changes within streamflow due to the projecte increases in the temperature and precipitation the validated svr models driven by statistically downscaled climate projected under ssp245 and ssp585 from five cmip6 gcms were used monthly streamflow under the projected wetter and warmer climate from 2020 to 2100 are therefore projected as shown in fig 6 the projected wetter and warmer climate result in higher streamflow in nearly all river basins for most gcm projections which is consistent with previous studies based on other gcms van vliet et al 2013 for lena river the projected increase in the annual streamflow averaged from projected monthly streamflow is about 6 1 per decades under ssp245 and 14 6 under ssp585 durong 2020 2100 respectively fig 6c which is the fastest among the four river basins for yenisei river the second fastest the annual streamflow is projected to increase by 4 6 per dacade under ssp245 and 9 9 per dacade under ssp585 respectively fig 6d the annual streamflow from the mackenzie river basin also projected to increase by 2 3 per decade under ssp245 and 4 9 per decade under ssp585 respectively fig 6a but for ob river the annual streamflow during 2020 2100 is projected to be consistent with the historical variations for almost gcms under both ssp scenarios fig 6b to further analyze the projected streamflow the flow regime that shows the annual distribution of streamflow were analyzed as shown in fig 7 the streamflow of each month from 2020s to 2090s were presented in radarmaps to show the temporal changes the annual streamflow hydrograph for each river basin is projected to change significantly under most gcms projections for lena and yenisei river basins projecting large increase in annual streamflows the july streamflow which has been the largest will increase further under a wetter and warmer climate while the streamflow in june and august are also projected to increase significantly under all gcms projections fig 7c and d some of gcms such as fio esm 2 0 and cmcc esm2 that both project high increase in precipitation and temperature project large increase in the summer streamflow therefore the projected increase in summer streamflow could be the main contributor of major increase in the annual streamflow for lena and yenisei river for the mackenzie river the streamflow is projected to increase most months by different gcms the ensemble mean shows more obvious increase in january and december streamflows than other months fig 7a6 and the annual distribution of streamflow from the mackenzie river basin is projected to be uniform a few gcms project significant changes in months with largest streamflow such as cmcc esm2 under ssp585 in the end of the 21st century fig 7a3 for the ob river the projected annual hydrographs have large variance among gcms the ensemble mean shows the high flow month advance from july to june due to an earlier snowmelt under a warmer climate kerkhoven and gan 2011 with higher streamflow between january and june at the expense of summer streamflow in july and august fig 7b6 the projected changes in temperature precipitation and streamflow for the four arctic river basins with respect to the 1970 2000 baseline historical periods of the five gcms of cmip6 by the end of the twenty first century 2070 2099 are compared and presented in fig 8 because the arctic is warming much faster than the global average the mean annual temperature in moly is projected to increase by 6 3 7 1 7 7 and 7 2 respectively fig 8a which are significantly higher than the projected global average of about 4 3 under ssp585 while the precipitation by 14 9 24 and 15 respectively fig 8b the streamflow from the four river basins under ssp585 at the end of the twenty first century is projected to increase by 17 4 39 and 48 respectively under ssp245 scenarios the mean annual temperature in four river basins are projected to increase by 3 7 4 3 4 7 and 4 4 respectively at the end of twenty first century which are still higher than the projected global average of about 2 6 under ssp245 fig 7a correspondingly the precipitation in moly is projected to increase by 12 11 16 and 12 respectively fig 7b the corresponding mean streamflow is projected by svrs to increase by 7 1 21 and 28 based on the climate scenarios of four gcms fig 7a it is noted that for the ob river some gcms such as fio esm 2 0 bcc csm2 mr and mpi esm1 2 hr project higher temperature as much as other river basins but the projected increase in precipitation is much lower than other three basins which is consistent with the results of magritsky et al 2018 5 discussions of results the future streamflow of the four pan arctic river basins over the 21st century under the climate change scenarios is projected by the svr model of which three basins show continuous increasing trends for the arctic warming is amplified by about twice to four times rantanen et al 2022 the global rate since the 1980s known as the arctic amplification attributed to several feedback mechanisms namely ice albedo temperature planck lapse rate water vapor co2 and cloud feedbacks with higher air temperature the stronger moisture poleward transport is expected to contribute to significant increase in the arctic precipitation bintanja et al 2020 that makes the arctic wetter as expected all cmip6 gcms selected in this study unanimously project increase in precipitation and temperature under both ssp245 and ssp585 climate scenarios with different amplitudes figs 5 and 8 due to higher precipitation the streamflow from mackenzie lena and yenisei river basins is projected to increase except the ob river these differences are the results of different projected precipitation and different terrestrial conditions the strong warming reduces the streamflow through higher evaporation loss vegetation greening that increases the canopy interception and transpiration berner et al 2020 kerkhoven and gan 2013 myers smith et al 2020 and permafrost thawing that enhances the soil infiltration wang et al 2021a b these hydrological changes could offset the positive effects of higher precipitation on the streamflow with the least increase in projected precipitation the ob river is expected to experience the least changes in its streamflow and for other three river basins lena river is projected with the largest increase in streamflow partly because its projected precipitation is the largest the higher summer streamflow is the main contributor to the projected increase in the annual streamflow the winter streamflow is also projected to increase in some river basins such as the mackenzie ob and lena river basins which could partly because permafrost thawing that enhances the groundwater discharge wang et al 2021a b therefore the variation of future streamflow are responses of the terrestrial environmental to a combination of increasing precipitation and increasing temperature however without adequate observations and site experiments in such large river basins in the pan arctic river basin detailed mechanisms behind the response of terrestrial environment to the climate warming remains unclear the findings of this study demonstrate the increasing trends of streamflow simulated by the svr models for the pan arctic river basins subjected to climate scenarios of five gcms of cmip6 as a major source of freshwater to the arctic ocean shiklomanov et al 2021 the increase in the streamflow of the arctic river basins would have crucial influence on the arctic even the global oceanic and atmospheric circulations studies show that with increasing streamflow the arctic ocean is undergoing a freshening trend mcphee et al 1998 shu et al 2018 that could influence the ocean salinity stratification bintanja et al 2018 yang et al 2016 the heat and mass balance of the arctic atmosphere park et al 2020 and global thermohaline circulation anderson et al 2004 besides the freshwater the river input also brings heat enhancing the early melt of sea ice and sea surface warming park et al 2021 the gigantic global effects brought by shorter and low sea ice cover have been widely known and extensively studied the shrinking of arctic sea ice has been found to have significant relationship to the extreme weather in mid latitude through the rossby wave the polar vortex or large scale cliamte patterns ding and wu 2021 fu et al 2021 li et al 2021 mccrystall and screen 2021 mccrystall et al 2021 smith et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 moreover nutrients organic carbon and other substances brought by higher river input would also have impact on the ecosystem of the arctic holmes et al 2012 torres valdés et al 2013 the uncertainties of the projected climate change impact to moly come from the climate change scenarios projected by the selected cmip6 gcms statistical downscaling techniques the data driven svr models and limitations of available data the uncertainties from the climate projection by gcms could be reduced through using the ensemble means of multi gcms instead of individual gcms and the limitation of available data mainly refers to the limited number of meteorology stations which could provide reliable hydro climatological data but given the reliability of cru data has been demonstrated globally the uncertainty from data sources is acceptable therefore we mainly discusse the uncertainties from the model and downscaling techniques the overall good performance of svms in simulating the streamflow of major arctic river basins is acceptable with nash sutcliffe efficiency and r2 higher than 0 8 in nearly all river basins with limited predictors and training data svm could adequately capture the increasingly dynamic non linear non stationary and chaotic characteristics of the streamflow of the pan arctic river basins the robustness of svm makes it a popular tool in modeling hydrologic processes of river basins worldwide in recent years khoi et al 2022 ren et al 2018 wu et al 2014 however similar with most data driven models it is also challenging for svm to simulate accurate peak flow there have been studies combining the traditional svm with decompose techniques such as wavelet analysis that decompose the monthly streamflow according to frequency characteristics and reduce or eliminate noises that reduces the uncertainties within the simulated peak flow to a certain extent guo et al 2011 kisi and cimen 2011 the occurences of peak flow are extreme conditions possibly related to large scale climate patterns which have been shown to interact with global streamflows therefore relating streamflow to the possible influences of certain large scale climate patterns may improve the simulations of peak flows of arctic river basins besides integrating data driven models with other techniques there are studies using large scale climate patterns to forecast streamflow kalra et al 2013 this study has demonstrated the potential of svms in the simulation of streamflow from pan arctic river basins our future work will focus on improving the performance of svms in the peak flow simulation though coupling with decomposition techniques or by an ensemble framework with extreme value statistical models the statistical downscaling technique bias corrected spatial downscaling bcsd is selected to downscale simulated precipitation and temperature of gcms to the local scale of the moly river basins because it has been shown to be skillful in downscaling monthly precipitation and temperature yang et al 2019 simulated precipitation and temperature data of cmip6 downscaled by bcsd are assessed against the cru dataset using statistics such as the correlation coefficients rmse and the ratio of variances fig s1 as expected uncertainties of precipitation data simulated by all five gcms are higher than that of temperature in all four river basins because precipitation is more variable spatially than temperature the application of bcsd could increase the accuracy and reduce the uncertainties of simulated precipitation and temperature at basin scale effectively especially the precipitation data fig s1 a bcsd has also been applied in other studies yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 6 summary and conclusions in this study the impact of climate change on four major pan arctic river basins mackenzie ob lena and yenisei river basin are analyzed the monthly streamflow of these basins are projected by svm models driven by ssp245 and ssp585 climate changes scenarios of five cmip6 gcms three main findings of this study ① the projected temperature of the four river basins are all higher than the global average under two scenarios for all selected cmip6 gcms which is consistent with the arctic amplification phenomenon while precipitation is projected to increase in most gcms with but with large variance overall a wetter and warmer climate is projected in pan arctic river basins from cmip6 gcms ② under this wetter and warmer climate the annual streamflow is projected to increase over 2020 2100 for mackenzie lena and yenisei rivers significantly with larger amplitudes under ssp585 than that under ssp245 scenarios of all gcms however the ob river does not show significant increasing trend in its annual streamflow ③ from the annual streamflow hydrograph it is found that the projected increase in the annual streamflow of lena and yenisei river basins mainly come from higher summer streamflow while for the mackenzie river basin the streamflow in summer and winter increases evenly and minimal projected change in the annual streamflow from ob river is due to the offsetting of higher winter streamflow by lower summer streamflow in addition the onset of spring snowmelt is also projected to occur earlier in all river basins due to warmer climate results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies that the arctic streamflow is increasing generally and deepens the understanding about the variations of seasonal streamflow that response differently to warmer temperature and higher precipitation projected by gcms as the variations of streamflow involves active responses of multiple arctic hydrological processes to the climate change long term climate and hydrologic observations in the arctic are essential to better understand the

2116,human activities have substantially enhanced riverine nitrogen loads in many parts of the world the processes such as denitrification remove a large fraction of n added to the system and thus are very helpful in mitigating the effects of increasing human n loads in aquatic ecosystems no systematic studies so far are available on current magnitude and factors regulating efficiency of n removal by the ganga river using three sub sets of studies main river course two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories along 520 km middle stretch we generated high spatio temporal resolution data to show that spatially targeted river reaches with higher nitrate concentrations are acting as hotspots of n removal in the ganga river the static core method was used to measure the rate of denitrification intact sediment core samples were incubated in the laboratory condition and efficiency adjusted pollution impacted point sources showed higher rates of denitrification 0 40 mg n m2 hr to 2 48 mg n m2 hr relative to main stream sites 0 32 mg n m2 hr to 2 09 mg n m2 hr our results indicate that increased level of carbon c and phosphorus p which often accompany nitrogen n inputs from human activities have enhanced n removal by the river periodic oxic hypoxic cycle at sediment water interface dosw which might link nitrification with denitrification has stimulated n removal at study sites in an opportunistic manner these results suggest that data on this natural process of n removal denitrification and factors thereof especially those accounting for interactive effects at spatially targeted locations should be taken into account to formulate policies for the management of nutrient and organic pollution keywords benthic hypoxia anoxia denitrification ecosystem feedback ganga river sediment p release data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the microbial interactions at sediment water interface are strongly influenced by the nature and magnitude of anthropogenic discharge jaiswal and pandey 2021a the flow regime alterations compromise functional attributes and provisioning services supported by river ecosystems nilsson et al 2005 tonkin et al 2017 whereas the human driven wastes being added to the rivers also alter heterotrophic microbial communities and consequently the carbon and nutrients cycling at sediment water interface freixa et al 2016 jaiswal and pandey 2021a constant and intense flushing of human releases cause a sequence of detrimental effects forcing the river ecosystems to compromise ecosystem functions and services they provide pen uelas et al 2013 best 2019 siddiqui et al 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 these problems are exacerbated by the flow regulation drought intensification and climate change nilsson et al 2005 palmer et al 2009 tonkin et al 2017 tonkin et al 2019 excessive fertilizer use widespread land use change and fossil fuel combustion together with the biological n fixation and other sources have added massive amount of reactive nitrogen nr almost in all ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 galloway et al 2008 the freshwater ecosystems are particularly prone and experience drastic transformation in ecosystem metabolism under excess nr load leading to the adverse impacts on the water quality trophic status and biodiversity schlesinger et al 2006 woodward et al 2012 finlay et al 2013 pandey and pandey 2013 pandey et al 2014 pandey et al 2017 such effects are interlinked and cumulative impacts are often long lasting for instance increased nutrients vs algal blooms and carbon loads lead to the development of mosaic of hypoxic anoxic zones jaiswal and pandey 2019a such effects although have negative impacts in an ecosystem function perspective jaiswal and pandey 2020 jaiswal and pandey 2021a enhance the denitrification and consequently lower the n load and its export to coastal waters cheng et al 2020 gervasio et al 2022 the rivers and streams export massive amount of bioavailable nitrogen from land to the ocean howarth et al 1996 boyer et al 2006 mulholland et al 2008 while doing so a large fraction of nr is removed along the hydrologic continuum this happens because under anoxic hypoxic condition a diverse group of microbes reduce nitrate and nitrite to gaseous n by a process called denitrification qiao et al 2020 the conditions at sediment water interface often favor the process van breemen et al 2002 schlesinger et al 2006 seitzinger et al 2006 mulholland et al 2008 this removal process helps in balancing overall nr in the rivers and streams van breemen et al 2002 and consequently its oceanic transport donner and kucharik 2008 efforts focusing on the kinetic and energetic control of human alteration of n biogeochemical cycle have increased our understanding of no3 dynamics in the rivers and streams mcisaac et al 2001 mulholland et al 2008 böhlke et al 2009 taylor and townsend 2010 also these have helped exploring the changes in river nitrogen budget bouwman et al 2005 processes such as the long term sediment burial and denitrification biotic uptake and anammox substantially reduce nitrogen concentration in aquatic ecosystems kuypers et al 2005 li et al 2007 schlesinger 2009 finlay et al 2013 callbeck et al 2021 the denitrification alone accounts for a large share in total n removal in the rivers and streams mulholland et al 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 liu et al 2013 the global nitrogen input in inland waters varies from 67 to 129 tg n yr 1 galloway et al 2004 beusen et al 2016 wherein the denitrification alone removes from 49 to 66 tg n yr 1 seitzinger et al 2006 maranger et al 2018 the denitrification removes about 43 of total n load in a river network that discharges to taihu lake in china zhao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 in a study representing eight regions of the united states and puerto rico mulholland et al 2008 showed that the denitrification accounted for over 43 of the total no3 removal in 18 out of 72 study streams a study by gervasio et al 2022 has shown that denitrification not only removes nitrate but also the total n in po di goro river italy confirming the theory that the denitrification causes n reduction along rivers yang et al 2021 reported that the denitrification is responsible for about 20 of n removal in eight rivers of yangtze river estuary shanghai similarly for lower ishikari river system of japan jha and minagawa 2013 reported that the denitrification causes removal of 5 day of dissolved nitrate added to the river about 14 24 of total n load has been reported to be removed by this process from weisse elster river germany wagenschein and rode 2008 on the global scale freshwater systems account for 20 of total global denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 despite these facts systematic data base on the relative importance of denitrification and regulatory determinants is lacking for the rivers systems in india in general and for the ganga river in particular a comprehensive understanding of denitrification driven n loss and the factors at the sediment water interface that favor inhibit the process as a distinctive driver requires intensive system specific evaluation incorporating the extent of dissolved oxygen deficit dod and concentrations of no3 phosphorus and organic carbon would provide important insights into whether the nutrient enrichment biological uptake toc and dod are the primary regulators of the denitrification driven n loss in large rivers phosphorus supports accumulation of algal biomass which in turn leads to increase n transfer and decrease in dissolved oxygen and consequently stimulates denitrification jaiswal and pandey 2021a this is important for effective management decisions of large rivers in face of excessive n flushing from human sources the ganga river network is the most important river system of india in respect of its basin size and socio economic perspective the denitrification driven n removal and factors there of have never been studied for the ganga river here we studied the denitrification driven n removal rates and assessed if the diurnal oscillation in benthic dissolved oxygen levels favour inhibit the n removal in the ganga river this has relevance because of the specific nature of river ecosystems and because the diurnal oscillation in dissolved oxygen an intrinsic driver of denitrification is rarely measured in meaningful ways in large rivers pandey et al 2019 birk et al 2020 here we hypothesized that under the human driven nutrient and carbon pollution the diurnal oscillation in the level of dissolved oxygen and intermittent breaks in the hypoxic anoxic conditions in large rivers stimulate the denitrification driven n removal at the sediment water interface in an opportunistic manner the objectives were to explore the factors that affect denitrification at the sediment water interface and to assess whether the intermittent breaking of hypoxic anoxic conditions and possible nitrification denitrification coupling favors the n removal from benthic sediment in the ganga river to understand the control and variations we analyzed factors especially those that co occur with the enhanced n loading in the rivers such as dissolved oxygen deficit hypoxia anoxia carbon accumulation phosphorus concentration sediment p release nitrate concentration and n p ratios these results cover the first high spatio temporal resolution database on denitrification in the ganga river along the main river stream and point sources confluence trajectories useful in the management decisions as well as for constructing the basin scale n budgets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study considers 32 heterogeneous study locations including the main stream tributary confluences and point source stressors along a 520 km mid segment of the ganga the largest river system of india the mid segment kannauj upstream 27 17 n 79 84 e to varanasi downstream 25 32 n 83 04 e considered here represents the most polluted stretch of the ganga river fig 1 with about 73 44 agricultural lands the basin represents the highest population density of the country and occupies 26 2 geographical area of india the river receives together with inputs from several hundred industrial units pollutants from 29 large cities 23 small cities and 48 townships situated along the bank climatic range encompasses sub tropical climate towards headwaters to tropical monsoonal towards downstream reaches the year shows transition from a dry summer march june to cold winter november february through a humid rainy season july october average rain in the basin ranges between 550 and 2500 mm with southwest monsoon accounting for more than 80 of the total rainfall the himalayan snow feeds the river during summer while rain driven surface runoff causes overflow during the monsoon season at rare occasions the day time summer temperature may exceed 46 c the soil in the basin shows variable proportion of sand silt and clay with very high natural fertility in the mid geographical region driessen et al 2000 2 2 experimental protocol for detailed investigation we conducted the incubation and in situ experiments based on the spatially explicit source locations depicting three sets of variability and environmental control we choose the sources based on their established role in degrading the river system and availability with sufficient spatial resolution in the first set we consider four stations along a 520 km river segment kannauj knuj jajmau jjmu adalpura adpr and rajghat rjht we selected three sub sites at each station and marked the gradient as the main stream of the ganga river the second set include trajectory analyses presenting a gradient of 600 m with two sub sets of spatially variable pollution loading these include two tributary confluences the ramganga ganga at kannauj and the varuna ganga at varanasi and two point source downstream trajectories wazidpur drain at kanpur and assi drain at varanasi fig 1 each trajectory consisted of seven sites situated 100 m apart originating from 100 m upstream to the source site 1 was located 100 m upstream to the source whereas sites 2 to 7 were situated downstream to point sources and tributary confluences representing actively discharging portion accounting for the stressors input and spatial dilution from river mixing to analyze diurnal variations samples from all the study sites were collected at different times during the day at 3 hourly intervals between 6 00 am to 6 00 pm of a day at 6 00 hrs 9 00 hrs 12 00 hrs 15 00 hrs and 18 00 hrs the ramganga and varuna are among the most polluted tributaries of the ganga river accounting for massive input of sewage and industrial effluents to the main stream central pollution control board cpcb 2013 of the point sources considered here the wazidpur drain flushes about 54 million liters per day mld industrial effluents whereas the assi drain adds over 66 mld urban sewage in the ganga river central pollution control board cpcb 2013 2 3 sample collection the sampling was done for two consecutive years 2018 and 2019 and for three months april may and june of each year we divided each sampling site into three sub sites and the samples were collected in triplicate from each sub site the water and sediment samples were collected from 25 m reach of the river during summer low flow april to june of 2018 and 2019 we used water depth sampler for collecting water samples from sediment water interface 1 5 to 6 0 m water column depth and stainless steel corers height 10 cm and internal diameter 5 cm for collecting sediment samples from each sampling location the samples were placed in the ice boxes and transferred to the laboratory following standard measures the sediment samples were segregated into two parts one part was kept intact for measuring sediment p release and denitrification and the other was kept at room temperature for air drying for 3 4 days the air dried samples were then grounded in mortar and pestle and sieved using 2 mm mesh for further analysis we applied same procedure in all sets of studies 2 4 measurements for the measurement of dissolved oxygen at the sediment water interface dosw the do was fixed at sampling site and quantified volumetrically in the laboratory following the modified winkler s approach apha 1998 all measurements were done under similar identical conditions we used the difference between measured do and pure water do at saturation under similar conditions to calculate the dissolved oxygen deficit sànchez et al 2007 the samples for measuring do and nutrients were collected from the sediment water interface and analyzed in the laboratory the dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface is designated as dodsw for the nitrate in sediment we used phenol di sulphonic acid method tan 2005 and for ammonia in sediment we followed phenate method park et al 2009 the total organic carbon toc was measured by walkley and black chen et al 2015 and the phosphate by murphy and riley 1962 for quantifying sediment p release we used the method given by hu et al 2001 the experiment was carried out by incubating the sediment samples into specifically designed air tight chambers 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm air tight chambers were used to maintain conditions similar to in situ conditions the chambers filled with river water collected from respective sampling sites were kept in the dark to avoid photosynthetic o2 production we maintained two levels of do the first one was maintained in anoxic to hypoxic range 0 to 2 mg l 1 without stirring and aeration whereas the second one was maintained in sub oxic to oxic range 2 to 5 mg l 1 by intermittent stirring and aeration to ensure a near constant value of do and temperature we regularly monitored these parameters in the chambers the water temperature during incubation was maintained similar to the field condition at 28 c to study the p release from the sediment the samples were collected from the interface sediment water of each incubation chamber and p concentrations measured following murphy and riley 1962 static core method was used to measure the rate of denitrification groffman et al 1999 in this acetylene inhibition technique we incubated intact sediment cores 10 cm deep 5 cm diameter in specifically designed air sealed 1l glass chambers the 80 volumes of these chambers were filled with water samples collected from respective site and 20 left as head space at the beginning of the incubation the headspace as well as incubation water was mixed with 10 acetylene 10 saturation is known to give more successful result of acetylene based quantification of denitrification yoshinari and knowles 1976 shrewsbury et al 2016 by repeated pumping using syringes to maintain the temperature of these chambers similar to the field condition we used tempered water bath further to ensure the stable measurement conditions continuous stirring was done 500 rpm for 12 h the n2o produced was sampled immediately after starting of the incubation experiment and then after 2 h of the lag period the n2o concentration was analyzed using a greenhouse gas analyzer trace 1110 thermo fisher scientific india pvt ltd and the denitrification rate was calculated using a linear regression model of n2o concentration vs incubation time studies show that this method underestimates the denitrification rate in nitrate poor systems seitzinger et al 1993 miyajima et al 2001 fulweiler et al 2015 and is well usable in nitrate rich systems groffman et al 2006 kreiling et al 2019 palacin lizarbe et al 2020 the human impacted ganga river receives continuous supply of large amount of no3 through multiple point and non point sources yadav and pandey 2017 siddiqui et al 2020 here the efficiency of this method has been adjusted as per seitzinger et al 1993 seitzinger et al 1993 using repeated measurements have assessed the efficiency of acetylene inhibition technique as 50 and corrected the measured rate of denitrification due to 100 µm no3 enrichment of sediment cores that was 99 µmol n m 2h 1 as 200 µmol n m 2h 1 based on 50 efficiency of the method lohse et al 1996 compared denitrification rates measured by acetylene inhibition technique and isotopic pairing technique ipt and found a closely similar efficiency as observed by seitzinger et al 1993 considering these observations similar adjustment has been made here also for correct estimate of denitrification rate in the ganga river further because of its cost effectiveness easy handling sensitivity and rapid result giving nature this method is widely used especially for aquatic sediment samples where the major study targets are comparison of sites for evaluating the controlling factors cavigelli and robertson 2000 2 5 statistical analysis for all spatial resolution data are presented as mean confidence limits above 95 were used for justifying the level of significance principal component analyses pca were used to identify factors accounting for variability in denitrification and associated determinants to test the spatially explicit differences in rates of denitrification we used multiple linear regression analysis considering site variables as random effect using ibm spss statistic version 22 for other statistical analysis we used sigma plot software version 11 0 we used stability coefficient s 1 cv or µ σ where s stability coefficient cv coefficient of variation µ mean σ standard deviation to test spatial invariability among samples per site it is a standardized measure of the magnitude of constancy in a variable in relation to the mean tilman et al 2006 greater spatial invariability is considered as a signature of stability we found the values of s above 10 cv 10 indicating the state of spatial invariability spatial homogeneity among samples per site 3 results 3 1 mainstream trends the dissolved oxygen at sediment water interface dosw was found to be the highest at adalpura adpr and the lowest at jajmau jjmu we found temporal maxima of dosw at 18 00 hrs and the minima at 15 00 hrs at all the study sites fig 2 the dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface dodsw followed a trend opposite to dosw both spatially as well as on the temporal scales the ecosystem feedbacks sediment p release and denitrification showed synchrony with dodsw and the rates of sediment

sediment was measured to be highest at jjmu site at 15 00 hrs and the lowest at adpr site at 18 00 hrs on a diurnal scale the sediment po4 3 and no3 showed asynchrony with sediment p release the concentration of no3 ranged from 0 97 mg g adpr site to 3 9 mg g jjmu site fig 2 the nh4 concentration did show spatial synchrony with po4 3 where the values measured were maximum at 15 00 hrs 2 87 mg

in this study the phosphate explained 10 55 of variations at main stream sites supplementary table 2 the n p stoichiometry showed shifts at all sites of the main stream of the ganga river with a deviation from canonical ratio 16 1 and the maximum shift in n p stoichiometry was observed at jjmu site the diurnal pattern showed lowest n p ratio at 18 00 hrs and highest at 15 00 hrs at all the study sites fig 3 the principal component analysis pca separated dodsw and the ecosystem feedbacks opposite to dosw the toc and nh4 clustered along denitrification at one axis and no3 at opposite axis further the pca segregated 15 00 12 00 and 9 00 hrs with dodsw toc po4 3 and ecosystem feedbacks whereas 6 00 hrs and 18 00 hrs clustered with dosw and no3 at another axis fig 4 3 2 ganga river tributary confluence downstream trends the dosw did appear 0 5 mg l at site 2 confluence site of both the tributaries figs 5 and 6 on the temporal scale the dosw for the varuna ganga confluence was found to be the lowest at 15 00 hrs 0 19 mg l and highest at 9 00 hrs 3 52 mg l the ramganga ganga confluence trajectories showed a similar trend although the values were relatively higher figs 5 and 6 the trajectories showed an increase in dosw as the distance from the confluence increased the dodsw followed a trend opposite to dosw and the values ranged from 4 68 to 8 01 mg l for the varuna ganga confluence sites and from 4 38 mg l to 7 64 mg l for the ramganga ganga confluence sites the sediment p release and denitrification both declined with increasing distance from the confluence and their maxima appeared at site 2 confluence site and minima at site 1 100 m upstream to confluence for both the tributary confluence trajectories the sediment p release varied between 1 84 mg m2 day and 12 62 mg m2 day for the varuna ganga confluence fig 5 and between 2 31 mg m2 day and 16 59 mg m2 day for the ramganga ganga confluence sites fig 6 the diel oscillation in sediment p release showed maxima at 15 00 hrs and minima at 9 00 hrs for both the confluences the rate of denitrification followed a similar diel pattern the toc and nh4 concentrations at both the confluences followed a trend similar to those recorded for dodsw although the toc concentration was relatively higher at the varuna ganga confluence and the nh4 concentration was relatively higher at the ramganga ganga confluence figs 5 and 6 the no3 showed temporal synchrony with dosw and recorded to be maximum at 9 00 hrs and minimum at 15 00 hrs for both the confluence trajectories figs 5 and 6 we found the highest concentration of po4 3 at site 2 and the lowest at site 1 for both the confluences the no3 showed a deviation wherein the concentration maxima were found at site 5 for the varuna ganga confluence fig 5 and at site 7 for the ramganga ganga confluence fig 6 the rate of denitrification at vrna showed strong correlation with dosw r2 0 92 to 0 96 p 0 001 toc r2 0 97 to 0 98 p 0 001 and po4 3 r2 0 97 to 0 98 p 0 001 strong correlations were also observed for diurnal changes at rmga site supplementary table 1 here the phosphate did not explained large variations at source oriented sites supplementary table 2 the n p stoichiometry showed variable trends for the tributary confluences for the varuna ganga confluence trajectories all study sites showed n p ratios below 16 1 fig 3 only a marginal decrease from canonical ratio was found at the ramganga ganga confluence trajectory sites in the diel cycles the n p ratios showed synchrony with sediment p release fig 3 similar to the main stream studies the pca separated dosw opposite to dodsw and ecosystem feedbacks for both the confluence trajectories the toc nh4 dodsw and the ecosystem feedbacks clustered closely with 15 00 and 18 00 hrs for both the tributary confluence trajectories fig 4 3 3 point source downstream trends the concentration of dosw was highest at site 1 and lowest at site 2 for assi drain and also for wazidpur drain figs 7 and 8 the dosw increased with distance from the source values close to anoxia were observed at sites 2 to 4 at 15 00 hrs for wpdr and at site 2 at 15 00 hrs for asdr the overall concentrations ranged from 0 01 mg l to 3 13 mg l at wpdr and from 0 03 mg l to 3 81 mg l at asdr on a diurnal scale we found the maxima at 9 00 hrs and the minima at 15 00 hrs for both the trajectories figs 7 and 8 the dodsw varied between 5 07 mg l and 8 19 mg l at wpdr and between 4 40 mg l and 8 17 mg l at asdr the diel pattern showed a trend opposite to dosw the denitrification and sediment p release showed spatial and temporal synchrony with the dodsw for asdr and wpdr although the values were relatively higher at wpdr figs 7 and 8 the toc concentrations ranged from 1 75 mg g to 5 26 mg g at wpdr and from 1 37 mg g to 7 35 mg g at asdr on a diurnal scale the concentrations were maximum at 15 00 hrs and minimum at 9 00 hrs the concentration of nh4 followed a similar temporal trend whereas those of no3 and po4 3 showed an opposite trend for both the point sources spatially the concentrations of toc and po4 3 were found to be the highest at site 2 the concentration of no3 showed an opposite trend with the values ranging from 0 84 mg g to 2 24 mg g at wpdr fig 7 and from 0 97 mg g to 3 83 mg g at asdr fig 8 similar to the main stream and tributary confluence downstream sites we found strong correlations between the denitrification rate and the concentrations of dosw toc no3 and po4 3 r2 0 81 to 0 99 p 0 01 to 0 001 at study sites of wpdr and asdr supplementary table 1 similar to the tributary confluence trajectories the point source trajectories at asdr also showed n p maxima at 15 00 hrs at site 1 the values declined from site 1 to site 5 and then increased up to site 7 fig 3 for wpdr n p stoichiometric maxima was found at site 7 at 15 00 hrs and unlike asdr a continuous increase was reported from site 1 to site 5 the deviation from standard 16 1 ratio was also found at wpdr however the decreases at this site were relatively lower fig 3 the pca separated denitrification with toc po4 3 and nh4 and sediment p release with dodsw for both asdr and wpdr sites the dosw and no3 were segregated opposite to these fig 4 also 15 00 hrs appeared with dodsw and ecosystem feedbacks while 12 00 hrs with dosw for both the point sources fig 4 4 discussion a comprehensive understanding of n loading its distribution and removal in large rivers and transport to the coastal oceans requires more extensive system specific evaluation the nitrate removal potential is a function of the river size and the large rivers are more effective sink owing to higher nitrogen availability larger transport distance and water residence time alexander et al 2000 wollheim et al 2006 also rivers exhibit interaction with stressors more often than lentic systems owing to temporal variability in higher shoreline length greater habitat heterogeneity and exposure to multiple stressors with increasing spatial scales birk et al 2020 denitrification a major driver of n loss from aquatic bodies is regulated by a number of factors including oxygen level organic matter temperature and substrate availability saunders and kalff 2001 bernot and dodds 2005 seitzinger et al 2006 tian et al 2020 our study showed higher rates of denitrification at study sites characterized by low dosw level and high concentrations of toc and nh4 at 15 00 hrs in an aquatic continuum where sub oxic and oxic environments interact the denitrification is tightly coupled with nitrification in space and time marchant et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 incorporating factors regulating nitrification denitrification coupling at sediment water interface would provide new insights into the denitrification driven n removal in large rivers our results yield an optimistic projection on drivers of the denitrification for management decisions associated with the large rivers here we show that a shift in our focus from monitoring a water quality change to understanding the process interaction network not only uncover the features essential to ensure adaptive management and landscape scale delivery of the river ecosystem services but also sheds light on the relations among human activities climate change biogeochemical cycles and the riverine ecosystem functioning using three sub sets of studies at multiple spatio temporal scales main river stream two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories we identified four regulatory determinants of denitrification in the ganga river carbon no3 po4 3 and dissolved oxygen concentration at sediment water interface we found strong dependency of denitrification on dodsw and carbon and nitrogen concentrations 4 1 general trends the lowest concentration of dosw at jajmau site indicated a very high pollution load as the jajmau area is a famous hub of leather industry releasing the effluents to the ganga river besides this a large amount of urban sewage is also added to the river at this site the heavy load of oxygen demanding substances ods coinciding with the summer time high temperature at 15 00 hrs can be interpreted as the main cause of dissolved oxygen deficit at the sediment water interface dodsw yadav and pandey 2017 similarly the lowest value of dosw at 15 00 hrs at the varuna ganga and the ramganga ganga confluences indicated an intensive consumption of oxygen the maxima at 9 00 hrs for the trajectories could be due to an increased flow from point sources and associated mixing of water coinciding with morning time low temperature yadav and pandey 2017 the low concentration of dosw at 15 00 hrs at all the study sites led to enhance ecosystem feedbacks denitrification and sediment p release at this point of time the sediment p release enhances oxygen demand lowering the dosw further additionally the heavy loading of toc and nh4 at 15 00 hrs also support denitrification maxima showing that these chemicals from industrial and agricultural activities and urban releases also have potential to affect the process of nitrogen transformation liu et al 2022 these aspects are further supported by low concentration of no3 and its synchrony with dosw at 15 00 hrs the denitrification rates recorded here appear substantially higher relative to those measured for the ouse river and the wiske river england pattinson et al 1998 the garonne river france teissier and torre 2002 the big ditch river usa schaller et al 2004 and the kalamazoo river usa beaulieu et al 2008 the mean denitrification rates were found closely at par with those measured for the raan river sweden jansson et al 1994 the misssissipi river usa richardson et al 2004 the sangamon river usa royer et al 2004 and many other rivers and streams of the world pina ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 mulholland et al 2008 in some lentic ecosystems the upper ranges have been reported relatively higher bruesewitz et al 2012 the process of denitrification is restricted to anaerobic zones of the sediment water interface or to a thin upper zone of benthic sediments in shallow streams the oxygen released in benthic photosynthesis can reduce denitrification up to 85 christensen et al 1990 in some studies however limited aerobic denitrification has also been reported the transcriptional and metabolic regulation studies using paracoccus denitrificans have shown low but significant activity of n2o reductase under oxic condition zhi et al 2016 also the slow but significant rates of aerobic denitrification have been reported in some agricultural fields ji et al 2015 the diurnal changes in denitrification observed here can be related to the diel variations in anthropogenic flushing and associated shifts in the concentrations of dosw and no3 the diel cycle of dosw and consequently the diffusion of nitrate may further control the diurnal variation in denitrification because the diffusion from overlying water is a major source of no3 supply for denitrification and the thickness of oxygen rich water column acts as a no3 diffusion barrier christensen et al 1990 the period of high temperature summer season in this case when water holds low oxygen is expected to enhance the denitrification the results showed coherence as the rate of the denitrification peaked at 15 00 hrs this also coincides with the summer time decrease of the river water discharge and relative stabilization to favor the denitrification further 4 2 carbon demand the carbon addition most often but not always taylor and townsend 2010 enhances the denitrification obenhuber and lowrance 1991 the denitrification requires the co occurrence of carbon and no3 under sub oxic condition if biomass synthesis aspect is ignored this catabolic process denitrification requires carbon and nitrogen in 1 1 ratio taylor and townsend 2010 the organic carbon rich anoxic sediments often act as hotspots for denitrification van cleemput et al 2007 while developing a predictive model babbin et al 2014 have shown that the organic matter supply and c n ratios are among the most important determinants of setting the balance between the denitrification and annamox mediated n loss on a large scale and under the sufficient supply of organic matter the annamox leads to about 28 of total n loss dalsgaard et al 2012 the degradation of carbon provides electron source that regulates denitrifying enzyme activities richardson 2000 thus a high concentration of carbon is expected to favor the rate of denitrification dodla et al 2008 giles et al 2012 this plausibility seemed greater in the present case as the toc supply remained sufficiently high at all the source oriented sites throughout the study period and the denitrification showed a spatial synchrony with the toc this trend was invariably observed in all the three sub sets of studies both the denitrification and the concentration of toc were measured highest at jjmu and lowest at adpr similarly in concurrence with toc the denitrification did show declining trajectories down the confluences point sources this merits attention because the summer low flow favors c accumulation and an increase in temperature here summer time temperature rise is expected to enhance c mineralization gudasz et al 2010 in addition to its role in electron transfer the organic matter om degradation accelerates loss of benthic oxygen creating the conditions conducive to denitrification furthermore the denitrification showed concurrence with the temporal diurnal oscillation in toc and both peaked at 15 00 hrs in an incubation study babbin et al 2014 have shown that naturally occurring om more strongly stimulated the n loss compared to an added carbohydrate or an amino acid diet they argued that the diverse organic compounds present in naturally occurring om could be more beneficial to cell growth and maintenance as compared to a pure carbohydrate or an amino acid supplement we found strong positive correlation r2 0 81 to 0 99 p 0 001 between the concentration of toc and the rates of denitrification supplementary table 1 the multiple linear regression analysis did explain over 19 of the variance in denitrification driven n loss supplementary table 2 the unexplained spatio temporal variations could be linked to the intermittent episodic supply of organic matter ward et al 2009 also in an aerobic microbial respiration the humic substances can serve as terminal electron acceptor and play important role in the carbon cycling in a temporarily anaerobic environment lovley et al 1996 klüpfel et al 2014 these may become re oxidized by intermittent aeration as expected in the lotic systems and thus competitively suppress the electron transfer klüpfel et al 2014 furthermore because the expansion of oxygen deficient zones odz an intrinsic driver of denitrification has an intricate link with om supply jaiswal and pandey 2019b our observations will additionally help in evaluating the effects of future climate change and associated feedbacks in a recent study callbeck et al 2021 have observed that in the oxygen deficient zones the blooms of photosynthetic bacteria mainly the members of chlorobiaceae and synechococcales develop hotspot of organic matter mineralization enhancing the denitrification these observations together with those recorded here suggest that the carbon supply promotes n loss and have relevance contexting auto regulation of c eutrophy and c n vs n p driven regulations of the food chain in the human impacted large rivers 4 3 nitrate supply the humans are continuing to accelerate the supply of reactive nitrogen in the environment leading to nutrient imbalances and transformation of n cycle galloway et al 2008 pen uelas et al 2013 in rivers the effects of nutrient addition often depend on the interaction or combination with other stressors and on specific biological response variable birk et al 2020 the denitrification a microbially driven anaerobic process converts no3 to n2o intermediate product and n2 final product that lost to atmosphere neverthless the acetylene inhibition technique determines only the first gas both these gases lost to the atmosphere create n balance and regulate the n cycle although the former n2o is a natural contributor to greenhouse gases pool the oxygen demanding processes lower the concentration of dissolved oxygen and consequently increase the microbial demand for other electron acceptors no3 more recent studies show that the magnitude of the n removal is dependent on the surplus n present within the system cheng et al 2020 mineralization nitrification and anthropogenic flushing that enhance availability of no3 favor denitrification li et al 2021 although the removal efficiency declines under the excess concentration of no3 mulholland et al 2008 when no3 concentration drops the exchangeable nh4 becomes the main source of n supply through nitrification coupled denitrification strauss et al 2002 kreiling et al 2021 these microbial metabolic processes are enhanced by a temperature rise sheibley et al 2003 which is expected to occur here also during the summer season however the errors and uncertainties related to hydrologic changes and the associated factors reduce the comparability of short term experimental results with the annual riverine nitrogen budget alexander et al 2000 van breemen et al 2002 bouwman et al 2005 being conducted during the summer low flow that minimize variances relatively stable water increased availability of no3 and constrained dissolved oxygen dynamics and on multiple spatio temporal scales our study results provide an optimistic high resolution comparable database on mechanistic substrate no3 linkages and the drivers of n loss in the main stream we found that the location with high overall concentration of nitrate favors denitrification here the rate of denitrification was highest at jjmu site characterized by the highest concentration of no3 between the point sources the denitrification was highest at asdr supported by the highest concentration of nitrate also we found strong positive correlation site wise between the concentration of total nitrogen no3 nh4 and the rates of denitrification despite this the rates of denitrification showed a diurnal oscillation almost opposite to no3 concentration at the sediment water interface indicating the consumption of nitrate in the process furthermore diffusion of water column no3 to the bottom is constrained by water column levels of dissolved oxygen christensen et al 1990 this invites caution while linking water column no3 vs sediment water interface no3 concentrations with the denitrification n pollution and trophic state of the water body 4 4 phosphorous linkages the phosphorous supply also regulates n removal given a similar water residence time and total nitrogen load the p eutrophic water bodies can remove seven folds more n than their oligotrophic counterparts with over three times greater n removal efficiency in the former finlay et al 2013 this happens via p driven transfer of water column n to anoxic sediment followed by the n loss through denitrification small et al 2014 the p enrichment enhances the algal production coupled n uptake davison et al 1995 xie et al 2003 mills and arrigo 2010 using a box model experiment have suggested that the relative abundance of fast growing phytoplankton with different cellular n p quotas controls the amount of newly added nitrogen this mechanism may be more effective for p loving species pandey et al 2017 on sedimentation this particulate organic c along with the trapped n is transferred to the bottom where it undergoes microbial decomposition leading to benthic anoxia coupled denitrification in addition to p induced transfer of pelagic n some other mechanisms also operate in a recent study fan et al 2018 reported that the addition of p stimulated the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers and consequently the denitrification was enhanced we found proportionately higher rates of denitrification at sites characterized by higher concentrations of po4 3 this concurrence was observed mainly at the main stream sites in this study the phosphate explained about 10 55 of variations at main stream sites but did not explain large variations at source oriented sites supplementary table 2 as observed here these activities are expected to be further enhanced in response to the sediment p release we found high concentration of po4 3 high sediment p release and associated decline in the n p stoichiometry at sediment water interface characterized by high rates of denitrification this coincides with the lowest levels of dosw and no3 concentrations at the sediment water interface these trends were observed irrespective of site at all the spatio temporal scales including the diurnal oscillations suggesting that the anthropogenic p flushing enhances the denitrification driven n loss and alters n p stoichiometry towards n limitation the asynchronous responses of denitrification and sediment p release to dosw under spatially and temporally fluctuating conditions as observed here are important leading the system towards a single nutrient response especially in human impacted ecosystems collins et al 2017 together with the denitrification with a decline in dosw we found an increase in this self enhancing positive feedback sediment p release the pca clusters sediment p release and denitrification opposite to dosw fig 4 when a river system is constrained upto the level of a tipping point it may respond differently either to enhance positive feedback or counterbalance negative feedback a specific process here the p release is a positive feedback and denitrification is a negative feedback this study considers variation in denitrification with change in time and accordingly anthropogenic loading because of this some variables at all study sites cluster with certain time period fig 4 the time dependency could offer a greater role in management of the ganga river as it shows that the effluents added through point sources at different times of a day affect the denitrification and sediment p release this merits attention contexting an ecological perspective and the control of n eutrophication however this countervailing effect of n and p has no rationale for downscaling p control measures because excess p supply itself has a number of adverse effects on lakes rivers and coastal oceans in a regional to continental scale study collins et al 2017 have shown that the changes in n p stoichiometry will have a greater accountability shifting the ecosystem functioning in regions of high anthropogenic activity 4 5 dissolved oxygen dynamics the denitrification is a microbial driven process that removes the no3 mostly in hypoxic anoxic zones in aquatic ecosystems penn et al 2019 jaiswal and pandey 2021b accordingly the dissolved oxygen dynamics provides a plausible mechanistic link to explain the bimodalities in the denitrification rates but a moot question remains about the scale of occurrence of a rationale oscillation in the dissolved oxygen as a potential alternative driver here the denitrification at sediment water interface was strongly negatively correlated with dosw r2 0 94 to 0 99 p 0 001 proximity to the point sources vs concentration of the oxygen demanding substances and transverse flow regimes however lead to large uncertainties in the system level quantification of denitrification driven n removal furthermore the system level estimates may be largely constrained by seasonality in the river flow that has strong impacts on dissolved oxygen dynamics and potential distribution of the oxygen demanding substances in the river future climate change birk et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 and other drivers kvale et al 2021 may enlarge hypoxic anoxic areas and consequently the rate of denitrification the fact that benthic hypoxia anoxia favors denitrification can be seen in empirically supported arguments based on in situ and incubation experimental settings christensen et al 1990 laursen and seitzinger 2004 mulholland et al 2008 hamersley et al 2009 here we used three subsets of studies main stream river two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories to minimize variances the diel cycling of benthic hypoxia may trigger the nitrification denitrification responses in an opportunistic manner to assess how far the diel cycling of dosw affect denitrification at the sediment water interface we exploited within site variations linking benthic diel oxygen regimes to establish plausible causal connections with the nitrification denitrification coupling because we consider the site input as fixed effect the observed differences in nh4 availability would imply nitrification as an intrinsic preference due plausibly to the oscillation in oxygen supply the multiple linear regression analysis thus supports our correlative evidence that is driven by an intrinsic oscillation in oxygen supply the nitrification denitrification coupling favors n removal at the sediment water interface furthermore the availability of the labile organic carbon fuels denitrification and under c limited condition increased concentration of nh4 promotes the nitrification leading to production of nitrate taylor and townsend 2010 this mechanism might not operate here because c availability was not a constraint previous studies suggest that the rate of denitrification is slowly declines in course of time owing to no3 constraint mulholland et al 2008 however the nitrification denitrification coupling is not necessarily eliminated instead the positive oscillation in dosw can trigger no3 accrual through nitrification at sediment water interface when the no3 supply is limited under extreme denitrification the positive oscillation in dosw may cause a transient increase in aerobic ammonia oxidation bridging the no3 supply wang et al 2012 our results suggest that the nitrification denitrification de coupling might be site specific because a positive oscillation in dosw may overcome the apparent mismatch and thus maintain the continuum therefore understanding the nitrification denitrification coupling mediated by positive oscillation in dosw is important for more appropriate predictive modeling of n loss today and projecting the riverine sink in the future we found significant consistency between benthic oxic hypoxic cycle and n loss indicating the possibility that through the nitrification denitrification coupling river ecosystems balance the excess n supply the correlative evidence entwined with the consistency in these consequential effects and mechanistic links thereof indicate a stochastic self organizing ecosystem process essential for river ecosystem functional and biogeochemical studies furthermore because the climate warming not only influences the benthic oxic hypoxic transition but also alters the hydrologic residence time baron et al 2013 jaiswal et al 2021 and influences the oxygen holding capacity this mechanism based approach may circumvent the obstacles of river management decisions under the future climate change scenario 5 conclusions moving a step ahead from monitoring the water quality change to understanding the process interaction network in large rivers helps uncover the features essential to ensure adaptive management and landscape scale delivery of ecosystem services also it sheds light on the combined effects of human activities changes in biogeochemical cycles and climate with associated shift in overall river ecosystem functioning our results show that human inputs of carbon and phosphorus that often accompany n loading favored the denitrification driven n loss along spatio temporal scales in the ganga river more specifically source targeted locations act as hotspots of n removal the diel cycling of benthic hypoxia did favor the n loss in an opportunistic manner probably by triggering the coupling between nitrification and denitrification because the ganga river is a large and heterogeneous system with multiple point and non point sources of human inputs the magnitude of n removable shown here has implications for the coastal n loads furthermore because the c n p and many other pollutants for instance other oxygen demanding substances often act synergistically and the denitrification helps reducing n pollution and balancing n p stoichiometry our observations emphasize the need for more systematic long term whole stream scale studies on the denitrification driven n loss for a deeper understanding of ecosystem responses for predicting long term consequences under multiple stressor control and planning for adaptive management of the human impacted large rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2116,human activities have substantially enhanced riverine nitrogen loads in many parts of the world the processes such as denitrification remove a large fraction of n added to the system and thus are very helpful in mitigating the effects of increasing human n loads in aquatic ecosystems no systematic studies so far are available on current magnitude and factors regulating efficiency of n removal by the ganga river using three sub sets of studies main river course two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories along 520 km middle stretch we generated high spatio temporal resolution data to show that spatially targeted river reaches with higher nitrate concentrations are acting as hotspots of n removal in the ganga river the static core method was used to measure the rate of denitrification intact sediment core samples were incubated in the laboratory condition and efficiency adjusted pollution impacted point sources showed higher rates of denitrification 0 40 mg n m2 hr to 2 48 mg n m2 hr relative to main stream sites 0 32 mg n m2 hr to 2 09 mg n m2 hr our results indicate that increased level of carbon c and phosphorus p which often accompany nitrogen n inputs from human activities have enhanced n removal by the river periodic oxic hypoxic cycle at sediment water interface dosw which might link nitrification with denitrification has stimulated n removal at study sites in an opportunistic manner these results suggest that data on this natural process of n removal denitrification and factors thereof especially those accounting for interactive effects at spatially targeted locations should be taken into account to formulate policies for the management of nutrient and organic pollution keywords benthic hypoxia anoxia denitrification ecosystem feedback ganga river sediment p release data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the microbial interactions at sediment water interface are strongly influenced by the nature and magnitude of anthropogenic discharge jaiswal and pandey 2021a the flow regime alterations compromise functional attributes and provisioning services supported by river ecosystems nilsson et al 2005 tonkin et al 2017 whereas the human driven wastes being added to the rivers also alter heterotrophic microbial communities and consequently the carbon and nutrients cycling at sediment water interface freixa et al 2016 jaiswal and pandey 2021a constant and intense flushing of human releases cause a sequence of detrimental effects forcing the river ecosystems to compromise ecosystem functions and services they provide pen uelas et al 2013 best 2019 siddiqui et al 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 these problems are exacerbated by the flow regulation drought intensification and climate change nilsson et al 2005 palmer et al 2009 tonkin et al 2017 tonkin et al 2019 excessive fertilizer use widespread land use change and fossil fuel combustion together with the biological n fixation and other sources have added massive amount of reactive nitrogen nr almost in all ecosystems vitousek et al 1997 galloway et al 2008 the freshwater ecosystems are particularly prone and experience drastic transformation in ecosystem metabolism under excess nr load leading to the adverse impacts on the water quality trophic status and biodiversity schlesinger et al 2006 woodward et al 2012 finlay et al 2013 pandey and pandey 2013 pandey et al 2014 pandey et al 2017 such effects are interlinked and cumulative impacts are often long lasting for instance increased nutrients vs algal blooms and carbon loads lead to the development of mosaic of hypoxic anoxic zones jaiswal and pandey 2019a such effects although have negative impacts in an ecosystem function perspective jaiswal and pandey 2020 jaiswal and pandey 2021a enhance the denitrification and consequently lower the n load and its export to coastal waters cheng et al 2020 gervasio et al 2022 the rivers and streams export massive amount of bioavailable nitrogen from land to the ocean howarth et al 1996 boyer et al 2006 mulholland et al 2008 while doing so a large fraction of nr is removed along the hydrologic continuum this happens because under anoxic hypoxic condition a diverse group of microbes reduce nitrate and nitrite to gaseous n by a process called denitrification qiao et al 2020 the conditions at sediment water interface often favor the process van breemen et al 2002 schlesinger et al 2006 seitzinger et al 2006 mulholland et al 2008 this removal process helps in balancing overall nr in the rivers and streams van breemen et al 2002 and consequently its oceanic transport donner and kucharik 2008 efforts focusing on the kinetic and energetic control of human alteration of n biogeochemical cycle have increased our understanding of no3 dynamics in the rivers and streams mcisaac et al 2001 mulholland et al 2008 böhlke et al 2009 taylor and townsend 2010 also these have helped exploring the changes in river nitrogen budget bouwman et al 2005 processes such as the long term sediment burial and denitrification biotic uptake and anammox substantially reduce nitrogen concentration in aquatic ecosystems kuypers et al 2005 li et al 2007 schlesinger 2009 finlay et al 2013 callbeck et al 2021 the denitrification alone accounts for a large share in total n removal in the rivers and streams mulholland et al 2008 taylor and townsend 2010 liu et al 2013 the global nitrogen input in inland waters varies from 67 to 129 tg n yr 1 galloway et al 2004 beusen et al 2016 wherein the denitrification alone removes from 49 to 66 tg n yr 1 seitzinger et al 2006 maranger et al 2018 the denitrification removes about 43 of total n load in a river network that discharges to taihu lake in china zhao et al 2015 zhu et al 2020 in a study representing eight regions of the united states and puerto rico mulholland et al 2008 showed that the denitrification accounted for over 43 of the total no3 removal in 18 out of 72 study streams a study by gervasio et al 2022 has shown that denitrification not only removes nitrate but also the total n in po di goro river italy confirming the theory that the denitrification causes n reduction along rivers yang et al 2021 reported that the denitrification is responsible for about 20 of n removal in eight rivers of yangtze river estuary shanghai similarly for lower ishikari river system of japan jha and minagawa 2013 reported that the denitrification causes removal of 5 day of dissolved nitrate added to the river about 14 24 of total n load has been reported to be removed by this process from weisse elster river germany wagenschein and rode 2008 on the global scale freshwater systems account for 20 of total global denitrification seitzinger et al 2006 despite these facts systematic data base on the relative importance of denitrification and regulatory determinants is lacking for the rivers systems in india in general and for the ganga river in particular a comprehensive understanding of denitrification driven n loss and the factors at the sediment water interface that favor inhibit the process as a distinctive driver requires intensive system specific evaluation incorporating the extent of dissolved oxygen deficit dod and concentrations of no3 phosphorus and organic carbon would provide important insights into whether the nutrient enrichment biological uptake toc and dod are the primary regulators of the denitrification driven n loss in large rivers phosphorus supports accumulation of algal biomass which in turn leads to increase n transfer and decrease in dissolved oxygen and consequently stimulates denitrification jaiswal and pandey 2021a this is important for effective management decisions of large rivers in face of excessive n flushing from human sources the ganga river network is the most important river system of india in respect of its basin size and socio economic perspective the denitrification driven n removal and factors there of have never been studied for the ganga river here we studied the denitrification driven n removal rates and assessed if the diurnal oscillation in benthic dissolved oxygen levels favour inhibit the n removal in the ganga river this has relevance because of the specific nature of river ecosystems and because the diurnal oscillation in dissolved oxygen an intrinsic driver of denitrification is rarely measured in meaningful ways in large rivers pandey et al 2019 birk et al 2020 here we hypothesized that under the human driven nutrient and carbon pollution the diurnal oscillation in the level of dissolved oxygen and intermittent breaks in the hypoxic anoxic conditions in large rivers stimulate the denitrification driven n removal at the sediment water interface in an opportunistic manner the objectives were to explore the factors that affect denitrification at the sediment water interface and to assess whether the intermittent breaking of hypoxic anoxic conditions and possible nitrification denitrification coupling favors the n removal from benthic sediment in the ganga river to understand the control and variations we analyzed factors especially those that co occur with the enhanced n loading in the rivers such as dissolved oxygen deficit hypoxia anoxia carbon accumulation phosphorus concentration sediment p release nitrate concentration and n p ratios these results cover the first high spatio temporal resolution database on denitrification in the ganga river along the main river stream and point sources confluence trajectories useful in the management decisions as well as for constructing the basin scale n budgets 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the present study considers 32 heterogeneous study locations including the main stream tributary confluences and point source stressors along a 520 km mid segment of the ganga the largest river system of india the mid segment kannauj upstream 27 17 n 79 84 e to varanasi downstream 25 32 n 83 04 e considered here represents the most polluted stretch of the ganga river fig 1 with about 73 44 agricultural lands the basin represents the highest population density of the country and occupies 26 2 geographical area of india the river receives together with inputs from several hundred industrial units pollutants from 29 large cities 23 small cities and 48 townships situated along the bank climatic range encompasses sub tropical climate towards headwaters to tropical monsoonal towards downstream reaches the year shows transition from a dry summer march june to cold winter november february through a humid rainy season july october average rain in the basin ranges between 550 and 2500 mm with southwest monsoon accounting for more than 80 of the total rainfall the himalayan snow feeds the river during summer while rain driven surface runoff causes overflow during the monsoon season at rare occasions the day time summer temperature may exceed 46 c the soil in the basin shows variable proportion of sand silt and clay with very high natural fertility in the mid geographical region driessen et al 2000 2 2 experimental protocol for detailed investigation we conducted the incubation and in situ experiments based on the spatially explicit source locations depicting three sets of variability and environmental control we choose the sources based on their established role in degrading the river system and availability with sufficient spatial resolution in the first set we consider four stations along a 520 km river segment kannauj knuj jajmau jjmu adalpura adpr and rajghat rjht we selected three sub sites at each station and marked the gradient as the main stream of the ganga river the second set include trajectory analyses presenting a gradient of 600 m with two sub sets of spatially variable pollution loading these include two tributary confluences the ramganga ganga at kannauj and the varuna ganga at varanasi and two point source downstream trajectories wazidpur drain at kanpur and assi drain at varanasi fig 1 each trajectory consisted of seven sites situated 100 m apart originating from 100 m upstream to the source site 1 was located 100 m upstream to the source whereas sites 2 to 7 were situated downstream to point sources and tributary confluences representing actively discharging portion accounting for the stressors input and spatial dilution from river mixing to analyze diurnal variations samples from all the study sites were collected at different times during the day at 3 hourly intervals between 6 00 am to 6 00 pm of a day at 6 00 hrs 9 00 hrs 12 00 hrs 15 00 hrs and 18 00 hrs the ramganga and varuna are among the most polluted tributaries of the ganga river accounting for massive input of sewage and industrial effluents to the main stream central pollution control board cpcb 2013 of the point sources considered here the wazidpur drain flushes about 54 million liters per day mld industrial effluents whereas the assi drain adds over 66 mld urban sewage in the ganga river central pollution control board cpcb 2013 2 3 sample collection the sampling was done for two consecutive years 2018 and 2019 and for three months april may and june of each year we divided each sampling site into three sub sites and the samples were collected in triplicate from each sub site the water and sediment samples were collected from 25 m reach of the river during summer low flow april to june of 2018 and 2019 we used water depth sampler for collecting water samples from sediment water interface 1 5 to 6 0 m water column depth and stainless steel corers height 10 cm and internal diameter 5 cm for collecting sediment samples from each sampling location the samples were placed in the ice boxes and transferred to the laboratory following standard measures the sediment samples were segregated into two parts one part was kept intact for measuring sediment p release and denitrification and the other was kept at room temperature for air drying for 3 4 days the air dried samples were then grounded in mortar and pestle and sieved using 2 mm mesh for further analysis we applied same procedure in all sets of studies 2 4 measurements for the measurement of dissolved oxygen at the sediment water interface dosw the do was fixed at sampling site and quantified volumetrically in the laboratory following the modified winkler s approach apha 1998 all measurements were done under similar identical conditions we used the difference between measured do and pure water do at saturation under similar conditions to calculate the dissolved oxygen deficit sànchez et al 2007 the samples for measuring do and nutrients were collected from the sediment water interface and analyzed in the laboratory the dissolved oxygen deficit at sediment water interface is designated as dodsw for the nitrate in sediment we used phenol di sulphonic acid method tan 2005 and for ammonia in sediment we followed phenate method park et al 2009 the total organic carbon toc was measured by walkley and black chen et al 2015 and the phosphate by murphy and riley 1962 for quantifying sediment p release we used the method given by hu et al 2001 the experiment was carried out by incubating the sediment samples into specifically designed air tight chambers 15 cm 20 cm 30 cm air tight chambers were used to maintain conditions similar to in situ conditions the chambers filled with river water collected from respective sampling sites were kept in the dark to avoid photosynthetic o2 production we maintained two levels of do the first one was maintained in anoxic to hypoxic range 0 to 2 mg l 1 without stirring and aeration whereas the second one was maintained in sub oxic to oxic range 2 to 5 mg l 1 by intermittent stirring and aeration to ensure a near constant value of do and temperature we regularly monitored these parameters in the chambers the water temperature during incubation was maintained similar to the field condition at 28 c to study the p release from the sediment the samples were collected from the interface sediment water of each incubation chamber and p concentrations measured following murphy and riley 1962 static core method was used to measure the rate of denitrification groffman et al 1999 in this acetylene inhibition technique we incubated intact sediment cores 10 cm deep 5 cm diameter in specifically designed air sealed 1l glass chambers the 80 volumes of these chambers were filled with water samples collected from respective site and 20 left as head space at the beginning of the incubation the headspace as well as incubation water was mixed with 10 acetylene 10 saturation is known to give more successful result of acetylene based quantification of denitrification yoshinari and knowles 1976 shrewsbury et al 2016 by repeated pumping using syringes to maintain the temperature of these chambers similar to the field condition we used tempered water bath further to ensure the stable measurement conditions continuous stirring was done 500 rpm for 12 h the n2o produced was sampled immediately after starting of the incubation experiment and then after 2 h of the lag period the n2o concentration was analyzed using a greenhouse gas analyzer trace 1110 thermo fisher scientific india pvt ltd and the denitrification rate was calculated using a linear regression model of n2o concentration vs incubation time studies show that this method underestimates the denitrification rate in nitrate poor systems seitzinger et al 1993 miyajima et al 2001 fulweiler et al 2015 and is well usable in nitrate rich systems groffman et al 2006 kreiling et al 2019 palacin lizarbe et al 2020 the human impacted ganga river receives continuous supply of large amount of no3 through multiple point and non point sources yadav and pandey 2017 siddiqui et al 2020 here the efficiency of this method has been adjusted as per seitzinger et al 1993 seitzinger et al 1993 using repeated measurements have assessed the efficiency of acetylene inhibition technique as 50 and corrected the measured rate of denitrification due to 100 µm no3 enrichment of sediment cores that was 99 µmol n m 2h 1 as 200 µmol n m 2h 1 based on 50 efficiency of the method lohse et al 1996 compared denitrification rates measured by acetylene inhibition technique and isotopic pairing technique ipt and found a closely similar efficiency as observed by seitzinger et al 1993 considering these observations similar adjustment has been made here also for correct estimate of denitrification rate in the ganga river further because of its cost effectiveness easy handling sensitivity and rapid result giving nature this method is widely used especially for aquatic sediment samples where the major study targets are comparison of sites for evaluating the controlling factors cavigelli and robertson 2000 2 5 statistical analysis for all spatial resolution data are presented as mean confidence limits above 95 were used for justifying the level of significance principal component analyses pca were used to identify factors accounting for variability in denitrification and associated determinants to test the spatially explicit differences in rates of denitrification we used multiple linear regression analysis considering site variables as random effect using ibm spss statistic version 22 for other statistical analysis we used sigma plot software version 11 0 we used stability coefficient s 1 cv or µ σ where s stability coefficient cv coefficient of variation µ mean σ standard deviation to test spatial invariability among samples per site it is a standardized measure of the magnitude of constancy in a variable in relation to the mean tilman et al 2006 greater spatial invariability is considered as a signature of stability we found the values of s above 10 cv 10 indicating the state of spatial invariability spatial homogeneity among samples per site 3 results 3 1 mainstream trends the dissolved oxygen at sediment water interface dosw was found to be the highest at adalpura adpr

tributary confluence downstream trends the dosw did appear 0 5 mg l at site 2 confluence site of both the tributaries figs 5 and 6 on the temporal scale the dosw for the varuna ganga confluence was found to be the lowest at 15 00 hrs 0 19 mg l and highest at 9 00 hrs 3 52 mg l the ramganga ganga confluence trajectories showed a similar trend although the values were relatively higher figs 5 and 6 the trajectories showed an increase in dosw as the distance from the confluence increased the dodsw followed a trend opposite to dosw and the values ranged from 4 68 to 8 01 mg l for the varuna ganga confluence sites and from 4 38 mg l to 7 64 mg l for the ramganga ganga confluence sites the sediment p release and denitrification both declined with increasing distance from the confluence and their maxima appeared at site 2 confluence site and minima at site 1 100 m upstream to confluence for both the tributary confluence trajectories the sediment p release varied between 1 84 mg m2 day and 12 62 mg m2 day for the varuna ganga confluence fig 5 and between 2 31 mg m2 day and 16 59 mg m2 day for the ramganga ganga confluence sites fig 6 the diel oscillation in sediment p release showed maxima at 15 00 hrs and minima at 9 00 hrs for both the confluences the rate of denitrification followed a similar diel pattern the toc and nh4 concentrations at both the confluences followed a trend similar to those recorded for dodsw although the toc concentration was relatively higher at the varuna ganga confluence and the nh4 concentration was relatively higher at the ramganga ganga confluence figs 5 and 6 the no3 showed temporal synchrony with dosw and recorded to be maximum at 9 00 hrs and minimum at 15 00 hrs for both the confluence trajectories figs 5 and 6 we found the highest concentration of po4 3 at site 2 and the lowest at site 1 for both the confluences the no3 showed a deviation wherein the concentration maxima were found at site 5 for the varuna ganga confluence fig 5 and at site 7 for the ramganga ganga confluence fig 6 the rate of denitrification at vrna showed strong correlation with dosw r2 0 92 to 0 96 p 0 001 toc r2 0 97 to 0 98 p 0 001 and po4 3 r2 0 97 to 0 98 p 0 001 strong correlations were also observed for diurnal changes at rmga site supplementary table 1 here the phosphate did not explained large variations at source oriented sites supplementary table 2 the n p stoichiometry showed variable trends for the tributary confluences for the varuna ganga confluence trajectories all study sites showed n p ratios below 16 1 fig 3 only a marginal decrease from canonical ratio was found at the ramganga ganga confluence trajectory sites in the diel cycles the n p ratios showed synchrony with sediment p release fig 3 similar to the main stream studies the pca separated dosw opposite to dodsw and ecosystem feedbacks for both the confluence trajectories the toc nh4 dodsw and the ecosystem feedbacks clustered closely with 15 00 and 18 00 hrs for both the tributary confluence trajectories fig 4 3 3 point source downstream trends the concentration of dosw was highest at site 1 and lowest at site 2 for assi drain and also for wazidpur drain figs 7 and 8 the dosw increased with distance from the source values close to anoxia were observed at sites 2 to 4 at 15 00 hrs for wpdr and at site 2 at 15 00 hrs for asdr the overall concentrations ranged from 0 01 mg l to 3 13 mg l at wpdr and from 0 03 mg l to 3 81 mg l at asdr on a diurnal scale we found the maxima at 9 00 hrs and the minima at 15 00 hrs for both the trajectories figs 7 and 8 the dodsw varied between 5 07 mg l and 8 19 mg l at wpdr and between 4 40 mg l and 8 17 mg l at asdr the diel pattern showed a trend opposite to dosw the denitrification and sediment p release showed spatial and temporal synchrony with the dodsw for asdr and wpdr although the values were relatively higher at wpdr figs 7 and 8 the toc concentrations ranged from 1 75 mg g to 5 26 mg g at wpdr and from 1 37 mg g to 7 35 mg g at asdr on a diurnal scale the concentrations were maximum at 15 00 hrs and minimum at 9 00 hrs the concentration of nh4 followed a similar temporal trend whereas those of

with the values ranging from 0 84 mg g to 2 24 mg g at wpdr fig 7 and from 0 97 mg g to 3 83 mg g at asdr fig 8 similar to the main stream and tributary confluence downstream sites we found strong correlations between the denitrification rate and the concentrations of dosw toc no3 and po4 3 r2 0 81 to 0 99 p 0 01 to 0 001 at study sites of wpdr and asdr supplementary table 1 similar to the tributary confluence trajectories the point source trajectories at asdr also showed n p maxima at 15 00 hrs at site 1 the values declined from site 1 to site 5 and then increased up to site 7 fig 3 for wpdr n p stoichiometric maxima was found at site 7 at 15 00 hrs and unlike asdr a continuous increase was reported from site 1 to site 5 the deviation from standard 16 1 ratio was also found at wpdr however the decreases at this site were relatively lower fig 3 the pca separated denitrification with toc po4 3 and nh4 and sediment p release with dodsw for both asdr and wpdr sites the dosw and no3 were segregated opposite to these fig 4 also 15 00 hrs appeared with dodsw and ecosystem feedbacks while 12 00 hrs with dosw for both the point sources fig 4 4 discussion a comprehensive understanding of n loading its distribution and removal in large rivers and transport to the coastal oceans requires more extensive system specific evaluation the nitrate removal potential is a function of the river size and the large rivers are more effective sink owing to higher nitrogen availability larger transport distance and water residence time alexander et al 2000 wollheim et al 2006 also rivers exhibit interaction with stressors more often than lentic systems owing to temporal variability in higher shoreline length greater habitat heterogeneity and exposure to multiple stressors with increasing spatial scales birk et al 2020 denitrification a major driver of n loss from aquatic bodies is regulated by a number of factors including oxygen level organic matter temperature and substrate availability saunders and kalff 2001 bernot and dodds 2005 seitzinger et al 2006 tian et al 2020 our study showed higher rates of denitrification at study sites characterized by low dosw level and high concentrations of toc and nh4 at 15 00 hrs in an aquatic continuum where sub oxic and oxic environments interact the denitrification is tightly coupled with nitrification in space and time marchant et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 incorporating factors regulating nitrification denitrification coupling at sediment water interface would provide new insights into the denitrification driven n removal in large rivers our results yield an optimistic projection on drivers of the denitrification for management decisions associated with the large rivers here we show that a shift in our focus from monitoring a water quality change to understanding the process interaction network not only uncover the features essential to ensure adaptive management and landscape scale delivery of the river ecosystem services but also sheds light on the relations among human activities climate change biogeochemical cycles and the riverine ecosystem functioning using three sub sets of studies at multiple spatio temporal scales main river stream two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories we identified four regulatory determinants of denitrification in the ganga river carbon no3 po4 3 and dissolved oxygen concentration at sediment water interface we found strong dependency of denitrification on dodsw and carbon and nitrogen concentrations 4 1 general trends the lowest concentration of dosw at jajmau site indicated a very high pollution load as the jajmau area is a famous hub of leather industry releasing the effluents to the ganga river besides this a large amount of urban sewage is also added to the river at this site the heavy load of oxygen demanding substances ods coinciding with the summer time high temperature at 15 00 hrs can be interpreted as the main cause of dissolved oxygen deficit at the sediment water interface dodsw yadav and pandey 2017 similarly the lowest value of dosw at 15 00 hrs at the varuna ganga and the ramganga ganga confluences indicated an intensive consumption of oxygen the maxima at 9 00 hrs for the trajectories could be due to an increased flow from point sources and associated mixing of water coinciding with morning time low temperature yadav and pandey 2017 the low concentration of dosw at 15 00 hrs at all the study sites led to enhance ecosystem feedbacks denitrification and sediment p release at this point of time the sediment p release enhances oxygen demand lowering the dosw further additionally the heavy loading of toc and nh4 at 15 00 hrs also support denitrification maxima showing that these chemicals from industrial and agricultural activities and urban releases also have potential to affect the process of nitrogen transformation liu et al 2022 these aspects are further supported by low concentration of no3 and its synchrony with dosw at 15 00 hrs the denitrification rates recorded here appear substantially higher relative to those measured for the ouse river and the wiske river england pattinson et al 1998 the garonne river france teissier and torre 2002 the big ditch river usa schaller et al 2004 and the kalamazoo river usa beaulieu et al 2008 the mean denitrification rates were found closely at par with those measured for the raan river sweden jansson et al 1994 the misssissipi river usa richardson et al 2004 the sangamon river usa royer et al 2004 and many other rivers and streams of the world pina ochoa and álvarez cobelas 2006 mulholland et al 2008 in some lentic ecosystems the upper ranges have been reported relatively higher bruesewitz et al 2012 the process of denitrification is restricted to anaerobic zones of the sediment water interface or to a thin upper zone of benthic sediments in shallow streams the oxygen released in benthic photosynthesis can reduce denitrification up to 85 christensen et al 1990 in some studies however limited aerobic denitrification has also been reported the transcriptional and metabolic regulation studies using paracoccus denitrificans have shown low but significant activity of n2o reductase under oxic condition zhi et al 2016 also the slow but significant rates of aerobic denitrification have been reported in some agricultural fields ji et al 2015 the diurnal changes in denitrification observed here can be related to the diel variations in anthropogenic flushing and associated shifts in the concentrations of dosw and no3 the diel cycle of dosw and consequently the diffusion of nitrate may further control the diurnal variation in denitrification because the diffusion from overlying water is a major source of no3 supply for denitrification and the thickness of oxygen rich water column acts as a no3 diffusion barrier christensen et al 1990 the period of high temperature summer season in this case when water holds low oxygen is expected to enhance the denitrification the results showed coherence as the rate of the denitrification peaked at 15 00 hrs this also coincides with the summer time decrease of the river water discharge and relative stabilization to favor the denitrification further 4 2 carbon demand the carbon addition most often but not always taylor and townsend 2010 enhances the denitrification obenhuber and lowrance 1991 the denitrification requires the co occurrence of carbon and no3 under sub oxic condition if biomass synthesis aspect is ignored this catabolic process denitrification requires carbon and nitrogen in 1 1 ratio taylor and townsend 2010 the organic carbon rich anoxic sediments often act as hotspots for denitrification van cleemput et al 2007 while developing a predictive model babbin et al 2014 have shown that the organic matter supply and c n ratios are among the most important determinants of setting the balance between the denitrification and annamox mediated n loss on a large scale and under the sufficient supply of organic matter the annamox leads to about 28 of total n loss dalsgaard et al 2012 the degradation of carbon provides electron source that regulates denitrifying enzyme activities richardson 2000 thus a high concentration of carbon is expected to favor the rate of denitrification dodla et al 2008 giles et al 2012 this plausibility seemed greater in the present case as the toc supply remained sufficiently high at all the source oriented sites throughout the study period and the denitrification showed a spatial synchrony with the toc this trend was invariably observed in all the three sub sets of studies both the denitrification and the concentration of toc were measured highest at jjmu and lowest at adpr similarly in concurrence with toc the denitrification did show declining trajectories down the confluences point sources this merits attention because the summer low flow favors c accumulation and an increase in temperature here summer time temperature rise is expected to enhance c mineralization gudasz et al 2010 in addition to its role in electron transfer the organic matter om degradation accelerates loss of benthic oxygen creating the conditions conducive to denitrification furthermore the denitrification showed concurrence with the temporal diurnal oscillation in toc and both peaked at 15 00 hrs in an incubation study babbin et al 2014 have shown that naturally occurring om more strongly stimulated the n loss compared to an added carbohydrate or an amino acid diet they argued that the diverse organic compounds present in naturally occurring om could be more beneficial to cell growth and maintenance as compared to a pure carbohydrate or an amino acid supplement we found strong positive correlation r2 0 81 to 0 99 p 0 001 between the concentration of toc and the rates of denitrification supplementary table 1 the multiple linear regression analysis did explain over 19 of the variance in denitrification driven n loss supplementary table 2 the unexplained spatio temporal variations could be linked to the intermittent episodic supply of organic matter ward et al 2009 also in an aerobic microbial respiration the humic substances can serve as terminal electron acceptor and play important role in the carbon cycling in a temporarily anaerobic environment lovley et al 1996 klüpfel et al 2014 these may become re oxidized by intermittent aeration as expected in the lotic systems and thus competitively suppress the electron transfer klüpfel et al 2014 furthermore because the expansion of oxygen deficient zones odz an intrinsic driver of denitrification has an intricate link with om supply jaiswal and pandey 2019b our observations will additionally help in evaluating the effects of future climate change and associated feedbacks in a recent study callbeck et al 2021 have observed that in the oxygen deficient zones the blooms of photosynthetic bacteria mainly the members of chlorobiaceae and synechococcales develop hotspot of organic matter mineralization enhancing the denitrification these observations together with those recorded here suggest that the carbon supply promotes n loss and have relevance contexting auto regulation of c eutrophy and c n vs n p driven regulations of the food chain in the human impacted large rivers 4 3 nitrate supply the humans are continuing to accelerate the supply of reactive nitrogen in the environment leading to nutrient imbalances and transformation of n cycle galloway et al 2008 pen uelas et al 2013 in rivers the effects of nutrient addition often depend on the interaction or combination with other stressors and on specific biological response variable birk et al 2020 the denitrification a microbially driven anaerobic process converts no3 to n2o intermediate product and n2 final product that lost to atmosphere neverthless the acetylene inhibition technique determines only the first gas both these gases lost to the atmosphere create n balance and regulate the n cycle although the former n2o is a natural contributor to greenhouse gases pool the oxygen demanding processes lower the concentration of dissolved oxygen and consequently increase the microbial demand for other electron acceptors no3 more recent studies show that the magnitude of the n removal is dependent on the surplus n present within the system cheng et al 2020 mineralization nitrification and anthropogenic flushing that enhance availability of no3 favor denitrification li et al 2021 although the removal efficiency declines under the excess concentration of no3 mulholland et al 2008 when no3 concentration drops the exchangeable nh4 becomes the main source of n supply through nitrification coupled denitrification strauss et al 2002 kreiling et al 2021 these microbial metabolic processes are enhanced by a temperature rise sheibley et al 2003 which is expected to occur here also during the summer season however the errors and uncertainties related to hydrologic changes and the associated factors reduce the comparability of short term experimental results with the annual riverine nitrogen budget alexander et al 2000 van breemen et al 2002 bouwman et al 2005 being conducted during the summer low flow that minimize variances relatively stable water increased availability of no3 and constrained dissolved oxygen dynamics and on multiple spatio temporal scales our study results provide an optimistic high resolution comparable database on mechanistic substrate no3 linkages and the drivers of n loss in the main stream we found that the location with high overall concentration of nitrate favors denitrification here the rate of denitrification was highest at jjmu site characterized by the highest concentration of no3 between the point sources the denitrification was highest at asdr supported by the highest concentration of nitrate also we found strong positive correlation site wise between the concentration of total nitrogen no3 nh4 and the rates of denitrification despite this the rates of denitrification showed a diurnal oscillation almost opposite to no3 concentration at the sediment water interface indicating the consumption of nitrate in the process furthermore diffusion of water column no3 to the bottom is constrained by water column levels of dissolved oxygen christensen et al 1990 this invites caution while linking water column no3 vs sediment water interface no3 concentrations with the denitrification n pollution and trophic state of the water body 4 4 phosphorous linkages the phosphorous supply also regulates n removal given a similar water residence time and total nitrogen load the p eutrophic water bodies can remove seven folds more n than their oligotrophic counterparts with over three times greater n removal efficiency in the former finlay et al 2013 this happens via p driven transfer of water column n to anoxic sediment followed by the n loss through denitrification small et al 2014 the p enrichment enhances the algal production coupled n uptake davison et al 1995 xie et al 2003 mills and arrigo 2010 using a box model experiment have suggested that the relative abundance of fast growing phytoplankton with different cellular n p quotas controls the amount of newly added nitrogen this mechanism may be more effective for p loving species pandey et al 2017 on sedimentation this particulate organic c along with the trapped n is transferred to the bottom where it undergoes microbial decomposition leading to benthic anoxia coupled denitrification in addition to p induced transfer of pelagic n some other mechanisms also operate in a recent study fan et al 2018 reported that the addition of p stimulated the growth of autotrophic and heterotrophic denitrifiers and consequently the denitrification was enhanced we found proportionately higher rates of denitrification at sites characterized by higher concentrations of po4 3 this concurrence was observed mainly at the main stream sites in this study the phosphate explained about 10 55 of variations at main stream sites but did not explain large variations at source oriented sites supplementary table 2 as observed here these activities are expected to be further enhanced in response to the sediment p release we found high concentration of po4 3 high sediment p release and associated decline in the n p stoichiometry at sediment water interface characterized by high rates of denitrification this coincides with the lowest levels of dosw and no3 concentrations at the sediment water interface these trends were observed irrespective of site at all the spatio temporal scales including the diurnal oscillations suggesting that the anthropogenic p flushing enhances the denitrification driven n loss and alters n p stoichiometry towards n limitation the asynchronous responses of denitrification and sediment p release to dosw under spatially and temporally fluctuating conditions as observed here are important leading the system towards a single nutrient response especially in human impacted ecosystems collins et al 2017 together with the denitrification with a decline in dosw we found an increase in this self enhancing positive feedback sediment p release the pca clusters sediment p release and denitrification opposite to dosw fig 4 when a river system is constrained upto the level of a tipping point it may respond differently either to enhance positive feedback or counterbalance negative feedback a specific process here the p release is a positive feedback and denitrification is a negative feedback this study considers variation in denitrification with change in time and accordingly anthropogenic loading because of this some variables at all study sites cluster with certain time period fig 4 the time dependency could offer a greater role in management of the ganga river as it shows that the effluents added through point sources at different times of a day affect the denitrification and sediment p release this merits attention contexting an ecological perspective and the control of n eutrophication however this countervailing effect of n and p has no rationale for downscaling p control measures because excess p supply itself has a number of adverse effects on lakes rivers and coastal oceans in a regional to continental scale study collins et al 2017 have shown that the changes in n p stoichiometry will have a greater accountability shifting the ecosystem functioning in regions of high anthropogenic activity 4 5 dissolved oxygen dynamics the denitrification is a microbial driven process that removes the no3 mostly in hypoxic anoxic zones in aquatic ecosystems penn et al 2019 jaiswal and pandey 2021b accordingly the dissolved oxygen dynamics provides a plausible mechanistic link to explain the bimodalities in the denitrification rates but a moot question remains about the scale of occurrence of a rationale oscillation in the dissolved oxygen as a potential alternative driver here the denitrification at sediment water interface was strongly negatively correlated with dosw r2 0 94 to 0 99 p 0 001 proximity to the point sources vs concentration of the oxygen demanding substances and transverse flow regimes however lead to large uncertainties in the system level quantification of denitrification driven n removal furthermore the system level estimates may be largely constrained by seasonality in the river flow that has strong impacts on dissolved oxygen dynamics and potential distribution of the oxygen demanding substances in the river future climate change birk et al 2020 cheng et al 2020 jaiswal et al 2021 and other drivers kvale et al 2021 may enlarge hypoxic anoxic areas and consequently the rate of denitrification the fact that benthic hypoxia anoxia favors denitrification can be seen in empirically supported arguments based on in situ and incubation experimental settings christensen et al 1990 laursen and seitzinger 2004 mulholland et al 2008 hamersley et al 2009 here we used three subsets of studies main stream river two tributary confluence trajectories and two point source trajectories to minimize variances the diel cycling of benthic hypoxia may trigger the nitrification denitrification responses in an opportunistic manner to assess how far the diel cycling of dosw affect denitrification at the sediment water interface we exploited within site variations linking benthic diel oxygen regimes to establish plausible causal connections with the nitrification denitrification coupling because we consider the site input as fixed effect the observed differences in nh4 availability would imply nitrification as an intrinsic preference due plausibly to the oscillation in oxygen supply the multiple linear regression analysis thus supports our correlative evidence that is driven by an intrinsic oscillation in oxygen supply the nitrification denitrification coupling favors n removal at the sediment water interface furthermore the availability of the labile organic carbon fuels denitrification and under c limited condition increased concentration of nh4 promotes the nitrification leading to production of nitrate taylor and townsend 2010 this mechanism might not operate here because c availability was not a constraint previous studies suggest that the rate of denitrification is slowly declines in course of time owing to no3 constraint mulholland et al 2008 however the nitrification denitrification coupling is not necessarily eliminated instead the positive oscillation in dosw can trigger no3 accrual through nitrification at sediment water interface when the no3 supply is limited under extreme denitrification the positive oscillation in dosw may cause a transient increase in aerobic ammonia oxidation bridging the no3 supply wang et al 2012 our results suggest that the nitrification denitrification de coupling might be site specific because a positive oscillation in dosw may overcome the apparent mismatch and thus maintain the continuum therefore understanding the nitrification denitrification coupling mediated by positive oscillation in dosw is important for more appropriate predictive modeling of n loss today and projecting the riverine sink in the future we found significant consistency between benthic oxic hypoxic cycle and n loss indicating the possibility that through the nitrification denitrification coupling river ecosystems balance the excess n supply the correlative evidence entwined with the consistency in these consequential effects and mechanistic links thereof indicate a stochastic self organizing ecosystem process essential for river ecosystem functional and biogeochemical studies furthermore because the climate warming not only influences the benthic oxic hypoxic transition but also alters the hydrologic residence time baron et al 2013 jaiswal et al 2021 and influences the oxygen holding capacity this mechanism based approach may circumvent the obstacles of river management decisions under the future climate change scenario 5 conclusions moving a step ahead from monitoring the water quality change to understanding the process interaction network in large rivers helps uncover the features essential to ensure adaptive management and landscape scale delivery of ecosystem services also it sheds light on the combined effects of human activities changes in biogeochemical cycles and climate with associated shift in overall river ecosystem functioning our results show that human inputs of carbon and phosphorus that often accompany n loading favored the denitrification driven n loss along spatio temporal scales in the ganga river more specifically source targeted locations act as hotspots of n removal the diel cycling of benthic hypoxia did favor the n loss in an opportunistic manner probably by triggering the coupling between nitrification and denitrification because the ganga river is a large and heterogeneous system with multiple point and non point sources of human inputs the magnitude of n removable shown here has implications for the coastal n loads furthermore because the c n p and many other pollutants for instance other oxygen demanding substances often act synergistically and the denitrification helps reducing n pollution and balancing n p stoichiometry our observations emphasize the need for more systematic long term whole stream scale studies on the denitrification driven n loss for a deeper understanding of ecosystem responses for predicting long term consequences under multiple stressor control and planning for adaptive management of the human impacted large rivers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

2117,the priority management areas pmas of a watershed are areas with high contributions to the pollutant load to the assessment outlet such as the watershed outlet and thus have high priority in the decision making for comprehensive watershed management existing spatial units used to identify pmas are commonly based on three concepts including subbasins artificial geographic entities and grid cells however these identification units cannot balance general applicability to diverse geographic environments and the representation degree of spatial heterogeneity which impacts the effectiveness of the pmas this study proposes utilizing landscape positions along the hillslope as identification units of pmas which can be represented by slope position units e g upland backslope and valley landscape position units inherently have upstream downstream relations with each other and with channels therefore their contributions to the assessment outlet can be quantified based on the propagation effects of hillslope and channel routing processes the proposed method was implemented using a restructured and enhanced version of the soil and water assessment tool swat to quantify the pollutants released and a markov chain based surrogate model to distinguish the source contribution with the improvement of the transition matrix in representing both landscape position and channel units two watersheds one in china and one in the usa with different geographic characteristics were selected to separately conduct comparative experiments to identify pmas at the landscape position and subbasin levels the results show that pmas based on landscape positions have more accurate spatial distribution and require less area for the future configuration of management practices to achieve the same management goal as pmas based on subbasins the better effectiveness of landscape position units in identifying pmas is mainly due to their better ability to represent hillslope processes and the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface environments within subbasins the proposed method can be implemented using other watershed models that support landscape position units or different types of spatial units with explicit upstream downstream relations within subbasins keywords priority management areas landscape positions spatial units pollutant load contribution best management practices swat data availability the modeling data was provided at https github com lreis2415 watershedmodelingdata 1 introduction priority management areas pmas are prioritized areas for pollution management in a watershed with a high contribution to the pollutant load of its direct or indirect downstream water bodies chen et al 2014 this concept is similar to a critical source area csa which is more commonly used to identify highly polluted areas pionke et al 2000 white et al 2009 but usually does not emphasize propagation effects from upstream to downstream in the watershed which is essential for decision making for comprehensive watershed management priority management areas are ideal spatial locations for implementing suitable best management practices bmps to effectively control ecological and environmental problems such as soil erosion and non point source pollution shen et al 2015 tian et al 2020 guo et al 2022 the identification of pmas can be regarded as the first step in the spatial configuration of bmps for comprehensive watershed management where factors affecting actual management decisions such as investment plans stakeholder willingness environmental goals and bmp effectiveness can be considered the spatial distribution of pmas considerably affects the locations areas and effectiveness of the configured bmps affecting the cost effectiveness of the bmp scenario i e the spatial configuration of multiple bmps in the watershed chiang et al 2014 qin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 therefore the accurate identification of pmas is a key issue for comprehensive watershed management chen et al 2022 although field observation is the most accurate approach to investigating the pollutant released at the plot or farm level the pollutant contributions from upstream plots or farms to downstream channels are difficult or even impossible to observe directly therefore the pma identification methods are primarily based on watershed modeling the key point in the identification methods is to determine an appropriate type of spatial unit as a modeling unit for pollutant production and contribution to the assessment outlet such as the watershed outlet hereafter referred to as the identification units dong et al 2018 white et al 2009 the identification units utilized in existing research are mainly based on three concepts subbasins shang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 dong et al 2018 artificial geographic entities tian et al 2020 and grid cells kovacs et al 2012 it is worth noting that the identification units are not necessarily consistent with the realistic implementation units of bmps or the simulation units of watershed models zhu et al 2019 for example the nonstructural bmp of returning farmland to forest configured on the pma identified by subbasin units is implemented on the farmland with a slope above 15 within this subbasin and represented at hru units using the soil and water assessment tool swat chen et al 2022 a subbasin represents a relatively closed and independent geographic unit that is linked to other subbasins through channels subbasin units are the most straightforward and frequently used identification units because they are delineated and modeled in most watershed modeling in addition to directly utilizing subbasin units researchers also use the combination of subbasins as identification units according to administrative regions such as villages shang et al 2012 for the benefit of making and implementing watershed management policies especially in large study areas liu et al 2019 shang et al 2012 however a subbasin can be recognized and modeled as an integral of one or more levels of finer spatial units to better represent spatial heterogeneity within the subbasin such as hillslopes slope position units landuse fields and even grid cells therefore it may be too coarse to use these subbasin based identification units because the heterogeneity of pollutant sources and transportation processes within the subbasins should be considered qin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 artificial geographic entities refer to artificially constructed and hydrologically connected geographic entities based on the characteristics of a specific geographic environment ghebremichael et al 2013 such as polders that developed in lowland plains with densely distributed rivers and lakes tian et al 2020 such spatial units have relatively homogeneous features from the perspectives of physical geographic processes and or anthropogenic activities for example a polder may contain agricultural land irrigation channels ponds and even villages that are enclosed by artificial dams to serve as conservation areas for flood management and waterlogging although artificial geographic entities are more appropriate for use as identification units than subbasins in the corresponding geographic environments they are not easily generalized as universal identification units and thus cannot be widely applied to diverse geographic environments grid cells are commonly used spatial units with regular shapes in geographic modeling and their underlying surface characteristics are homogeneous grid cells are universal units to identify pmas accurately using those watershed models that explicitly represent flow routing among grid cells kovacs et al 2012 however using grid cells may cause more fragmentized distributions of pmas which reduces the implementation efficiency and limits further application e g for pma based spatial optimization of bmps therefore the existing spatial units used for identifying pmas cannot balance general applicability to diverse geographic environments and the representation degree of spatial heterogeneity according to the foregoing analysis proper identification units should 1 be broadly available and not be limited to a specific geographic environment 2 be capable of representing the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface characteristics physical geographic processes and or anthropogenic activities inside the study area by a small number of units and 3 have hydrologic connections among each other that existing watershed models can explicitly represent this study proposes the use of landscape positions along hillslopes within each subbasin to identify pmas in this study landscape positions refer to the geographic objects that reflect the integrated effects of hillslope processes on topography and affect geographic processes on the surface volk et al 2007 arnold et al 2010 miller and schaetzl 2015 qin et al 2018 landscape position units are universal in most geographic environments that can be delineated by slope position units wolock et al 2004 volk et al 2007 qin et al 2009 based on commonly used classification systems of slope positions e g the divide backslope and valley units utilized by arnold et al 2010 each subbasin needs only a few spatial units e g three to represent the spatial homogeneity from the perspective of hillslope processes qin et al 2018 rathjens et al 2016 in addition landscape position units have inherent upstream downstream relations among each other which have been considered in watershed modeling arnold et al 2010 bieger et al 2019 rathjens et al 2015 yang et al 2002 and spatial optimization of bmps qin et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 thus landscape position units meet the requirements for use as the aforementioned identification units this study proposes a pma identification method based on landscape position units and evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with the adoption of widely used subbasin units the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed method together with the exemplified implementation based on the swat model i e the restructured and enhanced version of the swat model bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 and section 3 presents a comparative experimental design of using landscape position and subbasin units to identify pmas of total nitrogen in two watersheds with different geographic characteristics the experimental results and discussion are presented in section 4 and the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 method design to identify pmas at the landscape position unit level two key issues must be addressed the first is the quantification of pollutants released from the landscape position units the second is how to distinguish the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit to the assessment outlet that is the residual amount of pollutant after being transported to its direct downstream channel and then transitioning in hierarchical channels before reaching the assessment outlet chen et al 2014 generally the contribution of the pollutant load cannot be directly determined from the results of most watershed models instead watershed models output the pollutant released from each simulation unit e g the hydrologic response unit hru in swat or lumped unit e g subbasin as well as the flow of substances in and out of each channel to fill this gap grimvall and stålnacke 1996 proposed a markov chain based surrogate model to simulate pollutant transitions from upstream channels one channel for each subbasin to the assessment outlet in a statistical manner their basic idea is to use analog pollutant transformation and transfer processes in hierarchical channels as a markov process in which the transition matrix is determined by the upstream downstream relations among channels and the retention effects of the channel routing process after a finite number of transitions equal to the length of the longest branch in hierarchical channels all pollutants from upstream subbasins reach the assessment outlet thus the corresponding pollutant load contributions can be derived grimvall and stålnacke 1996 follow up studies continued to apply the subbasin unit in the markov chain based model chen et al 2014 rankinen et al 2016 which includes pollutant production on hillslopes and pollutant routing in the channel the transition matrix of the markov chain based model can be improved to represent both landscape position and channel units therefore if these two processes can be separated in the landscape position units and channels the improved markov chain based model will be able to distinguish the pollutant contribution of each landscape position unit to the assessment outlet based on this basic idea the proposed method aims to incorporate a watershed model that supports landscape position units as simulation or lumped units to improve the markov chain based pma identification method from the subbasin level to the landscape position unit level therefore the markov chain based pma identification method can be generalized as a method framework that supports one or more types of hierarchical spatial units with explicit hydrological connections i e upstream downstream relations such as subbasins and landscape position units fig 1 in this study the exemplified implementation of the improved markov chain based pma identification method adopted the swat model to construct the transition matrix and quantify the pollutants released section 2 1 first introduces the ability of the swat model to delineate and represent landscape position units section 2 2 then elaborates on the proposed method to derive pollutant load contribution of landscape position units to the watershed outlet taking the swat model as an implementation example 2 1 delineation and modeling of landscape position units in swat as a restructured and enhanced version of the swat model swat bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 introduced a new type of spatial unit between the subbasin unit and hru named the landscape position unit lsu which includes the uplands and floodplains fig 2 swat uses the relative position index rpi of each cell in a gridded digital elevation model dem to delineate lsus rathjens et al 2016 the rpi of each cell is the ratio of the drop length to its downstream valley i e the stream cell and the length from its upstream ridge cell to the same valley cell the rpi ranges from 0 to 1 the cell with a rpi less than the user specific threshold is classified as the floodplain this means that the basic spatial discretization of a watershed in swat contains three types of nested spatial units as a hierarchy subbasin lsu and hru the hru as the basic simulation unit of swat is delineated as the unique combination of soil land use and slope class within the lsu which is spatially discrete fig 2a and even lacks explicit spatial locations according to different delineation parameters arnold et al 2010 therefore hrus are unsuitable for pma identification units since there are no hydrologic connections between hrus although the hru is finer than the lsu in addition swat also abstracts specific types of geographic entities as spatial units with locations and properties to participate in watershed modeling for example reservoirs or ponds within a subbasin are first generalized as one point in the channel that divides the channel into two parts and then defined by the upstream part with additional properties such as storage capacity fig 2a the hillslopes lsus and hrus also are delineated accordingly while the two aquifer units remain unchanged fig 2b these spatial units can enrich the flow routing network of swat and play important roles in the simulation of study areas with specific geographic environments such as agricultural ecosystems with densely distributed ponds with the new spatial discretization scheme swat improves the representation of realistic hydrologic processes from hillslopes to channels bieger et al 2019 instead of directly adding all released substances from hrus including water sediment and pollutants to the channel swat first lumps hrus outputs at the lsu level and then routes these outputs to other spatial units using two different methods the first method involves completely draining from the upland to the floodplain and from the floodplain to the channel which is applicable for lateral flow in soils and groundwater recharge in aquifers fig 2b the second method distributes water from the upland to the channel pond reservoir by a constant ratio e g 0 30 from lsu2 to the pond reservoir and 0 66 from lsu4 to the channel as shown in fig 2b hereafter channel pond reservoir is referred to as channel collectively and the rest to the floodplain as additional net precipitation to participate in the hydrologic simulation the output from the floodplain drains entirely into the channel fig 2b swat provides two ways to determine this ratio the user specified global value for all upland units in the watershed and the area ratio of each upland to its floodplain the area ratio method has been proven to be more realistic in representing the connectivity than the fixed ratio for the entire watershed bieger et al 2019 and is therefore applied in this study with the flow routing network primarily constructed by chain of hru lsu and channel fig 2b swat is suitable to quantify pollutants released at the landscape position units and the corresponding transportation amounts to their direct channels 2 2 pollutant load contribution of landscape position units derived from a markov chain based surrogate model of swat based on the flow routing network and simulation results of swat the key part of the markov chain based surrogate model can be determined that is the transition matrix of pollutants through lsus and channels subsequently using the lumped simulation results at lsus as inputs the markov chain based model can determine the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit 2 2 1 transition matrix of pollutants based on flow routing network and retention effects of the channel routing process the transition matrix is constructed using flow distribution relations from upstream to downstream units and the retention coefficients of channel routing processes chen et al 2014 according to the spatial discretization scheme of swat see section 2 1 the flow distribution relations among the lsus and channels can be represented by an n n matrix h eq 1 fig 3 shows an example of the matrix h 1 h i j s i f l s u f l o o d p l a i n j i s a d j a c e n t d o w n s t r e a m o f l s u u p l a n d i 1 s i f c h a c h a n n e l j i s d i r e c t l y d o w n s t r e a m o f l s u u p l a n d i 1 i f c h a j i s a d j a c e n t d o w n s t r e a m o f c h a i o r l s u u p l a n d i 0 o t h e r w i s e where n is the total number of lsus and channels in the watershed and s is the flow distribution ratio from upland to floodplain for surface runoff s is initially set by the area ratio of upland and hillslope while for lateral flow and groundwater recharge s 1 fig 2b each row represents the flow distribution relations of a spatial unit with its downstream units the sum of all elements in one row equals 1 except for the channel row where the assessment outlet is located e g the 7th row in fig 3 when the outlet of channel 7 is the assessment outlet for a given assessment outlet of channel k there exists a smallest integer n k to make h n k 0 which means that after n k transitions pollutants from all upstream spatial units of channel k will reach the outlet the physical meaning of n k is the longest routing length from the uppermost spatial units to the outlet of channel k for example n 7 4 in fig 3 the complicated channel routing process of pollutants accounts for the chemical transformation or retardation of the interested substances for example a stepwise transformation from organic nitrogen to ammonia then to nitrite and finally to nitrate is simulated in swat neitsch et al 2011 for each channel of the study area the difference between the output substance and the input can be explained by the retention effect of the channel which is time varying and affected by pollutant concentration water temperature and other factors the yearly average retention of each channel can be regarded as its stable removal capacity of pollutants calculated as the retention coefficient eq 2 chen et al 2014 grimvall and stålnacke 1996 hejzlar et al 2009 the landscape position unit is a lumped unit of pollutant sources calculated at hrus thus it has no retention effect 2 r load in load out load in where r denotes the retention coefficient of the channel to a specific pollutant loadin is the pollutant input to the channel that includes pollutant outputs of adjacent upstream channels and pollutant released from upstream lsus and loadout is the pollutant output at the outlet of the channel the retention coefficient of spatial units r also is represented by an n n matrix as follows 3 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n where the ith diagonal element ri denotes the retention coefficient of spatial unit i for lsus ri 0 and for channels ri can be calculated using eq 2 the transition matrix h of the markov chain based model can be represented as follows and used to simulate the flow transitions of substances e g water and pollutants through the hierarchy of landscape position units and channels 4 h h i r where i is an identity matrix 2 2 2 calculation of pollutant load contribution except for the transition matrix the pollutant released from each lsu is the primary input data for the markov chain based model as the initial states because the channel acts as a receptor for pollutants it contains no self generated pollutants an n 1 matrix l is used to organize the input of the pollutant sources 5 l e 1 e 2 e i e n t where ei is the pollutant released from spatial unit i based on the simulation results of swat specifically ei 0 if i is a channel the pollutant load contribution of each spatial unit to a specific assessment outlet can be calculated using simple matrix calculations grimvall and stålnacke 1996 6 e h k n k v k l 7 h k i j h i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k and j k 8 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise where k represents the assessment outlet located channel and the corresponding modification from h to h k implies that the kth state is transformed to an absorbing state vk is an n 1 matrix for extracting the kth column of the h k n k resulting in the contribution rate of each unit and the asterisk denotes element wise multiplication considering that the pollutants of interest may have various states that are modeled in different watershed processes the calculation of the pollutant load contribution should be combined with all components calculated by different transition matrixes h and pollutant source matrixes l for example the total nitrogen consists of organic and inorganic nitrogen in swat swat the inorganic nitrogen output in the channel includes ammonia nitrite and nitrate nitrogen the nitrate nitrogen no 3 and the organic nitrogen orgn are relatively stable forms of nitrogen in the soil that are routed from hrus into the channel with water and sediment neitsch et al 2011 since the nitrogen output at the lsu level is the sum of its internal hrus output the nitrogen released from lsus considered in this study also comprises no 3 and orgn for the sake of simplicity we use the term of total nitrogen tn in this study the tn load contribution can be calculated as follows 9 e tn e n o 3 s u r f e n o 3 l a t e n o 3 g w e orgn 10 e n o 3 s u r f h surf i r n o 3 k n k v k l n o 3 s

runoff lat denotes the lateral flow gw denotes the groundwater recharge hsurf hlat and hgw describe the flow distribution relations among the spatial units of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge respectively lno3 surf lno3 lat and lno3 gw are the amounts of no 3 released in surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge respectively and lorgn surf is the amount of orgn released in surface runoff 2 2 3 pma identification based on classification of pollution degrees once the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit is distinguished a classification of pollution degrees can be determined to identify different levels of pmas such as high medium and low contribution pmas in this study the natural breaks method a commonly used classification method de smith et al 2018 giri et al 2016 was used to classify the pollutant load contribution the natural breaks method groups the data into different classes utilizing the statistical groupings and pattern characteristics inherent in the data to minimize the data difference within a class and maximize the difference between classes 3 experimental design to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method a comparative experimental study was designed to identify the pmas for total nitrogen at the landscape position and subbasin levels based on the same calibrated swat model the source of total nitrogen considered in this study is summed by nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen on the lsu since the improvement of the markov based surrogate model in this study does not change the calculation principle of the original model the differences in identifying pmas can be attributed to the identification units adopted i e the lsu and the subbasin unit the same experimental design was used in two watersheds to evaluate the applicability of the method under different geographic characteristics e g topographical climatic hydrological and ecological conditions that is the zhongtianshe watershed 42 km2 in southern china and the willow river watershed 212 km2 in western wisconsin usa fig 4 3 1 study areas and data the zhongtianshe watershed located south of liyang jiangsu province china is a typical hilly area situated in the upstream region of taihu lake the study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 15 5 c and the average annual precipitation is 1160 mm the main soil type is yellow red soil which is a type of acidic soil that is easily weathered the main land use types are forest 77 cropland 10 primarily rice paddy fields orchard 3 residential areas 8 and water areas 2 the watershed experiences frequent agricultural activities and the cultivation of rice and wheat is the primary contributor to local non point source pollution because the study area is in the drinking water source of liyang knowing the details of the pollution situation and taking reasonable measures to control pollution is a vital issue for the local government shi et al 2021 the willow river located in western wisconsin usa is a tributary of the st croix river it is classified as part of the central wisconsin undulating till plain based on a report by the u s environmental protection agency epa 2022 and is characterized as relatively flat compared to the zhongtianshe watershed the area has a continental climate with high evapotranspiration an average annual temperature of 11 8 c and an average annual precipitation of 788 mm the soils are predominantly silt loams with moderately well drained characteristics the main land use types are grassland 45 forest 27 cropland 18 residential areas 6 and wetlands 3 watershed crops are dominated by corn silage soybeans and alfalfa resulting in non point source pollution and relatively poor water quality as the headwater of the popular willow river state park and attractive trout fishing destinations the watershed has been the focus of non point source pollution control for decades almendinger and murphy 2007 the input data of the study areas for the swat modeling consisted of a dem land use types soil types and properties meteorological data agricultural management practices and observed data at the watershed outlet detailed descriptions of the data for the two watersheds are listed in table 1 3 2 modeling and calibration of the swat model two swat models were built by qswat version 1 2 2 and swat version 59 3 to simulate the total nitrogen pollution in each study area a total of 15 subbasins 41 lsus and 1260 hrus were generated in the zhongtianshe watershed while 19 subbasins 131 lsus and 7245 hrus were generated in the willow river watershed fig 5 the rpi thresholds for delineating uplands and floodplains were manually determined by visual interpretation of contour lines which are 0 14 and 0 3 for the zhongtianshe watershed and the willow river watershed respectively in most situations each subbasin has one upland and one floodplain there may be an additional floodplain due to the very short channel generated after the setting of a pond or reservoir limited by the available observed data for the zhongtianshe watershed the year 2011 was set as a warm up period and 2012 2013 and 2014 2015 were set as calibration and validation periods respectively for daily flow modeling the model performance for the total nitrogen was calibrated using the 5 day or 3 day monitoring data from 2014 to 2015 a total of 181 values of which 53 values during the rainy season were sampled in about three days interval from june to august in the two years without validation for the willow river watershed the model had a 2 year warm up period the calibration period ranged from 1 january 2012 to 31 july 2014 and the validation period was from 1 october 2010 to 31 december 2011 respectively the available daily ammonia and organic nitrogen were combined to calibrate and validate the nitrogen modeling model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percentage bias pbias root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 as listed in table 2 according to the criteria of monthly model performance proposed by moriasi et al 2007 a satisfactory model should generally have the nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for flow 55 for sediment and 70 for nutrients meanwhile the daily model is more likely to have poorer model performance than the monthly model engel et al 2007 therefore considering this study mainly utilizes the relative rather than absolute model result comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed pma identification method both calibrated models can be regarded as acceptable for use in the current study besides considering that the swat model is still in active development an open source repository was created to store the modeling data and update the modeling details and results routinely in future studies https github com lreis2415 watershedmodelingdata 3 3 identification and evaluation of pmas at lsu level and subbasin level to evaluate the effectiveness of the pmas at the lsu level pmas also were identified at the subbasin level in the same study area based on the same calibrated swat model and the corresponding markov chain based surrogate model the average annual total nitrogen modeled during the calibration period was used for the input data of the markov chain to identify the pmas with the watershed outlet set as the assessment outlet the natural breaks method was utilized to classify the nitrogen load contribution of the spatial units into three classes and high contribution areas were identified as pmas the comparison of the pmas identified at the lsu and subbasin levels was done from two perspectives the spatial distribution and cumulative load contributions the spatial distribution of pmas is an intuitive way to qualitatively analyze the spatial consistency and differences between different units the cumulative load contributions were used to quantitatively compare the relations between the area of pmas and their total pollutant load contribution 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of pmas in the zhongtianshe watershed five lsus and two subbasins classified as high contribution areas were identified as pmas fig 6 there was a relatively consistent spatial correlation between the two levels for example one subbasin was identified as pma at both levels that is subbasin s2 in fig 6b and its two lsus l2 and l3 in fig 6a pmas identified at the lsu level have a more accurate spatial distribution because of the inherent characteristics of the lsus that can represent the spatial heterogeneity within subbasins considering the retention effect of ponds and reservoirs in swat the upstream part of the subbasin may have a distinctive load contribution compared to the downstream part for example in subbasin s1 in fig 6b the upstream part composed of floodplain l10 and upland l12 in fig 6a were identified as medium contribution areas while the downstream floodplain l1 was the high contribution area in addition most lsu based pmas were floodplains in the zhongtianshe watershed this may be because the cropland in the study area is mostly distributed along the valley plain which is a direct cause of local non point source pollution these results also indicate that swat is well suited for characterizing pollutants released at the lsu level and their transitions in the reconstructed routing network by lsus and channels including ponds in the willow river watershed two lsus and two subbasins classified as high contribution areas were identified as pmas fig 7 it was similar that at both the lsu and subbasin levels the northeast areas of the watershed were identified as low contribution areas owing to the upstream pollution predominantly reduced by the ponds and wetlands along the main channel although the results identified at the two levels had similar spatial distributions the subbasin based pmas covered larger areas than the lsu based pmas which may result in additional screening work or more investment in watershed management decision making in contrast the lsu based pmas were the upland areas within the subbasins that is uplands l1 and l2 fig 7a within two subbasins fig 7b the medium contribution areas identified at the lsu level were also more specific and detailed than the areas identified at the subbasin level therefore it is clear that lsu based results can provide a finer identification than subbasin based results in the willow river watershed in addition for the willow river watershed lsus belonging to subbasin l2 in fig 7b were not identified as pmas but as contribution areas classified as medium contribution areas this shows that the application of detailed spatial units could decompose the aggregation of the pollutant load within a subbasin in a relatively realistic representation although subbasin s2 contributed a high pollutant load as the result of being the largest subbasin in the watershed overall lsu based pmas have improved the accuracy of identification from the perspective of spatial distribution compared with subbasin based pmas it is also shown that the proposed pma identification method at landscape position units using swat is effective and applicable to different watersheds 4 2 cumulative load contribution to quantitatively evaluate the difference in pmas identified at the lsu and subbasin levels for each case study each type of spatial unit was ranked by load contribution in descending order and plotted in figs 8 and 9 with the cumulative area and load contribution calculated in the zhongtianshe watershed lsu based pmas contributed 48 6 of the total nitrogen in 23 3 of the watershed area whereas subbasin based pmas only contributed 44 7 in as much as 30 1 of the area fig 8a this means that landscape position units are more effective in identifying the pmas moreover the cumulative area contribution line of the lsu based method in fig 8a was always higher than that of the subbasin based method proving its better effectiveness although based on different types of identification units in the willow river watershed lsu based pmas contributed 31 7 of the total nitrogen in 5 9 of the watershed area whereas subbasin based pmas contributed 54 9 of the total nitrogen in 21 5 of the area fig 9a it is not convincing to simply use these numbers to compare the effectiveness of the two levels in this watershed however the line in fig 9a shows that the lsu based pmas almost always covered less area than the subbasin based pmas under the same cumulative contribution in general the results reveal that there would be less work on the reduction of pollution at the lsu level if the local government wanted to control the pollution to a certain extent furthermore there was no deterministic relation between the area of the spatial unit and its pollutant load contribution for example lsu l1 in the zhongtianshe watershed contributed 12 0 of the total nitrogen but ranked 17 in area while subbasin s1 contributed 24 3 of the total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area fig 8 in the willow river watershed lsu l1 contributed 16 8 of the total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area and subbasin s1 contributed 31 7 of total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area of all subbasins fig 9 although absolute differences exist in the results of the two watersheds due to different geographic characteristics the comparison between them is less important for the scope of this study which is to evaluate the effectiveness of the pmas at the lsu level instead the similar appearance depicted by the relations between the area of pmas and their total load contribution at the two levels in different watersheds can also show the universality and effectiveness of lsus in summary identifying pmas based on landscape positions performs better than subbasins from the perspectives of both the spatial distribution and cumulative load contribution in both test watersheds thus lsu based pmas have the merit of accounting for more pollutant load contributions with smaller areas and can effectively be utilized in the spatial configuration of bmps for integrated watershed management 5 conclusions this study proposes the use of landscape position units lsus derived from a universal type of spatial unit for most geographic environments as identification units for priority management areas pmas a markov chain based surrogate model of the swat model was implemented with the improvement of the transition matrix in representing both landscape position and channel units to distinguish the pollutant load contribution of each lsu to the assessment outlet and then identify the pmas according to a classification method the experimental results show that landscape position units are more effective than widely used subbasins in identifying pmas because of their superior ability to represent hillslope processes and the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface environments within subbasins therefore lsu based pmas are much more valuable for providing accurate locations for implementing suitable bmps for integrated watershed management the improved markov chain based pma identification method can be regarded as a method framework more types of spatial units with explicit upstream downstream relations may be proposed and validated to identify pmas with the support of proper watershed models in addition several issues may be worth attention in future research such as 1 how to consider various climate scenarios to determine the retention effects of channel routing processes 2 how to better quantify the hydrological connectivity among landscape positions and channels and its effects on pma identification 3 how a specific type of identification unit affects pma identification under different delineation methods 4 how the modeling accuracy of the same or different watershed models affects pma identification and 5 how pmas derived from different identification

2117,the priority management areas pmas of a watershed are areas with high contributions to the pollutant load to the assessment outlet such as the watershed outlet and thus have high priority in the decision making for comprehensive watershed management existing spatial units used to identify pmas are commonly based on three concepts including subbasins artificial geographic entities and grid cells however these identification units cannot balance general applicability to diverse geographic environments and the representation degree of spatial heterogeneity which impacts the effectiveness of the pmas this study proposes utilizing landscape positions along the hillslope as identification units of pmas which can be represented by slope position units e g upland backslope and valley landscape position units inherently have upstream downstream relations with each other and with channels therefore their contributions to the assessment outlet can be quantified based on the propagation effects of hillslope and channel routing processes the proposed method was implemented using a restructured and enhanced version of the soil and water assessment tool swat to quantify the pollutants released and a markov chain based surrogate model to distinguish the source contribution with the improvement of the transition matrix in representing both landscape position and channel units two watersheds one in china and one in the usa with different geographic characteristics were selected to separately conduct comparative experiments to identify pmas at the landscape position and subbasin levels the results show that pmas based on landscape positions have more accurate spatial distribution and require less area for the future configuration of management practices to achieve the same management goal as pmas based on subbasins the better effectiveness of landscape position units in identifying pmas is mainly due to their better ability to represent hillslope processes and the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface environments within subbasins the proposed method can be implemented using other watershed models that support landscape position units or different types of spatial units with explicit upstream downstream relations within subbasins keywords priority management areas landscape positions spatial units pollutant load contribution best management practices swat data availability the modeling data was provided at https github com lreis2415 watershedmodelingdata 1 introduction priority management areas pmas are prioritized areas for pollution management in a watershed with a high contribution to the pollutant load of its direct or indirect downstream water bodies chen et al 2014 this concept is similar to a critical source area csa which is more commonly used to identify highly polluted areas pionke et al 2000 white et al 2009 but usually does not emphasize propagation effects from upstream to downstream in the watershed which is essential for decision making for comprehensive watershed management priority management areas are ideal spatial locations for implementing suitable best management practices bmps to effectively control ecological and environmental problems such as soil erosion and non point source pollution shen et al 2015 tian et al 2020 guo et al 2022 the identification of pmas can be regarded as the first step in the spatial configuration of bmps for comprehensive watershed management where factors affecting actual management decisions such as investment plans stakeholder willingness environmental goals and bmp effectiveness can be considered the spatial distribution of pmas considerably affects the locations areas and effectiveness of the configured bmps affecting the cost effectiveness of the bmp scenario i e the spatial configuration of multiple bmps in the watershed chiang et al 2014 qin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2021 therefore the accurate identification of pmas is a key issue for comprehensive watershed management chen et al 2022 although field observation is the most accurate approach to investigating the pollutant released at the plot or farm level the pollutant contributions from upstream plots or farms to downstream channels are difficult or even impossible to observe directly therefore the pma identification methods are primarily based on watershed modeling the key point in the identification methods is to determine an appropriate type of spatial unit as a modeling unit for pollutant production and contribution to the assessment outlet such as the watershed outlet hereafter referred to as the identification units dong et al 2018 white et al 2009 the identification units utilized in existing research are mainly based on three concepts subbasins shang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 shen et al 2015 dong et al 2018 artificial geographic entities tian et al 2020 and grid cells kovacs et al 2012 it is worth noting that the identification units are not necessarily consistent with the realistic implementation units of bmps or the simulation units of watershed models zhu et al 2019 for example the nonstructural bmp of returning farmland to forest configured on the pma identified by subbasin units is implemented on the farmland with a slope above 15 within this subbasin and represented at hru units using the soil and water assessment tool swat chen et al 2022 a subbasin represents a relatively closed and independent geographic unit that is linked to other subbasins through channels subbasin units are the most straightforward and frequently used identification units because they are delineated and modeled in most watershed modeling in addition to directly utilizing subbasin units researchers also use the combination of subbasins as identification units according to administrative regions such as villages shang et al 2012 for the benefit of making and implementing watershed management policies especially in large study areas liu et al 2019 shang et al 2012 however a subbasin can be recognized and modeled as an integral of one or more levels of finer spatial units to better represent spatial heterogeneity within the subbasin such as hillslopes slope position units landuse fields and even grid cells therefore it may be too coarse to use these subbasin based identification units because the heterogeneity of pollutant sources and transportation processes within the subbasins should be considered qin et al 2018 wang et al 2016 artificial geographic entities refer to artificially constructed and hydrologically connected geographic entities based on the characteristics of a specific geographic environment ghebremichael et al 2013 such as polders that developed in lowland plains with densely distributed rivers and lakes tian et al 2020 such spatial units have relatively homogeneous features from the perspectives of physical geographic processes and or anthropogenic activities for example a polder may contain agricultural land irrigation channels ponds and even villages that are enclosed by artificial dams to serve as conservation areas for flood management and waterlogging although artificial geographic entities are more appropriate for use as identification units than subbasins in the corresponding geographic environments they are not easily generalized as universal identification units and thus cannot be widely applied to diverse geographic environments grid cells are commonly used spatial units with regular shapes in geographic modeling and their underlying surface characteristics are homogeneous grid cells are universal units to identify pmas accurately using those watershed models that explicitly represent flow routing among grid cells kovacs et al 2012 however using grid cells may cause more fragmentized distributions of pmas which reduces the implementation efficiency and limits further application e g for pma based spatial optimization of bmps therefore the existing spatial units used for identifying pmas cannot balance general applicability to diverse geographic environments and the representation degree of spatial heterogeneity according to the foregoing analysis proper identification units should 1 be broadly available and not be limited to a specific geographic environment 2 be capable of representing the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface characteristics physical geographic processes and or anthropogenic activities inside the study area by a small number of units and 3 have hydrologic connections among each other that existing watershed models can explicitly represent this study proposes the use of landscape positions along hillslopes within each subbasin to identify pmas in this study landscape positions refer to the geographic objects that reflect the integrated effects of hillslope processes on topography and affect geographic processes on the surface volk et al 2007 arnold et al 2010 miller and schaetzl 2015 qin et al 2018 landscape position units are universal in most geographic environments that can be delineated by slope position units wolock et al 2004 volk et al 2007 qin et al 2009 based on commonly used classification systems of slope positions e g the divide backslope and valley units utilized by arnold et al 2010 each subbasin needs only a few spatial units e g three to represent the spatial homogeneity from the perspective of hillslope processes qin et al 2018 rathjens et al 2016 in addition landscape position units have inherent upstream downstream relations among each other which have been considered in watershed modeling arnold et al 2010 bieger et al 2019 rathjens et al 2015 yang et al 2002 and spatial optimization of bmps qin et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 thus landscape position units meet the requirements for use as the aforementioned identification units this study proposes a pma identification method based on landscape position units and evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing it with the adoption of widely used subbasin units the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proposed method together with the exemplified implementation based on the swat model i e the restructured and enhanced version of the swat model bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 and section 3 presents a comparative experimental design of using landscape position and subbasin units to identify pmas of total nitrogen in two watersheds with different geographic characteristics the experimental results and discussion are presented in section 4 and the conclusions are presented in section 5 2 method design to identify pmas at the landscape position unit level two key issues must be addressed the first is the quantification of pollutants released from the landscape position units the second is how to distinguish the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit to the assessment outlet that is the residual amount of pollutant after being transported to its direct downstream channel and then transitioning in hierarchical channels before reaching the assessment outlet chen et al 2014 generally the contribution of the pollutant load cannot be directly determined from the results of most watershed models instead watershed models output the pollutant released from each simulation unit e g the hydrologic response unit hru in swat or lumped unit e g subbasin as well as the flow of substances in and out of each channel to fill this gap grimvall and stålnacke 1996 proposed a markov chain based surrogate model to simulate pollutant transitions from upstream channels one channel for each subbasin to the assessment outlet in a statistical manner their basic idea is to use analog pollutant transformation and transfer processes in hierarchical channels as a markov process in which the transition matrix is determined by the upstream downstream relations among channels and the retention effects of the channel routing process after a finite number of transitions equal to the length of the longest branch in hierarchical channels all pollutants from upstream subbasins reach the assessment outlet thus the corresponding pollutant load contributions can be derived grimvall and stålnacke 1996 follow up studies continued to apply the subbasin unit in the markov chain based model chen et al 2014 rankinen et al 2016 which includes pollutant production on hillslopes and pollutant routing in the channel the transition matrix of the markov chain based model can be improved to represent both landscape position and channel units therefore if these two processes can be separated in the landscape position units and channels the improved markov chain based model will be able to distinguish the pollutant contribution of each landscape position unit to the assessment outlet based on this basic idea the proposed method aims to incorporate a watershed model that supports landscape position units as simulation or lumped units to improve the markov chain based pma identification method from the subbasin level to the landscape position unit level therefore the markov chain based pma identification method can be generalized as a method framework that supports one or more types of hierarchical spatial units with explicit hydrological connections i e upstream downstream relations such as subbasins and landscape position units fig 1 in this study the exemplified implementation of the improved markov chain based pma identification method adopted the swat model to construct the transition matrix and quantify the pollutants released section 2 1 first introduces the ability of the swat model to delineate and represent landscape position units section 2 2 then elaborates on the proposed method to derive pollutant load contribution of landscape position units to the watershed outlet taking the swat model as an implementation example 2 1 delineation and modeling of landscape position units in swat as a restructured and enhanced version of the swat model swat bieger et al 2017 bieger et al 2019 introduced a new type of spatial unit between the subbasin unit and hru named the landscape position unit lsu which includes the uplands and floodplains fig 2 swat uses the relative position index rpi of each cell in a gridded digital elevation model dem to delineate lsus rathjens et al 2016 the rpi of each cell is the ratio of the drop length to its downstream valley i e the stream cell and the length from its upstream ridge cell to the same valley cell the rpi ranges from 0 to 1 the cell with a rpi less than the user specific threshold is classified as the floodplain this means that the basic spatial discretization of a watershed in swat contains three types of nested spatial units as a hierarchy subbasin lsu and hru the hru as the basic simulation unit of swat is delineated as the unique combination of soil land use and slope class within the lsu which is spatially discrete fig 2a and even lacks explicit spatial locations according to different delineation parameters arnold et al 2010 therefore hrus are unsuitable for pma identification units since there are no hydrologic connections between hrus although the hru is finer than the lsu in addition swat also abstracts specific types of geographic entities as spatial units with locations and properties to participate in watershed modeling for example reservoirs or ponds within a subbasin are first generalized as one point in the channel that divides the channel into two parts and then defined by the upstream part with additional properties such as storage capacity fig 2a the hillslopes lsus and hrus also are delineated accordingly while the two aquifer units remain unchanged fig 2b these spatial units can enrich the flow routing network of swat and play important roles in the simulation of study areas with specific geographic environments such as agricultural ecosystems with densely distributed ponds with the new spatial discretization scheme swat improves the representation of realistic hydrologic processes from hillslopes to channels bieger et al 2019 instead of directly adding all released substances from hrus including water sediment and pollutants to the channel swat first lumps hrus outputs at the lsu level and then routes these outputs to other spatial units using two different methods the first method involves completely draining from the upland to the floodplain and from the floodplain to the channel which is applicable for lateral flow in soils and groundwater recharge in aquifers fig 2b the second method distributes water from the upland to the channel pond reservoir by a constant ratio e g 0 30 from lsu2 to the pond reservoir and 0 66 from lsu4 to the channel as shown in fig 2b hereafter channel pond reservoir is referred to as channel collectively and the rest to the floodplain as additional net precipitation to participate in the hydrologic simulation the output from the floodplain drains entirely into the channel fig 2b swat provides two ways to determine this ratio the user specified global value for all upland units in the watershed and the area ratio of each upland to its floodplain the area ratio method has been proven to be more realistic in representing the connectivity than the fixed ratio for the entire watershed bieger et al 2019 and is therefore applied in this study with the flow routing network primarily constructed by chain of hru lsu and channel fig 2b swat is suitable to quantify pollutants released at the landscape position units and the corresponding transportation amounts to their direct channels 2 2 pollutant load contribution of landscape position units derived from a markov chain based surrogate model of swat based on the flow routing network and simulation results of swat the key part of the markov chain based surrogate model can be determined that is the transition matrix of pollutants through lsus and channels subsequently using the lumped simulation results at lsus as inputs the markov chain based model can determine the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit 2 2 1 transition matrix of pollutants based on flow routing network and retention effects of the channel routing process the transition matrix is constructed using flow distribution relations from upstream to downstream units and the retention coefficients of channel routing processes chen et al 2014 according to the spatial discretization scheme of swat see section 2 1 the flow distribution relations among the lsus and channels can be represented by an n n matrix h eq 1 fig 3 shows an example of the matrix h 1 h i j s i f l s u f l o o d p l a i n j i s a d j a c e n t d o w n s t r e a m o f l s u u p l a n d i 1 s i f c h a c h a n n e l j i s d i r e c t l y d o w n s t r e a m o f l s u u p l a n d i 1 i f c h a j i s a d j a c e n t d o w n s t r e a m o f c h a i o r l s u u p l a n d i 0 o t h e r w i s e where n is the total number of lsus and channels in the watershed and s is the flow distribution ratio from upland to floodplain for surface runoff s is initially set by the area ratio of upland and hillslope while for lateral flow and groundwater recharge s 1 fig 2b each row represents the flow distribution relations of a spatial unit with its downstream units the sum of all elements in one row equals 1 except for the channel row where the assessment outlet is located e g the 7th row in fig 3 when the outlet of channel 7 is the assessment outlet for a given assessment outlet of channel k there exists a smallest integer n k to make h n k 0 which means that after n k transitions pollutants from all upstream spatial units of channel k will reach the outlet the physical meaning of n k is the longest routing length from the uppermost spatial units to the outlet of channel k for example n 7 4 in fig 3 the complicated channel routing process of pollutants accounts for the chemical transformation or retardation of the interested substances for example a stepwise transformation from organic nitrogen to ammonia then to nitrite and finally to nitrate is simulated in swat neitsch et al 2011 for each channel of the study area the difference between the output substance and the input can be explained by the retention effect of the channel which is time varying and affected by pollutant concentration water temperature and other factors the yearly average retention of each channel can be regarded as its stable removal capacity of pollutants calculated as the retention coefficient eq 2 chen et al 2014 grimvall and stålnacke 1996 hejzlar et al 2009 the landscape position unit is a lumped unit of pollutant sources calculated at hrus thus it has no retention effect 2 r load in load out load in where r denotes the retention coefficient of the channel to a specific pollutant loadin is the pollutant input to the channel that includes pollutant outputs of adjacent upstream channels and pollutant released from upstream lsus and loadout is the pollutant output at the outlet of the channel the retention coefficient of spatial units r also is represented by an n n matrix as follows 3 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n where the ith diagonal element ri denotes the retention coefficient of spatial unit i for lsus ri 0 and for channels ri can be calculated using eq 2 the transition matrix h of the markov chain based model can be represented as follows and used to simulate the flow transitions of substances e g water and pollutants through the hierarchy of landscape position units and channels 4 h h i r where i is an identity matrix 2 2 2 calculation of pollutant load contribution except for the transition matrix the pollutant released from each lsu is the primary input data for the markov chain based model as the initial states because the channel acts as a receptor for pollutants it contains no self generated pollutants an n 1 matrix l is used to organize the input of the pollutant sources 5 l e 1 e 2 e i e n t where ei is the pollutant released from spatial unit i based on the simulation results of swat specifically ei 0 if i is a channel the pollutant load contribution of each spatial unit to a specific assessment outlet can be calculated using simple matrix calculations grimvall and stålnacke 1996 6 e h k n k v k l 7 h k i j h i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k and j k 8 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise where k represents the assessment outlet located channel and the corresponding modification from h to h k implies that the kth state is transformed to an absorbing state vk is an n 1 matrix for extracting the kth column of the h k n k resulting in the contribution rate of each unit and the asterisk denotes element wise multiplication considering that the pollutants of interest may have various states that are modeled in different watershed processes the calculation of the pollutant load contribution should be combined with all components calculated by different transition matrixes h and pollutant source matrixes l for example the total nitrogen consists of organic and inorganic nitrogen in swat swat the inorganic nitrogen output in the channel includes ammonia nitrite and nitrate nitrogen the nitrate nitrogen no 3 and the organic nitrogen orgn are relatively stable forms of nitrogen in the soil that are routed from hrus into the channel with water and sediment neitsch et al 2011 since the nitrogen output at the lsu level is the sum of its internal hrus output the nitrogen released from lsus considered in this study also comprises no 3 and orgn for the sake of simplicity we use the term of total nitrogen tn in this study the tn load contribution can be calculated as follows 9 e tn e n o 3 s u r f e n o 3 l a t e n o 3 g w e orgn 10 e n o 3 s u r f h surf i r n o 3 k n k v k l n o 3 s

runoff lat denotes the lateral flow gw denotes the groundwater recharge hsurf hlat and hgw describe the flow distribution relations among the spatial units of surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge respectively lno3 surf lno3 lat and lno3 gw are the amounts of no 3 released in surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater recharge respectively and lorgn surf is the amount of orgn released in surface runoff 2 2 3 pma identification based on classification of pollution degrees once the pollutant load contribution of each landscape position unit is distinguished a classification of pollution degrees can be determined to identify different levels of pmas such as high medium and low contribution pmas in this study the natural breaks method a commonly used classification method de smith et al 2018 giri et al 2016 was used to classify the pollutant load contribution the natural breaks method groups the data into different classes utilizing the statistical groupings and pattern characteristics inherent in the data to minimize the data difference within a class and maximize the difference between classes 3 experimental design to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method a comparative experimental study was designed to identify the pmas for total nitrogen at the landscape position and subbasin levels based on the same calibrated swat model the source of total nitrogen considered in this study is summed by nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen on the lsu since the improvement of the markov based surrogate model in this study does not change the calculation principle of the original model the differences in identifying pmas can be attributed to the identification units adopted i e the lsu and the subbasin unit the same experimental design was used in two watersheds to evaluate the applicability of the method under different geographic characteristics e g topographical climatic hydrological and ecological conditions that is the zhongtianshe watershed 42 km2 in southern china and the willow river watershed 212 km2 in western wisconsin usa fig 4 3 1 study areas and data the zhongtianshe watershed located south of liyang jiangsu province china is a typical hilly area situated in the upstream region of taihu lake the study area is characterized by a subtropical monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 15 5 c and the average annual precipitation is 1160 mm the main soil type is yellow red soil which is a type of acidic soil that is easily weathered the main land use types are forest 77 cropland 10 primarily rice paddy fields orchard 3 residential areas 8 and water areas 2 the watershed experiences frequent agricultural activities and the cultivation of rice and wheat is the primary contributor to local non point source pollution because the study area is in the drinking water source of liyang knowing the details of the pollution situation and taking reasonable measures to control pollution is a vital issue for the local government shi et al 2021 the willow river located in western wisconsin usa is a tributary of the st croix river it is classified as part of the central wisconsin undulating till plain based on a report by the u s environmental protection agency epa 2022 and is characterized as relatively flat compared to the zhongtianshe watershed the area has a continental climate with high evapotranspiration an average annual temperature of 11 8 c and an average annual precipitation of 788 mm the soils are predominantly silt loams with moderately well drained characteristics the main land use types are grassland 45 forest 27 cropland 18 residential areas 6 and wetlands 3 watershed crops are dominated by corn silage soybeans and alfalfa resulting in non point source pollution and relatively poor water quality as the headwater of the popular willow river state park and attractive trout fishing destinations the watershed has been the focus of non point source pollution control for decades almendinger and murphy 2007 the input data of the study areas for the swat modeling consisted of a dem land use types soil types and properties meteorological data agricultural management practices and observed data at the watershed outlet detailed descriptions of the data for the two watersheds are listed in table 1 3 2 modeling and calibration of the swat model two swat models were built by qswat version 1 2 2 and swat version 59 3 to simulate the total nitrogen pollution in each study area a total of 15 subbasins 41 lsus and 1260 hrus were generated in the zhongtianshe watershed while 19 subbasins 131 lsus and 7245 hrus were generated in the willow river watershed fig 5 the rpi thresholds for delineating uplands and floodplains were manually determined by visual interpretation of contour lines which are 0 14 and 0 3 for the zhongtianshe watershed and the willow river watershed respectively in most situations each subbasin has one upland and one floodplain there may be an additional floodplain due to the very short channel generated after the setting of a pond or reservoir limited by the available observed data for the zhongtianshe watershed the year 2011 was set as a warm up period and 2012 2013 and 2014 2015 were set as calibration and validation periods respectively for daily flow modeling the model performance for the total nitrogen was calibrated using the 5 day or 3 day monitoring data from 2014 to 2015 a total of 181 values of which 53 values during the rainy season were sampled in about three days interval from june to august in the two years without validation for the willow river watershed the model had a 2 year warm up period the calibration period ranged from 1 january 2012 to 31 july 2014 and the validation period was from 1 october 2010 to 31 december 2011 respectively the available daily ammonia and organic nitrogen were combined to calibrate and validate the nitrogen modeling model performance was evaluated using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 percentage bias pbias root mean square error standard deviation ratio rsr and coefficient of determination r2 as listed in table 2 according to the criteria of monthly model performance proposed by moriasi et al 2007 a satisfactory model should generally have the nse 0 50 rsr 0 70 and pbias 25 for flow 55 for sediment and 70 for nutrients meanwhile the daily model is more likely to have poorer model performance than the monthly model engel et al 2007 therefore considering this study mainly utilizes the relative rather than absolute model result comparisons to verify the effectiveness of the proposed pma identification method both calibrated models can be regarded as acceptable for use in the current study besides considering that the swat model is still in active development an open source repository was created to store the modeling data and update the modeling details and results routinely in future studies https github com lreis2415 watershedmodelingdata 3 3 identification and evaluation of pmas at lsu level and subbasin level to evaluate the effectiveness of the pmas at the lsu level pmas also were identified at the subbasin level in the same study area based on the same calibrated swat model and the corresponding markov chain based surrogate model the average annual total nitrogen modeled during the calibration period was used for the input data of the markov chain to identify the pmas with the watershed outlet set as the assessment outlet the natural breaks method was utilized to classify the nitrogen load contribution of the spatial units into three classes and high contribution areas were identified as pmas the comparison of the pmas identified at the lsu and subbasin levels was done from two perspectives the spatial distribution and cumulative load contributions the spatial distribution of pmas is an intuitive way to qualitatively analyze the spatial consistency and differences between different units the cumulative load contributions were used to quantitatively compare the relations between the area of pmas and their total pollutant load contribution 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution of pmas in the zhongtianshe watershed five lsus and two subbasins classified as high contribution areas were identified as pmas fig 6 there was a relatively consistent spatial correlation between the two levels for example one subbasin was identified as pma at both levels that is subbasin s2 in fig 6b and its two lsus l2 and l3 in fig 6a pmas identified at the lsu level have a more accurate spatial distribution because of the inherent characteristics of the lsus that can represent the spatial heterogeneity within subbasins considering the retention effect of ponds and reservoirs in swat the upstream part of the subbasin may have a distinctive load contribution compared to the downstream part for example in subbasin s1 in fig 6b the upstream part composed of floodplain l10 and upland l12 in fig 6a were identified as medium contribution areas while the downstream floodplain l1 was the high contribution area in addition most lsu based pmas were floodplains in the zhongtianshe watershed this may be because the cropland in the study area is mostly distributed along the valley plain which is a direct cause of local non point source pollution these results also indicate that swat is well suited for characterizing pollutants released at the lsu level and their transitions in the reconstructed routing network by lsus and channels including ponds in the willow river watershed two lsus and two subbasins classified as high contribution areas were identified as pmas fig 7 it was similar that at both the lsu and subbasin levels the northeast areas of the watershed were identified as low contribution areas owing to the upstream pollution predominantly reduced by the ponds and wetlands along the main channel although the results identified at the two levels had similar spatial distributions the subbasin based pmas covered larger areas than the lsu based pmas which may result in additional screening work or more investment in watershed management decision making in contrast the lsu based pmas were the upland areas within the subbasins that is uplands l1 and l2 fig 7a within two subbasins fig 7b the medium contribution areas identified at the lsu level were also more specific and detailed than the areas identified at the subbasin level therefore it is clear that lsu based results can provide a finer identification than subbasin based results in the willow river watershed in addition for the willow river watershed lsus belonging to subbasin l2 in fig 7b were not identified as pmas but as contribution areas classified as medium contribution areas this shows that the application of detailed spatial units could decompose the aggregation of the pollutant load within a subbasin in a relatively realistic representation although subbasin s2 contributed a high pollutant load as the result of being the largest subbasin in the watershed overall lsu based pmas have improved the accuracy of identification from the perspective of spatial distribution compared with subbasin based pmas it is also shown that the proposed pma identification method at landscape position units using swat is effective and applicable to different watersheds 4 2 cumulative load contribution to quantitatively evaluate the difference in pmas identified at the lsu and subbasin levels for each case study each type of spatial unit was ranked by load contribution in descending order and plotted in figs 8 and 9 with the cumulative area and load contribution calculated in the zhongtianshe watershed lsu based pmas contributed 48 6 of the total nitrogen in 23 3 of the watershed area whereas subbasin based pmas only contributed 44 7 in as much as 30 1 of the area fig 8a this means that landscape position units are more effective in identifying the pmas moreover the cumulative area contribution line of the lsu based method in fig 8a was always higher than that of the subbasin based method proving its better effectiveness although based on different types of identification units in the willow river watershed lsu based pmas contributed 31 7 of the total nitrogen in 5 9 of the watershed area whereas subbasin based pmas contributed 54 9 of the total nitrogen in 21 5 of the area fig 9a it is not convincing to simply use these numbers to compare the effectiveness of the two levels in this watershed however the line in fig 9a shows that the lsu based pmas almost always covered less area than the subbasin based pmas under the same cumulative contribution in general the results reveal that there would be less work on the reduction of pollution at the lsu level if the local government wanted to control the pollution to a certain extent furthermore there was no deterministic relation between the area of the spatial unit and its pollutant load contribution for example lsu l1 in the zhongtianshe watershed contributed 12 0 of the total nitrogen but ranked 17 in area while subbasin s1 contributed 24 3 of the total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area fig 8 in the willow river watershed lsu l1 contributed 16 8 of the total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area and subbasin s1 contributed 31 7 of total nitrogen with the 2nd largest area of all subbasins fig 9 although absolute differences exist in the results of the two watersheds due to different geographic characteristics the comparison between them is less important for the scope of this study which is to evaluate the effectiveness of the pmas at the lsu level instead the similar appearance depicted by the relations between the area of pmas and their total load contribution at the two levels in different watersheds can also show the universality and effectiveness of lsus in summary identifying pmas based on landscape positions performs better than subbasins from the perspectives of both the spatial distribution and cumulative load contribution in both test watersheds thus lsu based pmas have the merit of accounting for more pollutant load contributions with smaller areas and can effectively be utilized in the spatial configuration of bmps for integrated watershed management 5 conclusions this study proposes the use of landscape position units lsus derived from a universal type of spatial unit for most geographic environments as identification units for priority management areas pmas a markov chain based surrogate model of the swat model was implemented with the improvement of the transition matrix in representing both landscape position and channel units to distinguish the pollutant load contribution of each lsu to the assessment outlet and then identify the pmas according to a classification method the experimental results show that landscape position units are more effective than widely used subbasins in identifying pmas because of their superior ability to represent hillslope processes and the spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface environments within subbasins therefore lsu based pmas are much more valuable for providing accurate locations for implementing suitable bmps for integrated watershed management the improved markov chain based pma identification method can be regarded as a method framework more types of spatial units with explicit upstream downstream relations may be proposed and validated to identify pmas with the support of proper watershed models in addition several issues may be worth attention in future research such as 1 how to consider various climate scenarios to determine the retention effects of channel routing processes 2 how to better quantify the hydrological connectivity among landscape positions and channels and its effects on pma identification 3 how a specific type of identification unit affects pma identification under different delineation methods 4 how the modeling accuracy of the same or different watershed models affects pma identification and 5 how pmas derived from different identification

2118,the loss of soil through underground leakage is a unique erosion process in the rocky karst desertification areas with abundant bedrock outcrops although some effort has been made to understand soil leakage loss until now the processes and ways that soil leakage loss occur have continued to puzzle us in this area to solve this problem three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected on a sloped farmland in a rocky karst desertification area located in guizhou china stable rare earth element tracing techniques combined with a streaking and marking method were used to observe the soil leaking process under three intervals of natural rainfall accumulated rainfall was 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm for each interval we found that rainstorms or heavy rainstorms are the key factors that cause the loss of soil around outcrop bedrock outcrops where the main form of soil leakage is the downwards creeping of the soil layer the soil creep displacement associated with the rainfall total of 104 5 mm which consisted of one rainstorm two moderate rain events and several light rain events could account for more than 62 5 of the total creep associated with the rainfall total of 332 7 mm however the rainfall total of 181 5 mm which consisted of a heavy rain episode four moderate rain events and several light rain events accounted for less than 15 0 during different rainfall events the concentrations of ce la and sm in patches of soil around bedrock outcrops are negative compared with the background values in soil layers with treated with rare earth elements rees while the concentrations of ce la and sm used for comparison have a certain presence in other soil layers additionally the concentrations of ce la and sm at the rock soil interface are not always higher or lower than those of the corresponding soil layer it is proven that the soils in both the rock soil interface and soil layer can leak downwards with a certain degree of probability during the leaking processes these soils do not move down uniformly or as a whole but some particles in certain layers migrate to the lower layer separately therefore improving soil anti erodibility can prevent the creep leakage of soil patches to a certain extent and further preserve a sufficient material basis for plant restoration in rocky desertification areas keywords underground leakage soil around bedrock outcrops rock soil interface rare earth element tracing karst rocky desertification area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction karst areas are the primary ecologically fragile zones in the world and have great importance to the academic community as one of the countries with the largest distribution of karst areas in the world china is famous for its well developed range of beautiful landscape and the fragility of its ecological environment sweeting 1992 wang et al 2010 karst landforms in china cover 1 24 million km2 and the majority of those landforms 0 13 million km2 fall within guizhou province karst landforms usually form a dual three dimensional spatial structure in tropical and subtropical areas kovačič and ravbar 2013 that is they consist of a multi interface network of channels that connect the surface with underground hydrological paths kovačič and ravbar 2013 such a dual hydrogeological structure indicates poor water and soil conservation capacity and leads to intense water and soil loss cao et al 2021 rocky desertification caused by soil erosion is one of the most severe eco environmental problems and is called the cancer of our earth chu et al 2020 rocky desertification is the process and result of soil loss and rock exposure under the joint action of human factors and geological conditions wang et al 2010 xu and zhang 2014 as a result agricultural production can only be carried out in a narrow area in which soil is only distributed around outcrop bedrock therefore the ability to control the development of rocky desertification is key to fully understand the occurrence and migration mechanism of soil erosion in karst areas the process of soil erosion or leakage loss is very complex in karst rocky desertification areas soil could not only be eroded along the slope by surface runoff but also leaked underground through karst fissures conduits and funnels via seepage flow feng et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 finally the soils in many areas are patchy and only exist among many rocky outcrops especially in rocky areas with extreme desertification underground leakage refers to the soil parent material and other ground materials such as rock debris and loose deposits that enter the underground karst space by creeping and dislocation for example due to gravity and via fissures that have been filled by the overlying soils zhang and wang 2016 previous studies have found that the main sources of soil leakage are fissures sinkholes shafts and funnels feng et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the unique soil loss type in karst areas has attracted substantial attention in recent years and that attention has included the surface loss and underground leakage loss processes cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2014 for surface erosion the process mechanism and influencing factors are relatively systematic and can be studied through a series of methods such as field observations indoor simulations and isotope tracing yang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 dai et al 2017 however little research progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of underground leakage in karst areas due to the lack of practical research methods and techniques previous findings from field observations showed that little soil loss was observed on the surface and large soil loss was mainly caused by heavy rainfall storms peng and wang 2012 chen et al 2012 through indoor simulation tests we have revealed the influence that rain intensity the degree of underground fissuring and rock exposure rate has on soil leakage dai et al 2017 peng et al 2019 2022 but the problem of how soil is transported down has always puzzled us patchy soils around bedrock outcrops are the only soil left on the surface of areas that have undergone severe rocky desertification and this soil is of importance for water conservation nutrient supply and vegetation growth in karst areas hence it becomes more urgent and important to understand the underground leakage processes in these areas especially in areas with patches of soil around bedrock outcrops whether the patchy soil is transported down in whole or in part or in other ways is in urgent need of understanding rare earth element ree tracing technology a method used for quantitative estimates of the distribution of soil erosion from specific areas provides a way to solve this problem liu et al 2004 kimoto et al 2006 tracer techniques applying stable rees could be used to study the distribution and process of soil erosion the basic principle is that the selected oxide elements used for tracing are evenly mixed with soil and distributed at different topographic positions in the study area causing them to move with runoff and sediment during the whole process of rainfall erosion then eroded sediment samples are collected to determine the content of trace elements in samples via the neutron activation analysis method the source of erosion sediment and the different characteristics of soil erosion in different types of terrain could be identified to distinguish the source of erosion sediment and obtain the amount of soil loss in different terrain the above method is mainly applicable to slopes that have runoff plots in non karst areas for karst areas with unique erosion types it is difficult to collect leaked water and soil directly as a result the process of soil leakage can only be reflected by the distribution of the tracer in the soil patch layers and the interface of soil and rock therefore three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected on a slope farmland in a rocky area located in the qingyan town huaxi district guiyang city china stable ree tracing techniques surveying methods and natural rainfall observations were used to observe the soil creep displacement and leaking processes under three natural rainfall events with different amounts of accumulated rainfall this study aims to i measure the change in creep displacement during the soil leakage process ii discuss the concentration change of ree in the patch soil layers and the rock soil interface and iii reveal the influence of the rock soil interface on soil leakage in areas of patchy soil around bedrock outcrops the results could provide a new understanding of the underground loss of soil and water via leakage and provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive management of rocky desertification in karst areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and selection the sampling area is located in qingyan town huaxi district guiyang city guizhou province china qingyan town known as one of the four ancient towns in guizhou province is a typical rocky desertification area in guiyang this area is located at 106 37 106 44 e and 26 17 26 23 n is approximately 10 km long from north to south and is 8 km wide from east to west with a total area of 92 3 km2 it is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate and does not have severe cold in winter or severe heat in summer this area has an annual average temperature of 15 c an annual average relative humidity of 81 and an annual average rainfall of 1100 1200 mm the main soil types are yellow soil calcareous soil and paddy soil the sampling area is located in the south of the tongmuling watershed of the yangtze river and pearl river basin which belongs to the pearl river system three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected in the sampling area along the same sloped farmland with a double hydrogeological structure the lithology of the outcrops and bedrock is calcareous dolomite created in the cretaceous period the sampling area is located in the middle of the slope and at an altitude of 1069 m the sample areas have the same soil type calcareous soil farming methods conventional tillage and farming systems maize monoculture but the size of the soil patches differs the soil texture is 19 clay less than 0 002 mm 58 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 23 sand 0 05 2 00 mm three rain gauges were placed around the three soil patches to obtain the natural rainfall data 2 2 tracer element selection and concentration estimation at present rees have proven to be an ideal tracer for studying soil erosion processes ding et al 2003 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 ree tracers when used to study soil erosion should contain the basic characteristics of being appropriate for soil insoluble in water not easily absorbed by plants and harmless to the soil environment to ensure the utility of their tracer effect on sediment during the process of soil erosion additionally rare earth tracer elements should be distinct from otherwise low background values in the sediment have low release amounts be easily identifiable be easily detectable etc furthermore they should consider the accuracy of the analysis method the cost of the experiment and the prospects of acceptance and application according to our previous work peng et al 2021 cerium ce lanthanum la and samarium sm were selected as trace elements to explore the processes and ways that patches of soil creep around outcrop bedrock in karst slope farmland with double hydrogeological structures the release concentration and release amount of rees can be calculated according to the following formula 1 c i b c i a 2 m i c i s i 1000 b c where i is the i th rare earth tracer element i 1 2 3 n ci is the concentration of the i th rare earth tracer element mg kg bci is the background value of the i th rare earth tracer element mg kg mi is the release amount of the i th rare earth tracer oxide g si is the soil weight needed for the i th rare earth tracer element kg a is the concentration expansion coefficient 20 100 b is the concentration correction coefficient i e purity of rare earth tracer oxide generally 0 9999 c is the oxide correction coefficient that is the ratio of the relative molecular weight of rees to the relative molecular weight of oxides si can be calculated by eq 3 3 s i wl h i r 1000 where wl is the sample area of the observation area cm2 hi is the original depth of the i th rare earth tracer element cm r is the soil bulk density at the original depth g cm3 and 1000 is the unit conversion coefficient the concentration and application of rare earth tracer oxides are shown in table 1 2 3 preparation and deployment of tracer soil samples a strip and sectioning method is used to cast i e deploy the mixture of soil and rare earth oxides fig 1 the casting sites are often located at the position places at the average width of the selected soil patches that can represent the water and soil loss in the area a strip with a length of 0 5 m is arranged according to the width of the soil patch peng et al 2021 ce is distributed in the 0 4 cm soil layer la in the 4 6 cm soil layer and sm in the 6 8 cm soil layer the preparation procedures for soil samples with high concentrations of tracer elements can be applied as follows i a small amount of dried test soil which has a particle size less than 0 075 mm was mixed with the required weight of rare earth tracer oxides and the soil samples were diluted with high concentrations of rare earth tracer oxides ii the soil was mixed and added with slightly larger particles to form secondary soil samples with high concentrations of rare earth tracer oxides iii soil that can be fully filled with tracer material was added and mixed at the original depth and was added into the section strip pit the surface of the pit was then tamped down to the same bulk density as the original soil and the position of the topsoil was marked with red paint at the rock soil interface the ree tracing experiment was conducted on june 15 2017 the location and appearance of each selected patch of soil are shown in fig 1 an artificial light rain less than5 mm event was simulated through sprinkling to ensure that the soil was mixed with the rare earth tracer oxide and to ensure that the soil settled and stabilized before being left until july 2 when observations began as a result the soil is close to the original soil based on our pre experiments the surface of each patchy soil sample selected tends to be horizontal or slightly concave that is there is no or little soil surface erosion or loss 2 4 background value of tracer element concentration and its calibration the background ree values and the concentrations of soil samples with high concentrations of rees are shown in table 2 the background ree values in the selected soil patches were relatively low the concentrations of ce la and sm ranged from 24 66 to 42 05 mg kg 8 90 42 35 mg kg and 0 19 1 03 mg kg respectively in the 0 10 cm soil layer for all the soil patches selected the ree concentration measured in the soil samples to which high concentrations of rees had been added was uniform and stable which was consistent with the expected ree concentration after adding rees proportionally taking patch soil 1 as an example the background values of ce la and sm were 24 66 mg kg 8 90 mg kg and 0 33 mg kg respectively the expected or original concentration of ce was 493 2 mg kg after adding rees proportionally the ce concentration measured was 500 00 mg kg which was close to the original value 493 2 mm kg in the high concentration soil samples with added ce oxides additionally the concentrations of other rees namely la and sm were 6 25 mg kg and 0 34 mg kg respectively which were close to the background value la was 8 90 mg kg sm was 0 33 mg kg similarly the concentration measured of la was 177 63 mg kg in the high concentration soil samples with added la which was close to the original value 178 0 mg kg the sm concentration measured was 5 54 mg kg in the high concentration soil samples with added sm which was also close to the original value 6 6 mg kg indicating that the method of adding rees to the soils was appropriate 2 5 rainfall events and collection of soil samples the soil samples collected included samples from the rock soil interface and soil layer which was located at the edge and centre of the soil patches respectively samples from the rock soil interface and soil layer were collected from layers up to 16 cm in depth the thickness of each layer is 2 cm on three occasions july 13 august 19 and october 20 2017 the total accumulated rainfall at each date of soil sample collection was 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm respectively the detailed daily rainfall variability for each observation period is shown in fig 2 during the whole experimental observation period that is from july 1 2017 to october 19 2017 the accumulated rainfall was 332 7 mm which included one rainstorm 67 6 mm one heavy rain episode 32 3 mm seven moderate rain events and thirty four light rain events during the first observation period there was one rainstorm two moderate rain events and many light rain events for a total of 104 5 mm the rain fall total by the second observation period was 151 2 mm which included only one moderate rain event and many light rain events that occurred during the second observation period as well as the rain totals during the first observation one episode of heavy rain four moderate rain events and many light rain events occurred during the third observation for a combined total of 332 7 mm that also includes rains during the first and second observations 2 6 sample testing the ree concentrations in the soil samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in the key laboratory of karst environment and geological hazards ministry of land and resources chemical and environmental research and testing center guizhou university the following steps were used for the analysis i first the air dried soil was passed through a sieve with a 100 mesh 0 15 mm diameter ii the samples were then weighed and 0 1000 g accurate to 0 0001 g of air dried soil was put into each microwave digestion pot iii next 2 0 ml of highly concentrated h2o2 was added to eliminate organic matter followed by add 5 0 ml of highly concentrated hno3 and then 3 ml of highly concentrated hf was added after 30 min iv the mars 6 which was produced by the cem company of america was used for digestion and the classic method was loaded by selecting the method sample form and control mode then the reaction method was set maximum power climbing time target temperature holding time as well as the naming method and the preservation method the power was set at 600 1000 w the warming time was set to 10 15 min the holding time was 15 25 min the temperature was 120 190 c and the full tank temperature monitoring system was 240 c v once digestion was completed the microwave digestion pots were opened and placed in a secondary device to drive off excess acid when the acid was released and was viscous or only 1 ml remained at 150 0 5 ml of highly concentrated hno3 was added with a few drops of water to dissolve the sample next the sample was put into a 50 ml volumetric flask to maintain the volume vi finally the ree content in the samples was determined by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry which was made in america 3 results 3 1 creep displacement of the soil layer for patchy soils fig 3 shows the variable characteristics of creep displacement of the soil layer for patchy soils around bedrock outcrops during the whole observation period during the total observation period during which 332 7 mm of rain fell the soil creep displacement of each patch of soil around the bedrock outcrops was 2 8 cm for patch soil 1 ps1 2 4 cm for patch soil 2 ps2 and 1 6 cm for patch soil 3 ps3 during the first observation period 104 5 mm rainfall the corresponding soil creep displacement of each patch of soil around the bedrock outcrops was 2 5 cm 2 0 cm and 1 0 cm which accounted for 89 3 83 3 and 62 5 of the total creep displacement during the whole observation period the soil creep displacement was 0 cm 0 2 cm and 0 4 cm during the second observation 46 7 mm rainfall it should be noted that these measurements were taken by designating the end of the previous observation period as the new starting point these distances accounted for 0 8 3 and 25 0 of the total creep displacement respectively the displacement was 0 3 cm 0 2 cm and 0 2 cm during the third observation rainfall 181 5 mm which accounted for 10 7 8 3 and 12 5 respectively the soil creep displacement associated with the 104 5 mm rainfall event was 1 0 2 5 cm which accounted for more than 62 5 of the soil creep displacement during the whole observation period during which a total of 332 7 mm of rain fell however the soil creep displacement associated the 181 5 mm rainfall total was only 0 2 0 3 cm which accounted for less than 15 0 of the soil creep displacement associated with the total 332 7 mm rainfall total 3 2 variability of the ree concentration in patchy soils fig 4 shows the variable characteristics of the ree concentration in different soil layers for different patchy soils after subtracting background values for different observation periods the ree concentrations in the soils at the deployment layers for different patches of soils were significantly different from the background values which were all negative with the increase in accumulated rainfall from 104 5 to 332 7 mm the difference between the concentration of rees affected by rains and the background value in the soils at the deployment layers increased or first decreased and then increased which indicated that the soil particles carrying rees in the deployment layers had a downwards leakage trend the ree concentration tested in the soil layer 8 16 cm below the deployment layers was generally higher than the background values which demonstrates that most of the soil particles carrying rees in the deployment layers and above leak downwards and accumulate in the soil layer below the deployment layer however a few of them were lower than the background values especially for the concentrations of la in ps1 at 332 7 mm of rain and ce in ps2 for 151 2 mm of rain the concentrations of rees identified in the soil deployment layer and below were lower than the background value this showed that there was little accumulation of rees in the soil layer below the deployment layer that is rees may leak into the soil layer below the soil depth of 16 cm with soil particles the accumulation and leakage of different rees were different in each soil layer within the same soil patch during the observations for example the ce concentration in ps2 had a tendency of constant leakage in the soil layers at 0 4 cm a tendency of leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 4 8 cm and accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 8 16 cm the la concentration in ps2 showed a trend of leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 0 2 cm 6 10 cm and 14 16 cm accumulation leakage in the soil layers at 2 4 cm leakage accumulation leakage in the soil layer at 4 6 cm and accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 10 14 cm the sm concentration of ps2 indicated the trend of accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 0 2 cm and 12 16 cm but constant leakage in the soil layers of 4 12 cm similarly the variable trends of the three rees in ps1 and ps3 are also different regardless of the kind of tracer elements and rainfall event both the soil layer of the patchy soils where soil particle leakage occurred and the soil layer where particles moving down accumulated were random they were not fixed in a soil layer 3 3 influence of the rock soil interface on the leakage of patchy soils fig 5 shows the variable characteristics of the ree concentration of the soil at the rock soil interface for different patchy soils around bedrock outcrops under different rainfall events the ree concentration of the soil at the rock soil interface was not always higher or lower than the corresponding soil layer for the same patchy soils under different rainfall events that is soil leakage occurring at the rock soil interface was not always the primary mechanism in the patch of soil around the bedrock outcrop the difference in the ree concentration between the rock soil interface and the homologous soil layer was positive that is soil leakage was obvious in the soil layer of the patchy soils taking the observation period of 104 5 mm rainfall as an example fig 5a the concentrations of all rees in the soil at the rock soil interface i e the 0 2 cm layer were lower than those in the corresponding soil layer the soil leakage was obvious at the surface layer 0 2 cm of the rock soil interface for the patchy soils however for the observation following 151 2 mm of rain the concentration of la in the rock soil interface at the 0 2 cm layer was higher than that in the soil layer for each patch of soil for different rainfall totals there was no obvious regularity in the concentration of rees in the soils between the rock soil interface and the corresponding soil layer for the observation periods that coincided with the total 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm of rain the concentration of sm in the layers below the deployment layer of the selected patchy soils were lower than in the layers at the rock soil interface however the other rees had no such changes the concentrations of the three rees at the rock soil interface were generally less than those in the soil layer for ps1 under different observation periods but not all three elements for all patchy soils displayed such changes for example for the observation period that coincided with the total 332 7 mm of rain the concentrations of ce la and sm in the 8 10 cm layer at the rock soil interface were obviously higher than those in the soil layers of ps2 4 discussions 4 1 influence of extreme rainfall on soil erosion or leakage relevant studies have shown that rainfall intensity especially extreme rainfall events exerts an important influence on soil erosion panagos et al 2015 grimm et al 2003 soil erosion in a basin is mainly caused by a few heavy rain or rainstorm events and the amount of erosion caused by a rainstorm can account for 60 or even more than 90 of the total annual erosion wang et al 2016 the results of indoor simulated rainfall experiments showed that the runoff yield on farmlands set on karst slopes was mainly dominated by underground runoff for light rainfall intensities 50 mm h and moderate rainfall intensities 70 mm h but the surface runoff was higher than the underground runoff for heavy rainfall intensities 90 mm h the processes of soil loss on a karst slope farmland vary between changes in the surface and underground sediment yield for light rain events to mainly changes in surface sediment yield during heavier rains peng et al 2019 peng and dai 2022 in our study the soil creep displacement of different patchy soils around bedrock outcrops ranged between 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm following 104 5 mm of rainfall which involved one rainstorm two moderate rain events and several light rain events but it could account for more than 62 5 of the total soil creep displacement for the rainfall total of 332 7 mm furthermore the creep of 0 2 0 3 cm associated with the total rainfall of 181 5 mm containing a heavy rainstorm four moderate rain events and several light rain events accounted for less than 15 0 the reason why the soil creep loss distance was low under one heavy rainfall event for the 181 5 mm rain total was that the majority of the rainfall was mainly due to light rain events although there was one heavy rain event and four moderate rain events those accounted for less than 18 of the total loss amount moreover most light rain events had not reached the level of erosive rainfall and mainly played the role of moistening the surface the 104 5 mm rainfall total consisted of only one storm and two moderate rain events but the proportion of the total loss amount was 65 thus the influence of rainstorm soil creep loss was obvious liang et al 2020 found that the average soil loss of erosive rainstorm events was 2 to 16 times that of ordinary erosive rainfall events the average annual erosive rainfall frequency accounted for only 21 2 of the average annual total rainfall frequency but the average annual erosive rainfall amount accounted for 70 4 of the average annual total rainfall amount the yearly soil erosion was caused by rains that occurred infrequently but had greater rainfall intensity shi et al 2021 this indicated that the rainfall amount was not the key factor in determining the soil creep displacement in the patchy soils around bedrock outcrops but was instead the rainfall intensity this was consistent with the results of indoor simulated rainfall experiments that is rainfall intensity was the dominant factor of soil leakage dai et al 2017 peng et al 2019 therefore extreme rainfall such as rainstorms or heavy rainstorms was the key factor in soil leakage loss in the karst rocky desertification area and the main form of soil leakage was soil creeping as a special method of soil leakage in karst areas soil creep leakage should be given more attention in future scientific research because areas with obvious leakage may further induce karst collapse fig 6 4 2 ways of soil leakage a field study on the karst red soil layer and rock soil interface found that there were many dense scratches at the red soil layer and rock soil interface and the directions of the scratches inside the red soil layer were random but were parallel at the rock soil interface zhang and wang 2016 the main mechanism of soil underground leakage is creep ping et al 2011 wang et al 2014 feng et al 2014 concluded that the soil is mainly lost as a whole along fissures underground conduits etc however that study did not use such tracer technologies to reveal the specific mechanisms of creep and leakage in our study the ree tracer technique was used to study the soil leakage process on the soil layers and the rock soil interfaces of the three patchy soils around bedrock outcrops over three observation periods for rainfall totals of 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm it is assumed that if the creep of the patchy soils around the bedrock outcrops occurs as a whole during the process of creeping leakage the ree contents within the different soil layers should be the same as those in the deployment casting layers in contrast if the soil moves down unevenly rather than as a whole during the process of creeping leakage i e some particles in the soil layer keep moving down the ree contents in the different soil layers will be significantly different from the content of the deployment layers the results showed that soil particles in the soil layer or at the rock soil interface move to the lower layer in a random soil layer instead of moving uniformly as a whole during the process of creeping leakage of patchy soils around bedrock outcrops the layers of the two soil layer and rock soil interface in which creeping leakage occurred were not fixed but accidental and the layers accumulated the leaked soil particles moving downwards were also random this was because the particle composition size and capillary pores etc in different soil layers of the patchy soils were not completely consistent we also found that the concentrations of ce la and sm in the soil layers where the rees were deployed were all negative compared to the background values andshowedalargedifference that is the concentrations were obvious in the soil layers where rees were deployed since they were lower than the background values in these layers this indicated that the soil particles carrying rees in the soil layers may have moved down while the positive and negative values in other soil layers showed a certain contingency the ree concentration in the deployment layer was obviously different from the background value because the soil leakage was random and the ree concentration in the deployment layer was high the proportion of soil particles that adsorbed rees was large the probability of the loss of rees was increased and the proportion of the soil particles among the lost soil particles was increased therefore the difference between the ree concentration and the background value was clear based on this consideration quantifying the soil leakage by the proportion of ree leakage gives an incomplete depiction of the process thus indoor simulation experiments that are conducive to accepting the leakage should be designed for future research some results showed that the intermediate flow along the karst slope mainly occurred at the soil rock interface in the form of preferential flow nobles et al 2010 leh et al 2008 wilcox et al 2007 the rock soil interface is conducive to soil leakage in our study with the change in rainfall the ree concentration at the rock soil interface was not always higher or lower than that of the corresponding soil layer in other words during the creeping and leakage process of patchy soils around outcrops the soil particles at the rock soil interface and in the soil layer may leak downwards showing a certain degree of contingency the conditions of rocks on both sides of the selected patchy soils were not completely the same and were different in surface shape roughness and inclination many scholars have found that rees can be enriched within weathering crust nesbitt 1979 lan 1980 in particular it has been found that there is an obvious and abrupt alkaline barrier near the rock soil interface of carbonate rocks which can enrich rees sun et al 2002 it is assumed that if the rock soil interfaces at the edge of patchy soils do not cause the soil particles to move down and leak the change in the ree concentration in the soil at the rock soil interface should be the same as that of the soil layer in this patch of soil in contrast if there is any difference between the two it is proven that the rock soil interface is also one of the locations where soil creeping and leaking occurs under the same conditions the comparison of ree concentration changes at the rock soil interface with that in the same layer of soil in the same patchy soils can better explain the characteristics of soil leakage at the rock soil interface however in our study the ree concentration at the rock soil interface was not always higher than that at the soil profile of the three patchy soils around the outcrops in other words the mode of soil leakage at the rock soil interface was similar to that of the soil layer and soil leakage was random this was closely related to the fact that the lands sampled in this study were sloping farmlands influenced by human disturbance factors and the experimental soil was artificially released moreover the situation of fractured rocks in the three samples was not exactly the same and their surface shape roughness and inclination were different combined with the influence of extreme rainfall on soil erosion or leakage it can be concluded that the soil leakage that occurred at the rock soil interface of patchy soils was not only related to the shape of the rock soil interface i e the undulation inclination and roughness of the rock interface but also related to the rainfall rainfall intensity and continuous rainfall the process of underground leakage in the karst area was irreversible and the degree of soil leakage in those patchy soils around outcrops was often related to the development degree of near surface fissures this study revealed the mechanism of soil leakage in karst cracks but failed to quantify the amount of soil leakage via rees there are relatively few studies on the unique mechanisms of soil leakage in karst fissures and at the rock soil interface and there are especially few studies on the amount of soil leakage in fissures and at the rock soil interface 5 conclusions the creep and leakage of soil patches around outcrops is a process in which the particles of these soils migrate downwards through the rock soil interface and into the interior of the deeper soil layer due to the action of rainfall and gravity and creep scratches appear at the joint between the outcrop surface and the soil rainfall intensity directly determined the soil creep displacement of soil patches around outcrops under certain conditions the greater the rainfall was the greater the soil creep displacement that occurred in the patchy soils around the outcrops among the rainfall factors rainstorms or heavy rainstorms were the decisive factors for soil creep leakage loss during the creeping and leaking processes the particles within the patchy soils around the outcrops did not move down uniformly or as a whole but some soil particles in a certain soil layer moved to the lower layer the soil layer where leakage occurred was not constant and the soil layer where downward moving particles accumulated was random the leakage form at the rock soil interface was similar to that in the soil layer the soil leakage that occurred at the rock soil interface of the patchy soils around the outcrops was related not only to the shape of the rock soil interface but also to the rainfall total rainfall intensity and rainfall duration the process of underground leakage in the karst area was irreversible and may induce karst collapse credit authorship contribution statement xudong peng

2118,the loss of soil through underground leakage is a unique erosion process in the rocky karst desertification areas with abundant bedrock outcrops although some effort has been made to understand soil leakage loss until now the processes and ways that soil leakage loss occur have continued to puzzle us in this area to solve this problem three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected on a sloped farmland in a rocky karst desertification area located in guizhou china stable rare earth element tracing techniques combined with a streaking and marking method were used to observe the soil leaking process under three intervals of natural rainfall accumulated rainfall was 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm for each interval we found that rainstorms or heavy rainstorms are the key factors that cause the loss of soil around outcrop bedrock outcrops where the main form of soil leakage is the downwards creeping of the soil layer the soil creep displacement associated with the rainfall total of 104 5 mm which consisted of one rainstorm two moderate rain events and several light rain events could account for more than 62 5 of the total creep associated with the rainfall total of 332 7 mm however the rainfall total of 181 5 mm which consisted of a heavy rain episode four moderate rain events and several light rain events accounted for less than 15 0 during different rainfall events the concentrations of ce la and sm in patches of soil around bedrock outcrops are negative compared with the background values in soil layers with treated with rare earth elements rees while the concentrations of ce la and sm used for comparison have a certain presence in other soil layers additionally the concentrations of ce la and sm at the rock soil interface are not always higher or lower than those of the corresponding soil layer it is proven that the soils in both the rock soil interface and soil layer can leak downwards with a certain degree of probability during the leaking processes these soils do not move down uniformly or as a whole but some particles in certain layers migrate to the lower layer separately therefore improving soil anti erodibility can prevent the creep leakage of soil patches to a certain extent and further preserve a sufficient material basis for plant restoration in rocky desertification areas keywords underground leakage soil around bedrock outcrops rock soil interface rare earth element tracing karst rocky desertification area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction karst areas are the primary ecologically fragile zones in the world and have great importance to the academic community as one of the countries with the largest distribution of karst areas in the world china is famous for its well developed range of beautiful landscape and the fragility of its ecological environment sweeting 1992 wang et al 2010 karst landforms in china cover 1 24 million km2 and the majority of those landforms 0 13 million km2 fall within guizhou province karst landforms usually form a dual three dimensional spatial structure in tropical and subtropical areas kovačič and ravbar 2013 that is they consist of a multi interface network of channels that connect the surface with underground hydrological paths kovačič and ravbar 2013 such a dual hydrogeological structure indicates poor water and soil conservation capacity and leads to intense water and soil loss cao et al 2021 rocky desertification caused by soil erosion is one of the most severe eco environmental problems and is called the cancer of our earth chu et al 2020 rocky desertification is the process and result of soil loss and rock exposure under the joint action of human factors and geological conditions wang et al 2010 xu and zhang 2014 as a result agricultural production can only be carried out in a narrow area in which soil is only distributed around outcrop bedrock therefore the ability to control the development of rocky desertification is key to fully understand the occurrence and migration mechanism of soil erosion in karst areas the process of soil erosion or leakage loss is very complex in karst rocky desertification areas soil could not only be eroded along the slope by surface runoff but also leaked underground through karst fissures conduits and funnels via seepage flow feng et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 finally the soils in many areas are patchy and only exist among many rocky outcrops especially in rocky areas with extreme desertification underground leakage refers to the soil parent material and other ground materials such as rock debris and loose deposits that enter the underground karst space by creeping and dislocation for example due to gravity and via fissures that have been filled by the overlying soils zhang and wang 2016 previous studies have found that the main sources of soil leakage are fissures sinkholes shafts and funnels feng et al 2014 fu et al 2016 wei et al 2016 the unique soil loss type in karst areas has attracted substantial attention in recent years and that attention has included the surface loss and underground leakage loss processes cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2014 for surface erosion the process mechanism and influencing factors are relatively systematic and can be studied through a series of methods such as field observations indoor simulations and isotope tracing yang et al 2011 feng et al 2016 dai et al 2017 however little research progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of underground leakage in karst areas due to the lack of practical research methods and techniques previous findings from field observations showed that little soil loss was observed on the surface and large soil loss was mainly caused by heavy rainfall storms peng and wang 2012 chen et al 2012 through indoor simulation tests we have revealed the influence that rain intensity the degree of underground fissuring and rock exposure rate has on soil leakage dai et al 2017 peng et al 2019 2022 but the problem of how soil is transported down has always puzzled us patchy soils around bedrock outcrops are the only soil left on the surface of areas that have undergone severe rocky desertification and this soil is of importance for water conservation nutrient supply and vegetation growth in karst areas hence it becomes more urgent and important to understand the underground leakage processes in these areas especially in areas with patches of soil around bedrock outcrops whether the patchy soil is transported down in whole or in part or in other ways is in urgent need of understanding rare earth element ree tracing technology a method used for quantitative estimates of the distribution of soil erosion from specific areas provides a way to solve this problem liu et al 2004 kimoto et al 2006 tracer techniques applying stable rees could be used to study the distribution and process of soil erosion the basic principle is that the selected oxide elements used for tracing are evenly mixed with soil and distributed at different topographic positions in the study area causing them to move with runoff and sediment during the whole process of rainfall erosion then eroded sediment samples are collected to determine the content of trace elements in samples via the neutron activation analysis method the source of erosion sediment and the different characteristics of soil erosion in different types of terrain could be identified to distinguish the source of erosion sediment and obtain the amount of soil loss in different terrain the above method is mainly applicable to slopes that have runoff plots in non karst areas for karst areas with unique erosion types it is difficult to collect leaked water and soil directly as a result the process of soil leakage can only be reflected by the distribution of the tracer in the soil patch layers and the interface of soil and rock therefore three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected on a slope farmland in a rocky area located in the qingyan town huaxi district guiyang city china stable ree tracing techniques surveying methods and natural rainfall observations were used to observe the soil creep displacement and leaking processes under three natural rainfall events with different amounts of accumulated rainfall this study aims to i measure the change in creep displacement during the soil leakage process ii discuss the concentration change of ree in the patch soil layers and the rock soil interface and iii reveal the influence of the rock soil interface on soil leakage in areas of patchy soil around bedrock outcrops the results could provide a new understanding of the underground loss of soil and water via leakage and provide a scientific basis for the comprehensive management of rocky desertification in karst areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and selection the sampling area is located in qingyan town huaxi district guiyang city guizhou province china qingyan town known as one of the four ancient towns in guizhou province is a typical rocky desertification area in guiyang this area is located at 106 37 106 44 e and 26 17 26 23 n is approximately 10 km long from north to south and is 8 km wide from east to west with a total area of 92 3 km2 it is characterized by a subtropical humid monsoon climate and does not have severe cold in winter or severe heat in summer this area has an annual average temperature of 15 c an annual average relative humidity of 81 and an annual average rainfall of 1100 1200 mm the main soil types are yellow soil calcareous soil and paddy soil the sampling area is located in the south of the tongmuling watershed of the yangtze river and pearl river basin which belongs to the pearl river system three typical soil patches around bedrock outcrops were selected in the sampling area along the same sloped farmland with a double hydrogeological structure the lithology of the outcrops and bedrock is calcareous dolomite created in the cretaceous period the sampling area is located in the middle of the slope and at an altitude of 1069 m the sample areas have the same soil type calcareous soil farming methods conventional tillage and farming systems maize monoculture but the size of the soil patches differs the soil texture is 19 clay less than 0 002 mm 58 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 23 sand 0 05 2 00 mm three rain gauges were placed around the three soil patches to obtain the natural rainfall data 2 2 tracer element selection and concentration estimation at present rees have proven to be an ideal tracer for studying soil erosion processes ding et al 2003 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 ree tracers when used to study soil erosion should contain the basic characteristics of being appropriate for soil insoluble in water not easily absorbed by plants and harmless to the soil environment to ensure the utility of their tracer effect on sediment during the process of soil erosion additionally rare earth tracer elements should be distinct from otherwise low background values in the sediment have low release amounts be easily identifiable be easily detectable etc furthermore they should consider the accuracy of the analysis method the cost of the experiment and the prospects of acceptance and application according to our previous work peng et al 2021 cerium ce lanthanum la and samarium sm were selected as trace elements to explore the processes and ways that patches of soil creep around outcrop bedrock in karst slope farmland with double hydrogeological structures the release concentration and release amount of rees can be calculated according to the following formula 1 c i b c i a 2 m i c i s i 1000 b c where i is the i th rare earth tracer element i 1 2 3 n ci is the concentration of the i th rare earth tracer element mg kg bci is the background value of the i th rare earth tracer element mg kg mi is the release amount of the i th rare earth tracer oxide g si is the soil weight needed for the i th rare earth tracer element kg a is the concentration expansion coefficient 20 100 b is the concentration correction coefficient i e purity of rare earth tracer oxide generally 0 9999 c is the oxide correction coefficient that is the ratio of the relative molecular weight of rees to the relative molecular weight of oxides si can be calculated by eq 3 3 s i wl h i r 1000 where wl is the sample area of the observation area cm2 hi is the original depth of the i th rare earth tracer element cm r is the soil bulk density at the original depth g cm3 and 1000 is the unit conversion coefficient the concentration and application of rare earth tracer oxides are shown in table 1 2 3 preparation and deployment of tracer soil samples a strip and sectioning method is used to cast i e deploy the mixture of soil and rare earth oxides fig 1 the casting sites are often located at the position places at the average width of the selected soil patches that can represent the water and soil loss in the area a strip with a length of 0 5 m is arranged according to the width of the soil patch peng et al 2021 ce is distributed in the 0 4 cm soil layer la in the 4 6 cm soil layer and sm in the 6 8 cm soil layer the preparation procedures for soil samples with high concentrations of tracer elements can be applied as follows i a small amount of dried test soil which has a particle size less than 0 075 mm was mixed with the required weight of rare earth tracer oxides and the soil samples were diluted with high concentrations of rare earth tracer oxides ii the soil was mixed and added with slightly larger particles to form secondary soil samples with high concentrations of rare earth tracer oxides iii soil that can be fully filled with tracer material was added and mixed at the original depth and was added into the section strip pit the surface of the pit was then tamped down to the same bulk density as the original soil and the position of the topsoil was marked with red paint at the rock soil interface the ree tracing experiment was conducted on june 15 2017 the location and appearance of each selected patch of soil are shown in fig 1 an artificial light rain less than5 mm event was simulated through sprinkling to ensure that the soil was mixed with the rare earth tracer oxide and to ensure that the soil settled and stabilized before being left until july 2 when observations began as a result the soil is close to the original soil based on our pre experiments the surface of each patchy soil sample selected tends to be horizontal or slightly concave that is there is no or little soil surface erosion or loss 2 4 background value of tracer element concentration and its calibration the background ree values and the concentrations of soil samples with high concentrations of rees are shown in table 2 the background ree values in the selected soil patches were relatively low the concentrations of ce la and sm ranged from 24 66 to 42 05 mg kg 8 90 42 35 mg kg and 0 19 1 03 mg kg respectively in the 0 10 cm soil layer for all the soil patches selected the ree concentration measured in the soil samples to which high concentrations of rees had been added was uniform and stable which was consistent with the expected ree concentration after adding rees proportionally taking patch soil 1 as an example the background values of ce la and sm were 24 66 mg kg 8 90 mg kg and 0 33 mg kg respectively the expected or original concentration of ce was 493 2 mg kg after adding rees proportionally the ce concentration measured was 500 00 mg kg which was close to the original value 493 2 mm kg in the high concentration soil samples with added ce oxides additionally the concentrations of other rees namely la and sm were 6 25 mg kg and 0 34 mg kg respectively which were close to the background value la was 8 90 mg kg sm was 0 33 mg kg similarly the concentration measured of la was 177 63 mg kg in the high concentration soil samples with added la which was close to the original value 178 0 mg kg the sm concentration measured was 5 54 mg kg in the high concentration soil samples with added sm which was also close to the original value 6 6 mg kg indicating that the method of adding rees to the soils was appropriate 2 5 rainfall events and collection of soil samples the soil samples collected included samples from the rock soil interface and soil layer which was located at the edge and centre of the soil patches respectively samples from the rock soil interface and soil layer were collected from layers up to 16 cm in depth the thickness of each layer is 2 cm on three occasions july 13 august 19 and october 20 2017 the total accumulated rainfall at each date of soil sample collection was 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm respectively the detailed daily rainfall variability for each observation period is shown in fig 2 during the whole experimental observation period that is from july 1 2017 to october 19 2017 the accumulated rainfall was 332 7 mm which included one rainstorm 67 6 mm one heavy rain episode 32 3 mm seven moderate rain events and thirty four light rain events during the first observation period there was one rainstorm two moderate rain events and many light rain events for a total of 104 5 mm the rain fall total by the second observation period was 151 2 mm which included only one moderate rain event and many light rain events that occurred during the second observation period as well as the rain totals during the first observation one episode of heavy rain four moderate rain events and many light rain events occurred during the third observation for a combined total of 332 7 mm that also includes rains during the first and second observations 2 6 sample testing the ree concentrations in the soil samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms in the key laboratory of karst environment and geological hazards ministry of land and resources chemical and environmental research and testing center guizhou university the following steps were used for the analysis i first the air dried soil was passed through a sieve with a 100 mesh 0 15 mm diameter ii the samples were then weighed and 0 1000 g accurate to 0 0001 g of air dried soil was put into each microwave digestion pot iii next 2 0 ml of highly concentrated h2o2 was added to eliminate organic matter followed by add 5 0 ml of highly concentrated hno3 and then 3 ml of highly concentrated hf was added after 30 min iv the mars 6 which was produced by the cem company of america was used for digestion and the classic method was loaded by selecting the method sample form and control mode then the reaction method was set maximum power climbing time target temperature holding time as well as the naming method and the preservation method the power was set at 600 1000 w the warming time was set to 10 15 min the holding time was 15 25 min the temperature was 120 190 c and the full tank temperature monitoring system was 240 c v once digestion was completed the microwave digestion pots were opened and placed in a secondary device to drive off excess acid when the acid was released and was viscous or only 1 ml remained at 150 0 5 ml of highly concentrated hno3 was added with a few drops of water to dissolve the sample next the sample was put into a 50 ml volumetric flask to maintain the volume vi finally the ree content in the samples was determined by icp ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry which was made in america 3 results 3 1 creep displacement of the soil layer for patchy soils fig 3 shows the variable characteristics of creep displacement of the soil layer for patchy soils around bedrock outcrops during the whole observation period during the total observation period during which 332 7 mm of rain fell the soil creep displacement of each patch of soil around the bedrock outcrops was 2 8 cm for patch soil 1 ps1 2 4 cm for patch soil 2 ps2 and 1 6 cm for patch soil 3 ps3 during the first observation period 104 5 mm rainfall the corresponding soil creep displacement of each patch of soil around the bedrock outcrops was 2 5 cm 2 0 cm and 1 0 cm which accounted for 89 3 83 3 and 62 5 of the total creep displacement during the whole observation period the soil creep displacement was 0 cm 0 2 cm and 0 4 cm during the second observation 46 7 mm rainfall it should be noted that these measurements were taken by designating the end of the previous observation period as the new starting point these distances accounted for 0 8 3 and 25 0 of the total creep displacement respectively the displacement was 0 3 cm 0 2 cm and 0 2 cm during the third observation rainfall 181 5 mm which accounted for 10 7 8 3 and 12 5 respectively the soil creep displacement associated with the 104 5 mm rainfall event was 1 0 2 5 cm which accounted for more than 62 5 of the soil creep displacement during the whole observation period during which a total of 332 7 mm of rain fell however the soil creep displacement associated the 181 5 mm rainfall total was only 0 2 0 3 cm which accounted for less than 15 0 of the soil creep displacement associated with the total 332 7 mm rainfall total 3 2 variability of the ree concentration in patchy soils fig 4 shows the variable characteristics of the ree concentration in different soil layers for different patchy soils after subtracting background values for different observation periods the ree concentrations in the soils at the deployment layers for different patches of soils were significantly different from the background values which were all negative with the increase in accumulated rainfall from 104 5 to 332 7 mm the difference between the concentration of rees affected by rains and the background value in the soils at the deployment layers increased or first decreased and then increased which indicated that the soil particles carrying rees in the deployment layers had a downwards leakage trend the ree concentration tested in the soil layer 8 16 cm below the deployment layers was generally higher than the background values which demonstrates that most of the soil particles carrying rees in the deployment layers and above leak downwards and accumulate in the soil layer below the deployment layer however a few of them were lower than the background values especially for the concentrations of la in ps1 at 332 7 mm of rain and ce in ps2 for 151 2 mm of rain the concentrations of rees identified in the soil deployment layer and below were lower than the background value this showed that there was little accumulation of rees in the soil layer below the deployment layer that is rees may leak into the soil layer below the soil depth of 16 cm with soil particles the accumulation and leakage of different rees were different in each soil layer within the same soil patch during the observations for example the ce concentration in ps2 had a tendency of constant leakage in the soil layers at 0 4 cm a tendency of leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 4 8 cm and accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 8 16 cm the la concentration in ps2 showed a trend of leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 0 2 cm 6 10 cm and 14 16 cm accumulation leakage in the soil layers at 2 4 cm leakage accumulation leakage in the soil layer at 4 6 cm and accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 10 14 cm the sm concentration of ps2 indicated the trend of accumulation leakage accumulation in the soil layers at 0 2 cm and 12 16 cm but constant leakage in the soil layers of 4 12 cm similarly the variable trends of the three rees in ps1 and ps3 are also different regardless of the kind of tracer elements and rainfall event both the soil layer of the patchy soils where soil particle leakage occurred and the soil layer where particles moving down accumulated were random they were not fixed in a soil layer 3 3 influence of the rock soil interface on the leakage of patchy soils fig 5 shows the variable characteristics of the ree concentration of the soil at the rock soil interface for different patchy soils around bedrock outcrops under different rainfall events the ree concentration of the soil at the rock soil interface was not always higher or lower than the corresponding soil layer for the same patchy soils under different rainfall events that is soil leakage occurring at the rock soil interface was not always the primary mechanism in the patch of soil around the bedrock outcrop the difference in the ree concentration between the rock soil interface and the homologous soil layer was positive that is soil leakage was obvious in the soil layer of the patchy soils taking the observation period of 104 5 mm rainfall as an example fig 5a the concentrations of all rees in the soil at the rock soil interface i e the 0 2 cm layer were lower than those in the corresponding soil layer the soil leakage was obvious at the surface layer 0 2 cm of the rock soil interface for the patchy soils however for the observation following 151 2 mm of rain the concentration of la in the rock soil interface at the 0 2 cm layer was higher than that in the soil layer for each patch of soil for different rainfall totals there was no obvious regularity in the concentration of rees in the soils between the rock soil interface and the corresponding soil layer for the observation periods that coincided with the total 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm of rain the concentration of sm in the layers below the deployment layer of the selected patchy soils were lower than in the layers at the rock soil interface however the other rees had no such changes the concentrations of the three rees at the rock soil interface were generally less than those in the soil layer for ps1 under different observation periods but not all three elements for all patchy soils displayed such changes for example for the observation period that coincided with the total 332 7 mm of rain the concentrations of ce la and sm in the 8 10 cm layer at the rock soil interface were obviously higher than those in the soil layers of ps2 4 discussions 4 1 influence of extreme rainfall on soil erosion or leakage relevant studies have shown that rainfall intensity especially extreme rainfall events exerts an important influence on soil erosion panagos et al 2015 grimm et al 2003 soil erosion in a basin is mainly caused by a few heavy rain or rainstorm events and the amount of erosion caused by a rainstorm can account for 60 or even more than 90 of the total annual erosion wang et al 2016 the results of indoor simulated rainfall experiments showed that the runoff yield on farmlands set on karst slopes was mainly dominated by underground runoff for light rainfall intensities 50 mm h and moderate rainfall intensities 70 mm h but the surface runoff was higher than the underground runoff for heavy rainfall intensities 90 mm h the processes of soil loss on a karst slope farmland vary between changes in the surface and underground sediment yield for light rain events to mainly changes in surface sediment yield during heavier rains peng et al 2019 peng and dai 2022 in our study the soil creep displacement of different patchy soils around bedrock outcrops ranged between 1 0 cm and 2 5 cm following 104 5 mm of rainfall which involved one rainstorm two moderate rain events and several light rain events but it could account for more than 62 5 of the total soil creep displacement for the rainfall total of 332 7 mm furthermore the creep of 0 2 0 3 cm associated with the total rainfall of 181 5 mm containing a heavy rainstorm four moderate rain events and several light rain events accounted for less than 15 0 the reason why the soil creep loss distance was low under one heavy rainfall event for the 181 5 mm rain total was that the majority of the rainfall was mainly due to light rain events although there was one heavy rain event and four moderate rain events those accounted for less than 18 of the total loss amount moreover most light rain events had not reached the level of erosive rainfall and mainly played the role of moistening the surface the 104 5 mm rainfall total consisted of only one storm and two moderate rain events but the proportion of the total loss amount was 65 thus the influence of rainstorm soil creep loss was obvious liang et al 2020 found that the average soil loss of erosive rainstorm events was 2 to 16 times that of ordinary erosive rainfall events the average annual erosive rainfall frequency accounted for only 21 2 of the average annual total rainfall frequency but the average annual erosive rainfall amount accounted for 70 4 of the average annual total rainfall amount the yearly soil erosion was caused by rains that occurred infrequently but had greater rainfall intensity shi et al 2021 this indicated that the rainfall amount was not the key factor in determining the soil creep displacement in the patchy soils around bedrock outcrops but was instead the rainfall intensity this was consistent with the results of indoor simulated rainfall experiments that is rainfall intensity was the dominant factor of soil leakage dai et al 2017 peng et al 2019 therefore extreme rainfall such as rainstorms or heavy rainstorms was the key factor in soil leakage loss in the karst rocky desertification area and the main form of soil leakage was soil creeping as a special method of soil leakage in karst areas soil creep leakage should be given more attention in future scientific research because areas with obvious leakage may further induce karst collapse fig 6 4 2 ways of soil leakage a field study on the karst red soil layer and rock soil interface found that there were many dense scratches at the red soil layer and rock soil interface and the directions of the scratches inside the red soil layer were random but were parallel at the rock soil interface zhang and wang 2016 the main mechanism of soil underground leakage is creep ping et al 2011 wang et al 2014 feng et al 2014 concluded that the soil is mainly lost as a whole along fissures underground conduits etc however that study did not use such tracer technologies to reveal the specific mechanisms of creep and leakage in our study the ree tracer technique was used to study the soil leakage process on the soil layers and the rock soil interfaces of the three patchy soils around bedrock outcrops over three observation periods for rainfall totals of 104 5 mm 151 2 mm and 332 7 mm it is assumed that if the creep of the patchy soils around the bedrock outcrops occurs as a whole during the process of creeping leakage the ree contents within the different soil layers should be the same as those in the deployment casting layers in contrast if the soil moves down unevenly rather than as a whole during the process of creeping leakage i e some particles in the soil layer keep moving down the ree contents in the different soil layers will be significantly different from the content of the deployment layers the results showed that soil particles in the soil layer or at the rock soil interface move to the lower layer in a random soil layer instead of moving uniformly as a whole during the process of creeping leakage of patchy soils around bedrock outcrops the layers of the two soil layer and rock soil interface in which creeping leakage occurred were not fixed but accidental and the layers accumulated the leaked soil particles moving downwards were also random this was because the particle composition size and capillary pores etc in different soil layers of the patchy soils were not completely consistent we also found that the concentrations of ce la and sm in the soil layers where the rees were deployed were all negative compared to the background values andshowedalargedifference that is the concentrations were obvious in the soil layers where rees were deployed since they were lower than the background values in these layers this indicated that the soil particles carrying rees in the soil layers may have moved down while the positive and negative values in other soil layers showed a certain contingency the ree concentration in the deployment layer was obviously different from the background value because the soil leakage was random and the ree concentration in the deployment layer was high the proportion of soil particles that adsorbed rees was large the probability of the loss of rees was increased and the proportion of the soil particles among the lost soil particles was increased therefore the difference between the ree concentration and the background value was clear based on this consideration quantifying the soil leakage by the proportion of ree leakage gives an incomplete depiction of the process thus indoor simulation experiments that are conducive to accepting the leakage should be designed for future research some results showed that the intermediate flow along the karst slope mainly occurred at the soil rock interface in the form of preferential flow nobles et al 2010 leh et al 2008 wilcox et al 2007 the rock soil interface is conducive to soil leakage in our study with the change in rainfall the ree concentration at the rock soil interface was not always higher or lower than that of the corresponding soil layer in other words during the creeping and leakage process of patchy soils around outcrops the soil particles at the rock soil interface and in the soil layer may leak downwards showing a certain degree of contingency the conditions of rocks on both sides of the selected patchy soils were not completely the same and were different in surface shape roughness and inclination many scholars have found that rees can be enriched within weathering crust nesbitt 1979 lan 1980 in particular it has been found that there is an obvious and abrupt alkaline barrier near the rock soil interface of carbonate rocks which can enrich rees sun et al 2002 it is assumed that if the rock soil interfaces at the edge of patchy soils do not cause the soil particles to move down and leak the change in the ree concentration in the soil at the rock soil interface should be the same as that of the soil layer in this patch of soil in contrast if there is any difference between the two it is proven that the rock soil interface is also one of the locations where soil creeping and leaking occurs under the same conditions the comparison of ree concentration changes at the rock soil interface with that in the same layer of soil in the same patchy soils can better explain the characteristics of soil leakage at the rock soil interface however in our study the ree concentration at the rock soil interface was not always higher than that at the soil profile of the three patchy soils around the outcrops in other words the mode of soil leakage at the rock soil interface was similar to that of the soil layer and soil leakage was random this was closely related to the fact that the lands sampled in this study were sloping farmlands influenced by human disturbance factors and the experimental soil was artificially released moreover the situation of fractured rocks in the three samples was not exactly the same and their surface shape roughness and inclination were different combined with the influence of extreme rainfall on soil erosion or leakage it can be concluded that the soil leakage that occurred at the rock soil interface of patchy soils was not only related to the shape of the rock soil interface i e the undulation inclination and roughness of the rock interface but also related to the rainfall rainfall intensity and continuous rainfall the process of underground leakage in the karst area was irreversible and the degree of soil leakage in those patchy soils around outcrops was often related to the development degree of near surface fissures this study revealed the mechanism of soil leakage in karst cracks but failed to quantify the amount of soil leakage via rees there are relatively few studies on the unique mechanisms of soil leakage in karst fissures and at the rock soil interface and there are especially few studies on the amount of soil leakage in fissures and at the rock soil interface 5 conclusions the creep and leakage of soil patches around outcrops is a process in which the particles of these soils migrate downwards through the rock soil interface and into the interior of the deeper soil layer due to the action of rainfall and gravity and creep scratches appear at the joint between the outcrop surface and the soil rainfall intensity directly determined the soil creep displacement of soil patches around outcrops under certain conditions the greater the rainfall was the greater the soil creep displacement that occurred in the patchy soils around the outcrops among the rainfall factors rainstorms or heavy rainstorms were the decisive factors for soil creep leakage loss during the creeping and leaking processes the particles within the patchy soils around the outcrops did not move down uniformly or as a whole but some soil particles in a certain soil layer moved to the lower layer the soil layer where leakage occurred was not constant and the soil layer where downward moving particles accumulated was random the leakage form at the rock soil interface was similar to that in the soil layer the soil leakage that occurred at the rock soil interface of the patchy soils around the outcrops was related not only to the shape of the rock soil interface but also to the rainfall total rainfall intensity and rainfall duration the process of underground leakage in the karst area was irreversible and may induce karst collapse credit authorship contribution statement xudong peng

2119,soil moisture sm which plays a critical role in land atmosphere hydrological cycles acts as the dominant water resource for vegetation growth in china the spatial temporal variation in multi depth sm patterns caused by the combined influence of climatic and human factors remains unclear in this study we systematically investigated the trends of sm as well as the relationship between sm and the multiple factors affecting it our results indicated that variability in sm in china was quite unbalanced during the 1950 2020 period mainly the region covering north china and central northeastern china underwent significant drying and exhibited a remarkable warming trend by contrast the wetting region characterized by decreasing soil temperature in the summer was concentrated in the area encompassing the kunlun and tianshan mountains as the depth increased the drought level in the drying region steadily intensified while the dampness degree in the wetting region gradually shrank such a consistently intensifying sm deficit inevitably threatens crop yield and food security correlation and granger causality analyses indicated that precipitation and evaporation may act as dominant climatic factors that drive the variability of multi depth sm this driving force gradually declining with increasing depth due to buffering by upper soil layers by contrast the correlation between human water withdrawal and sm grew continuously with increasing depth except when irrigation was involved implying that deep layer sm is susceptible to water intake these findings are expected to boost the understanding of patterns of sm in china and provide a reference for future exploration usage and management of sm as well keywords multi depth soil moisture variability pattern climatic

1209296 1 introduction soil moisture sm which acts as a vital linkage in the land atmosphere hydrological cycle provides an indispensable research target in hydrology vereecken et al 2008 climatology dong et al 2020 meteorology calvet et al 1998 ecology robinson et al 2008 and agronomy rigden et al 2020 sm may function as an important indicator of climate change due to its tight association with precipitation koster et al 2003 temperature xu et al 2004 vegetation zwieback et al 2018 and evaporation delworth and manabe 1988 among other factors various human activities e g irrigation domestic electrical generation livestock mining and manufacturing may directly or indirectly affect the spatial temporal distribution and variation of sm in varying degrees he et al 2021 therefore fluctuation of sm may be considered as a comprehensive expression driven by both climatic and human factors with climate change analyses increasingly attracting attention li et al 2021b pastor and post 1986 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 seneviratne et al 2011 the importance of exploring the dynamics of sm which is highly sensitive to climatic factors is gaining significance human activity which is intensifying with swiftly growing global population levels and rapidly developing economic conditions is exerting a significant level of stress on sustainable water resource supplies colaizzi et al 2003 döll et al 2012 puy et al 2021 qiu et al 2016 therefore studies aimed at revealing the mechanisms underlying the association between sm and water resource withdrawal dominated by human activities may lead to a better understanding of sm many studies have analyzed the spatial temporal patterns of sm as well as the mechanisms underlying these patterns in detail meng et al 2002 assessed the effects of climatic factors on sm variability in the mongolian plateau from 1982 to 2019 and found that decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration resulted in a decreasing trend jia et al 2017 used long term in situ observations to determine that afforestation had caused an obvious decline in deep sm across the loess plateau zhang et al 2019 analyzed sm changes in the himalayan tibetan plateau from a historical and futuristic perspective and revealed that a persistently amplifying decreasing trend observed since 2010 was predominantly driven by increasing precipitation and even more significantly by increasing evapotranspiration liu et al 2015a analyzed sm dynamics in croplands of northern china during the period between 1983 and 2012 and demonstrated that agriculture had remarkably intensified soil drying especially during the growing season as stated above much effort has been devoted to the exploration of the fluctuating trends of sm from multiple perspectives resulting in some progress however little is known about the causes underlying the patterns of sm variability observed across the 9 600 000 km2 land area of china which exhibits diverse landcover types various climatic conditions unbalanced population densities and activity intensities since both climatic as well as human factors may significantly impact the variability of sm it is necessary to investigate the long term multi depth spatial temporal sm trends observed across china in order to quantitatively determine probable driving forces currently a considerable number of sm products such as in situ measurements satellite retrievals and assimilation based products are available for use in scientific studies dobriyal et al 2012 in situ measurements are usually retrieved by equipment such as time domain reflectometry tdr sensors capacitance probes hygrometric sensors and resistance probes dorigo et al 2021 they are capable of monitoring and recording point scale soil volumetric water contents at a precise location depth and time dorigo et al 2011 these probes are regularly and rigorously calibrated via gravimetric measurements to maintain accuracy liu et al 2021 however limited spatial representation spatial coverage time span and unevenly distributed sensors pose challenges when attempting to conduct long term large scale sm analyses using in situ measurements satellite retrievals present an unprecedented opportunity for accessing global near real time sm datasets entekhabi et al 2010 gruber et al 2019 kerr et al 2001 liu et al 2016 njoku et al 2003 satellite based sm retrievals are broadly used to study the dynamics of land surface water energy and carbon cycles dorigo et al 2017 holzman et al 2014 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 nevertheless gap regions attributed to satellite orbits dense vegetation and radio frequency interference among others are prevalent in satellite retrievals furthermore spaceborne sensors are able to retrieve only top layer sm signals approximately 0 5 cm depth due to limited microwave penetration capabilities in comparison multi depth sm conditions are more valuable for the purpose of grasping vertical sm profiles an assimilation based approach effectively overcomes the spatial scope and representativeness limitation of ground observations breaks through the depth limitations of spaceborne microwave derived data and achieves complete multi depth coverage of sm with definitive physical undertones the european centre for medium range weather forecast reanalysis v5 land era5 land developed by the copernicus climate change service provides a series of multi depth sm and surface variable products muñoz sabater et al 2021 although some bias is inevitably associated with reanalysis products the accuracy of sm estimates made via these have been comprehensively evaluated and acknowledged li et al 2020a wu et al 2021 consequently in this study we utilized the era5 land product to investigate the patterns of sm dynamics in china moreover soil temperature st precipitation p evaporation et and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were employed as climatic factors domestic dom electricity generation elec irrigation irr livestock liv manufacturing mfg and mining min related water withdrawals are mainly made from shallow groundwater and surface water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs which are critical factors associated with the hydrological cycle and are thus tightly linked to sm condon et al 2020 erler et al 2019 these water withdrawals are recognized as human factors the correlation between these factors and sm variability was explored this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the study regions and data resources used in the current study data preprocessing correlation calculation and causality analysis methods are also included in this section section 3 describes the spatial temporal dynamics of multi depth sm in china and the relationships between sm and the above mentioned factors in section 4 currently practiced water resource regulation related measures that may affect sm variation as well as uncertainty factors are further discussed and conclusions that can be drawn from this study are stated in section 5 2 the study region data resources and methodology 2 1 study region the territory of china spans between 73 e 135 e from east to west and 4 n 53 n from north to south fig 1 because spatial resolution of the dataset used in this study is unified to 0 1 0 1 about 100 km2 the island areas less than one pixel were not taken into consideration the vegetation coverage shows a decline from forest to shrubland savanna cropland grassland and barren land and from the southeast coast to the west north inland fig 1 correspondingly the climate gradually turns from humid semi humid to monsoon and semi arid arid as the terrain gradually becomes higher human activity intensity decreases 2 2 data

accordingly the four layer st p and et were chosen as related climatic factors in view of the inseparable interaction between sm and vegetation the global inventory modeling mapping studies gimms ndvi product https iridl ldeo columbia edu renowned for its lengthy time series and reliable quality was also employed as a climatic factor pinzon and tucker 2014 the spatialized global monthly human water withdrawals originate from the statistics of the food and agriculture organization fao aquastat and us geological survey usgs https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1209296 huang et al 2018 country level statistics were downscaled to grid level using spatial downscaling algorithms next linear interpolation was employed to acquire annual data from the 5 year interval reports finally a temporal downscaling algorithm was applied to obtain the monthly gridded dataset irrigation withdrawal in particular was estimated using four types of global hydrological models including watergap lpjml h08 and pcr globwb in this study simple arithmetic means of the four estimates were utilized to reflect irrigation withdrawals additionally landcover patterns may be greatly impacted by innate climate properties and human activities hence the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis landcover product mcd12c1 was adopted to detect any potential association between landcover and sm dynamics friedl et al 2002 basic information on the above mentioned datasets with detailed references are listed table 1 2 3 methodology 1 preprocessing all datasets were unified at a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 in accordance with the era5 land products usage stipulations the gimms ndvi was simply upscaled by calculating the arithmetic average within each 0 1 0 1 grid while the maximum value composite method was used to obtain the monthly product the dominant landcover type was selected to present upscaled mcd12c1 data in regard to human water withdrawals bilinear interpolation was used to realize the downscaling procedure furthermore these datasets were processed to the same spatial reference as well as spatial extent in order to maintain consistency between each other 2 trend analysis sm as well as climatic factors may show regular seasonal fluctuations in term of the regional climate rhythm hence it necessary to remove intra annual changes which allows the general trend of each parameter to be explicitly displayed and any possible correlation between two parameters to be explored from a long term perspective therefore the moving average was adopted to calculate the temporal variation trend by subtracting the moving average of anterior months as follows 1 m o v i n g a v e r a g e t x t 11 t where x t 11 t is the moving average of the target long time series parameters during the period from the time of t 11 to t here time is calculated on a monthly basis in order to clarify the association between multi layer sm and various factors the interaction among them was systematically analyzed using the correlation coefficient r and granger causality analysis r is a classical index that quantitatively depicts the degree of linear correlation between two parameters r values range from 1 to 1 where r 0 indicates a positive correlation and r 0 indicates a negative correlation the closer the absolute value is to 1 the higher the correlation comparatively granger causality is a simple non linear but effective statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether the time series of a given variable is useful for forecasting another one it was developed by the nobel laureate clive w j granger in 1969 granger 1969 this causality indicator has been widely applied in economic and political fields since its inception dutta 2001 freeman 1983 kónya 2006 earth system science related studies have started using it in recent years papagiannopoulou et al 2017 wuebbles et al 2017 the equations for r and the granger causality test are displayed as follows 2 r x y c o v x y v a r x v a r y where cov x y is the covariance of x and y v a r x and v a r y are the variance of x and y respectively 3 x t i 1 n a i x t i i 1 n b i y t i ε t 4 y t i 1 n c i y t i i 1 n d i x t i η t where x t and y t are the time series of two parameters n is the sample capacity a i b i c i and d i are regression coefficients and ε t and η t are white noise it is noted that both the time series interrelationship and the autocorrelation of the two target parameters are evaluated using granger causality analysis besides a f test is used to determine whether the granger causality hypothesis is tenable usually set f 0 05 or 0 1 if the estimation of y t can be remarkably improved by taking x t into consideration compared to merely using the past y t values then that would indicate that past values of x t exert a statistically significant effect on the current values of y t and vice versa in addition the 95 significance test was performed to ensure the reliability of the calculated results 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal multi depth dynamics 3 1 1 covariations of sm and st spatial sm variation across china was evidently unbalanced during the 1950 2020 period fig 2 in terms of different sm variation levels table 2 although most areas 70 exhibited inconspicuous variation the drying and wetting regions were considered to be nonnegligible due to the possibility that the available soil water content could have exerted a far reaching effect on the local ecosystem the drying region was mainly located in north china and central northeast china which exhibit a typically flat terrain and a temperate monsoon climate meanwhile as the intensity of human activities such as domestic farming and industrial activities keep increasing the accompanying increase in water withdrawal as well as consumption may inevitably lower the water table reduce surface water and exacerbate sm loss as one of the most populous regions affected by water scarcity in china continuous overexploitation of groundwater and expansion of irrigated agriculture would lead to a serious water crisis in this area kang and eltahir 2018 xing et al 2013 furthermore due to the effects exerted by a warming climate the influence of potential evapotranspiration on sm may become prominent li et al 2021c comparatively the wetting region which extends along the mountains kunlun 5 500 6 000 m on average and tianshan 4 000 m on average exhibits steep terrains and climate altitudinal belts the wetting region contains one of the largest glacier areas in china yang et al 1996 given that these trackless mountains exit far from human activity except for the occasional scientific expedition it is possible that the prevailing tendency towards a surplus of soil water is largely induced by climatic factors evidently the extent of drought expanded from 22 45 to 25 95 with growing depth while the drought level strengthened from 0 008 m3 m3 per decade to 0 013 m3 m3 per decade however the wetting region shrank from 4 15 to 3 02 and the degree of co wetting decreased from 0 009 m3 m3 per decade to 0 004 m3 m3 per decade at the same time the 70 year temporal sequences explicitly demonstrated variation trends in different regions although phased fluctuations appeared to be prevalent the overall trend could easily be observed from a long term perspective as depth increased the average soil water content of the wetting region steadily caught up with and surpassed that of the drying region additionally the momentary fluctuation degree became significantly moderate preliminarily as depth increased indicating the sensitivity of surface soil to land atmosphere interactions and the impervious feature of deep layer soil this phenomenon was further verified on a monthly scale fig 3 and variability across months apparently turned from distinct to vague as depth grew the stability of deep layer soil has similarly been acknowledged by previous studies focusing on sm variability in the mongolian plateau meng et al 2022 as well as in illinois usa wu et al 2002 in terms of the different soil water holding capacities if every soil layer intercepted some part of water during its downward transportation through soil pores then less water would be obtained and a smaller amplitude would be exhibited as depth increases the sm of the wetting region continuously increased throughout the year due to seasonal snow melt and p fig 3 the least wetting trend appeared in may when melting of snow was nearing its end and p was yet to come simultaneously the drying region maintained consistency and showed a relatively strong tendency in spring and autumn when the winter wheat and corn in northern china begin to elongate a relatively insignificant trend was seen in june when wheat as well as early season rice in north china plain was just being harvested and the grass on the hulun buir grassland had just begun to grow the spatial distribution of multi depth st fig 4 indicated that the correlation between the variability of sm and st was generally negative the spatial scope of warming and cooling areas were basically in accordance with that of the drying and wetting regions respectively china underwent a universal multi depth st increase of 0 16 per decade on average during the past 70 years under a background of global warming with respect to different change levels table 3 as soil depth increased the scope of the significantly warming region was progressively enlarged from 27 07 to 30 29 along with an increasing degree of serious warming from 0 29 per decade to 0 31 per decade in comparison both the scope ranging from 1 26 to 1 47 and varying degree 0 01 per decade of the cooling region remained mostly stable the distribution of st declining trend was basically in accordance with the extent of the wetting region the abnormal cooling process was mainly due to the falling average temperature in summer azam et al 2018 cogley 2011 gardelle et al 2012 temporal dynamics fig 4 and the monthly variation trends fig 5 revealed that the degree of monthly as well as interannual st fluctuations showed a gradual and mild tendency as depth increased which coincided with the degree of vertical sm variation such uniformity may shed light on the consistent spatial temporal water heat covariation in soil as substantiated by the findings of a previous study li et al 2020a however different layers did diverge for warming regions the notable increasing period of layer 1 0 7 cm and layer 2 7 28 cm was in spring mar apr and may whereas the peak increasing period of layers 3 and 4 were gradually delayed until summer and autumn respectively with respect to cooling regions the cooling trend mostly lasted from mar to sep followed by varying degrees of warming up from oct to feb of the next year the changes in surface st were caused by solar radiation molecular conduction latent heat exchange convection and turbulence while vertical st variability was mainly due to heat conduction during the process of downward heat transfer each soil layer would retain some part of the heat hence the deeper the soil the less heat it would receive and the smaller the increase in temperature probability density function pdf curves were drawn to intuitively display the sm value distribution in 1950 and 2020 the multi depth sm values corresponding to maximum percent probability in the drying region evidently declined from approximately 0 3 to 0 25 m3 m3 during 1950 2020 fig 6 with increasing depth the sm corresponding to maximum percent probability in the wetting region ranged from approximately 0 16 to 0 31 m3 m3 in 1950 however in 2020 as depth increased from the surface layer to the bottom layer the peak sms corresponding to maximum percent probability increased visibly ranging between approximately 0 24 and 0 34 m3 m3 moreover there were noticeable differences between the wetting and drying regions across the four layers in 1950 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the drying region orange was higher than that for the wetting one light blue at layer 1 fig 6 a meanwhile the gap between peak sm values of the pdf curves for the wetting and drying regions kept shrinking with increasing depth and in 1950 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the drying region was finally surpassed by that for the wetting region at layer 4 fig 6 d in comparison in 2020 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the wetting region blue exceeded that of the drying region red at layer 2 preliminarily demonstrating that the drying trend accelerated with increasing depth during 1950 and 2020 3 1 2 landcover based sm variability analysis surface soil is commonly covered with vegetation vegetation growth is deeply affected by the availability of soil water on the one hand soil water deficit may lead to plant wilting while on the other hand excessive sm may result in root rot the variability of sm may be influenced by vegetation as well vegetation absorbs water from the soil for respiration and transpiration purposes effectively reducing sm thereby however vegetation conserves soil and water by preventing rapid evaporation and restraining desertification thus a relationship characterized by a tight and mutually bidirectional feedback exists between sm and vegetation brockett et al 2012 landcover data was used to explore the link between the variation in sm and vegetation firstly the urban built up lands and water bodies were filtered out then the 14 original landcover types were reclassified as forest shrubland savannas grassland cropland permanent snow and ice and barren table 4 different landcover trends were observed in regions displaying sm variation during 2001 2020 table 5 due to the nourishment afforded by adequate soil water supplies the percentage of grassland consistently increased in the wetting region suggesting widespread greening for kunlun and tianshan mountains a previous study revealed that greening of the arctic was associated with warming accompanied by permafrost thaw and snowmelt myers smith et al 2020 however the findings of our investigations indicated that greening trends may also be triggered by ample soil water supplies despite stable or slightly declining temperatures thereby providing new avenues for analyzing the association between vegetation and climate change in general permanent snow and ice increased slowly due to a slightly cooling tendency and the barren area shrank accordingly comparatively speaking in densely populated areas human intervention acts as one of the leading factors affecting time series landcover pattern in drying regions the drying region roughly comprises the north china plain the northeast china plain the sanjiang plain and the guanzhong plain which are the main wheat corn peanut and cotton producing areas original uncultivated land was reclaimed little by little to feed 1 4 billion people as well as to guarantee national food security simultaneously the three north shelter belts forest project was initiated here to improve the ecological environment reduce natural disasters and maintain living space li et al 2021a therefore the maintenance of forest and cropland increased while savannas grassland and barren regions were neglected the demand for soil water rose quickly because artificial irrigation could satisfy plant growth requirements only temporarily therefore the continuous imbalance between water demand and supply may have led to a deficit in sm the proportion of cropland in the stable region was far less than that in the drying region indicating substantially less irrigation water requirements the forest proportion rose from 11 07 to 13 05 during 2001 2020 afforestation may directly cause an increase in local et thereby giving rise to a reduction in available water resources including sm nevertheless parts of the evaporated water would nourish the downwind region in the form of p via an enhanced water cycle in turn p and available water resources in nearby downwind regions may be indirectly boosted hoek van dijke et al 2022 3 2 analysis of climatic factors 3 2 1 correlation analysis apart from st we chose p et and ndvi as the three mainly correlated climatic factors that needed to be investigated for their role in the spatiotemporal variability shown by sm p in the wetting region and southeast china showed a rising trend while p in the area that was mainly distributed in the drying region central and southwest china showed a declining trend fig 7 a furthermore from a temporal variation perspective both rising and declining trends were prominent in the summer fig 8 a b wherein p was predominantly regulated by the summer monsoon in an area where the sm drying region was roughly located et showed a conspicuously increasing trend which was possibly jointly induced by a declining p and a greening tendency the remaining part of et showed a generally decreasing trend especially in the wetting region the periods of et change were largely focused on their own growing seasons fig 8 e f the major area showing a greening trend was situated in eastern china an area naturally suitable for plant growth wherein continuous reclamation and afforestation had taken places during the past 70 years in comparison the greening area in western china was mainly located in the tianshan and the altai mountains where p as well as available soil water contents increased steadily overall a greening trend was clearly observable throughout china fig 8 j especially in the spring and autumn with particular reference to the elongation stage of winter wheat and early season rice and the elongation stage of corn and late rice respectively therefore it may be concluded that the drying region was accompanied by a rising st an increasing et a declining p and a greening trend whereas the wetting region was accompanied by a decreasing st a falling et an increasing p and a rising ndvi in order to intuitively discover their linkage the spatial distribution of the correlation between the temporal trends of multi layer sm and climatic factors is depicted fig 9 the correlation between monthly sm and st trends was generally negative heat transfer triggered by temperature differences among multi layers and air namely the sensible heat flux uses water as the energy carrier flanagan and johnson 2005 the rate of specific heat transfers depended on different atmospheric conditions and soil components sm evaporation was an effective way to reduce st besides st showed a notable negative correlation with sm which was due to the decline in viscosity and surface tension of water caused by increasing temperature therefore at constant water potential higher temperatures are associated with lower soil water contents the relationship between p and sm was hardly observable in areas where st and sm were positively correlated p and irr were the two main sources that nourished soil significantly p exhibited a primarily positive association with multi layer sm across china due to interception by upper layer soil its degree of relevance continuously declined with increasing depth a declining correlation was also reflected by et the extent of positive correlation was mainly confined to the croplands grasslands and barren lands of the arid semi arid monsoon climate regions fig 9 a d in the areas showing a negative correlation there was a lack of water supply as an enhanced et process driven by the warming trend slowly drained the water from soil in comparison the region showing a positive correlation was basically located in the yangtze river basin as well as the northeast border of china where the predominant landcover type was forest and grassland long lasting p in the spring and summer of the yangtze river basin sufficiently nourishes soil and vegetation resulting in a simultaneously increasing sm and et the yangtze river basin which is rich in water resources provides approximately 50 of the runoff and 40 of the fresh water resources in china duan et al 2018 xu et al 2022 compared to the above mentioned factors there was a rather weak relationship between the trends shown by ndvi and sm the central and southeast parts exhibited a negative relationship r 0 3 while a positively associated trend r 0 3 was seen in the northeast northwest and southwest parts this suggested the possible existence of a nonlinear and obscure relationship between the variation in vegetation and sm caused by the complicated nature of their interactions 3 2 2 causality analysis in view of the limitations of linear correlation analysis the granger causality analysis with max lag time of 2 months was used to further explore the relationship between multi layer sm and climatic factors the extent of the causal relationship between multi layer sm and corresponding st was found to gradually increase with depth at the top layer the causally linked regions which were located in southwest central and northeast china accounted for 43 67 in total fig 10 a d however the extent constantly grew to reach 66 59 when depth rose to layer 4 simultaneously the area showing a bidirectional causality relationship rose to 22 36 indicating that water heat covariation was enhanced as depth grew there was always a higher proportion of st being the unidirectional cause of sm than sm being the unidirectional cause of st furthermore st is regarded as the dominant factor that determines sm variation at mid high latitudes li et al 2021b niu and yang 2006 p which is one of the most influential and direct water sources of soil shows a causal relationship with sm the coverage with p sm causality steadily expanded from 48 4 to 55 53 as the depth increased the ratio that the dynamics of p was regarded as the granger reason of sm variability was also boosted from 32 58 to 52 9 simultaneously further verifying the crucial role played by p in sm variability despite the ratio which indicated that sm was the unidirectional cause of p was much less than the one indicating the opposite numerous studies have focused on analyzing the effect of sm on p koster et al 2003 who analyzed a 50 year observational precipitation dataset covering the united states were the first to find evidence that sm anomalies induced by p may subsequently affect p itself further studies conducted by koster et al 2004 demonstrated that sm anomalies exert a substantial effect on p during boreal summer based on koster s framework yang et al 2018 observed a prevalently positive sm p feedback over land although a non negligible negative feedback did occur in the dry and wet regions due to varying climatic conditions total et which is defined as the accumulated amount of water including bare soil and vegetation that evaporates from earth s surface was employed in this study a predominantly bidirectional causality relationship exists between the dynamics of et and surface layer sm nevertheless as depth rose the dominant position was assumed in a degree by degree manner by et which acted as the unidirectional cause of sm comparatively the variation of et uniformly affected the sm pattern across all layers while the feedback from sm to et sharply declined with increasing depth illustrating the dominance of et and top layer sm in sm et mutual responses for decades much effort has been devoted to analyze the interaction between sm and et chanzy and bruckler 1993 delworth and manabe 1988 philip 1957 vargas zeppetello et al 2019 culminating in the conclusion that et was limited by sm in dry regions positively correlated and by radiation energy in the wet region negatively correlated since vegetation related conditions are easily impacted by many climatic and human factors the proportion that showed a significant causal link between ndvi and sm steadily increased as the soil depth increased fig 10 m p this tendency revealed that root zone sm maybe a more competent indicator of vegetation growth than surface sm moreover regions where ndvi was susceptible to sm were mostly located in northern and southern china on the one hand soil water deficit appears to be the main limiting factor affecting vegetation based photosynthesis in northern china while on the other hand it appears that excessive sm caused by continuous p may directly lead to a deterioration in soil aeration as well as root anoxia in southern china furthermore the region where ndvi could effectively influence sm was located in the southern part where vast forest lands favored the retention of water in the northern part the root zone sm expressed higher sensitivity to ndvi than the surface ones 3 3 human factor analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis in this study we used the spatialized water withdrawals by dom elec irr liv mfg and min during 1971 2010 to investigate the correlation between human water use factors and multi layer sm the results indicated that changes had mainly occurred in the densely populated southeast fig 11 the industrial boom associated with the promulgation of a series of economic policies and the advent of new technologies brought about a rapid increase in mfg and min resulting in soaring water consumption rapid growth of the industrial complex created a huge demand for elec a large amount of water was required for fuel extraction processing and power generation thermal power being the mainstream power source in china is one of the most water consuming power generation technologies according to recent reports water consumption by the power industry accounts for nearly 12 of the total water intake in china gao et al 2018 besides persistent population growth 0 85 billion in 1971 and 1 34 billion in 2010 as well as urbanization urbanization rate surged from 17 26 to 49 95 during the 1971 2010 period continues to accelerate dom water withdrawal accordingly these remarkable increasing trends were concentrated in urban agglomerations such as the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration by contrast water withdrawal for agricultural purposes displayed a different pattern agriculture being the largest water user in china accounted for 61 26 of the total water consumption in 2010 china 2020 the irr water withdrawal pattern showed a notable decreasing trend in the north china and a slightly increasing trend in southern china in addition a previous study reported that the national irr water use coefficient defined as the proportion of irr water used by crops was increasing in eastern and northern regions than in the western and southern regions respectively li et al 2020b this study further revealed that shandong province had the highest coefficient which basically coincided with the extent of the decrease in the east fig 11 c liv water withdrawal showed a widespread declining trend except in some areas of shandong province and the guangxi zhuang autonomous region as with the climatic factors the monthly variation trends of human water use data fig 12 exhibited regular patterns which evolved in accordance with seasonal rhythms usually both dom and elec peak in the summer since the hot weather increases the demand for showering and air conditioning further investigation indicated that the peaks of the increasing trends shown by dom and elec also emerged in summer from jun to aug the predominantly decreasing trend of irr occurred in may and june especially in the drying region may represents the crucial wheat filling stage during which a sufficient water supply would boost the setting percentage grain number per spike and content of wheat protein maize is sown in the summer and thus june becomes the critical month for irrigation if a favorable emergence rate is desired in comparison the variation trends of liv mfg and min remained stable across months due to their insensitivity to climatic conditions we calculated the correlation coefficients corresponding to the association between the dynamics of human water use factors and sm for every grid during the 1971 2010 period and drew spatial distribution patterns to explore their potential connections fig 13 human water withdrawals were mainly made from shallow groundwater and surface water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs industrial related water use including dom elec mfg and min displayed roughly coincident spatial characteristics with the depth increasing the absolute values of the correlation coefficients continued to grow with increasing depth implying that deep layer sm could be more susceptible to water intake than surface sm moreover the correlation in central and eastern china was significantly negative in the negatively correlated region plants with long roots such as shrubs and trees easily perceived sm deficits caused by the rapidly rising trend of industrial related water withdrawal by contrast a positive correlation was observed in the western arid inland area although this region is renowned for abundant glacier water resources the available water supply is seriously restricted by climatic factors such as p and temperature hence water consumption levels may be seriously affected by the amount of available water in terms of agricultural water withdrawal the dynamics of sm and irr gradually became weakly negatively correlated as depth increased irr was used to relieve sm deficit as also to supply the water required for plant growth in croplands the drier the soil the greater the amount of irr required the most remarkably negative correlation was observed in the surface layer and the weak trend seen may have been due to water interception in the vertical direction similar to the correlation pattern observed between industrial water withdrawal and sm the correlation pattern between liv and sm also showed a tendency to strengthen with increasing depth the positively correlated region was widely distributed in the southern western and central northeastern china while the negative correlated region was concentrated in inner mongolia and northeastern china 3 3 2 causality analysis because it is difficult to prove the interaction between artificial water usage and sm via correlation analysis alone the granger causality analysis was used to conduct further investigations industrial related water withdrawal including dom elec mfg and min and layer 1 4 sm in the causally linked regions across china displayed a gradually expanding trend as the depth increased fig 14 however it appeared that the region industrial water usage being the granger cause of sm dynamics expanded from northeast to east china the region in which sm could be regarded as the unidirectional cause of irr was mostly located in the southeast coastal area of china which area displayed a typical subtropical monsoon climate with abundant p numerous rivers and many water resources during the long hot summers moist soils remarkably reduce the requirement of irr by contrast irr was the most effective way to relieve sm deficit and meet the water demands of crops in the northern regions which lack sufficient p liv was also seen as a granger cause of sm variability and its responding region gradually enlarged from scattered to east and northwest china as depth increased overall although causality relationships were detected between various types of human water withdrawal and multi layer sm the proportions human water withdrawal causing the variation of sm were less than those detected between climatic factors and multi layer sm this is due to most artificial water withdrawals from surface water bodies or shallow ground water sources impacting the soil water content either directly or indirectly however climatic factors may directly and noticeably affect sm by regulating water supply and consumption 4 discussion sm which is one of the most important indicators of agricultural drought directly affects the physical and chemical qualities of soil and vegetation growth which in turn significantly influence grain yields in china given the strategic and irreplaceable role played by sm in ensuring national food security a detailed investigation into the spatial temporal variability of sm across china under the overwhelming global warming trend may be considered imperative this study comprehensively analyzed the multi layer sm fluctuation patterns during 1950 2020 and detected a primarily imbalanced variation trend which showed overall drying and regional wetting tendencies furthermore in this study we explored the degree of correlation and causality between sm dynamics and climatic and human factors in an attempt to clarify the key driving factors that cause sm variation and identify underlying mechanisms additionally the association between sm and these factors were also retroactively analyzed to obtain a better understanding of their interactions the sm drying trend was widespread across most regions of china especially in north china and central northeast china which were major grain producing areas with intense human activity activities of the three north shelter belts forest project and land reclamation led to a steady expansion of forests as well as croplands in the region exhibiting sm drying during the 2001 2020 period thus the soil water demand in this region was remarkably increased compared to that in the original savanna grassland and barren land cover types simultaneously a downward trend in p and an upward trend in st were clearly observed rising temperature led to a higher vapor pressure deficit and an evaporative demand resulting in a corresponding increase in et in terms of anthropogenic factors domestic agricultural and industrial water withdrawals continued to grow with rapid economic development consequently sm decreased under the combined effect of increasingly insufficient water supplementation and growing multi source water requirements furthermore it was found that the deep soil layer expressed a much higher degree of drought than did the surface one which may be caused by water saving technology induced decline in irrigation amount per unit area zhu et al 2022 investigated the relative evolution of in situ sm at various agricultural stations across china between 1992 and 2012 they found that relative sm exhibited a long term decreasing trend in temperate continental climate zones and that this trend was driven by both climatic and agricultural management activities specifically sm declined significantly during the crop growing season liu et al 2015b fertilizer application and proliferation of water expensive crops e g maize contributed to rising et and drying soil individually additionally li et al 2022 predicted that an increasing vegetation transpiration ratio induced by warming climates and prolonged growing seasons would continuously intensify sm loss over the semiarid and subhumid regions of china for the period 2015 2100 the severe sm loss patterns has been recognized and much effort is being made to alleviate sm deficits technical progress and an enhanced awareness of the importance of saving water has resulted in a continuously improving national irrigation water use coefficient li et al 2020b the grain for green program devoted to converting sloping croplands into forest and preventing soil erosion was initiated in 1999 feng et al 2005 this program has made an irreplaceably important contribution towards increasing forest coverage and restoring the ecosystem however compared to retaining original croplands or grasslands savannas the introduction of deep rooted trees may further aggravate the deep layer sm deficit and exacerbate drying trends yang et al 2022 a previous study has suggested that afforestation may consume more water in china s arid and semi arid regions where available sm is the key limiting resource cao et al 2018 it further suggested that picking up and planting drought tolerant tree species would result in an improvement in both ecosystem and sm variation trends in the future besides it is necessary to evaluate the long term sustainability and effectiveness of the measures that have been taken already a previous study has revealed that agricultural production in india would be ensured by the 2030 s via an adequate irrigation strategy however by the 2080 s irrigation adaptation alone would be insufficient to compensate for the severe effects exerted by climatic warming trends unless strong worldwide climate change mitigation or vegetation climate adaptation evolution could be introduced droppers et al 2022 despite the progress that has been achieved some uncertainty regarding issues that may affect these achievements lingers on firstly apart from the above mentioned climatic and human factors many other factors such as atmospheric rivers liang et al 2023 snowmelt bales et al 2011 and water transfer project liu and zheng 2002 that are closely associated with sm dynamics may need further exploration however it may be difficult to quantify some of these factors as well as their impact on sm secondly many climatic and human factors jointly and simultaneously contribute to the fluctuation of sm further increasing the complexity of sm patterns additionally an almost century long effort has gone into developing a numerical model equation of sm richards 1931 the era5 land model which benefited from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation has been acknowledged for providing a state of the art global land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater et al 2021 however current information on the effects exerted by the disturbances caused by intensified human activities on land surface should be expanded and quantified since multi depth sm and climatic parameters originate mostly from era5 land products a certain degree of inherent relevance and systematic bias could inevitably exist among these products specifically the accuracy of era5 land et was evaluated comprehensively during 2001 2014 and era5 land et showed overall good performance against in situ measurements muñoz sabater et al 2021 however the reliable reference sites were mainly distributed across the continental us europe and australia and the error increased at high altitude sites according to a previous study exploring the long term et in northern china using averaged et from era5 land and other six datasets it was found that et increased significantly from 1982 to 2017 su et al 2022 although the et could be remarkably correlated to p the increasing trend of p was insignificant which suggested that there appeared inconsistency between long terms et and p under the warming climate therefore future work should be focused on using multi source and mutually independent datasets to objectively investigate the variation pattern and mechanism of sm 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the spatial temporal variation patterns of multi depth sm that were jointly driven by climatic and human factors during the past decades in china the dynamics of sm displayed varying degrees in the background of a generally warming trend the significantly drying region was located mostly in north china and central northeast china while the wetting region was concentrated in the kunlun and tianshan mountains while the drought level in the drying region increased steadily with increasing depth the degree of dampness in the wetting region shrank gradually since roughly one quarter of the drying region comprised croplands where root zone sm appeared to be more crucial for plant growth than surface sm an urgent need for sufficient and sustainable soil water supplies that ensure food security has emerged correlation and granger causality analyses indicate that p and et may be the dominant climatic factors driving the variability of multi depth sm and that the effects exerted by these factors may gradually decline with increasing depth due to interception by upper soil layers feedback between sm and climatic factors was detected revealing their close interaction intense human water withdrawal activities play an important role in influencing the variation patterns of sm the correlation between human factors and sm grows continuously with increasing depth except for irr implying that deep layer sm is susceptible to activities associated with water intake consequently the dual impact of climatic and human factors leads to complicated multi layer sm changes in china thus the findings of this study may expectedly boost the understanding of sm patterns in china and provide a reference for the future exploration usage and management of sm credit authorship contribution statement yangxiaoyue liu

2119,soil moisture sm which plays a critical role in land atmosphere hydrological cycles acts as the dominant water resource for vegetation growth in china the spatial temporal variation in multi depth sm patterns caused by the combined influence of climatic and human factors remains unclear in this study we systematically investigated the trends of sm as well as the relationship between sm and the multiple factors affecting it our results indicated that variability in sm in china was quite unbalanced during the 1950 2020 period mainly the region covering north china and central northeastern china underwent significant drying and exhibited a remarkable warming trend by contrast the wetting region characterized by decreasing soil temperature in the summer was concentrated in the area encompassing the kunlun and tianshan mountains as the depth increased the drought level in the drying region steadily intensified while the dampness degree in the wetting region gradually shrank such a consistently intensifying sm deficit inevitably threatens crop yield and food security correlation and granger causality analyses indicated that precipitation and evaporation may act as dominant climatic factors that drive the variability of multi depth sm this driving force gradually declining with increasing depth due to buffering by upper soil layers by contrast the correlation between human water withdrawal and sm grew continuously with increasing depth except when irrigation was involved implying that deep layer sm is susceptible to water intake these findings are expected to boost the understanding of patterns of sm in china and provide a reference for future exploration usage and management of sm as well keywords multi depth soil moisture variability pattern climatic and human factors china data availability the era5 land products can be acquired from https www ecmwf int en forecasts datasets the gimms ndvi is retrieved from https iridl ldeo columbia edu the land

1209296 1 introduction soil moisture sm which acts as a vital linkage in the land atmosphere hydrological cycle provides an indispensable research target in hydrology vereecken et al 2008 climatology dong et al 2020 meteorology calvet et al 1998 ecology robinson et al 2008 and agronomy rigden et al 2020 sm may function as an important indicator of climate change due to its tight association with precipitation koster et al 2003 temperature xu et al 2004 vegetation zwieback et al 2018 and evaporation delworth and manabe 1988 among other factors various human activities e g irrigation domestic electrical generation livestock mining and manufacturing may directly or indirectly affect the spatial temporal distribution and variation of sm in varying degrees he et al 2021 therefore fluctuation of sm may be considered as a comprehensive expression driven by both climatic and human factors with climate change analyses increasingly attracting attention li et al 2021b pastor and post 1986 rodriguez iturbe et al 1999 seneviratne et al 2011 the importance of exploring the dynamics of sm which is highly sensitive to climatic factors is gaining significance human activity which is intensifying with swiftly growing global population levels and rapidly developing economic conditions is exerting a significant level of stress on sustainable water resource supplies colaizzi et al 2003 döll et al 2012 puy et al 2021 qiu et al 2016 therefore studies aimed at revealing the mechanisms underlying the association between sm and water resource withdrawal dominated by human activities may lead to a better understanding of sm many studies have analyzed the spatial temporal patterns of sm as well as the mechanisms underlying these patterns in detail meng et al 2002 assessed the effects of climatic factors on sm variability in the mongolian plateau from 1982 to 2019 and found that decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration resulted in a decreasing trend jia et al 2017 used long term in situ observations to determine that afforestation had caused an obvious decline in deep sm across the loess plateau zhang et al 2019 analyzed sm changes in the himalayan tibetan plateau from a historical and futuristic perspective and revealed that a persistently amplifying decreasing trend observed since 2010 was predominantly driven by increasing precipitation and even more significantly by increasing evapotranspiration liu et al 2015a analyzed sm dynamics in croplands of northern china during the period between 1983 and 2012 and demonstrated that agriculture had remarkably intensified soil drying especially during the growing season as stated above much effort has been devoted to the exploration of the fluctuating trends of sm from multiple perspectives resulting in some progress however little is known about the causes underlying the patterns of sm variability observed across the 9 600 000 km2 land area of china which exhibits diverse landcover types various climatic conditions unbalanced population densities and activity intensities since both climatic as well as human factors may significantly impact the variability of sm it is necessary to investigate the long term multi depth spatial temporal sm trends observed across china in order to quantitatively determine probable driving forces currently a considerable number of sm products such as in situ measurements satellite retrievals and assimilation based products are available for use in scientific studies dobriyal et al 2012 in situ measurements are usually retrieved by equipment such as time domain reflectometry tdr sensors capacitance probes hygrometric sensors and resistance probes dorigo et al 2021 they are capable of monitoring and recording point scale soil volumetric water contents at a precise location depth and time dorigo et al 2011 these probes are regularly and rigorously calibrated via gravimetric measurements to maintain accuracy liu et al 2021 however limited spatial representation spatial coverage time span and unevenly distributed sensors pose challenges when attempting to conduct long term large scale sm analyses using in situ measurements satellite retrievals present an unprecedented opportunity for accessing global near real time sm datasets entekhabi et al 2010 gruber et al 2019 kerr et al 2001 liu et al 2016 njoku et al 2003 satellite based sm retrievals are broadly used to study the dynamics of land surface water energy and carbon cycles dorigo et al 2017 holzman et al 2014 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 nevertheless gap regions attributed to satellite orbits dense vegetation and radio frequency interference among others are prevalent in satellite retrievals furthermore spaceborne sensors are able to retrieve only top layer sm signals approximately 0 5 cm depth due to limited microwave penetration capabilities in comparison multi depth sm conditions are more valuable for the purpose of grasping vertical sm profiles an assimilation based approach effectively overcomes the spatial scope and representativeness limitation of ground observations breaks through the depth limitations of spaceborne microwave derived data and achieves complete multi depth coverage of sm with definitive physical undertones the european centre for medium range weather forecast reanalysis v5 land era5 land developed by the copernicus climate change service provides a series of multi depth sm and surface variable products muñoz sabater et al 2021 although some bias is inevitably associated with reanalysis products the accuracy of sm estimates made via these have been comprehensively evaluated and acknowledged li et al 2020a wu et al 2021 consequently in this study we utilized the era5 land product to investigate the patterns of sm dynamics in china moreover soil temperature st precipitation p evaporation et and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi were employed as climatic factors domestic dom electricity generation elec irrigation irr livestock liv manufacturing mfg and mining min related water withdrawals are mainly made from shallow groundwater and surface water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs which are critical factors associated with the hydrological cycle and are thus tightly linked to sm condon et al 2020 erler et al 2019 these water withdrawals are recognized as human factors the correlation between these factors and sm variability was explored this paper is structured as follows section 2 introduces the study regions and data resources used in the current study data preprocessing correlation calculation and causality analysis methods are also included in this section section 3 describes the spatial temporal dynamics of multi depth sm in china and the relationships between sm and the above mentioned factors in section 4 currently practiced water resource regulation related measures that may affect sm variation as well as uncertainty factors are further discussed and conclusions that can be drawn from this study are stated in section 5 2 the study region data resources and methodology 2 1 study region the territory of china spans between 73 e 135 e from east to west and 4 n 53 n from north to south fig 1 because spatial resolution of the dataset used in this study is unified to 0 1 0 1 about 100 km2 the island areas less than one pixel were not taken into consideration the vegetation coverage shows a decline from forest to shrubland savanna cropland grassland and barren land and from the southeast coast to the west north inland fig 1 correspondingly the climate gradually turns from humid semi humid to monsoon and semi arid arid as the terrain gradually becomes higher human activity intensity decreases 2 2 data resources as the successor of era interim era5 land provides a consistent view of water and energy cycles from 1950 onwards by combining model data with observations from across the world https cds climate copernicus eu muñoz sabater et al 2021 the native resolution of the published products is 9 km which is greatly enhanced compared to the 31 km spatial resolution of era5 and the dataset is updated monthly with a lapse of 2 3 months the four layer sm product layer 1 0 7 cm layer 2 7 28 cm layer 3 28 100 cm layer 4 100 289 cm of the era5 land was used for dynamics related analyses accordingly the four layer st p and et were chosen as related climatic factors in view of the inseparable interaction between sm and vegetation the global inventory modeling mapping studies gimms ndvi product https iridl ldeo columbia edu renowned for its lengthy time series and reliable quality was also employed as a climatic factor pinzon and tucker 2014 the spatialized global monthly human water withdrawals originate from the statistics of the food and agriculture organization fao aquastat and us geological survey usgs https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1209296 huang et al 2018 country level statistics were downscaled to grid level using spatial downscaling algorithms next linear interpolation was employed to acquire annual data from the 5 year interval reports finally a temporal downscaling algorithm was applied to obtain the monthly gridded dataset irrigation withdrawal in particular was estimated using four types of global hydrological models including watergap lpjml h08 and pcr globwb in this study simple arithmetic means of the four estimates were utilized to reflect irrigation withdrawals additionally landcover patterns may be greatly impacted by innate climate properties and human activities hence the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis landcover product mcd12c1 was adopted to detect any potential association between landcover and sm dynamics friedl et al 2002 basic information on the above mentioned datasets with detailed references are listed table 1 2 3 methodology 1 preprocessing all datasets were unified at a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 in accordance with the era5 land products usage stipulations the gimms ndvi was simply upscaled by calculating the arithmetic average within each 0 1 0 1 grid while the maximum value composite method was used to obtain the monthly product the dominant landcover type was selected to present upscaled mcd12c1 data in regard to human water withdrawals bilinear interpolation was used to realize the downscaling procedure furthermore these datasets were processed to the same spatial reference as well as spatial extent in order to maintain consistency between each other 2 trend analysis sm as well as climatic factors may show regular seasonal fluctuations in term of the regional climate rhythm hence it necessary to remove intra annual changes which allows the general trend of each parameter to be explicitly displayed and any possible correlation between two parameters to be explored from a long term perspective therefore the moving average was adopted to calculate the temporal variation trend by subtracting the moving average of anterior months as follows 1 m o v i n g a v e r a g e t x t 11 t where x t 11 t is the moving average of the target long time series parameters during the period from the time of t 11 to t here time is calculated on a monthly basis in order to clarify the association between multi layer sm and various factors the interaction among them was systematically analyzed using the correlation coefficient r and granger causality analysis r is a classical index that quantitatively depicts the degree of linear correlation between two parameters r values range from 1 to 1 where r 0 indicates a positive correlation and r 0 indicates a negative correlation the closer the absolute value is to 1 the higher the correlation comparatively granger causality is a simple non linear but effective statistical hypothesis test that can be used to determine whether the time series of a given variable is useful for forecasting another one it was developed by the nobel laureate clive w j granger in 1969 granger 1969 this causality indicator has been widely applied in economic and political fields since its inception dutta 2001 freeman 1983 kónya 2006 earth system science related studies have started using it in recent years papagiannopoulou et al 2017 wuebbles et al 2017 the equations for r and the granger causality test are displayed as follows 2 r x y c o v x y v a r x v a r y where cov x y is the covariance of x and y v a r x and v a r y are the variance of x and y respectively 3 x t i 1 n a i x t i i 1 n b i y t i ε t 4 y t i 1 n c i y t i i 1 n d i x t i η t where x t and y t are the time series of two parameters n is the sample capacity a i b i c i and d i are regression coefficients and ε t and η t are white noise it is noted that both the time series interrelationship and the autocorrelation of the two target parameters are evaluated using granger causality analysis besides a f test is used to determine whether the granger causality hypothesis is tenable usually set f 0 05 or 0 1 if the estimation of y t can be remarkably improved by taking x t into consideration compared to merely using the past y t values then that would indicate that past values of x t exert a statistically significant effect on the current values of y t and vice versa in addition the 95 significance test was performed to ensure the reliability of the calculated results 3 results 3 1 spatial temporal multi depth dynamics 3 1 1 covariations of sm and st spatial sm variation across china was evidently unbalanced during the 1950 2020 period fig 2 in terms of different sm variation levels table 2 although most areas 70 exhibited inconspicuous variation the drying and wetting regions were considered to be nonnegligible due to the possibility that the available soil water content could have exerted a far reaching effect on the local ecosystem the drying region was mainly located in north china and central northeast china which exhibit a typically flat terrain and a temperate monsoon climate meanwhile as the intensity of human activities such as domestic farming and industrial activities keep increasing the accompanying increase in water withdrawal as well as consumption may inevitably lower the water table reduce surface water and exacerbate sm loss as one of the most populous regions affected by water scarcity in china continuous overexploitation of groundwater and expansion of irrigated agriculture would lead to a serious water crisis in this area kang and eltahir 2018 xing et al 2013 furthermore due to the effects exerted by a warming climate the influence of potential evapotranspiration on sm may become prominent li et al 2021c comparatively the wetting region which extends along the mountains kunlun 5 500 6 000 m on average and tianshan 4 000 m on average exhibits steep terrains and climate altitudinal belts the wetting region contains one of the largest glacier areas in china yang et al 1996 given that these trackless mountains exit far from human activity except for the occasional scientific expedition it is possible that the prevailing tendency towards a surplus of soil water is largely induced by climatic factors evidently the extent of drought expanded from 22 45 to 25 95 with growing depth while the drought level strengthened from 0 008 m3 m3 per decade to 0 013 m3 m3 per decade however the wetting region shrank from 4 15 to 3 02 and the degree of co wetting decreased from 0 009 m3 m3 per decade to 0 004 m3 m3 per decade at the same time the 70 year temporal sequences explicitly demonstrated variation trends in different regions although phased fluctuations appeared to be prevalent the overall trend could easily be observed from a long term perspective as depth increased the average soil water content of the wetting region steadily caught up with and surpassed that of the drying region additionally the momentary fluctuation degree became significantly moderate preliminarily as depth increased indicating the sensitivity of surface soil to land atmosphere interactions and the impervious feature of deep layer soil this phenomenon was further verified on a monthly scale fig 3 and variability across months apparently turned from distinct to vague as depth grew the stability of deep layer soil has similarly been acknowledged by previous studies focusing on sm variability in the mongolian plateau meng et al 2022 as well as in illinois usa wu et al 2002 in terms of the different soil water holding capacities if every soil layer intercepted some part of water during its downward transportation through soil pores then less water would be obtained and a smaller amplitude would be exhibited as depth increases the sm of the wetting region continuously increased throughout the year due to seasonal snow melt and p fig 3 the least wetting trend appeared in may when melting of snow was nearing its end and p was yet to come simultaneously the drying region maintained consistency and showed a relatively strong tendency in spring and autumn when the winter wheat and corn in northern china begin to elongate a relatively insignificant trend was seen in june when wheat as well as early season rice in north china plain was just being harvested and the grass on the hulun buir grassland had just begun to grow the spatial distribution of multi depth st fig 4 indicated that the correlation between the variability of sm and st was generally negative the spatial scope of warming and cooling areas were basically in accordance with that of the drying and wetting regions respectively china underwent a universal multi depth st increase of 0 16 per decade on average during the past 70 years under a background of global warming with respect to different change levels table 3 as soil depth increased the scope of the significantly warming region was progressively enlarged from 27 07 to 30 29 along with an increasing degree of serious warming from 0 29 per decade to 0 31 per decade in comparison both the scope ranging from 1 26 to 1 47 and varying degree 0 01 per decade of the cooling region remained mostly stable the distribution of st declining trend was basically in accordance with the extent of the wetting region the abnormal cooling process was mainly due to the falling average temperature in summer azam et al 2018 cogley 2011 gardelle et al 2012 temporal dynamics fig 4 and the monthly variation trends fig 5 revealed that the degree of monthly as well as interannual st fluctuations showed a gradual and mild tendency as depth increased which coincided with the degree of vertical sm variation such uniformity may shed light on the consistent spatial temporal water heat covariation in soil as substantiated by the findings of a previous study li et al 2020a however different layers did diverge for warming regions the notable increasing period of layer 1 0 7 cm and layer 2 7 28 cm was in spring mar apr and may whereas the peak increasing period of layers 3 and 4 were gradually delayed until summer and autumn respectively with respect to cooling regions the cooling trend mostly lasted from mar to sep followed by varying degrees of warming up from oct to feb of the next year the changes in surface st were caused by solar radiation molecular conduction latent heat exchange convection and turbulence while vertical st variability was mainly due to heat conduction during the process of downward heat transfer each soil layer would retain some part of the heat hence the deeper the soil the less heat it would receive and the smaller the increase in temperature probability density function pdf curves were drawn to intuitively display the sm value distribution in 1950 and 2020 the multi depth sm values corresponding to maximum percent probability in the drying region evidently declined from approximately 0 3 to 0 25 m3 m3 during 1950 2020 fig 6 with increasing depth the sm corresponding to maximum percent probability in the wetting region ranged from approximately 0 16 to 0 31 m3 m3 in 1950 however in 2020 as depth increased from the surface layer to the bottom layer the peak sms corresponding to maximum percent probability increased visibly ranging between approximately 0 24 and 0 34 m3 m3 moreover there were noticeable differences between the wetting and drying regions across the four layers in 1950 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the drying region orange was higher than that for the wetting one light blue at layer 1 fig 6 a meanwhile the gap between peak sm values of the pdf curves for the wetting and drying regions kept shrinking with increasing depth and in 1950 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the drying region was finally surpassed by that for the wetting region at layer 4 fig 6 d in comparison in 2020 the peak sm value of the pdf curve for the wetting region blue exceeded that of the drying region red at layer 2 preliminarily demonstrating that the drying trend accelerated with increasing depth during 1950 and 2020 3 1 2 landcover based sm variability analysis surface soil is commonly covered with vegetation vegetation growth is deeply affected by the availability of soil water on the one hand soil water deficit may lead to plant wilting while on the other hand excessive sm may result in root rot the variability of sm may be influenced by vegetation as well vegetation absorbs water from the soil for respiration and transpiration purposes effectively reducing sm thereby however vegetation conserves soil and water by preventing rapid evaporation and restraining desertification thus a relationship characterized by a tight and mutually bidirectional feedback exists between sm and vegetation brockett et al 2012 landcover data was used to explore the link between the variation in sm and vegetation firstly the urban built up lands and water bodies were filtered out then the 14 original landcover types were reclassified as forest shrubland savannas grassland cropland permanent snow and ice and barren table 4 different landcover trends were observed in regions displaying sm variation during 2001 2020 table 5 due to the nourishment afforded by adequate soil water supplies the percentage of grassland consistently increased in the wetting region suggesting widespread greening for kunlun and tianshan mountains a previous study revealed that greening of the arctic was associated with warming accompanied by permafrost thaw and snowmelt myers smith et al 2020 however the findings of our investigations indicated that greening trends may also be triggered by ample soil water supplies despite stable or slightly declining temperatures thereby providing new avenues for analyzing the association between vegetation and climate change in general permanent snow and ice increased slowly due to a slightly cooling tendency and the barren area shrank accordingly comparatively speaking in densely populated areas human intervention acts as one of the leading factors affecting time series landcover pattern in drying regions the drying region roughly comprises the north china plain the northeast china plain the sanjiang plain and the guanzhong plain which are the main wheat corn peanut and cotton producing areas original uncultivated land was reclaimed little by little to feed 1 4 billion people as well as to guarantee national food security simultaneously the three north shelter belts forest project was initiated here to improve the ecological environment reduce natural disasters and maintain living space li et al 2021a therefore the maintenance of forest and cropland increased while savannas grassland and barren regions were neglected the demand for soil water rose quickly because artificial irrigation could satisfy plant growth requirements only temporarily therefore the continuous imbalance between water demand and supply may have led to a deficit in sm the proportion of cropland in the stable region was far less than that in the drying region indicating substantially less irrigation water requirements the forest proportion rose from 11 07 to 13 05 during 2001 2020 afforestation may directly cause an increase in local et thereby giving rise to a reduction in available water resources including sm nevertheless parts of the evaporated water would nourish the downwind region in the form of p via an enhanced water cycle in turn p and available water resources in nearby downwind regions may be indirectly boosted hoek van dijke et al 2022 3 2 analysis of climatic factors 3 2 1 correlation analysis apart from st we chose p et and ndvi as the three mainly correlated climatic factors that needed to be investigated for their role in the spatiotemporal variability shown by sm p in the wetting region and southeast china showed a rising trend while p in the area that was mainly distributed in the drying region central and southwest china showed a declining trend fig 7 a furthermore from a temporal variation perspective both rising and declining trends were prominent in the summer fig 8 a b wherein p was predominantly regulated by the summer monsoon in an area where the sm drying region was roughly located et showed a conspicuously increasing trend which was possibly jointly induced by a declining p and a greening tendency the remaining part of et showed a generally decreasing trend especially in the wetting region the periods of et change were largely focused on their own growing seasons fig 8 e f the major area showing a greening trend was situated in eastern china an area naturally suitable for plant growth wherein continuous reclamation and afforestation had taken places during the past 70 years in comparison the greening area in western china was mainly located in the tianshan and the altai mountains where p as well as available soil water contents increased steadily overall a greening trend was clearly observable throughout china fig 8 j especially in the spring and autumn with particular reference to the elongation stage of winter wheat and early season rice and the elongation stage of corn and late rice respectively therefore it may be concluded that the drying region was accompanied by a rising st an increasing et a declining p and a greening trend whereas the wetting region was accompanied by a decreasing st a falling et an increasing p and a rising ndvi in order to intuitively discover their linkage the spatial distribution of the correlation between the temporal trends of multi layer sm and climatic factors is depicted fig 9 the correlation between monthly sm and st trends was generally negative heat transfer triggered by temperature differences among multi layers and air namely the sensible heat flux uses water as the energy carrier flanagan and johnson 2005 the rate of specific heat transfers depended on different atmospheric conditions and soil components sm evaporation was an effective way to reduce st besides st showed a notable negative correlation with sm which was due to the decline in viscosity and surface tension of water caused by increasing temperature therefore at constant water potential higher temperatures are associated with lower soil water contents the relationship between p and sm was hardly observable in areas where st and sm were positively correlated p and irr were the two main sources that nourished soil significantly p exhibited a primarily positive association with multi layer sm across china due to interception by upper layer soil its degree of relevance continuously declined with increasing depth a declining correlation was also reflected by et the extent of positive correlation was mainly confined to the croplands grasslands and barren lands of the arid semi arid monsoon climate regions fig 9 a d in the areas showing a negative correlation there was a lack of water supply as an enhanced et process driven by the warming trend slowly drained the water from soil in comparison the region showing a positive correlation was basically located in the yangtze river basin as well as the northeast border of china where the predominant landcover type was forest and grassland long lasting p in the spring and summer of the yangtze river basin sufficiently nourishes soil and vegetation resulting in a simultaneously increasing sm and et the yangtze river basin which is rich in water resources provides approximately 50 of the runoff and 40 of the fresh water resources in china duan et al 2018 xu et al 2022 compared to the above mentioned factors there was a rather weak relationship between the trends shown by ndvi and sm the central and southeast parts exhibited a negative relationship r 0 3 while a positively associated trend r 0 3 was seen in the northeast northwest and southwest parts this suggested the possible existence of a nonlinear and obscure relationship between the variation in vegetation and sm caused by the complicated nature of their interactions 3 2 2 causality analysis in view of the limitations of linear correlation analysis the granger causality analysis with max lag time of 2 months was used to further explore the relationship between multi layer sm and climatic factors the extent of the causal relationship between multi layer sm and corresponding st was found to gradually increase with depth at the top layer the causally linked regions which were located in southwest central and northeast china accounted for 43 67 in total fig 10 a d however the extent constantly grew to reach 66 59 when depth rose to layer 4 simultaneously the area showing a bidirectional causality relationship rose to 22 36 indicating that water heat covariation was enhanced as depth grew there was always a higher proportion of st being the unidirectional cause of sm than sm being the unidirectional cause of st furthermore st is regarded as the dominant factor that determines sm variation at mid high latitudes li et al 2021b niu and yang 2006 p which is one of the most influential and direct water sources of soil shows a causal relationship with sm the coverage with p sm causality steadily expanded from 48 4 to 55 53 as the depth increased the ratio that the dynamics of p was regarded as the granger reason of sm variability was also boosted from 32 58 to 52 9 simultaneously further verifying the crucial role played by p in sm variability despite the ratio which indicated that sm was the unidirectional cause of p was much less than the one indicating the opposite numerous studies have focused on analyzing the effect of sm on p koster et al 2003 who analyzed a 50 year observational precipitation dataset covering the united states were the first to find evidence that sm anomalies induced by p may subsequently affect p itself further studies conducted by koster et al 2004 demonstrated that sm anomalies exert a substantial effect on p during boreal summer based on koster s framework yang et al 2018 observed a prevalently positive sm p feedback over land although a non negligible negative feedback did occur in the dry and wet regions due to varying climatic conditions total et which is defined as the accumulated amount of water including bare soil and vegetation that evaporates from earth s surface was employed in this study a predominantly bidirectional causality relationship exists between the dynamics of et and surface layer sm nevertheless as depth rose the dominant position was assumed in a degree by degree manner by et which acted as the unidirectional cause of sm comparatively the variation of et uniformly affected the sm pattern across all layers while the feedback from sm to et sharply declined with increasing depth illustrating the dominance of et and top layer sm in sm et mutual responses for decades much effort has been devoted to analyze the interaction between sm and et chanzy and bruckler 1993 delworth and manabe 1988 philip 1957 vargas zeppetello et al 2019 culminating in the conclusion that et was limited by sm in dry regions positively correlated and by radiation energy in the wet region negatively correlated since vegetation related conditions are easily impacted by many climatic and human factors the proportion that showed a significant causal link between ndvi and sm steadily increased as the soil depth increased fig 10 m p this tendency revealed that root zone sm maybe a more competent indicator of vegetation growth than surface sm moreover regions where ndvi was susceptible to sm were mostly located in northern and southern china on the one hand soil water deficit appears to be the main limiting factor affecting vegetation based photosynthesis in northern china while on the other hand it appears that excessive sm caused by continuous p may directly lead to a deterioration in soil aeration as well as root anoxia in southern china furthermore the region where ndvi could effectively influence sm was located in the southern part where vast forest lands favored the retention of water in the northern part the root zone sm expressed higher sensitivity to ndvi than the surface ones 3 3 human factor analysis 3 3 1 correlation analysis in this study we used the spatialized water withdrawals by dom elec irr liv mfg and min during 1971 2010 to investigate the correlation between human water use factors and multi layer sm the results indicated that changes had mainly occurred in the densely populated southeast fig 11 the industrial boom associated with the promulgation of a series of economic policies and the advent of new technologies brought about a rapid increase in mfg and min resulting in soaring water consumption rapid growth of the industrial complex created a huge demand for elec a large amount of water was required for fuel extraction processing and power generation thermal power being the mainstream power source in china is one of the most water consuming power generation technologies according to recent reports water consumption by the power industry accounts for nearly 12 of the total water intake in china gao et al 2018 besides persistent population growth 0 85 billion in 1971 and 1 34 billion in 2010 as well as urbanization urbanization rate surged from 17 26 to 49 95 during the 1971 2010 period continues to accelerate dom water withdrawal accordingly these remarkable increasing trends were concentrated in urban agglomerations such as the beijing tianjin hebei urban agglomeration the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area urban agglomerations in the middle reaches of the yangtze river and the chengdu chongqing urban agglomeration by contrast water withdrawal for agricultural purposes displayed a different pattern agriculture being the largest water user in china accounted for 61 26 of the total water consumption in 2010 china 2020 the irr water withdrawal pattern showed a notable decreasing trend in the north china and a slightly increasing trend in southern china in addition a previous study reported that the national irr water use coefficient defined as the proportion of irr water used by crops was increasing in eastern and northern regions than in the western and southern regions respectively li et al 2020b this study further revealed that shandong province had the highest coefficient which basically coincided with the extent of the decrease in the east fig 11 c liv water withdrawal showed a widespread declining trend except in some areas of shandong province and the guangxi zhuang autonomous region as with the climatic factors the monthly variation trends of human water use data fig 12 exhibited regular patterns which evolved in accordance with seasonal rhythms usually both dom and elec peak in the summer since the hot weather increases the demand for showering and air conditioning further investigation indicated that the peaks of the increasing trends shown by dom and elec also emerged in summer from jun to aug the predominantly decreasing trend of irr occurred in may and june especially in the drying region may represents the crucial wheat filling stage during which a sufficient water supply would boost the setting percentage grain number per spike and content of wheat protein maize is sown in the summer and thus june becomes the critical month for irrigation if a favorable emergence rate is desired in comparison the variation trends of liv mfg and min remained stable across months due to their insensitivity to climatic conditions we calculated the correlation coefficients corresponding to the association between the dynamics of human water use factors and sm for every grid during the 1971 2010 period and drew spatial distribution patterns to explore their potential connections fig 13 human water withdrawals were mainly made from shallow groundwater and surface water sources such as rivers lakes and reservoirs industrial related water use including dom elec mfg and min displayed roughly coincident spatial characteristics with the depth increasing the absolute values of the correlation coefficients continued to grow with increasing depth implying that deep layer sm could be more susceptible to water intake than surface sm moreover the correlation in central and eastern china was significantly negative in the negatively correlated region plants with long roots such as shrubs and trees easily perceived sm deficits caused by the rapidly rising trend of industrial related water withdrawal by contrast a positive correlation was observed in the western arid inland area although this region is renowned for abundant glacier water resources the available water supply is seriously restricted by climatic factors such as p and temperature hence water consumption levels may be seriously affected by the amount of available water in terms of agricultural water withdrawal the dynamics of sm and irr gradually became weakly negatively correlated as depth increased irr was used to relieve sm deficit as also to supply the water required for plant growth in croplands the drier the soil the greater the amount of irr required the most remarkably negative correlation was observed in the surface layer and the weak trend seen may have been due to water interception in the vertical direction similar to the correlation pattern observed between industrial water withdrawal and sm the correlation pattern between liv and sm also showed a tendency to strengthen with increasing depth the positively correlated region was widely distributed in the southern western and central northeastern china while the negative correlated region was concentrated in inner mongolia and northeastern china 3 3 2 causality analysis because it is difficult to prove the interaction between artificial water usage and sm via correlation analysis alone the granger causality analysis was used to conduct further investigations industrial related water withdrawal including dom elec mfg and min and layer 1 4 sm in the causally linked regions across china displayed a gradually expanding trend as the depth increased fig 14 however it appeared that the region industrial water usage being the granger cause of sm dynamics expanded from northeast to east china the region in which sm could be regarded as the unidirectional cause of irr was mostly located in the southeast coastal area of china which area displayed a typical subtropical monsoon climate with abundant p numerous rivers and many water resources during the long hot summers moist soils remarkably reduce the requirement of irr by contrast irr was the most effective way to relieve sm deficit and meet the water demands of crops in the northern regions which lack sufficient p liv was also seen as a granger cause of sm variability and its responding region gradually enlarged from scattered to east and northwest china as depth increased overall although causality relationships were detected between various types of human water withdrawal and multi layer sm the proportions human water withdrawal causing the variation of sm were less than those detected between climatic factors and multi layer sm this is due to most artificial water withdrawals from surface water bodies or shallow ground water sources impacting the soil water content either directly or indirectly however climatic factors may directly and noticeably affect sm by regulating water supply and consumption 4 discussion sm which is one of the most important indicators of agricultural drought directly affects the physical and chemical qualities of soil and vegetation growth which in turn significantly influence grain yields in china given the strategic and irreplaceable role played by sm in ensuring national food security a detailed investigation into the spatial temporal variability of sm across china under the overwhelming global warming trend may be considered imperative this study comprehensively analyzed the multi layer sm fluctuation patterns during 1950 2020 and detected a primarily imbalanced variation trend which showed overall drying and regional wetting tendencies furthermore in this study we explored the degree of correlation and causality between sm dynamics and climatic and human factors in an attempt to clarify the key driving factors that cause sm variation and identify underlying mechanisms additionally the association between sm and these factors were also retroactively analyzed to obtain a better understanding of their interactions the sm drying trend was widespread across most regions of china especially in north china and central northeast china which were major grain producing areas with intense human activity activities of the three north shelter belts forest project and land reclamation led to a steady expansion of forests as well as croplands in the region exhibiting sm drying during the 2001 2020 period thus the soil water demand in this region was remarkably increased compared to that in the original savanna grassland and barren land cover types simultaneously a downward trend in p and an upward trend in st were clearly observed rising temperature led to a higher vapor pressure deficit and an evaporative demand resulting in a corresponding increase in et in terms of anthropogenic factors domestic agricultural and industrial water withdrawals continued to grow with rapid economic development consequently sm decreased under the combined effect of increasingly insufficient water supplementation and growing multi source water requirements furthermore it was found that the deep soil layer expressed a much higher degree of drought than did the surface one which may be caused by water saving technology induced decline in irrigation amount per unit area zhu et al 2022 investigated the relative evolution of in situ sm at various agricultural stations across china between 1992 and 2012 they found that relative sm exhibited a long term decreasing trend in temperate continental climate zones and that this trend was driven by both climatic and agricultural management activities specifically sm declined significantly during the crop growing season liu et al 2015b fertilizer application and proliferation of water expensive crops e g maize contributed to rising et and drying soil individually additionally li et al 2022 predicted that an increasing vegetation transpiration ratio induced by warming climates and prolonged growing seasons would continuously intensify sm loss over the semiarid and subhumid regions of china for the period 2015 2100 the severe sm loss patterns has been recognized and much effort is being made to alleviate sm deficits technical progress and an enhanced awareness of the importance of saving water has resulted in a continuously improving national irrigation water use coefficient li et al 2020b the grain for green program devoted to converting sloping croplands into forest and preventing soil erosion was initiated in 1999 feng et al 2005 this program has made an irreplaceably important contribution towards increasing forest coverage and restoring the ecosystem however compared to retaining original croplands or grasslands savannas the introduction of deep rooted trees may further aggravate the deep layer sm deficit and exacerbate drying trends yang et al 2022 a previous study has suggested that afforestation may consume more water in china s arid and semi arid regions where available sm is the key limiting resource cao et al 2018 it further suggested that picking up and planting drought tolerant tree species would result in an improvement in both ecosystem and sm variation trends in the future besides it is necessary to evaluate the long term sustainability and effectiveness of the measures that have been taken already a previous study has revealed that agricultural production in india would be ensured by the 2030 s via an adequate irrigation strategy however by the 2080 s irrigation adaptation alone would be insufficient to compensate for the severe effects exerted by climatic warming trends unless strong worldwide climate change mitigation or vegetation climate adaptation evolution could be introduced droppers et al 2022 despite the progress that has been achieved some uncertainty regarding issues that may affect these achievements lingers on firstly apart from the above mentioned climatic and human factors many other factors such as atmospheric rivers liang et al 2023 snowmelt bales et al 2011 and water transfer project liu and zheng 2002 that are closely associated with sm dynamics may need further exploration however it may be difficult to quantify some of these factors as well as their impact on sm secondly many climatic and human factors jointly and simultaneously contribute to the fluctuation of sm further increasing the complexity of sm patterns additionally an almost century long effort has gone into developing a numerical model equation of sm richards 1931 the era5 land model which benefited from a decade of developments in model physics core dynamics and data assimilation has been acknowledged for providing a state of the art global land reanalysis dataset hersbach et al 2020 muñoz sabater et al 2021 however current information on the effects exerted by the disturbances caused by intensified human activities on land surface should be expanded and quantified since multi depth sm and climatic parameters originate mostly from era5 land products a certain degree of inherent relevance and systematic bias could inevitably exist among these products specifically the accuracy of era5 land et was evaluated comprehensively during 2001 2014 and era5 land et showed overall good performance against in situ measurements muñoz sabater et al 2021 however the reliable reference sites were mainly distributed across the continental us europe and australia and the error increased at high altitude sites according to a previous study exploring the long term et in northern china using averaged et from era5 land and other six datasets it was found that et increased significantly from 1982 to 2017 su et al 2022 although the et could be remarkably correlated to p the increasing trend of p was insignificant which suggested that there appeared inconsistency between long terms et and p under the warming climate therefore future work should be focused on using multi source and mutually independent datasets to objectively investigate the variation pattern and mechanism of sm 5 conclusions in this study we analyzed the spatial temporal variation patterns of multi depth sm that were jointly driven by climatic and human factors during the past decades in china the dynamics of sm displayed varying degrees in the background of a generally warming trend the significantly drying region was located mostly in north china and central northeast china while the wetting region was concentrated in the kunlun and tianshan mountains while the drought level in the drying region increased steadily with increasing depth the degree of dampness in the wetting region shrank gradually since roughly one quarter of the drying region comprised croplands where root zone sm appeared to be more crucial for plant growth than surface sm an urgent need for sufficient and sustainable soil water supplies that ensure food security has emerged correlation and granger causality analyses indicate that p and et may be the dominant climatic factors driving the variability of multi depth sm and that the effects exerted by these factors may gradually decline with increasing depth due to interception by upper soil layers feedback between sm and climatic factors was detected revealing their close interaction intense human water withdrawal activities play an important role in influencing the variation patterns of sm the correlation between human factors and sm grows continuously with increasing depth except for irr implying that deep layer sm is susceptible to activities associated with water intake consequently the dual impact of climatic and human factors leads to complicated multi layer sm changes in china thus the findings of this study may expectedly boost the understanding of sm patterns in china and provide a reference for the future exploration usage and management of sm credit authorship contribution statement yangxiaoyue liu
