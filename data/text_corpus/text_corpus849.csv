4245,precipitation is an important component of the global water cycle a comprehensive understanding of precipitation characteristics especially that in urban areas is essential for practical applications in hydrology era5 a state of the art reanalysis product with wide temporal coverage as well as fine spatial and temporal resolution has greater potential to reproduce precipitation than many other products however how era5 precipitation performs has not been well investigated in urban areas therefore we evaluate and compare the ability of two era5 products era5 land and era5 hres in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba using observations from over 3000 rain gauges in a high density network during 2018 the results show that era5 products generally characterize moderate intensity rain due to the different causes of seasonal precipitation as well as the combined influence of coastal effects and topography the best performance of era5 products is found in the southern coastal plains during the wet season and in the northern mountainous vegetation areas during the dry season meanwhile it is challenging for era5 products to model precipitation in areas with higher urbanization levels we also find that era5 land data with finer spatial resolution fails to deliver any preferable results than era5 hres era5 products needs further improvement in the gba for providing accurate precipitation patterns this paper gives a detailed insight into the performance of era5 products which offers a valuable reference for its probable applicability in the coastal urban areas keywords era5 precipitation evaluation urban areas 1 introduction precipitation is the most essential water input to the near surface water circulation system and is an important factor that would affect regional water resource conditions kucera et al 2013 understanding the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of precipitation is the prerequisite for various applications such as agricultural management disaster prevention ecological monitoring and public health management kirschbaum et al 2017 serrat capdevila et al 2014 tapiador et al 2012 in the context of global climate change it is essential to obtain accurate and timely precipitation information at high spatio temporal resolution especially in urban areas where usually suffer more casualties and losses in disasters such as floods due to the high population densities and active economies zhang et al 2015c reliable information on precipitation can provide effective support for flood prediction and prevention hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 nguyen and bae 2020 wang et al 2019 nevertheless accurate estimation of precipitation remains a challenge due to the discontinuity and high variability of precipitation in time and space stephens et al 2010 herold et al 2016 ground network of rain gauges is a conventional and the only way to measure precipitation directly de leeuw et al 2015 and the observations are usually accurate however the accuracy of ground measurements would still be affected by factors like wind evaporation human operation and instrument degradation fallah et al 2020 haiden et al 2011 in addition the spatial distribution and density of rain gauges vary considerably from region to region with marine and remote areas having limited gauges zhang et al 2020 making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous precipitation information to overcome the disadvantage of rain gauges distributing spatially discretely some researchers have performed spatial interpolation on gauge observations to obtain continuous precipitation fields nearest neighbor algorithm creutin and obled 1982 stow 2002 inverse distance weights creutin and obled 1982 simanton and osborn 1980 kriging li et al 2018 lloyd 2005 zhang et al 2015a zimmerman et al 1999 spline functions hutchinson 1998a hutchinson 1998b hutchinson 1995 and other traditional methods are widely used but their interpolation accuracy can be further improved as they rely only on the idea of spatial autocorrelation or spatial smooth continuity for this concern regression models that can describe the relationship between precipitation and other relevant auxiliary factors have been developed for interpolation such as the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2002 daly et al 2003 and geographically weighted regression gwr brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 2001 with the development of earth observation data transmission and computing technologies it is possible to collect continuous precipitation information through remote sensing this kind of precipitation estimates are mainly derived from ground based global positioning system gps ground based weather radars and satellites benefiting from the ability to detect rainfall accurately across wide spatial ranges in all weather conditions satellite based methods are major remote sensing approaches to observe precipitation over large areas currently based on the huge amount of data accumulated by the global meteorological satellite network continuous precipitation can be acquired by visible infrared inversion arkin and meisner 1987 ba and gruber 2001 griffith et al 1978 xie and arkin 1997 active or passive microwave inversion collins et al 2001 ferraro 1997 iguchi et al 2000 and multi sensor joint inversion huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 numerical simulation is also a means to gain precipitation information which can directly generate temporally and spatially continuous maps of precipitation distribution at global and regional scales global climate models gcms build climate system equations from the thermodynamic and fluid kinematic characteristics of the climate system and provide the most advanced tool for simulating continuous global precipitation schiermeier 2010 nested applied with regional climate models rcms gcms can also offer good precipitation estimates in regional climate change analysis giorgi and mearns 1999 reanalysis one of the typical model based approaches produces field data with a minimal error by assimilating quality controlled meteorological observations from multiple sources with simulated data from numerical weather prediction models nowadays diverse reanalysis precipitation products have been widely used such as japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2014 saha et al 2010 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis interim era interim dee et al 2011 etc as the fifth generation of atmosphere reanalysis dataset released by the european center for medium term weather forecasting ecmwf era5 is one of the state of the art reanalysis products in production since 2016 herold et al 2016 the 1950 onward era5 hourly data was officially released on the copernicus climate change services c3s climate data store cds in january 2019 hersbach et al 2019 era5 provides global hourly estimations of 265 variables such as precipitation temperature and humidity with a horizontal resolution of 31 km and 9 km for ocean waves and dedicated land products respectively hersbach et al 2020 compared to era interim era5 has higher spatio temporal resolution a better 4d var data assimilation scheme a more recent forecasting model more output parameters and 3 hourly uncertainty information as a result the estimations of era5 are significantly improved hersbach et al 2020 with its advantages of wide temporal coverage and fine resolution era5 has high application values in many fields however a thorough understanding of the performance of era5 is essential before it is practically applied since the release of era5 several researchers have evaluated the performance of its precipitation products using rain gauge data in different regions to support its application beck et al 2019 compared era5 and other 25 products including era interim at daily scale in the continental united states the results revealed that era5 properly captures the variability of precipitation and exhibits markedly better accuracy than era interim but improvements are needed in regions with complex topography and high precipitation heterogeneity beck et al 2019 a comparison of era interim and era5 at monthly scale in the mountainous regions of central asia found that era5 is capable of capturing precipitation trends but inadequate in estimating magnitudes zandler et al 2019 tang et al 2020 compared era5 and nine other satellite based or reanalysis products at daily and hourly scales in china it showed that although era5 performs well at daily scale it has difficulty in reproducing the peak precipitation time magnitude and variation of the diurnal cycle at hourly scale similar studies have also been conducted in iran india turkey australia and north american amjad et al 2020 feng et al 2021 kolluru et al 2020 sharifi et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 xu et al 2019 yazdandoost et al 2020 these studies generally agree that era5 is capable of detecting rainfall events and reproducing the spatio temporal distribution but overestimates precipitation in most cases several researchers also point out that the performance degrades in areas with complex topography nonetheless evaluation studies of era5 precipitation products are not yet comprehensive firstly existing studies mainly focus on non urban areas while few evaluations have been conducted specifically for urban areas in fact urban areas have a greater need for timely accurate precipitation information with wide spatio temporal coverage to aid in better city management development planning and disaster prevention so it is necessary to understand the performance of era5 in urban areas secondly most evaluations are carried out for the 31 km era5 hres dataset and very few studies have assessed the 9 km era5 land with higher spatial resolution and finer precipitation distribution details era5 land has greater potential to support urban applications than era5 hres and many other gridded products thus it is important to fill the gap of evaluation on era5 land in addition limited by various factors such as gauge data acquisition interval most current studies are based on daily or coarser temporal scales and the performance of era5 at sub daily scales needs to be further understood the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba a typical large urban agglomeration is one of the most open and economically vibrant regions in china it is located in the coastal region of southern china and is frequently affected by disasters such as torrential rain typhoon and flood which makes high quality precipitation information critically necessary there is a high density rain gauge network in the gba which can be used to evaluate era5 precipitation products and provide a good insight into the performance of era5 in coastal urban areas therefore this paper chooses a local region in the south central guangdong province of china which includes the gba as the study area to evaluate the performance of era5 at multiple spatial and temporal scales in 2018 the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate and compare the overall ability of era5 including 9 km era5 land and 31 km era5 hres to capture rainfall events and estimate precipitation at regional and multiple temporal hourly and daily scales 2 to analyze the performance of era5 products under different land cover types especially urban 3 to assess the performance of era5 products in different parts of the study area at the grid scale to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first study to evaluate the performance of era5 in an urban area based on a high density ground based rain gauge network it not only presents the first assessment of era5 land s ability to model precipitation but also provides insight into the performance differences between the two different spatial resolution era5 precipitation products it offers information on the error characteristics of era5 in coastal urban areas contributing to the probable rational applications of era5 in urban disaster prevention and city management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area in order to make full use of the local gauge observations and to better analyze the performance differences of era5 in urban and non urban areas the study area is defined as a local region fig 1 in the south central guangdong province of southeastern china covering a total area of 291 926 58 km2 between 110 116 e and 21 25 n the gba is included within this region fig 1 a the region has an elevation in the range of 10 1921 m with a mountainous and high hilly area in the north as well as plains in the coastal south the largest plain is the pearl river delta plain where the gba consisting of nine major cities including guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan and dongguan as well as the two special administrative regions of hong kong and macau is located fig 1 b according to the guangdong statistical yearbook the 2018 gdp of the gba was about 1656 82 billion dollars with the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries being 31 9 and 66 8 respectively the total population reached 70 million at the end of the year which included 60 41 million urban population in addition the transportation infrastructure system in the gba is relatively complete with a total 884 1 km of rail transportation and 8555 km of highways open to traffic it is evident that the study area is a highly urbanized area with developed economy thus more urgent need to effectively prevent and control disasters associated with precipitation events the study area is located in the east asian monsoon region which is characterized by subtropical climate in the north to tropical climate in the south the average annual temperature is about 19 24 c shen et al 2019 and the average annual precipitation is about 1300 2500 mm xia et al 2020 about 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season april to september zhang et al 2015b and is mainly formed by tropical weather systems and local thermal convection while the dry season october to march zhang et al 2015b is dominated by frontal rain there exists frequent orographic precipitation in the northern mountains because the air currents are easily blocked by the northeast to southwest mountains and prone to rise some southward opening flared terrain can also encourage moisture from the south to lift thus increasing the intensity of precipitation 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 rain gauge observation data provided by the china meteorological administration hourly accumulated observations from 3180 ground based rain gauges fig 1 a in 2018 are collected to evaluate the era5 precipitation products the gauge network has a high density in the study area with 73 and 80 of the era5 land and era5 hres grids without considering seawater having at least one gauge due to the limitation of data accessibility we use hourly data for the whole year of 2018 in our study 2 2 2 era5 precipitation products this paper evaluates the performance of two era5 precipitation products era5 land and era5 hres in the study area era5 hres refers to the high resolution realisation contained in era5 dataset which provides hourly precipitation estimates at a spatial resolution of 31 km era5 land the land portion of era5 reanalysis data offers finer scale information with its advanced 9 km resolution and becomes more accurate for land parameters and more effective in characterizing land status another important difference between the two products is that era5 land is only forced by the era5 low atmosphere meteorological field in conjunction with an additional lapse rate correction and is not coupled to the atmospheric model which is designed to make running era5 land computationally affordable sabater 2019 the precipitation data used in this paper include liquid and frozen water falling on the earth s surface which is the accumulation of the sum of large scale and convective precipitation from the beginning to the end of the forecast step both the era5 land and era5 hres data can be downloaded from the climate data store cds at the website https cds climate copernicus eu 2 2 3 digital elevation model dem aster global digital elevation model version 3 astgtmv003 is used to obtain elevation information for the study area it is developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in collaboration with the ministry of economy trade and industry meti of japan and provides a digital elevation model dem at 1 arc second about 30 m at the equator over global land all cloud masked and non cloud masked dems based on aster level 1a scenes obtained between 1 march 2000 and 30 november 2013 are stacked to create astgtmv003 during the production multiple algorithms are applied to remove outliers fujisada et al 2005 fujisada et al 2011 fujisada et al 2012 in areas where the number of scenes is limited several existing reference dems are used to displace residual anomalies the data can be found at https lpdaac usgs gov products astgtmv003 tools 2 2 4 land cover land cover data is mainly used to analyze the era5 performance under different land cover types globeland30 used in this paper is a 30 m global land cover product developed by chen et al 2014 including 10 class types cultivated land forest grassland shrubland wetland waterbody tundra artificial surfaces bareland as well as permanent snow and ice chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 land cover information in this paper is from the version of 2020 the data can be obtained from http www globallandcover com 3 methods 3 1 data pre processing firstly the gauge data are converted to universal time utc because gauge observations and era5 estimates are in different time systems secondly spatial matching between gauge stations and era5 grids is required for comparison purpose there are two widely adopted approaches xu et al 2019 one takes station measurements as baseline and compares them to the nearest grids bai et al 2018 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while the other compares values of grids with the mean of gauge observations within them li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 these two methods will be abbreviated as s2g station to grid and sa station average respectively in later sections given the high density of the network the latter is chosen for the following analysis only grids containing one or more stations are used for evaluation thirdly hourly data from gauges and era5 are summed by date to obtain daily cumulative precipitation for the daily scale evaluation the same method is used to calculate the monthly total precipitation to assess the ability of era5 to describe the seasonal trend in precipitation fourthly in order to compare the performance of era5 under different land cover types the era5 grids are distinguished as urban vegetation and water grids according to the land cover data since the spatial resolution of globeland30 is much finer than that of era5 land and era5 hres we regard the land cover type with the largest area within an era5 grid as the type of this grid grids with the land cover type of artificial surfaces are considered as urban grids grids with the type of cultivated land forest grass land and shrubland are regarded as vegetation grids and those with the type of water body are deemed as water grids on this basis we also calculate the artificial surface area proportion for urban grids which is applied to further study the era5 performance differences within urban areas besides to investigate the ability of era5 to describe the spatial distribution of precipitation we compare the precipitation distribution patterns obtained by era5 land and era5 hres with those obtained by interpolation based on gauge records the interpolation is performed using the nearest neighbor method ordinary kriging and co kriging with three topographic factors of slope aspect and elevation as auxiliary variables since the spatial distribution obtained by the three methods is similar fig s1 the result of nearest neighbor method is used as an example for illustration we choose august 30 august and 30 august 6 00 00 which have the greatest amount of precipitation during the study period as cases to be analyzed at monthly daily and hourly scale respectively and we also compare the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution on 6 january the day of maximum precipitation in the dry season and 30 august to investigate the differences in era5 performance across seasons 3 2 evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the performance of era5 precipitation products this paper selects metrics for evaluation in terms of estimation accuracy and detection capability the world meteorological organization wmo has given a short definition of some scores and illustrated whether they are considered to be highly recommended recommended or worth a try brown et al 2004 considering the recommendations from the wmo six highly recommended metrics are chosen three accuracy metrics i e relative bias rb correlation coefficient corr and root mean square error rmse as well as three detection metrics i e the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the equitable threat score ets accuracy metrics are used to assess the accuracy of era5 precipitation estimations rb is the difference between era5 and gauge data as a proportion of gauge observation it allows us to know whether era5 estimations are drier or wetter as well as the magnitude of that deviation relative to the true precipitation 0 rb and rb 0 indicate the overestimation and underestimation of era5 respectively corr measures the linear relationship between era5 and gauge data the range of corr is 1 to 1 as the corr value is closer to 1 the linear agreement between the time series of era5 estimations and that of the real precipitation is better rmse represents the overall error magnitude relative to gauge observations it is sensitive to precipitation intensity and errors larger rmse indicates larger mean error value of era5 and the estimation accuracy of era5 is best when rmse 0 the expression of these metrics are as follows 1 rb i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 2 corr i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x represents era5 grid estimations y denotes the averages of gauge observations in the grids and n is the total number of era5 estimates considering that the error magnitude may be sensitive to precipitation magnitude the rmse divided by the corresponding real precipitation rmse p is adopted instead of rmse for analyzing the performance under different land cover types detection metrics are used to evaluate the ability of era5 to detect the occurrence of precipitation pod measures the proportion of events correctly detected and is equivalent to the hit rate of era5 the closer the pod is to 1 the more real rainfall events can be detected by era5 far is the proportion of events detected by era5 but did not actually occur which is equivalent to the false detection rate it is in the range of 0 to 1 the closer its value is to 0 the fewer the number of events falsely detected by era5 ets gives the fraction of correct detection after considering the random hit probability it ranges from 1 3 to 1 a larger ets score indicates a better overall detection capability of era5 ets reaches the optimal score of 1 when era5 has no false and missed detection of rainfall events ets 0 indicates that era5 does not have the ability to correctly detect rainfall events the metrics are calculated as follows 4 pod h h m 5 far f h f 6 ets h h e h m f h e h e h m h f h m f c where h is the number of events observed by both gauge averages and era5 m is the number of events observed by gauge averages but not by era5 f is the opposite of m c is the events not observed by gauge averages and era5 h e denotes the number of events correctly detected by era5 due to randomness to eliminate the undue influence of very light drizzle 0 1 mm h 1 li et al 2020 and 1 mm d 1 territory et al 2013 are chosen as thresholds instead of 0 for distinguishing the occurrence and absence of rainfall events at hourly and daily scale respectively besides we use the probability density functions pdf skill score pdf ss proposed by perkins et al 2007 to assess the capability of era5 to reproduce the frequency distribution of precipitation under different precipitation intensity levels the closer the pdf ss is to 1 the closer the precipitation frequency distribution described by the era5 product is to the real case the score is calculated as follows 7 pdf ss 1 n i 1 n m i n n g n e where n is the total number of precipitation events n is the number of precipitation intensity levels n e and n g are the number of events within the i th precipitation intensity level obtained by the era5 grid and the averages of gauge observations in the grids respectively the intensity classification standard is described in section 3 3 3 3 precipitation intensity classification standard in order to investigate the performance of era5 under different precipitation intensity in more detail we grade the precipitation intensity and then calculate the frequency of era5 estimates and gauge observations as well as the value of each metric at each precipitation intensity level for hourly scale precipitation is divided into six grades of 0 1 mm h 1 0 1 1 mm h 1 1 2 5 mm h 1 2 5 8 mm h 1 8 16 mm h 1 and greater than 16 mm h 1 corresponding to no trace rain light rain moderate rain heavy rain rainstorm and heavy rainstorm according to the classification standard of li et al 2020 in the similar region for daily scale precipitation is classified into six levels of 0 1 mm d 1 0 1 1 mm d 1 1 2 mm d 1 2 10 mm d 1 10 50 mm d 1 and 50 mm d 1 corresponding to no trace rain tiny rain light rain moderate rain heavy rain and violent rain referring to the wmo standard tan et al 2015 3 4 spatial statistical analysis for a more intuitive insight into the ability of era5 to describe precipitation in different parts of the study area we use spatial correlation and local autocorrelation methods as an aid to evaluate the performance of the two products at the grid scale firstly we calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients ρ between the precipitation distributions obtained by the era5 products and gauge interpolation data at corresponding times to investigate the capability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution the method is also used to detect the spatial similarity of the performance of the two products this coefficient is a rank correlation method that can better measure the similarity between spatial trends it is calculated as follows 8 ρ 1 6 x i y i 2 n 3 n where x i and y i represent the corresponding sequence number of the era5 grid estimations and gauge interpolation records after sorting by precipitation amount from smallest to largest respectively n denotes the number of grids since the sizes of the era5 hres and era land grids are different we resample the era5 hres grids to the same size as era land and gauge interpolation grids before analysis then we employ the getis ord g i spatial hot spot statistical analysis model to acquire the spatial cold and hot spots for each metric of era5 which can provide aids for analyzing the spatial distribution of era5 performance based on the getis ord g i score this method calculates the g i value approximately equal to the z score of each grid to determine the high value and low value aggregation areas the g i value is calculated as follows 9 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 x j 1 n x j n s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 where x j is the metric value of grid j w i j denotes the spatial weight between grid i and grid j and n represents the number of grids for statistically significant positive g i the higher the value the tighter the high value clustering hot spots while for statistically significant negative g i the lower the value the tighter the low value clustering cold spots 3 5 necessity of a high density gauge network in this paper a dense rain gauge network is used to evaluate the performance of era5 to prove the importance of this network we compare the assessment results obtained by using different numbers 1 5 10 15 of gauge stations in all era5 hres grids containing more than 15 stations see sect 5 2 for each grid the metric averages of all stations are calculated after spatial matching using s2g then evaluation metrics are calculated based on the randomly selected 5 10 and all stations from the 15 gauges by matching via sa the step of randomly picking 5 or 10 stations and calculating metrics is repeated 500 times these 500 calculation results are averaged to produce the final evaluation results of 5 and 10 stations the final average results obtained from 1 5 10 and 15 stations are compared to analyze the evaluation differences in using different numbers of stations 4 results 4 1 overall performance at regional scale we evaluate the overall performance of era5 at regional scale both across the study area and within the gba since their results are similar here we take the results of the gba as illustration and the results of the whole study area can be found in the supplementary material figs s2 s4 and table s1 s3 fig 2 illustrates the total monthly precipitation for the gba it can be clearly seen that era5 can reproduce the seasonal trend of precipitation well in the study area both era5 land and era hres records show that the precipitation is relatively low from january to march increasing from april to june with a slight decrease in july and followed by a rise in august and a steady decline this seasonal trend is consistent with gauge observations as well as the dry and wet seasons rainfall distribution characteristics of the study area however precipitation is obviously overestimated by era5 land for the majority of months in contrast era5 hres can provide precipitation that is more in line with the real situation and has better estimation capability at monthly scale the evaluation results of the two era5 products in the gba at regional scale are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively at hourly scale the performance of the two products is not very satisfactory but comparatively speaking era5 hres delivers much better results than era5 land in metrics except for pod for estimation accuracy era5 land overestimates precipitation and the magnitude of the wet bias is more than one third of the true precipitation the linear agreement between the time series of era5 land estimates and gauge observations is also weak as corr values are 0 25 in all periods compared to era5 land era5 hres has a higher correlation coefficient and smaller overestimation magnitude showing a much greater ability to reproduce hourly rainfall amount regarding detection metrics era5 land seems to be good at capturing precipitation events but also prone to misreporting rainfall events as both pod and far values are high considering that a large fraction of the actual rainfall events detected by era5 land is captured due to randomness the ets scores are very low indicating the overall poor detecting capacity of era5 land in comparison although era5 hres has lower pod scores it misdetects fewer rainfall events far 0 72 resulting in a more significant advantage in overall detecting ability as its ets scores being almost twice as high as those of era5 land the performance of the two era5 products is better at daily scale indicated by the increase in corr pod ets and decrease in rmse and far this finding illustrates the deficiencies in the characterization of the diurnal cycle by era5 in contrast era5 hres can better describe the diurnal cycle as evidenced by the greater improvement of era5 land and the smaller differences between metrics of the two products at daily scale in general although era5 land has more spatial details it is less effective in offering accurate precipitation information over short periods at hourly and daily scales than era5 hres additionally the two products both perform relatively better in the dry season than in the wet suggesting that era5 is better at modeling the dry season frontal precipitation rather than the large amount of small scale convective precipitation that occurs in summer table 3 listed the pdf ss for era5 land and era5 hres precipitation product in the gba at hourly scale the two products can produce similar precipitation frequency distribution patterns with gauge records throughout the study period as their pdf ss scores are both higher than 0 7 for different seasons the distribution patterns reproduced by era5 are more accurate in the dry season than in the wet in addition the precipitation frequency distribution described by era5 hres is slightly closer to the real situation than era5 land the results at daily scale are similar to these at hourly scale but comparatively the frequency distribution patterns obtained by the era5 products at daily scale are less consistent with those by gauge observations which may result from the accumulation of hourly frequency estimate errors for different precipitation intensity levels as well as the incomplete correspondence between the hourly and daily scale intensity classification standard fig 3 displays the metrics under different precipitation intensities at hourly scale the change of metrics with precipitation intensity for era5 land and era5 hres are similar with respect to the accuracy metrics rb has an overall change from overestimation to underestimation as precipitation intensity increases with the turning point appearing at 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 corr and rmse have a generally declining and rising trend respectively suggesting that the greater the precipitation intensity the weaker the linear relationship between era5 estimations and gauge observations and the larger the era5 estimation error magnitude but relatively speaking the changes of corr and rmse in the range of 2 5 mm h 1 are not very significant for detection metrics the lower bound of the range for each level is used as the threshold for metric calculation overall the higher the intensity the lower the pod and the higher the far this finding indicates that era5 requires improvement in capturing actual heavy rainfall events ets also achieves the best score in the range of 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 due to the relatively high hit rate and low misdetection rate in this range generally speaking both era5 land and era5 hres has the best performance in the range of 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 i e light and moderate rain as shown in fig 4 the changes of rb rmse pod far and ets versus precipitation intensity are generally similar to those at hourly scale yet the best performance of era5 land and era5 hres occurs in the range of 2 50 mm d 1 also refer to moderate rain in which corr also has a significant peak such difference in the change of corr at daily and hourly scale reflects that era5 cannot capture the exact time of rainfall events in the diurnal cycle to some extent 4 2 performance in urban and non urban areas precipitation affects the management and development of cities and in turn urban areas may have an impact on precipitation lowry 1998 thus the ability of era5 to detect and estimate precipitation may differ among urban and non urban areas consequently performance differences of era5 land and era5 hres under urban vegetation and water land cover types are further analyzed in this paper as the results are similar at hourly and daily scales the findings at hourly scale are presented here as an illustration and the daily results are placed in the supplementary material figs s6 s8 and table s5 fig 5 presents the differences of each metric under different land cover types for the whole 2018 the dry season and the wet season with regard to the entire study period both era5 land and era5 hres give the most accurate estimates in urban areas as evidenced by notably smaller rb and rmse p as well as larger corr except for a higher corr score of era5 land for water the two products deliver better results for all other metrics in vegetation than water areas in terms of detection metrics era5 land and era5 hres have a slight advantage in urban over vegetation and show the weakest capability in water areas however era5 does not always perform better in urban areas in the wet season the two era5 products still offer superior capability in urban areas but in the dry season they model precipitation most effectively in vegetation areas instead of the urban this finding reveals that there exists certain seasonality in the performance differences of era5 between urban and vegetation areas additionally era5 consistently performs the most poorly in water areas which occurs in both the dry and wet seasons suggesting that it is relatively difficult for era5 to provide accurate precipitation information for water we also analyze the performance differences of era5 within the urban areas as exhibited in fig 6 the ability of era5 to describe precipitation generally becomes weaker as the artificial surface area proportion increases reflecting the deficiencies in the characterization of precipitation in urban grids with higher urbanization levels by era5 compared to era5 land era5 hres has a more notable decreasing tendency of rainfall modeling capacity besides we also conduct the analysis in the dry and wet seasons using corr and ets as proxies for accuracy and detection metrics the result reveals that the performance differences within urban areas are similar in the two seasons fig s5 but the urban effect seems comparatively weaker in the wet season 4 3 performance at the grid scale in addition to regional scale we also analyze the performance of era5 at the grid scale as described in sect 3 1 we select august 30 august and 30 august 6 00 00 as cases at monthly daily and hourly scale to analyze the ability of era5 land and era5 hres to describe the spatial distribution pattern of precipitation besides we take 6 january and 30 august as examples to investigate the performance differences between the dry and wet seasons fig 7 displays the precipitation spatial distribution given by the two era5 products at the three temporal scales benefiting from its finer spatial resolution era5 land provides spatial information on rainfall with more details however in general the spatial patterns reproduced by era5 land and era5 hres are consistent at all temporal scales as illustrated in fig 7 c precipitation in august has a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northern mountains despite systematic overestimation era5 land generally captures this pattern well with only more overestimation of precipitation in the northernmost mountains resulting in two small high value zones there era5 hres also characterizes the pattern correctly but it significantly underestimates the precipitation along the southern coast and does not clearly depict the three low value zones in the north and west due to its coarser resolution at daily scale both era5 land and era5 hres generally reproduce the true precipitation pattern but their obtained high value zones of precipitation are located in the south central plain and tend to expand to the northeast compared to the real pattern the spatial distributions obtained by era5 and gauges differ more at hourly scale at 30 august 6 00 00 era5 land noticeably underestimates the high intensity precipitation and provides greater precipitation in the eastern mountains than in most coastal areas which is not consistent with reality for era5 hres it yields two high value zones in the west that are not really present or larger than actual based on these results we further calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients to more directly assess the ability of era5 to simulate precipitation distribution as indicated in table 4 the patterns obtained by era5 at monthly scales are in good agreement with the real patterns with spatial correlation coefficients exceeding 0 75 at the daily and hourly scales however the values of coefficient drop below 0 5 generally neither era5 land nor era5 hres is very good at describing the precipitation spatial distribution over short periods we also extracted the large urban agglomeration area outlined by red lines in fig 7 in the study area to observe the performance of era5 within the urban area at all the three temporal scales the urban area is characterized by more precipitation in the southern offshore areas and relatively less precipitation in the north within this area the patterns depicted by era5 land and era5 hres are generally consistent with the interpolation results despite the bias of precipitation estimations it can be noted that the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution is relatively better in the urban area to further evaluate the difference in the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation distribution across seasons we pick two days with maximum daily precipitation in the dry 6 january and wet seasons 30 august as cases to compare the patterns obtained by era5 and rain gauge interpolation as illustrated in fig 8 the patterns depicted by era5 land and era5 hres agrees better with the reality on 6 january than on 30 august according to fig 8 c on 6 january the first and second high value zones of precipitation are located in the east and northwest corners of the study area respectively and there is a gradually decreasing spatial trend of precipitation from northeast to southwest despite providing a smaller high value zone in the east and overestimating the precipitation in the northwest corner era5 land well simulates the precipitation spatial trend in contrast the distribution pattern obtained by era5 hres is more accurate although there is an overall underestimation of precipitation in general the ability of era5 to describe precipitation distribution is better in the dry season than in the wet which is also reflected in table 4 as the spatial correlation coefficients for both era5 products are greater on 6 january than on 30 august this finding is consistent with the results of section 4 1 suggesting that era5 may be better at modeling frontal precipitation than convective precipitation fig 9 displays the spatial distribution of evaluation metrics for the whole 2018 at hourly scale and the corresponding hot and cold spot distributions are shown in fig s9 to check whether the spatial distributions of the performance of the two era5 products are similar we also calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients between the spatial distributions of the corresponding metrics for era5 land and era5 hres which are presented in table 5 since the daily precipitation is obtained cumulatively from the hourly observations and the spatial patterns of metrics are similar at the two temporal scales the results at hourly scale are presented here as an illustration see fig 10 according to table 5 almost all the spatial correlation coefficients between corresponding era5 land and era5 hres metrics are greater than 0 6 which indicates era5 land and era5 hres show similar spatial distribution characteristics of performance specifically for accuracy metrics rb is found the lowest in the southern coastal areas and higher in the western northernmost and north eastern of the study area in contrast corr has an overall opposite spatial distribution with its high value zone distributed in the south central areas and low value zones located in the west notably rmse has a similar distribution pattern with corr which indicates that era5 has a larger mean error magnitude in the coastal area such spatial distribution of rmse is possibly due to the overall greater precipitation in coastal areas than in mountains closer to the inland for detection metrics pod is relatively low in the western and eastern mountains far has a large high value zone in the west while ets has better scores in the east and the south coast areas considering estimation and detection capability together era5 performs best in the southern coastal areas where the large urban agglomeration is located the detection results of cold and hot spots also support this finding fig s9 the results are in line with the findings above that both era5 land and era5 hres have better performance in urban areas for the entire study period by further analyzing the spatial distribution of metrics within the urban agglomeration it can be found that the heterogeneity of the three accuracy metrics for the two products is low in the urban area in terms of detection capability era5 land has a better hit rate in the southeast corner of the urban area but the misdetection rate is also higher in several grids along the eastern edge of the urban agglomeration therefore the ets score of era5 land generally achieves optimal values in the southern corner of the urban agglomeration for era5 hres far shows little variation within the urban but pod has relatively higher values in the southeast corner where ets thus has better scores overall the ability of era5 to detect and estimate precipitation does not differ significantly in different parts of the urban area but may be slightly better in the southern coast since there is a seasonality in the performance differences of era5 under different land cover types as discussed above here we use corr and ets as proxies for accuracy and detection metrics to analyze the seasonality in the spatial distribution of era5 performance the spatial distributions of corr and ets for the two era5 products are similar as their spatial correlation coefficient values are high regardless of the season however the distributions of the same metric differ in the dry and wet seasons in the dry season the spatial distribution of corr and ets are similar with lower values in the southwestern corner and the southern coastal area during the wet season both corr and ets have better scores in the south central plain the corresponding hotspot analysis results also show such patterns fig s10 it follows that the ability of era5 land and era5 hres to estimate precipitation and capture rainfall events is better in the northern mountains in the dry season and becomes better in the south central area in the wet season yet within the large urban agglomeration seasonal differences in the spatial distribution of corr and ets are not very significant 5 discussion 5 1 modeling ability of era5 the evaluation results in sect 4 show that era5 can reproduce the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation at monthly scale but is not very good at detecting rainfall events and estimating precipitation magnitude at hourly and daily scales this finding is consistent with the study of zandler et al 2019 in general era5 overestimates hourly and daily scale precipitation which is also in agreement with some previous studies sharifi et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 yazdandoost et al 2020 zandler et al 2019 in terms of capturing rainfall events era5 tends to misidentify non precipitation events as rainfall events leading to its overall overestimation of precipitation and poor detection capability such misdetection is a common problem of reanalysis products as several previous research pointed out that reanalysis products tend to overestimate precipitation frequency beck et al 2017 hénin et al 2018 skok et al 2016 stephens et al 2010 zolina et al 2004 despite the optimization of relevant parameters such as convection and subgrid turbulent mixing hersbach et al 2020 sandu et al 2013 era5 still suffers from this common flaw which would cause spurious drizzle and lead to misdetection lopez 2007 skok et al 2016 it is also suggested that era5 tends to over compensate for the production of dry bias by era interim in humid areas amjad et al 2020 which might be another reason for the overestimation in the study area for different seasons era5 is better at describing dry season frontal precipitation than local short lived convective precipitation in the wet season which is one of the features of reanalysis products ebert et al 2007 gottschalck et al 2005 ruane roads 2007 similar to the results of tang et al 2020 we find deficiencies in the characterization of the diurnal cycle by era5 through analyzing the performance under different precipitation intensities figs 3 4 we notice that era5 has the best capability to estimate and detect moderate intensity rain which is also shown in the findings of kolluru et al 2020 it is due to the fact that era5 generally underestimates the frequency of no trace rain as well as the frequency and precipitation magnitude of actual high intensity rain which is associated with model uncertainty beck et al 2017 as mentioned above the ability of era5 to model no trace rain is insufficient because of the high misdetection rate and for high intensity rain era5 fails to describe the precipitation occurrence and magnitude mainly because gridded products have difficulty in accurately describing heavy rainfall events existing at microscopic scales ahmed et al 2019 pour et al 2014 despite the finer spatial resolution era5 land does not characterize precipitation any better than era5 hres and even provides greater overestimation magnitude and poorer overall detection results which is mainly associated with the more significant defect of era5 land to overestimate precipitation frequency as shown in the evaluation results this might be attributed to the fact that era5 land is a single simulation without coupling to the atmospheric model sabater 2019 the design makes running era5 land computationally affordable but with a certain loss of simulation accuracy analysis of the performance under different land cover types reveals that for the whole 2018 the results of the three land cover type grids in order from best to worst are that of urban vegetation and water this might be related to the geographic location and topographic conditions of these grids as many studies have pointed out that the performance of gridded precipitation products can be affected by topography complexity ebert et al 2007 feng et al 2021 isotta et al 2015 as well as the location of the land and sea jiang et al 2017 lockhoff et al 2019 we have analyzed the performance of era5 versus elevation fig s11 aspect fig s12 and slope fig s13 in the study area overall era5 may have a weaker estimation and detection capability in areas with more complex topography although the individual effects of topographic factors are not strong due to the relatively low topographic complexity over the study area this finding is shown in several previous studies evaluating era5 and some other precipitation products amjad et al 2020 beck et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is mainly due to the fact that the northeast to southwest mountains with higher altitude and greater slope can contribute to the development of orographic precipitation by lifting moisture from the southern ocean this kind of precipitation has stronger spatio temporal heterogeneity and is challenging to simulate tucker 2005 the location of the land and sea may also has an impact on the performance of era5 as some previous studies suggested caracciolo et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 lockhoff et al 2019 rahmawati and lubczynski 2018 offshore areas especially coastal shores and inshore sea surface are affected by coastline effects and would have a more complex land sea breeze circulation and coastal convection systems which will increase the difficulty for precipitation modeling in the study area of this paper urban grids are mainly distributed in the southern plain most of the water grids are seawater at the border of ocean and land except for a few scattered among the urban vegetation grids are those other than urban and water and all of the northern mountains are classified as vegetation strongly influenced by coastal effects the performance of water grids is relatively poor regardless of the entire study period dry or wet seasons for vegetation grids located in mountains farther away from the shoreline the precipitation is not only mainly influenced by the heat difference between the land and the adjacent ocean but also by topography and atmospheric stability bergemann et al 2015 therefore it is challenging to detect and estimate the precipitation for these grids which may impact the overall simulation performance of all the vegetation grids comparatively urban grids clustering in the southern plain generally perform better because they are moderately affected by coastal effects and topography the spatial distribution characteristics of performance are consistent with the assessment results under different land cover types which is also a result of the combined influence of coastal effects and topography in addition we find seasonality in the performance differences between urban and vegetation areas and in the spatial distribution of performance this finding might be associated with the different causes of wet and dry season rainfall as well as the relative spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation in the mountains compared to the plain in the dry season when precipitation is mainly due to seasonal shifts in pressure and wind zones mountains far from the sea are less affected by the combined effects of land sea heat difference and topography making detection and estimation uncertainties greater in offshore plain than mountains in the wet season the spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation in the mountains increases under the influence of summer monsoon thus era5 performs worse compared to the urban plain area analysis focusing on the performance differences within urban areas shows that precipitation of urban grids with higher urbanization levels is more challenging to model this is related to the increased precipitation heterogeneity caused by factors including high roughness of artificial surfaces urban thermal effects change of water vapor condition on the urban underlying surface and increased anthropogenic aerosol release cotton and pielke 2007 shepherd 2005 shepherd and burian 2003 simpson et al 2008 wan et al 2015 in the wet season when convective precipitation is active these factors contribute less significantly to the precipitation heterogeneity than in the dry season resulting in a weaker look of the urban effect compared to era5 land the performance decreasing trend of era5 hres urban grids with increasing urbanization levels is more notable which is probably due to the coarser spatial resolution of era5 hres and the more pronounced increase in the heterogeneity of precipitation within grids moreover we also discuss the era5 assessment results obtained from some other newer metrics table s6 including kge score gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 error decomposition indices hbias mbias and fbias tian et al 2009 and so on tables s7 and s8 give the performance of the two era5 products at regional scale derived from the newer metrics and figs s14 s18 show the era5 ability to describe precipitation given by the newer metrics for different precipitation intensities different land cover types different artificial surface area proportions and different parts of the study area generally results yielded by classical and newer metrics are similar 5 2 importance of a high density gauge network for evaluation it has been suggested that a sparse gauge network persistently underestimates the performance of gridded precipitation products tang et al 2018 in order to demonstrate the necessity of the dense ground based gauge network in this paper we perform an analysis with the approach mentioned in sect 3 4 since the results at daily and hourly scales are similar the findings at hourly scale are used here as an illustration table 6 compares the evaluation results obtained from different numbers of gauge stations overall the more stations are used for evaluation the better the performance of era5 hres is obtained this comes from the fact that gridded product estimates characterize the precipitation within the grid cells and gauge records at single points cannot perfectly represent this areal precipitation in contrast the averages of the densely distributed gauge observations can better reflect a mix of valleys slopes and peaks precipitation within the grid cells zandler et al 2019 among the accuracy metrics rb shows the most significant change with the number of stations being used decreasing by more than 70 2 when the number of stations used for evaluation increases from 1 to 15 corr has a moderate change magnitude about 19 7 and rmse has a relatively low one about 0 88 the rb calculated from the multi station averages is a product obtained by offsetting the dry and wet bias calculated from single station observations to some extent and thus has a greater change compared to rmse which represents the error magnitude the reason for the increasing corr with the number of stations is that the time of the same rainfall event occurring at each station in a grid may differ slightly and the use of the multi station average can smooth this difference resulting in a better linear agreement between the gridded product estimations and gauge observations regarding the detection metrics the change of ets is the most notable about 36 5 while that of pod about 3 8 and far about 12 6 are not very significant by comparison as many rainfall events may occur at scales smaller than the grid there are local rainfall events within the grids sharifi et al 2016 such local rainfall events are more likely to be observed by gauges when there are more stations in the grids in the case in which era5 hres tends to misreport no trace rain as rainfall events far values would be lower when calculated using multi station averages that capture the local rainfall in addition the multi station average can avoid the measurement uncertainty caused by factors such as instrument degradation and human operation at a single station therefore using more stations for evaluation can result in slightly higher pod values with increasing hit rate and decreasing misdetection rate ets score which represents the overall detection capability shows a greater increase magnitude than pod and far following the analysis above data from a high density gauge network is necessary for accurate evaluation on the era5 precipitation products because the densely distributed observations can help to reduce evaluation error and uncertainty caused by the sparsity of gauges notably according to this finding the study of the relationship between era5 performance and urbanization level in section 4 2 may be influenced by the number of stations however in general the grids we used with a smaller artificial surface area proportion contain a relatively less number of stations fig s19 which would lead to a certain underestimation of performance still our results indicate that the ability of era5 to describe precipitation degrades in areas with high urbanization levels therefore the relationship between era5 performance and urbanization level found in the paper is reliable 6 conclusions precipitation is a key parameter that can reflect the environmental conditions of the land surface so it is necessary to obtain accurate and timely information on precipitation especially that of urban areas era5 an advanced reanalysis product has a greater potential to reproduce urban precipitation than other precipitation gridded products due to its fine spatial and temporal resolution as well as a series of improvements in the numerical simulation therefore it is important to understand the capability of era5 to model urban precipitation at fine temporal scales in order to investigate the strength and weakness of era5 in urban areas this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of era5 land and era5 hres in a local region of the south central guangdong province which includes the gba using observations from a high density gauge network in 2018 the evaluation is carried out based on three accuracy metrics and three detection metrics at multiple spatial regional and grid and temporal hourly and daily scales besides we also compare the performance differences of era5 under different land cover types urban vegetation and water and within urban areas the conclusions are as follows 1 era5 products can describe the spatial distribution and temporal trend of precipitation at monthly scale but generally they fail to model precipitation over short periods at hourly and daily scale properly which is mainly caused by their model uncertainty and tendency to overestimate the frequency of precipitation 2 despite the finer spatial resolution era5 land without coupling with atmospheric models provides less accurate precipitation information compared to era5 hres 3 regarding different precipitation intensities era5 products have the best ability to estimate and detect moderate intensity rain 4 considering different land cover types for the whole of 2018 the best to worst performance of era5 occurs in the order of urban areas in the southern plain vegetation in the northern mountains and seawater at the border of ocean and land the same finding is obtained in the wet season but during the dry season era5 products deliver better results in the northern mountainous vegetation than urban areas due to the different causes of dry and wet seasons precipitation 5 focusing on the inner urban areas era5 has deficiencies in modeling precipitation in areas with higher urbanization levels in summary the ability of era5 especially era5 land to reproduce precipitation characteristics needs to be further improved to provide more accurate information on the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation in coastal urban areas with high storm and flood risk to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first study to evaluate the performance of era5 precipitation products in a coastal urban area based on observations from a high density gauge network it fills the research gap of the error characteristics of era5 land and makes a comparison between two era5 products era5 land and era5 hres with different spatial resolution providing a useful reference for the rational applications of era5 7 data availability the rain gauge observation

4245,precipitation is an important component of the global water cycle a comprehensive understanding of precipitation characteristics especially that in urban areas is essential for practical applications in hydrology era5 a state of the art reanalysis product with wide temporal coverage as well as fine spatial and temporal resolution has greater potential to reproduce precipitation than many other products however how era5 precipitation performs has not been well investigated in urban areas therefore we evaluate and compare the ability of two era5 products era5 land and era5 hres in the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba using observations from over 3000 rain gauges in a high density network during 2018 the results show that era5 products generally characterize moderate intensity rain due to the different causes of seasonal precipitation as well as the combined influence of coastal effects and topography the best performance of era5 products is found in the southern coastal plains during the wet season and in the northern mountainous vegetation areas during the dry season meanwhile it is challenging for era5 products to model precipitation in areas with higher urbanization levels we also find that era5 land data with finer spatial resolution fails to deliver any preferable results than era5 hres era5 products needs further improvement in the gba for providing accurate precipitation patterns this paper gives a detailed insight into the performance of era5 products which offers a valuable reference for its probable applicability in the coastal urban areas keywords era5 precipitation evaluation urban areas 1 introduction precipitation is the most essential water input to the near surface water circulation system and is an important factor that would affect regional water resource conditions kucera et al 2013 understanding the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of precipitation is the prerequisite for various applications such as agricultural management disaster prevention ecological monitoring and public health management kirschbaum et al 2017 serrat capdevila et al 2014 tapiador et al 2012 in the context of global climate change it is essential to obtain accurate and timely precipitation information at high spatio temporal resolution especially in urban areas where usually suffer more casualties and losses in disasters such as floods due to the high population densities and active economies zhang et al 2015c reliable information on precipitation can provide effective support for flood prediction and prevention hailegeorgis and alfredsen 2017 nguyen and bae 2020 wang et al 2019 nevertheless accurate estimation of precipitation remains a challenge due to the discontinuity and high variability of precipitation in time and space stephens et al 2010 herold et al 2016 ground network of rain gauges is a conventional and the only way to measure precipitation directly de leeuw et al 2015 and the observations are usually accurate however the accuracy of ground measurements would still be affected by factors like wind evaporation human operation and instrument degradation fallah et al 2020 haiden et al 2011 in addition the spatial distribution and density of rain gauges vary considerably from region to region with marine and remote areas having limited gauges zhang et al 2020 making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous precipitation information to overcome the disadvantage of rain gauges distributing spatially discretely some researchers have performed spatial interpolation on gauge observations to obtain continuous precipitation fields nearest neighbor algorithm creutin and obled 1982 stow 2002 inverse distance weights creutin and obled 1982 simanton and osborn 1980 kriging li et al 2018 lloyd 2005 zhang et al 2015a zimmerman et al 1999 spline functions hutchinson 1998a hutchinson 1998b hutchinson 1995 and other traditional methods are widely used but their interpolation accuracy can be further improved as they rely only on the idea of spatial autocorrelation or spatial smooth continuity for this concern regression models that can describe the relationship between precipitation and other relevant auxiliary factors have been developed for interpolation such as the parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2002 daly et al 2003 and geographically weighted regression gwr brunsdon et al 1996 brunsdon et al 2001 with the development of earth observation data transmission and computing technologies it is possible to collect continuous precipitation information through remote sensing this kind of precipitation estimates are mainly derived from ground based global positioning system gps ground based weather radars and satellites benefiting from the ability to detect rainfall accurately across wide spatial ranges in all weather conditions satellite based methods are major remote sensing approaches to observe precipitation over large areas currently based on the huge amount of data accumulated by the global meteorological satellite network continuous precipitation can be acquired by visible infrared inversion arkin and meisner 1987 ba and gruber 2001 griffith et al 1978 xie and arkin 1997 active or passive microwave inversion collins et al 2001 ferraro 1997 iguchi et al 2000 and multi sensor joint inversion huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 numerical simulation is also a means to gain precipitation information which can directly generate temporally and spatially continuous maps of precipitation distribution at global and regional scales global climate models gcms build climate system equations from the thermodynamic and fluid kinematic characteristics of the climate system and provide the most advanced tool for simulating continuous global precipitation schiermeier 2010 nested applied with regional climate models rcms gcms can also offer good precipitation estimates in regional climate change analysis giorgi and mearns 1999 reanalysis one of the typical model based approaches produces field data with a minimal error by assimilating quality controlled meteorological observations from multiple sources with simulated data from numerical weather prediction models nowadays diverse reanalysis precipitation products have been widely used such as japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 kobayashi et al 2015 climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2014 saha et al 2010 european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis interim era interim dee et al 2011 etc as the fifth generation of atmosphere reanalysis dataset released by the european center for medium term weather forecasting ecmwf era5 is one of the state of the art reanalysis products in production since 2016 herold et al 2016 the 1950 onward era5 hourly data was officially released on the copernicus climate change services c3s climate data store cds in january 2019 hersbach et al 2019 era5 provides global hourly estimations of 265 variables such as precipitation temperature and humidity with a horizontal resolution of 31 km and 9 km for ocean waves and dedicated land products respectively hersbach et al 2020 compared to era interim era5 has higher spatio temporal resolution a better 4d var data assimilation scheme a more recent forecasting model more output parameters and 3 hourly uncertainty information as a result the estimations of era5 are significantly improved hersbach et al 2020 with its advantages of wide temporal coverage and fine resolution era5 has high application values in many fields however a thorough understanding of the performance of era5 is essential before it is practically applied since the release of era5 several researchers have evaluated the performance of its precipitation products using rain gauge data in different regions to support its application beck et al 2019 compared era5 and other 25 products including era interim at daily scale in the continental united states the results revealed that era5 properly captures the variability of precipitation and exhibits markedly better accuracy than era interim but improvements are needed in regions with complex topography and high precipitation heterogeneity beck et al 2019 a comparison of era interim and era5 at monthly scale in the mountainous regions of central asia found that era5 is capable of capturing precipitation trends but inadequate in estimating magnitudes zandler et al 2019 tang et al 2020 compared era5 and nine other satellite based or reanalysis products at daily and hourly scales in china it showed that although era5 performs well at daily scale it has difficulty in reproducing the peak precipitation time magnitude and variation of the diurnal cycle at hourly scale similar studies have also been conducted in iran india turkey australia and north american amjad et al 2020 feng et al 2021 kolluru et al 2020 sharifi et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 xu et al 2019 yazdandoost et al 2020 these studies generally agree that era5 is capable of detecting rainfall events and reproducing the spatio temporal distribution but overestimates precipitation in most cases several researchers also point out that the performance degrades in areas with complex topography nonetheless evaluation studies of era5 precipitation products are not yet comprehensive firstly existing studies mainly focus on non urban areas while few evaluations have been conducted specifically for urban areas in fact urban areas have a greater need for timely accurate precipitation information with wide spatio temporal coverage to aid in better city management development planning and disaster prevention so it is necessary to understand the performance of era5 in urban areas secondly most evaluations are carried out for the 31 km era5 hres dataset and very few studies have assessed the 9 km era5 land with higher spatial resolution and finer precipitation distribution details era5 land has greater potential to support urban applications than era5 hres and many other gridded products thus it is important to fill the gap of evaluation on era5 land in addition limited by various factors such as gauge data acquisition interval most current studies are based on daily or coarser temporal scales and the performance of era5 at sub daily scales needs to be further understood the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area gba a typical large urban agglomeration is one of the most open and economically vibrant regions in china it is located in the coastal region of southern china and is frequently affected by disasters such as torrential rain typhoon and flood which makes high quality precipitation information critically necessary there is a high density rain gauge network in the gba which can be used to evaluate era5 precipitation products and provide a good insight into the performance of era5 in coastal urban areas therefore this paper chooses a local region in the south central guangdong province of china which includes the gba as the study area to evaluate the performance of era5 at multiple spatial and temporal scales in 2018 the main objectives of this study are 1 to evaluate and compare the overall ability of era5 including 9 km era5 land and 31 km era5 hres to capture rainfall events and estimate precipitation at regional and multiple temporal hourly and daily scales 2 to analyze the performance of era5 products under different land cover types especially urban 3 to assess the performance of era5 products in different parts of the study area at the grid scale to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first study to evaluate the performance of era5 in an urban area based on a high density ground based rain gauge network it not only presents the first assessment of era5 land s ability to model precipitation but also provides insight into the performance differences between the two different spatial resolution era5 precipitation products it offers information on the error characteristics of era5 in coastal urban areas contributing to the probable rational applications of era5 in urban disaster prevention and city management 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area in order to make full use of the local gauge observations and to better analyze the performance differences of era5 in urban and non urban areas the study area is defined as a local region fig 1 in the south central guangdong province of southeastern china covering a total area of 291 926 58 km2 between 110 116 e and 21 25 n the gba is included within this region fig 1 a the region has an elevation in the range of 10 1921 m with a mountainous and high hilly area in the north as well as plains in the coastal south the largest plain is the pearl river delta plain where the gba consisting of nine major cities including guangzhou shenzhen zhuhai foshan and dongguan as well as the two special administrative regions of hong kong and macau is located fig 1 b according to the guangdong statistical yearbook the 2018 gdp of the gba was about 1656 82 billion dollars with the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries being 31 9 and 66 8 respectively the total population reached 70 million at the end of the year which included 60 41 million urban population in addition the transportation infrastructure system in the gba is relatively complete with a total 884 1 km of rail transportation and 8555 km of highways open to traffic it is evident that the study area is a highly urbanized area with developed economy thus more urgent need to effectively prevent and control disasters associated with precipitation events the study area is located in the east asian monsoon region which is characterized by subtropical climate in the north to tropical climate in the south the average annual temperature is about 19 24 c shen et al 2019 and the average annual precipitation is about 1300 2500 mm xia et al 2020 about 80 of the annual precipitation occurs during the wet season april to september zhang et al 2015b and is mainly formed by tropical weather systems and local thermal convection while the dry season october to march zhang et al 2015b is dominated by frontal rain there exists frequent orographic precipitation in the northern mountains because the air currents are easily blocked by the northeast to southwest mountains and prone to rise some southward opening flared terrain can also encourage moisture from the south to lift thus increasing the intensity of precipitation 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 rain gauge observation data provided by the china meteorological administration hourly accumulated observations from 3180 ground based rain gauges fig 1 a in 2018 are collected to evaluate the era5 precipitation products the gauge network has a high density in the study area with 73 and 80 of the era5 land and era5 hres grids without considering seawater having at least one gauge due to the limitation of data accessibility we use hourly data for the whole year of 2018 in our study 2 2 2 era5 precipitation products this paper evaluates the performance of two era5 precipitation products era5 land and era5 hres in the study area era5 hres refers to the high resolution realisation contained in era5 dataset which provides hourly precipitation estimates at a spatial resolution of 31 km era5 land the land portion of era5 reanalysis data offers finer scale information with its advanced 9 km resolution and becomes more accurate for land parameters and more effective in characterizing land status another important difference between the two products is that era5 land is only forced by the era5 low atmosphere meteorological field in conjunction with an additional lapse rate correction and is not coupled to the atmospheric model which is designed to make running era5 land computationally affordable sabater 2019 the precipitation data used in this paper include liquid and frozen water falling on the earth s surface which is the accumulation of the sum of large scale and convective precipitation from the beginning to the end of the forecast step both the era5 land and era5 hres data can be downloaded from the climate data store cds at the website https cds climate copernicus eu 2 2 3 digital elevation model dem aster global digital elevation model version 3 astgtmv003 is used to obtain elevation information for the study area it is developed by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa in collaboration with the ministry of economy trade and industry meti of japan and

where the number of scenes is limited several existing reference dems are used to displace residual anomalies the data can be found at https lpdaac usgs gov products astgtmv003 tools 2 2 4 land cover land cover data is mainly used to analyze the era5 performance under different land cover types globeland30 used in this paper is a 30 m global land cover product developed by chen et al 2014 including 10 class types cultivated land forest grassland shrubland wetland waterbody tundra artificial surfaces bareland as well as permanent snow and ice chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 land cover information in this paper is from the version of 2020 the data can be obtained from http www globallandcover com 3 methods 3 1 data pre processing firstly the gauge data are converted to universal time utc because gauge observations and era5 estimates are in different time systems secondly spatial matching between gauge stations and era5 grids is required for comparison purpose there are two widely adopted approaches xu et al 2019 one takes station measurements as baseline and compares them to the nearest grids bai et al 2018 peng et al 2020 wang et al 2020 while the other compares values of grids with the mean of gauge observations within them li et al 2020 yu et al 2020 these two methods will be abbreviated as s2g station to grid and sa station average respectively in later sections given the high density of the network the latter is chosen for the following analysis only grids containing one or more stations are used for evaluation thirdly hourly data from gauges and era5 are summed by date to obtain daily cumulative precipitation for the daily scale evaluation the same method is used to calculate the monthly total precipitation to assess the ability of era5 to describe the seasonal trend in precipitation fourthly in order to compare the performance of era5 under different land cover types the era5 grids are distinguished as urban vegetation and water grids according to the land cover data since the spatial resolution of globeland30 is much finer than that of era5 land and era5 hres we regard the land cover type with the largest area within an era5 grid as the type of this grid grids with the land cover type of artificial surfaces are considered as urban grids grids with the type of cultivated land forest grass land and shrubland are regarded as vegetation grids and those with the type of water body are deemed as water grids on this basis we also calculate the artificial surface area proportion for urban grids which is applied to further study the era5 performance differences within urban areas besides to investigate the ability of era5 to describe the spatial distribution of precipitation we compare the precipitation distribution patterns obtained by era5 land and era5 hres with those obtained by interpolation based on gauge records the interpolation is performed using the nearest neighbor method ordinary kriging and co kriging with three topographic factors of slope aspect and elevation as auxiliary variables since the spatial distribution obtained by the three methods is similar fig s1 the result of nearest neighbor method is used as an example for illustration we choose august 30 august and 30 august 6 00 00 which have the greatest amount of precipitation during the study period as cases to be analyzed at monthly daily and hourly scale respectively and we also compare the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution on 6 january the day of maximum precipitation in the dry season and 30 august to investigate the differences in era5 performance across seasons 3 2 evaluation metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of the performance of era5 precipitation products this paper selects metrics for evaluation in terms of estimation accuracy and detection capability the world meteorological organization wmo has given a short definition of some scores and illustrated whether they are considered to be highly recommended recommended or worth a try brown et al 2004 considering the recommendations from the wmo six highly recommended metrics are chosen three accuracy metrics i e relative bias rb correlation coefficient corr and root mean square error rmse as well as three detection metrics i e the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the equitable threat score ets accuracy metrics are used to assess the accuracy of era5 precipitation estimations rb is the difference between era5 and gauge data as a proportion of gauge observation it allows us to know whether era5 estimations are drier or wetter as well as the magnitude of that deviation relative to the true precipitation 0 rb and rb 0 indicate the overestimation and underestimation of era5 respectively corr measures the linear relationship between era5 and gauge data the range of corr is 1 to 1 as the corr value is closer to 1 the linear agreement between the time series of era5 estimations and that of the real precipitation is better rmse represents the overall error magnitude relative to gauge observations it is sensitive to precipitation intensity and errors larger rmse indicates larger mean error value of era5 and the estimation accuracy of era5 is best when rmse 0 the expression of these metrics are as follows 1 rb i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 2 corr i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x represents era5 grid estimations y denotes the averages of gauge observations in the grids and n is the total number of era5 estimates considering that the error magnitude may be sensitive to precipitation magnitude the rmse divided by the corresponding real precipitation rmse p is adopted instead of rmse for analyzing the performance under different land cover types detection metrics are used to evaluate the ability of era5 to detect the occurrence of precipitation pod measures the proportion of events correctly detected and is equivalent to the hit rate of era5 the closer the pod is to 1 the more real rainfall events can be detected by era5 far is the proportion of events detected by era5 but did not actually occur which is equivalent to the false detection rate it is in the range of 0 to 1 the closer its value is to 0 the fewer the number of events falsely detected by era5 ets gives the fraction of correct detection after considering the random hit probability it ranges from 1 3 to 1 a larger ets score indicates a better overall detection capability of era5 ets reaches the optimal score of 1 when era5 has no false and missed detection of rainfall events ets 0 indicates that era5 does not have the ability to correctly detect rainfall events the metrics are calculated as follows 4 pod h h m 5 far f h f 6 ets h h e h m f h e h e h m h f h m f c where h is the number of events observed by both gauge averages and era5 m is the number of events observed by gauge averages but not by era5 f is the opposite of m c is the events not observed by gauge averages and era5 h e denotes the number of events correctly detected by era5 due to randomness to eliminate the undue influence of very light drizzle 0 1 mm h 1 li et al 2020 and 1 mm d 1 territory et al 2013 are chosen as thresholds instead of 0 for distinguishing the occurrence and absence of rainfall events at hourly and daily scale respectively besides we use the probability density functions pdf skill score pdf ss proposed by perkins et al 2007 to assess the capability of era5 to reproduce the frequency distribution of precipitation under different precipitation intensity levels the closer the pdf ss is to 1 the closer the precipitation frequency distribution described by the era5 product is to the real case the score is calculated as follows 7 pdf ss 1 n i 1 n m i n n g n e where n is the total number of precipitation events n is the number of precipitation intensity levels n e and n g are the number of events within the i th precipitation intensity level obtained by the era5 grid and the averages of gauge observations in the grids respectively the intensity classification standard is described in section 3 3 3 3 precipitation intensity classification standard in order to investigate the performance of era5 under different precipitation intensity in more detail we grade the precipitation intensity and then calculate the frequency of era5 estimates and gauge observations as well as the value of each metric at each precipitation intensity level for hourly scale precipitation is divided into six grades of 0 1 mm h 1 0 1 1 mm h 1 1 2 5 mm h 1 2 5 8 mm h 1 8 16 mm h 1 and greater than 16 mm h 1 corresponding to no trace rain light rain moderate rain heavy rain rainstorm and heavy rainstorm according to the classification standard of li et al 2020 in the similar region for daily scale precipitation is classified into six levels of 0 1 mm d 1 0 1 1 mm d 1 1 2 mm d 1 2 10 mm d 1 10 50 mm d 1 and 50 mm d 1 corresponding to no trace rain tiny rain light rain moderate rain heavy rain and violent rain referring to the wmo standard tan et al 2015 3 4 spatial statistical analysis for a more intuitive insight into the ability of era5 to describe precipitation in different parts of the study area we use spatial correlation and local autocorrelation methods as an aid to evaluate the performance of the two products at the grid scale firstly we calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients ρ between the precipitation distributions obtained by the era5 products and gauge interpolation data at corresponding times to investigate the capability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution the method is also used to detect the spatial similarity of the performance of the two products this coefficient is a rank correlation method that can better measure the similarity between spatial trends it is calculated as follows 8 ρ 1 6 x i y i 2 n 3 n where x i and y i represent the corresponding sequence number of the era5 grid estimations and gauge interpolation records after sorting by precipitation amount from smallest to largest respectively n denotes the number of grids since the sizes of the era5 hres and era land grids are different we resample the era5 hres grids to the same size as era land and gauge interpolation grids before analysis then we employ the getis ord g i spatial hot spot statistical analysis model to acquire the spatial cold and hot spots for each metric of era5 which can provide aids for analyzing the spatial distribution of era5 performance based on the getis ord g i score this method calculates the g i value approximately equal to the z score of each grid to determine the high value and low value aggregation areas the g i value is calculated as follows 9 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 x j 1 n x j n s j 1 n x j 2 n x 2 where x j is the metric value of grid j w i j denotes the spatial weight between grid i and grid j and n represents the number of grids for statistically significant positive g i the higher the value the tighter the high value clustering hot spots while for statistically significant negative g i the lower the value the tighter the low value clustering cold spots 3 5 necessity of a high density gauge network in this paper a dense rain gauge network is used to evaluate the performance of era5 to prove the importance of this network we compare the assessment results obtained by using different numbers 1 5 10 15 of gauge stations in all era5 hres grids containing more than 15 stations see sect 5 2 for each grid the metric averages of all stations are calculated after spatial matching using s2g then evaluation metrics are calculated based on the randomly selected 5 10 and all stations from the 15 gauges by matching via sa the step of randomly picking 5 or 10 stations and calculating metrics is repeated 500 times these 500 calculation results are averaged to produce the final evaluation results of 5 and 10 stations the final average results obtained from 1 5 10 and 15 stations are compared to analyze the evaluation differences in using different numbers of stations 4 results 4 1 overall performance at regional scale we evaluate the overall performance of era5 at regional scale both across the study area and within the gba since their results are similar here we take the results of the gba as illustration and the results of the whole study area can be found in the supplementary material figs s2 s4 and table s1 s3 fig 2 illustrates the total monthly precipitation for the gba it can be clearly seen that era5 can reproduce the seasonal trend of precipitation well in the study area both era5 land and era hres records show that the precipitation is relatively low from january to march increasing from april to june with a slight decrease in july and followed by a rise in august and a steady decline this seasonal trend is consistent with gauge observations as well as the dry and wet seasons rainfall distribution characteristics of the study area however precipitation is obviously overestimated by era5 land for the majority of months in contrast era5 hres can provide precipitation that is more in line with the real situation and has better estimation capability at monthly scale the evaluation results of the two era5 products in the gba at regional scale are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively at hourly scale the performance of the two products is not very satisfactory but comparatively speaking era5 hres delivers much better results than era5 land in metrics except for pod for estimation accuracy era5 land overestimates precipitation and the magnitude of the wet bias is more than one third of the true precipitation the linear agreement between the time series of era5 land estimates and gauge observations is also weak as corr values are 0 25 in all periods compared to era5 land era5 hres has a higher correlation coefficient and smaller overestimation magnitude showing a much greater ability to reproduce hourly rainfall amount regarding detection metrics era5 land seems to be good at capturing precipitation events but also prone to misreporting rainfall events as both pod and far values are high considering that a large fraction of the actual rainfall events detected by era5 land is captured due to randomness the ets scores are very low indicating the overall poor detecting capacity of era5 land in comparison although era5 hres has lower pod scores it misdetects fewer rainfall events far 0 72 resulting in a more significant advantage in overall detecting ability as its ets scores being almost twice as high as those of era5 land the performance of the two era5 products is better at daily scale indicated by the increase in corr pod ets and decrease in rmse and far this finding illustrates the deficiencies in the characterization of the diurnal cycle by era5 in contrast era5 hres can better describe the diurnal cycle as evidenced by the greater improvement of era5 land and the smaller differences between metrics of the two products at daily scale in general although era5 land has more spatial details it is less effective in offering accurate precipitation information over short periods at hourly and daily scales than era5 hres additionally the two products both perform relatively better in the dry season than in the wet suggesting that era5 is better at modeling the dry season frontal precipitation rather than the large amount of small scale convective precipitation that occurs in summer table 3 listed the pdf ss for era5 land and era5 hres precipitation product in the gba at hourly scale the two products can produce similar precipitation frequency distribution patterns with gauge records throughout the study period as their pdf ss scores are both higher than 0 7 for different seasons the distribution patterns reproduced by era5 are more accurate in the dry season than in the wet in addition the precipitation frequency distribution described by era5 hres is slightly closer to the real situation than era5 land the results at daily scale are similar to these at hourly scale but comparatively the frequency distribution patterns obtained by the era5 products at daily scale are less consistent with those by gauge observations which may result from the accumulation of hourly frequency estimate errors for different precipitation intensity levels as well as the incomplete correspondence between the hourly and daily scale intensity classification standard fig 3 displays the metrics under different precipitation intensities at hourly scale the change of metrics with precipitation intensity for era5 land and era5 hres are similar with respect to the accuracy metrics rb has an overall change from overestimation to underestimation as precipitation intensity increases with the turning point appearing at 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 corr and rmse have a generally declining and rising trend respectively suggesting that the greater the precipitation intensity the weaker the linear relationship between era5 estimations and gauge observations and the larger the era5 estimation error magnitude but relatively speaking the changes of corr and rmse in the range of 2 5 mm h 1 are not very significant for detection metrics the lower bound of the range for each level is used as the threshold for metric calculation overall the higher the intensity the lower the pod and the higher the far this finding indicates that era5 requires improvement in capturing actual heavy rainfall events ets also achieves the best score in the range of 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 due to the relatively high hit rate and low misdetection rate in this range generally speaking both era5 land and era5 hres has the best performance in the range of 0 1 2 5 mm h 1 i e light and moderate rain as shown in fig 4 the changes of rb rmse pod far and ets versus precipitation intensity are generally similar to those at hourly scale yet the best performance of era5 land and era5 hres occurs in the range of 2 50 mm d 1 also refer to moderate rain in which corr also has a significant peak such difference in the change of corr at daily and hourly scale reflects that era5 cannot capture the exact time of rainfall events in the diurnal cycle to some extent 4 2 performance in urban and non urban areas precipitation affects the management and development of cities and in turn urban areas may have an impact on precipitation lowry 1998 thus the ability of era5 to detect and estimate precipitation may differ among urban and non urban areas consequently performance differences of era5 land and era5 hres under urban vegetation and water land cover types are further analyzed in this paper as the results are similar at hourly and daily scales the findings at hourly scale are presented here as an illustration and the daily results are placed in the supplementary material figs s6 s8 and table s5 fig 5 presents the differences of each metric under different land cover types for the whole 2018 the dry season and the wet season with regard to the entire study period both era5 land and era5 hres give the most accurate estimates in urban areas as evidenced by notably smaller rb and rmse p as well as larger corr except for a higher corr score of era5 land for water the two products deliver better results for all other metrics in vegetation than water areas in terms of detection metrics era5 land and era5 hres have a slight advantage in urban over vegetation and show the weakest capability in water areas however era5 does not always perform better in urban areas in the wet season the two era5 products still offer superior capability in urban areas but in the dry season they model precipitation most effectively in vegetation areas instead of the urban this finding reveals that there exists certain seasonality in the performance differences of era5 between urban and vegetation areas additionally era5 consistently performs the most poorly in water areas which occurs in both the dry and wet seasons suggesting that it is relatively difficult for era5 to provide accurate precipitation information for water we also analyze the performance differences of era5 within the urban areas as exhibited in fig 6 the ability of era5 to describe precipitation generally becomes weaker as the artificial surface area proportion increases reflecting the deficiencies in the characterization of precipitation in urban grids with higher urbanization levels by era5 compared to era5 land era5 hres has a more notable decreasing tendency of rainfall modeling capacity besides we also conduct the analysis in the dry and wet seasons using corr and ets as proxies for accuracy and detection metrics the result reveals that the performance differences within urban areas are similar in the two seasons fig s5 but the urban effect seems comparatively weaker in the wet season 4 3 performance at the grid scale in addition to regional scale we also analyze the performance of era5 at the grid scale as described in sect 3 1 we select august 30 august and 30 august 6 00 00 as cases at monthly daily and hourly scale to analyze the ability of era5 land and era5 hres to describe the spatial distribution pattern of precipitation besides we take 6 january and 30 august as examples to investigate the performance differences between the dry and wet seasons fig 7 displays the precipitation spatial distribution given by the two era5 products at the three temporal scales benefiting from its finer spatial resolution era5 land provides spatial information on rainfall with more details however in general the spatial patterns reproduced by era5 land and era5 hres are consistent at all temporal scales as illustrated in fig 7 c precipitation in august has a decreasing trend from the southeast coast to the northern mountains despite systematic overestimation era5 land generally captures this pattern well with only more overestimation of precipitation in the northernmost mountains resulting in two small high value zones there era5 hres also characterizes the pattern correctly but it significantly underestimates the precipitation along the southern coast and does not clearly depict the three low value zones in the north and west due to its coarser resolution at daily scale both era5 land and era5 hres generally reproduce the true precipitation pattern but their obtained high value zones of precipitation are located in the south central plain and tend to expand to the northeast compared to the real pattern the spatial distributions obtained by era5 and gauges differ more at hourly scale at 30 august 6 00 00 era5 land noticeably underestimates the high intensity precipitation and provides greater precipitation in the eastern mountains than in most coastal areas which is not consistent with reality for era5 hres it yields two high value zones in the west that are not really present or larger than actual based on these results we further calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients to more directly assess the ability of era5 to simulate precipitation distribution as indicated in table 4 the patterns obtained by era5 at monthly scales are in good agreement with the real patterns with spatial correlation coefficients exceeding 0 75 at the daily and hourly scales however the values of coefficient drop below 0 5 generally neither era5 land nor era5 hres is very good at describing the precipitation spatial distribution over short periods we also extracted the large urban agglomeration area outlined by red lines in fig 7 in the study area to observe the performance of era5 within the urban area at all the three temporal scales the urban area is characterized by more precipitation in the southern offshore areas and relatively less precipitation in the north within this area the patterns depicted by era5 land and era5 hres are generally consistent with the interpolation results despite the bias of precipitation estimations it can be noted that the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation spatial distribution is relatively better in the urban area to further evaluate the difference in the ability of era5 to reproduce precipitation distribution across seasons we pick two days with maximum daily precipitation in the dry 6 january and wet seasons 30 august as cases to compare the patterns obtained by era5 and rain gauge interpolation as illustrated in fig 8 the patterns depicted by era5 land and era5 hres agrees better with the reality on 6 january than on 30 august according to fig 8 c on 6 january the first and second high value zones of precipitation are located in the east and northwest corners of the study area respectively and there is a gradually decreasing spatial trend of precipitation from northeast to southwest despite providing a smaller high value zone in the east and overestimating the precipitation in the northwest corner era5 land well simulates the precipitation spatial trend in contrast the distribution pattern obtained by era5 hres is more accurate although there is an overall underestimation of precipitation in general the ability of era5 to describe precipitation distribution is better in the dry season than in the wet which is also reflected in table 4 as the spatial correlation coefficients for both era5 products are greater on 6 january than on 30 august this finding is consistent with the results of section 4 1 suggesting that era5 may be better at modeling frontal precipitation than convective precipitation fig 9 displays the spatial distribution of evaluation metrics for the whole 2018 at hourly scale and the corresponding hot and cold spot distributions are shown in fig s9 to check whether the spatial distributions of the performance of the two era5 products are similar we also calculate the spatial spearman correlation coefficients between the spatial distributions of the corresponding metrics for era5 land and era5 hres which are presented in table 5 since the daily precipitation is obtained cumulatively from the hourly observations and the spatial patterns of metrics are similar at the two temporal scales the results at hourly scale are presented here as an illustration see fig 10 according to table 5 almost all the spatial correlation coefficients between corresponding era5 land and era5 hres metrics are greater than 0 6 which indicates era5 land and era5 hres show similar spatial distribution characteristics of performance specifically for accuracy metrics rb is found the lowest in the southern coastal areas and higher in the western northernmost and north eastern of the study area in contrast corr has an overall opposite spatial distribution with its high value zone distributed in the south central areas and low value zones located in the west notably rmse has a similar distribution pattern with corr which indicates that era5 has a larger mean error magnitude in the coastal area such spatial distribution of rmse is possibly due to the overall greater precipitation in coastal areas than in mountains closer to the inland for detection metrics pod is relatively low in the western and eastern mountains far has a large high value zone in the west while ets has better scores in the east and the south coast areas considering estimation and detection capability together era5 performs best in the southern coastal areas where the large urban agglomeration is located the detection results of cold and hot spots also support this finding fig s9 the results are in line with the findings above that both era5 land and era5 hres have better performance in urban areas for the entire study period by further analyzing the spatial distribution of metrics within the urban agglomeration it can be found that the heterogeneity of the three accuracy metrics for the two products is low in the urban area in terms of detection capability era5 land has a better hit rate in the southeast corner of the urban area but the misdetection rate is also higher in several grids along the eastern edge of the urban agglomeration therefore the ets score of era5 land generally achieves optimal values in the southern corner of the urban agglomeration for era5 hres far shows little variation within the urban but pod has relatively higher values in the southeast corner where ets thus has better scores overall the ability of era5 to detect and estimate precipitation does not differ significantly in different parts of the urban area but may be slightly better in the southern coast since there is a seasonality in the performance differences of era5 under different land cover types as discussed above here we use corr and ets as proxies for accuracy and detection metrics to analyze the seasonality in the spatial distribution of era5 performance the spatial distributions of corr and ets for the two era5 products are similar as their spatial correlation coefficient values are high regardless of the season however the distributions of the same metric differ in the dry and wet seasons in the dry season the spatial distribution of corr and ets are similar with lower values in the southwestern corner and the southern coastal area during the wet season both corr and ets have better scores in the south central plain the corresponding hotspot analysis results also show such patterns fig s10 it follows that the ability of era5 land and era5 hres to estimate precipitation and capture rainfall events is better in the northern mountains in the dry season and becomes better in the south central area in the wet season yet within the large urban agglomeration seasonal differences in the spatial distribution of corr and ets are not very significant 5 discussion 5 1 modeling ability of era5 the evaluation results in sect 4 show that era5 can reproduce the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation at monthly scale but is not very good at detecting rainfall events and estimating precipitation magnitude at hourly and daily scales this finding is consistent with the study of zandler et al 2019 in general era5 overestimates hourly and daily scale precipitation which is also in agreement with some previous studies sharifi et al 2019 tarek et al 2020 yazdandoost et al 2020 zandler et al 2019 in terms of capturing rainfall events era5 tends to misidentify non precipitation events as rainfall events leading to its overall overestimation of precipitation and poor detection capability such misdetection is a common problem of reanalysis products as several previous research pointed out that reanalysis products tend to overestimate precipitation frequency beck et al 2017 hénin et al 2018 skok et al 2016 stephens et al 2010 zolina et al 2004 despite the optimization of relevant parameters such as convection and subgrid turbulent mixing hersbach et al 2020 sandu et al 2013 era5 still suffers from this common flaw which would cause spurious drizzle and lead to misdetection lopez 2007 skok et al 2016 it is also suggested that era5 tends to over compensate for the production of dry bias by era interim in humid areas amjad et al 2020 which might be another reason for the overestimation in the study area for different seasons era5 is better at describing dry season frontal precipitation than local short lived convective precipitation in the wet season which is one of the features of reanalysis products ebert et al 2007 gottschalck et al 2005 ruane roads 2007 similar to the results of tang et al 2020 we find deficiencies in the characterization of the diurnal cycle by era5 through analyzing the performance under different precipitation intensities figs 3 4 we notice that era5 has the best capability to estimate and detect moderate intensity rain which is also shown in the findings of kolluru et al 2020 it is due to the fact that era5 generally underestimates the frequency of no trace rain as well as the frequency and precipitation magnitude of actual high intensity rain which is associated with model uncertainty beck et al 2017 as mentioned above the ability of era5 to model no trace rain is insufficient because of the high misdetection rate and for high intensity rain era5 fails to describe the precipitation occurrence and magnitude mainly because gridded products have difficulty in accurately describing heavy rainfall events existing at microscopic scales ahmed et al 2019 pour et al 2014 despite the finer spatial resolution era5 land does not characterize precipitation any better than era5 hres and even provides greater overestimation magnitude and poorer overall detection results which is mainly associated with the more significant defect of era5 land to overestimate precipitation frequency as shown in the evaluation results this might be attributed to the fact that era5 land is a single simulation without coupling to the atmospheric model sabater 2019 the design makes running era5 land computationally affordable but with a certain loss of simulation accuracy analysis of the performance under different land cover types reveals that for the whole 2018 the results of the three land cover type grids in order from best to worst are that of urban vegetation and water this might be related to the geographic location and topographic conditions of these grids as many studies have pointed out that the performance of gridded precipitation products can be affected by topography complexity ebert et al 2007 feng et al 2021 isotta et al 2015 as well as the location of the land and sea jiang et al 2017 lockhoff et al 2019 we have analyzed the performance of era5 versus elevation fig s11 aspect fig s12 and slope fig s13 in the study area overall era5 may have a weaker estimation and detection capability in areas with more complex topography although the individual effects of topographic factors are not strong due to the relatively low topographic complexity over the study area this finding is shown in several previous studies evaluating era5 and some other precipitation products amjad et al 2020 beck et al 2019 sharifi et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is mainly due to the fact that the northeast to southwest mountains with higher altitude and greater slope can contribute to the development of orographic precipitation by lifting moisture from the southern ocean this kind of precipitation has stronger spatio temporal heterogeneity and is challenging to simulate tucker 2005 the location of the land and sea may also has an impact on the performance of era5 as some previous studies suggested caracciolo et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 lockhoff et al 2019 rahmawati and lubczynski 2018 offshore areas especially coastal shores and inshore sea surface are affected by coastline effects and would have a more complex land sea breeze circulation and coastal convection systems which will increase the difficulty for precipitation modeling in the study area of this paper urban grids are mainly distributed in the southern plain most of the water grids are seawater at the border of ocean and land except for a few scattered among the urban vegetation grids are those other than urban and water and all of the northern mountains are classified as vegetation strongly influenced by coastal effects the performance of water grids is relatively poor regardless of the entire study period dry or wet seasons for vegetation grids located in mountains farther away from the shoreline the precipitation is not only mainly influenced by the heat difference between the land and the adjacent ocean but also by topography and atmospheric stability bergemann et al 2015 therefore it is challenging to detect and estimate the precipitation for these grids which may impact the overall simulation performance of all the vegetation grids comparatively urban grids clustering in the southern plain generally perform better because they are moderately affected by coastal effects and topography the spatial distribution characteristics of performance are consistent with the assessment results under different land cover types which is also a result of the combined influence of coastal effects and topography in addition we find seasonality in the performance differences between urban and vegetation areas and in the spatial distribution of performance this finding might be associated with the different causes of wet and dry season rainfall as well as the relative spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation in the mountains compared to the plain in the dry season when precipitation is mainly due to seasonal shifts in pressure and wind zones mountains far from the sea are less affected by the combined effects of land sea heat difference and topography making detection and estimation uncertainties greater in offshore plain than mountains in the wet season the spatio temporal heterogeneity of precipitation in the mountains increases under the influence of summer monsoon thus era5 performs worse compared to the urban plain area analysis focusing on the performance differences within urban areas shows that precipitation of urban grids with higher urbanization levels is more challenging to model this is related to the increased precipitation heterogeneity caused by factors including high roughness of artificial surfaces urban thermal effects change of water vapor condition on the urban underlying surface and increased anthropogenic aerosol release cotton and pielke 2007 shepherd 2005 shepherd and burian 2003 simpson et al 2008 wan et al 2015 in the wet season when convective precipitation is active these factors contribute less significantly to the precipitation heterogeneity than in the dry season resulting in a weaker look of the urban effect compared to era5 land the performance decreasing trend of era5 hres urban grids with increasing urbanization levels is more notable which is probably due to the coarser spatial resolution of era5 hres and the more pronounced increase in the heterogeneity of precipitation within grids moreover we also discuss the era5 assessment results obtained from some other newer metrics table s6 including kge score gupta et al 2009 kling et al 2012 error decomposition indices hbias mbias and fbias tian et al 2009 and so on tables s7 and s8 give the performance of the two era5 products at regional scale derived from the newer metrics and figs s14 s18 show the era5 ability to describe precipitation given by the newer metrics for different precipitation intensities different land cover types different artificial surface area proportions and different parts of the study area generally results yielded by classical and newer metrics are similar 5 2 importance of a high density gauge network for evaluation it has been suggested that a sparse gauge network persistently underestimates the performance of gridded precipitation products tang et al 2018 in order to demonstrate the necessity of the dense ground based gauge network in this paper we perform an analysis with the approach mentioned in sect 3 4 since the results at daily and hourly scales are similar the findings at hourly scale are used here as an illustration table 6 compares the evaluation results obtained from different numbers of gauge stations overall the more stations are used for evaluation the better the performance of era5 hres is obtained this comes from the fact that gridded product estimates characterize the precipitation within the grid cells and gauge records at single points cannot perfectly represent this areal precipitation in contrast the averages of the densely distributed gauge observations can better reflect a mix of valleys slopes and peaks precipitation within the grid cells zandler et al 2019 among the accuracy metrics rb shows the most significant change with the number of stations being used decreasing by more than 70 2 when the number of stations used for evaluation increases from 1 to 15 corr has a moderate change magnitude about 19 7 and rmse has a relatively low one about 0 88 the rb calculated from the multi station averages is a product obtained by offsetting the dry and wet bias calculated from single station observations to some extent and thus has a greater change compared to rmse which represents the error magnitude the reason for the increasing corr with the number of stations is that the time of the same rainfall event occurring at each station in a grid may differ slightly and the use of the multi station average can smooth this difference resulting in a better linear agreement between the gridded product estimations and gauge observations regarding the detection metrics the change of ets is the most notable about 36 5 while that of pod about 3 8 and far about 12 6 are not very significant by comparison as many rainfall events may occur at scales smaller than the grid there are local rainfall events within the grids sharifi et al 2016 such local rainfall events are more likely to be observed by gauges when there are more stations in the grids in the case in which era5 hres tends to misreport no trace rain as rainfall events far values would be lower when calculated using multi station averages that capture the local rainfall in addition the multi station average can avoid the measurement uncertainty caused by factors such as instrument degradation and human operation at a single station therefore using more stations for evaluation can result in slightly higher pod values with increasing hit rate and decreasing misdetection rate ets score which represents the overall detection capability shows a greater increase magnitude than pod and far following the analysis above data from a high density gauge network is necessary for accurate evaluation on the era5 precipitation products because the densely distributed observations can help to reduce evaluation error and uncertainty caused by the sparsity of gauges notably according to this finding the study of the relationship between era5 performance and urbanization level in section 4 2 may be influenced by the number of stations however in general the grids we used with a smaller artificial surface area proportion contain a relatively less number of stations fig s19 which would lead to a certain underestimation of performance still our results indicate that the ability of era5 to describe precipitation degrades in areas with high urbanization levels therefore the relationship between era5 performance and urbanization level found in the paper is reliable 6 conclusions precipitation is a key parameter that can reflect the environmental conditions of the land surface so it is necessary to obtain accurate and timely information on precipitation especially that of urban areas era5 an advanced reanalysis product has a greater potential to reproduce urban precipitation than other precipitation gridded products due to its fine spatial and temporal resolution as well as a series of improvements in the numerical simulation therefore it is important to understand the capability of era5 to model urban precipitation at fine temporal scales in order to investigate the strength and weakness of era5 in urban areas this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of era5 land and era5 hres in a local region of the south central guangdong province which includes the gba using observations from a high density gauge network in 2018 the evaluation is carried out based on three accuracy metrics and three detection metrics at multiple spatial regional and grid and temporal hourly and daily scales besides we also compare the performance differences of era5 under different land cover types urban vegetation and water and within urban areas the conclusions are as follows 1 era5 products can describe the spatial distribution and temporal trend of precipitation at monthly scale but generally they fail to model precipitation over short periods at hourly and daily scale properly which is mainly caused by their model uncertainty and tendency to overestimate the frequency of precipitation 2 despite the finer spatial resolution era5 land without coupling with atmospheric models provides less accurate precipitation information compared to era5 hres 3 regarding different precipitation intensities era5 products have the best ability to estimate and detect moderate intensity rain 4 considering different land cover types for the whole of 2018 the best to worst performance of era5 occurs in the order of urban areas in the southern plain vegetation in the northern mountains and seawater at the border of ocean and land the same finding is obtained in the wet season but during the dry season era5 products deliver better results in the northern mountainous vegetation than urban areas due to the different causes of dry and wet seasons precipitation 5 focusing on the inner urban areas era5 has deficiencies in modeling precipitation in areas with higher urbanization levels in summary the ability of era5 especially era5 land to reproduce precipitation characteristics needs to be further improved to provide more accurate information on the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation in coastal urban areas with high storm and flood risk to the best of our knowledge this paper is the first study to evaluate the performance of era5 precipitation products in a coastal urban area based on observations from a high density gauge network it fills the research gap of the error characteristics of era5 land and makes a comparison between two era5 products era5 land and era5 hres with different spatial resolution providing a useful reference for the rational applications of era5 7 data availability the rain gauge observation

4246,land use is a key factor affecting water balance which in turn affects the water resource availability increasing urbanization has altered water balances in river catchments although urbanization impacts have been widely investigated most studies focus on changes in land use area and the percent imperviousness of urban piu is typically downplayed or ignored piu is altered by permeable areas within urban regions being replaced by impervious ones and can influence the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of its flows in urban locales in this study we consider the increase in urban area piu due to urbanization and focus on the piu s impact on water balances we utilize the soil and water assessment tool to describe the piu s impact on long term 1970s 2010s water balances in a same catchment with different urbanization levels and quantify these characteristics on spatial and time scales with a combination of remote sensing and numerous hydrological and geographical data we demonstrate that 1 increasing urban piu has a significant influence on the balance of urban water resources with an increase to 0 17 causing the urban surface runoff ratio to increase by 0 2 2 the impact of piu on surface runoff and baseflows is sometimes more important than area changes in a catchment especially for those in settings characterized by rapid urbanization thus we note that piu changes directly affect the water balance and enhance the impacts of area changes fundamentally in the study of water resource management in urban settings or catchments in these the piu is a highly important variable to consider keywords land use change urban density urbanization surface runoff swat 1 introduction between 1960 and 2018 the global urban population rose from 1 billion to 4 2 billion with freshwater resources requirements more than doubling wada et al 2013 world bank 2020 urbanization has been a worldwide trend and moved at unprecedented speeds in recent decades which has impacted global freshwater resources kimaro et al 2003 onodera 2011 steffen et al 2015 doveri et al 2015 buettner 2015 liu et al 2020 the key reason for this is land use change arising from anthropogenic activities gatwaza et al 2016 land use change refers to changes in usage of land surfaces and is a key factor affecting water resources and the environment calder 1993 and sometimes makes the impact on water resources greater than that of climate change levy et al 2018 ma et al 2019 saidi and ridwansyah 2019 research on land use change primarily focuses on the area aspect fohrer et al 2001 baker and miller 2013 changes of percent imperviousness of urban regions piu similar to changes in urban building density is a rarely discussed aspect particularly in the context of water resources management research if the area change is qualitative between different land use types then piu change is quantitative within the same land use type and also affects the water balance especially in urban settings shuster et al 2005 to fully analyze the impact of urbanization on the water balance changes in both area and piu must be considered piu refers to the number of impervious areas in a unit area and is usually expressed as a fraction of the total impervious area in urban environmental research arnold and gibbons 1996 in the process of urbanization different policies will inevitably lead to differences in urban hydrology roesner et al 2001 for different urban areas piu effectively influences the hydrological characteristics difference between or within cities and reflects different features in the surface runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge processes panos et al 2018 litvak et al 2017 tubau et al 2017 changes that increase impervious areas include the following constructing apartment blocks instead of houses with yards impervious parking lots and paved asphalt roads urbanization development redevelopment processes in addition rainwater management policies alter water transmission processes in urban areas shuster and rhea 2013 because highly developed cities and poorly developed rural areas are usually classified as urban or construction land piu has been understudied in previous long term land use change research astuti et al 2019 however piu is paramount in urban hydrology or flooding modeling research rodriguez et al 2005 cantone and schmidt 2011 high piu can more easily suffer flooding because of greater generated overland flow boquet 2015 to study the impacts of long term land use change on water balance the differing degrees of urbanization reflected by piu in different periods should be considered this includes the piu difference between different cities and that in the same city at different periods water resource management must be restricted by water balance as this determines the water quantity involved in water circulation within a given area generally only precipitation and the streamflow can be directly observed with only these observational data it is difficult to thoroughly study the differences in each process in the water cycle kayane and takeuchi 1971 taniguchi 1994 cook 2013 minnig et al 2018 compared to other methods hydrological models can directly analyze the impact of land use change on water balance and attain more practical results naef et al 2002 compared to mike products swat requires fewer input data which makes it easier to use devia et al 2015 compared to the variable infiltration capacity model swat presents a better runoff response assessment of the impact of land use change hu et al 2007 and swat is capable of long term continuous simulations at the catchment scale including urban runoff jacobson 2011 however differences in piu are not reflected in swat if piu information is not defined by the user piu values were overlooked by not only swat users but also by other modeling researchers who focused on the impact of long term changes in land use because a land use map typically lacks piu information but the necessary piu information can be obtained by remote sensing or other methods now bauer et al 2007 weng 2012 remote sensing enables more realistic descriptions of catchments when constructing hydrological models is widely used in the simulation and calculations of hydrological environments but the piu information has not included in their models to distinguish urbanization processes lin et al 2008 yang et al 2014 wu and chen 2015 dang and kumar 2017 mehan et al 2017 parajuli et al 2018 martínez salvador and conesa garcía 2020 although individual studies have noted the impact of piu the percent imperviousness they refer to is not separated from land use area change which is not the percent imperviousness of urban region settings but the percent imperviousness of catchments brun and band 2000 hatt et al 2004 hardison et al 2009 shao et al 2019 some urban hydrological models such as peri urban model for landscape management model or storm water management model can quantify the hydrological characteristics of cities well but these tools are less suitable for assessing long term continuous land use change at large catchment scales than swat trinh and chui 2013 jankowfsky et al 2014 perin et al 2020 the impact and significance of urban piu on long term water balance in urbanized catchments still unclear the relationship between area expansion and the impact of piu increases on water balance is also unclear it is highly important to quantify the piu and its dynamic impact on the water balance of urban areas and catchments and useful for the management and control of the water resources of urban and catchment areas mcgrane 2016 since previous studies have ignored piu in favor of total urban area within the model framework for assessing changes of long term land use change in this study we aim to build more credible swat models that can reflect the changes in both area and piu in the long term on the catchment scale and evaluate the changes in water balance influenced by urbanization particularly we address how might piu impact urban and catchment water balance especially accompanied by the detailed time evolution of urban density increasing to answer these we utilized multiple land use situations for different periods to simulate the hydrological scenario and aimed to quantify the impacts of piu on water balance 2 materials methods 2 1 study catchment the yamato river catchment fig 1 covers 1077 km2 and has been an important crop production base in western japan since the 1600s ogasawara 1955 ukita 1957 shimizu et al 2013 average annual precipitation over the last 50 years was approximately 1400 mm the region s rich groundwater resources were a major factor in its agricultural development taniguchi 1994 in recent decades however agricultural land has gradually given way cities in the course of rapid urbanization and increasing population hirata et al 1999 the urbanization processes in the catchment have been clearly apparent since the 1970s hoshino 1996 in the 1970s the area s paddy fields covered 294 km2 and accounted for 27 of the catchment with urban sprawl covering 182 km2 and accounting for approximately 17 of the catchment fig 2 by the 2010s the latter had increased to 317 km2 and accounted for 29 of the total catchment area the urbanization rate was 3 13 per decade whereas the paddy field area s growth was 3 05 from the 1970s 2010s the catchment s total population grew from 1 630 000 to 2 150 000 yamato river water environment council 2016 constituting an increase of approximately 30 it should be noted that nara city located in the northeastern region of study catchment is an ancient cultural region compared to other areas its urbanization rate was lower with the expansion of the urban area and rapid development of cities around sakai a significant increase in piu also occurred in the yamato river catchment onodera et al 2013 the fraction of the total impervious urban area continued to increase over these 50 years and was typical of development processes from a low piu urban domain to a high piu one 2 2 soil and water assessment tool the swat is a catchment scale model developed by the usda agricultural research service usda 1980 to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediments and agricultural chemical yields in large complex catchments with varying soil land use and management conditions over long periods of time the swat simulates canopy interception infiltration evapotranspiration soil water surface runoff groundwater recharge and streamflow the water balance equation that governs the land phase of the swat s hydrological cycle is given by eq 1 neitsch et al 2011 1 sw t s w 0 i 1 t

balance equations can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 swat enables urban bmp functions such as drainage systems and distinguishes the hydrological response characteristics of different cities by employing piu and percent imperviousness directly connected to drainage systems pic pic reflects the coverage of urban rainwater drainage these two parameters describe the spatial flow patterns of water and the hydraulic efficiency of urban flows for directly connected impervious areas a curve number of 98 is a default setting in swat for disconnected impervious pervious areas a composite curve number is calculated and used in surface runoff calculations the equations used to calculate the composite curve number for disconnected impervious pervious

hru as the catchment configuration the topography data was sourced from the shuttle radar topography mission of united states geological survey with a spatial resolution of 30 m https earthexplorer usgs gov land use and soil data were then obtained from the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit with a spatial resolution of 100 m and slope data was calculated from the dem data https nlftp mlit go jp land use maps for 1976 1987 1997 2006 and 2016 were used to estimate the effect of land use change and were categorized as paddy fields upland fields forest wasteland urban road water lawn and others the spatial datasets were converted to the swat 2012 input dataset via arcswat 10 6 an external gis interface neitsch et al 2011 the meteorological data was obtained from the japan meteorological agency https www jma go jp and the hydrological data from the mlit s hydrological database http www1 river go jp the observed meteorological and hydrological data were derived from eight meteorological and two hydrologic stations located in or close to the catchment fig 1 these included daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and streamflow the input data were also information on point sources and reservoirs point source data required the discharge flow of each of these for reservoirs we used monthly water storage target and monthly water consumption use of each reservoir to control reservoir discharge wang et al 2021 there are several reservoirs upstream responsible for providing agricultural irrigation as well as water for industrial and domestic use domestic and industrial sewage would discharge to a river after treatment relevant data required set up in the reservoir point source and hru management modules 2 4 piu data processing we used the boundary of the sub catchment polygons as the demarcation benchmark and refer to the differences in the urban planning and urbanization processes of different cities and separate the study catchment into three regions the first region in the west of the catchment is defined by sakai city the second region in the northeast by nara city with the third region comprising other cities and rural areas in the southeast of the catchment fig 1 this study applied landsat satellite imagery corresponding to each land use maps year selected more than ten sample areas in each region using artificial visual interpretation method which delineates impervious area by sight to calculate the impervious area of each sample area in arcgis and to compare this with the total area of the sample area to obtain the piu and pic of each sample as is shown in eqs 10 11 10 piu a imp a 11 pic a con a where a imp is the total impervious area ha a con is the impervious area where directly connected with drainage system ha a is the area of urban region ha the total impervious area is easy to classify and calculate only requiring the extraction of all impervious surfaces in the sample areas however the impervious area connected to the drainage system requires distinction and judgment by users sytsma et al 2020 provided an effective method based on their method and our detailed field research in this study we considered high rise building roofs traffic arterials and city streets as impervious area directly connected to the drainage system we calculated the piu and pic of each sample area in 1976 landsat 2 1987 landsat 5 1997 landsat 5 2006 landsat 5 and 2016 landsat 8 respectively the average value of the piu and pic for each region in each study year was used as the piu data as is shown in fig 2 table s1 furthermore we estimated the piu for the 2030s and 2050s based on the increase in piu during the 1990s 2010s the estimated piu of the first region in the 2050s used the piu value of osaka city in the 2010s osaka city is an extreme scenario because it completed its major urbanization process in the 1970s saito et al 2018 piu data are not parameters that need calibrating in the swat cup they are directly defined as input data in swat additionally the default cn2 of each urban region should be updated in the swat database based on piu information soil conservation service engineering division 1986 2 5 model implementation the swat required warm up calibration and validation periods arnold et al 2012 the simulation was separated into five periods one for each decade to match the year of land use data the calibration period was selected for 1969 1978 and validated for 1979 1988 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 based on the review by douglas mankin et al 2010 the warm up period was set as two years and is not included in the above periods calibration and validation of the model were performed using the sufi 2 approach within the swat cup which runs in monthly time step to analyze the accuracy of the modeling results using the observed hydrological data of kashiwara and kaorigaoka fig 1 kashiwara covered both the second and third regions as the main channel is alternately distributed between the second and third regions it is difficult to simulate these two regions separately kaorigaoka hydrologic station comprised the whole catchment outlet before the river mouth area streamflow data was not recorded before 1980 thus we calculated the rating curve by exponential function from daily water levels and streamflow data throughout the1980s and estimated streamflow before 1980 from the rating curve for other periods we used the streamflow data directly the kaorigaoka hydrologic station was discontinued in 2006 thus we had to replace it with the newly built oriono hydrologic station since 2006 based on the above we assign kashiwara hydrologic station double weightage in the accuracy evaluation processes during the calibration and validation work owing to the long timespan of this study to ensure that parameters can be applied to all periods after the preliminary calibration work is completed we applied adjusted parameter ranges for four validation periods if swat obtained satisfactory results in validation periods then the parameter range can be narrowed as per the feedback calibration and validation finished only when a group of parameter ranges returned the same fitted parameter values depending on the situation if calibration always fails the parameter ranges may need re select fig s2 some studies may obtain different fitted parameters in different periods in the studied catchment the climate and geological conditions did not change significantly and the changes due to urbanization were directly input to swat to avoid the difference in results due to parameter changes in this study we selected a group of parameters that can be used in all periods we designed some scenarios to verify or compare the impact of piu changes on water balance table 1 for monthly scenarios the simulated periods were 2009 2018 for daily scenarios the simulated period was 2016 scenarios 1 3 applied the land use and piu data of the 1970s 1990s and 2010s respectively to eliminate the climate change impact and compare daily simulation time step results to compare the importance and significance of piu changes to the water balance we designed a comparison scenario that only considers area and piu changes scenarios 4 6 scenario 4 is taken as a baseline neither the area nor the piu increased scenario 5 was the only case of area expansion and scenario 6 was the only case of piu increase fig s1 scenarios 7 and 8 were simulated for future piu in the 2030s and 2050s using the land use area data from the 2010s 2 6 statistical and analytical methods swat output files can be printed for each hru and allow the user to extract the hru of specific land use types to determine how the piu influenced the water balance this study extracted the all hru of each urban region in the yamato river catchment we calculated the relationship between the precipitation and simulated surface runoff in all urban hru and fitted by directly proportional function which no intercept as follows 12 12 y k x where y is the simulated surface runoff in the hru mm x is the observed precipitation mm and k is the precise slope of the line which means the ratio of the surface runoff sur ratio this coefficient reflects the dynamic ratio of surface runoff per unit area in urban regions which can rule out the impact of changing area sur ratio can be calculated on the daily monthly or yearly time scale water yield is also an important indicator of water balance and limits the availability of water resources this value is the amount of water contribution to streamflow within a specific period of time it can reflect the impact of changes in land use characteristics on the water balance bosch and hewlett 1982 surface runoff reaches the main channel faster than the baseflow discharge usually has the greatest impact on water yield baker and miller 2013 we compared the impact of piu changes by comparing the change in water balance results in the simulation scenarios including the average annual urban surface runoff discharge usurq and the average annual urban rainwater discharge from rainwater drainage system rwq other water balance ratio used in this study are as follows and calculated by annual average 13 groundwater r e c h a r g e

fig 2 the average piu in the study catchment increased by 17 over the last 50 years the first region underwent the most rapid urbanization processes within the study catchment and its piu increased by 20 from the 1970s 2010s this will be close to the piu of osaka city in the 2030s the piu of osaka city in the 2010s was 75 and reach osaka s piu in the 2050s if the same urbanization rate is maintained the second region saw the lowest urbanization rate with piu increasing by 14 over the last 50 years the third region was rural in the 1970s but its rate of urbanization was higher than in the second region and the piu increased by 16 over the last 50 years at the same time the average pic in the study catchment increased from 14 to 37 and the increase in the piu speed in different regions was the same with the first region having the highest rate 3 2 evaluation of the main parameters and the simulation accuracy according to the relative sensitivity values during model calibration 16 sensitive parameters were considered applicable for estimating streamflow in the study catchment these parameters were associated with surface runoff groundwater soil evaporation soil properties river channel properties and hru characteristics table s2 we simulated scenario 5 using monthly simulation which only considered the area expansion without piu increase the average nse of hydrologic stations was 0 59 in 2009 2018 which was far from the scenario that considered the piu in the validation period during the 2010s when the average nse was 0 85 this difference was significant but it still exceeded 0 5 this was the reason why the piu was easily overlooked in long term land use change studies even if city density information was ignored models might still realize satisfactory statistical results during the calibration period in the 1970s r2 reached 0 83 nse reached 0 80 and rsr decreased to 0 45 table 2 this simulation performance can be considered very good the same parameters also require that the simulation be validated to confirm its viability during the validation periods from the 1980s 2010s r2 and nse were higher than 0 75 and rsr lower than 0 5 this indicates that the simulation performance of the parameters selected for this study during the validation period were also very good and that the swat model constructed for this study features excellent simulation performance and its results are reliable fig s3 swat does not require detailed drainage system distribution information this is an advantage because it is less restricted by data availability it is also a disadvantage because it cannot simulate urban rainwater with the same accuracy as some urban hydrological models jacobson 2011 this may affect the results especially peak value estimation another uncertainty is the simulation of future scenarios we linearly estimated the future piu and pic but the ground truth may not agree with our results 3 3 urban water balance to urban piu we compared the sur ratio influenced by the piu for different time periods and steps the r2 of the function fitting results for all linear fitting was 0 95 fig 4 the slopes k dynamic sur ratio constantly increased in all situations and those in daily time steps were greater than the monthly ones therefore the dynamic sur ratio has may possess the different sensitivity for precipitation and initial losses at different time scales but the increase in the slopes was the same in addition this increase in the slopes was the same regardless of same or different climatic conditions these results fully illustrate the direct impact of the piu on the urban water balance that increased piu caused more surface runoff generated in urban regions than before the slope in the yamato river catchment increased by 0 2 over the last 50 years meaning that per 100 mm precipitation over 20 mm more surface runoff will be generated in urbanized areas than 50 years ago and more urban surface runoff will lead to urban areas being at greater risk during flash floods kadoya et al 1993 brath et al 2006 during the same period different urban regions have different dynamic sur ratios due to different piu the first region has a higher piu than the other regions and a higher level of urban development due to different urbanization processes and goals hoshino 1996 because the urbanization processes in different regions differs the water balance in different periods has also been differently affected the average annual sur ratio disparity during 1970s between the first and second regions was 0 07 table 3 the faster urbanization processes in the first region exacerbated the difference after the 1990s and the difference in the sur ratio increased to 0 16 in the 2010s the difference in sur ratio between the first and third regions increased from 0 17 to 0 27 at the same period although they belonged to the same catchment the possibility of flash floods in the first area was much higher than that in the second and third regions under a heavy rainfall event if the piu of different cities in the catchment is not distinguished it may lead to erroneous assessment of flooding risks in the simulation scenario we compared the changes in the internal urban water balance with the growth of the piu fig 5 as the analysis objects are all within the urban region the difference in the urban area does not affect the results with the increases in the piu the urban sur ratio increased smoothly the piu increased by 17 causing the urban surface runoff ratio to increase by 0 2 however with the increase in the surface runoff the decrease in the groundwater recharge ratio and evapotranspiration ratio showed different trends in the situation of piu being less than 50 as per the increasing of sur ratio the groundwater recharge ratio decreases rapidly whereas the evapotranspiration ratio decreases slowly however as the piu situation is higher than 50 the evapotranspiration ratio decreases rapidly but the groundwater recharge ratio gradually stabilizes because it is already very difficult to recharge groundwater in urban settings the reduced groundwater recharge ratio will then lead to a reduction in baseflow which is an important water resource in summary we note that piu seriously affects the water balance of urban regions and impacts urban water resource management maybe the impact of piu on urban water balance deserves more attention than urban expansion as can be seen in fig 6 a the difference between scenarios 4 and 6 was higher than the difference between scenarios 4 and 5 for an actual change in the validation period in the 2010s this difference was obvious hence the impact of increasing piu was more significant than urban expansion on urban water balance for long term hydrological studies ignoring the piu may seriously underestimate the actual urban surface runoff which may neglect the potential flood crisis 3 4 the impact of increasing piu on the water balance of catchment in the yamato river catchment the sur ratios for each decade considered in this study were 0 112 0 137 0 163 0 171 and 0 231 respectively fig 3 in the last 50 years land use has undergone continuous changes in area and piu under the influence of land use change the water balance has changed to varying degrees the most obvious change is the surface runoff which increased it is generally understood that the surface runoff is the most sensitive aspect of land use impact gatwaza et al 2016 the surface runoff increased and the baseflow ratio decreased the precipitation in the 2000s was less than that in other periods and so the evapotranspiration ratio during this period was higher we calculated the average annual baseflow ratio and sur ratio in catchment scale in different urban areas and piu situations fig 7 comparing scenarios 4 and 5 we found that both baseflow decreased and surface runoff increased however in scenario 6 the lower baseflow ratio and the higher sur ratio than scenario 5 means the impact of the increase in the piu was more significant than area impact the actual change should constitute the validation period in the 2010s and the surface runoff is significantly increased whereas the baseflow also significantly decreased in the 1970s the urban area accounted for 17 of the total catchment area the urban piu increased by 17 causing a decrease in the baseflow ratio of the catchment by 0 08 scenarios 4 and 6 in the scenario portrayed in the 2010s land use map the urban area accounted for about 29 with the piu increasing by 17 which resulted in a decrease in the baseflow ratio of 0 14 scenario 5 validation in the 2010s as is shown in fig 7 a in scenarios 7 and 8 as the urban area in the 2010s was larger than that in the 1970s the impact of the increase in the piu was stronger either the surface runoff or the water yield significantly increased and the baseflow ratio decreases to 0 4 in the 2050s too low of a baseflow will lead to a higher risk of drought in the catchment in years with lower precipitation and will see a rise in river water temperature and reduce the availability of water resources affecting the ecological environment meisner et al 1988 the sur ratio is opposite to the baseflow the increase in the piu leads to a rapid increase in the sur ratio of the catchment as is shown in fig 7 b the larger the area of the urban region the stronger is this influence due to the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of the urban flow changing the quantity of rainwater discharge from rainwater drainage also increased as can be seen in fig 6 b and this mainly depends on the pic increasing as the response speed of rainwater drainage is usually fast the river water level may rise rapidly during heavy rainfall events carlos and tucci 2007 moreover with the pic increases the amount of rainwater infiltration decreased this led to a reduction in available water resources which is not conducive to the management and control of catchment water resources markovi et al 2014 on the other hand multiple rainwater pools were used for collected rainwater in the drainage system of the first region compared with the other region the rainwater pool in first region could collect rainwater which passed through drainage system to control the peak during heavy rainfall event and adjust the river flow during droughts wilson 1994 this is a highly effective management method for maintaining water resources on an urbanization catchment scale the impact of the increase in piu is even more serious than the urban area expansion in reality these two types of changes happened together and the impact of the area and piu changes on the water balance was superimposed if the urbanization impact of both areas and the piu simultaneously increased this would be much more serious than the impact of urbanization in terms of area expansion moreover these changes will ultimately increase the risk of floods and droughts pattanayak and kramer 2001 therefore assessments of urban or catchment scale water resources that do not consider piu may underestimate the impact of urbanization and ignore its potential risks in summary we note that piu seriously affects the water balance in catchments and has an impact on catchment water resource management 4 conclusions we conducted a study of the detailed time evolution of urban density increase and its impact on the hydrological response of a same catchment with different urbanization levels at different periods piu and pic describe the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of urban flows which has a stronger impact on water balance than urban area expansion rapid urbanization has resulted in a rapid increase in the piu which in turn increased the surface runoff and water yield and decreased the baseflow and evapotranspiration the area expansion and piu increase occurred simultaneously and led to a more significant change in the water balance piu is an important factor influencing the long term water balance and must be considered in urban catchments this study furthers understanding of land use change using more appropriate models this study employed a combination of remote sensing method and numerous hydrological and geographical data to incorporate both area and piu aspects into a hydrological evaluation thus providing a potentially improved method for quantifying changes in piu and their impact on spatial and time scales piu has a serious impact on the water balance in urban and catchment areas the effects of changes in these areas and piu on the water balance are superimposed influencing the management and control of catchment water resources and collectively exacerbate the risk of the occurrence of flooding or droughts ignoring the long term changes in piu may underestimate the potential risks therefore we again emphasize that changes in the piu cannot be ignored in research on urban or catchment water resources where necessary it is also important to distinguish the piu of different cities in catchment areas 5 data

4246,land use is a key factor affecting water balance which in turn affects the water resource availability increasing urbanization has altered water balances in river catchments although urbanization impacts have been widely investigated most studies focus on changes in land use area and the percent imperviousness of urban piu is typically downplayed or ignored piu is altered by permeable areas within urban regions being replaced by impervious ones and can influence the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of its flows in urban locales in this study we consider the increase in urban area piu due to urbanization and focus on the piu s impact on water balances we utilize the soil and water assessment tool to describe the piu s impact on long term 1970s 2010s water balances in a same catchment with different urbanization levels and quantify these characteristics on spatial and time scales with a combination of remote sensing and numerous hydrological and geographical data we demonstrate that 1 increasing urban piu has a significant influence on the balance of urban water resources with an increase to 0 17 causing the urban surface runoff ratio to increase by 0 2 2 the impact of piu on surface runoff and baseflows is sometimes more important than area changes in a catchment especially for those in settings characterized by rapid urbanization thus we note that piu changes directly affect the water balance and enhance the impacts of area changes fundamentally in the study of water resource management in urban settings or catchments in these the piu is a highly important variable to consider keywords land use change urban density urbanization surface runoff swat 1 introduction between 1960 and 2018 the global urban population rose from 1 billion to 4 2 billion with freshwater resources requirements more than doubling wada et al 2013 world bank 2020 urbanization has been a worldwide trend and moved at unprecedented speeds in recent decades which has impacted global freshwater resources kimaro et al 2003 onodera 2011 steffen et al 2015 doveri et al 2015 buettner 2015 liu et al 2020 the key reason for this is land use change arising from anthropogenic activities gatwaza et al 2016 land use change refers to changes in usage of land surfaces and is a key factor affecting water resources and the environment calder 1993 and sometimes makes the impact on water resources greater than that of climate change levy et al 2018 ma et al 2019 saidi and ridwansyah 2019 research on land use change primarily focuses on the area aspect fohrer et al 2001 baker and miller 2013 changes of percent imperviousness of urban regions piu similar to changes in urban building density is a rarely discussed aspect particularly in the context of water resources management research if the area change is qualitative between different land use types then piu change is quantitative within the same land use type and also affects the water balance especially in urban settings shuster et al 2005 to fully analyze the impact of urbanization on the water balance changes in both area and piu must be considered piu refers to the number of impervious areas in a unit area and is usually expressed as a fraction of the total impervious area in urban environmental research arnold and gibbons 1996 in the process of urbanization different policies will inevitably lead to differences in urban hydrology roesner et al 2001 for different urban areas piu effectively influences the hydrological characteristics difference between or within cities and reflects different features in the surface runoff evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge processes panos et al 2018 litvak et al 2017 tubau et al 2017 changes that increase impervious areas include the following constructing apartment blocks instead of houses with yards impervious parking lots and paved asphalt roads urbanization development redevelopment processes in addition rainwater management policies alter water transmission processes in urban areas shuster and rhea 2013 because highly developed cities and poorly developed rural areas are usually classified as urban or construction land piu has been understudied in previous long term land use change research astuti et al 2019 however piu is paramount in urban hydrology or flooding modeling research rodriguez et al 2005 cantone and schmidt 2011 high piu can more easily suffer flooding because of greater generated overland flow boquet 2015 to study the impacts of long term land use change on water balance the differing degrees of urbanization reflected by piu in different periods should be considered this includes the piu difference between different cities and that in the same city at different periods water resource management must be restricted by water balance as this determines the water quantity involved in water circulation within a given area generally only precipitation and the streamflow can be directly observed with only these observational data it is difficult to thoroughly study the differences in each process in the water cycle kayane and takeuchi 1971 taniguchi 1994 cook 2013 minnig et al 2018 compared to other methods hydrological models can directly analyze the impact of land use change on water balance and attain more practical results naef et al 2002 compared to mike products swat requires fewer input data which makes it easier to use devia et al 2015 compared to the variable infiltration capacity model swat presents a better runoff response assessment of the impact of land use change hu et al 2007 and swat is capable of long term continuous simulations at the catchment scale including urban runoff jacobson 2011 however differences in piu are not reflected in swat if piu information is not defined by the user piu values were overlooked by not only swat users but also by other modeling researchers who focused on the impact of long term changes in land use because a land use map typically lacks piu information but the necessary piu information can be obtained by remote sensing or other methods now bauer et al 2007 weng 2012 remote sensing enables more realistic descriptions of catchments when constructing hydrological models is widely used in the simulation and calculations of hydrological environments but the piu information has not included in their models to distinguish urbanization processes lin et al 2008 yang et al 2014 wu and chen 2015 dang and kumar 2017 mehan et al 2017 parajuli et al 2018 martínez salvador and conesa garcía 2020 although individual studies have noted the impact of piu the percent imperviousness they refer to is not separated from land use area change which is not the percent imperviousness of urban region settings but the percent imperviousness of catchments brun and band 2000 hatt et al 2004 hardison et al 2009 shao et al 2019 some urban hydrological models such as peri urban model for landscape management model or storm water management model can quantify the hydrological characteristics of cities well but these tools are less suitable for assessing long term continuous land use change at large catchment scales than swat trinh and chui 2013 jankowfsky et al 2014 perin et al 2020 the impact and significance of urban piu on long term water balance in urbanized catchments still unclear the relationship between area expansion and the impact of piu increases on water balance is also unclear it is highly important to quantify the piu and its dynamic impact on the water balance of urban areas and catchments and useful for the management and control of the water resources of urban and catchment areas mcgrane 2016 since previous studies have ignored piu in favor of total urban area within the model framework for assessing changes of long term land use change in this study we aim to build more credible swat models that can reflect the changes in both area and piu in the long term on the catchment scale and evaluate the changes in water balance influenced by urbanization particularly we address how might piu impact urban and catchment water balance especially accompanied by the detailed time evolution of urban density increasing to answer these we utilized multiple land use situations for different periods to simulate the hydrological scenario and aimed to quantify the impacts of piu on water balance 2 materials methods 2 1 study catchment the yamato river catchment fig 1 covers 1077 km2 and has been an important crop production base in western japan since the 1600s ogasawara 1955 ukita 1957 shimizu et al 2013 average annual precipitation over the last 50 years was approximately 1400 mm the region s rich groundwater resources were a major factor in its agricultural development taniguchi 1994 in recent decades however agricultural land has gradually given way cities in the course of rapid urbanization and increasing population hirata et al 1999 the urbanization processes in the catchment have been clearly apparent since the 1970s hoshino 1996 in the 1970s the area s paddy fields covered 294 km2 and accounted for 27 of the catchment with urban sprawl covering 182 km2 and accounting for approximately 17 of the catchment fig 2 by the 2010s the latter had increased to 317 km2 and accounted for 29 of the total catchment area the urbanization rate was 3 13 per decade whereas the paddy field area s growth was 3 05 from the 1970s 2010s the catchment s total population grew from 1 630 000 to 2 150 000 yamato river water environment council 2016 constituting an increase of approximately 30 it should be noted that nara city located in the northeastern region of study catchment is an ancient cultural region compared to other areas its urbanization rate was lower with the expansion of the urban area and rapid development of cities around sakai a significant increase in piu also occurred in the yamato river catchment onodera et al 2013 the fraction of the total impervious urban area continued to increase over these 50 years and was typical of development processes from a low piu urban domain to a high piu one 2 2 soil and water assessment tool the swat is a catchment scale model developed by the usda agricultural research service usda 1980 to predict the impact of land management practices on water sediments and agricultural chemical yields in large complex catchments with varying soil land use and management conditions over long periods of time the swat simulates canopy interception infiltration evapotranspiration soil

balance equations can be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 swat enables urban bmp functions such as drainage systems and distinguishes the hydrological response characteristics of different cities by employing piu and percent imperviousness directly connected to drainage systems pic pic reflects the coverage of urban rainwater drainage these two parameters describe the spatial flow patterns of water and the hydraulic efficiency of urban flows for directly connected impervious areas a curve number of 98 is a default setting in swat for disconnected impervious pervious areas a composite curve number is calculated and used in surface runoff calculations the equations used to calculate the composite curve number for disconnected impervious pervious

hru as the catchment configuration the topography data was sourced from the shuttle radar topography mission of united states geological survey with a spatial resolution of 30 m https earthexplorer usgs gov land use and soil data were then obtained from the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit with a spatial resolution of 100 m and slope data was calculated from the dem data https nlftp mlit go jp land use maps for 1976 1987 1997 2006 and 2016 were used to estimate the effect of land use change and were categorized as paddy fields upland fields forest wasteland urban road water lawn and others the spatial datasets were converted to the swat 2012 input dataset via arcswat 10 6 an external gis interface neitsch et al 2011 the meteorological data was obtained from the japan meteorological agency https www jma go jp and the hydrological data from the mlit s hydrological database http www1 river go jp the observed meteorological and hydrological data were derived from eight meteorological and two hydrologic stations located in or close to the catchment fig 1 these included daily precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature wind speed solar radiation relative humidity and streamflow the input data were also information on point sources and reservoirs point source data required the discharge flow of each of these for reservoirs we used monthly water storage target and monthly water consumption use of each reservoir to control reservoir discharge wang et al 2021 there are several reservoirs upstream responsible for providing agricultural irrigation as well as water for industrial and domestic use domestic and industrial sewage would discharge to a river after treatment relevant data required set up in the reservoir point source and hru management modules 2 4 piu data processing we used the boundary of the sub catchment polygons as the demarcation benchmark and refer to the differences in the urban planning and urbanization processes of different cities and separate the study catchment into three regions the first region in the west of the catchment is defined by sakai city the second region in the northeast by nara city with the third region comprising other cities and rural areas in the southeast of the catchment fig 1 this study applied landsat satellite imagery corresponding to each land use maps year selected more than ten sample areas in each region using artificial visual interpretation method which delineates impervious area by sight to calculate the impervious area of each sample area in arcgis and to compare this with the total area of the sample area to obtain the piu and pic of each sample as is shown in eqs 10 11 10 piu a imp a 11 pic a con a where a imp is the total impervious area ha a con is the impervious area where directly connected with drainage system ha a is the area of urban region ha the total impervious area is easy to classify and calculate only requiring the extraction of all impervious surfaces in the sample areas however the impervious area connected to the drainage system requires distinction and judgment by users sytsma et al 2020 provided an effective method based on their method and our detailed field research in this study we considered high rise building roofs traffic arterials and city streets as impervious area directly connected to the drainage system we calculated the piu and pic of each sample area in 1976 landsat 2 1987 landsat 5 1997 landsat 5 2006 landsat 5 and 2016 landsat 8 respectively the average value of the piu and pic for each region in each study year was used as the piu data as is shown in fig 2 table s1 furthermore we estimated the piu for the 2030s and 2050s based on the increase in piu during the 1990s 2010s the estimated piu of the first region in the 2050s used the piu value of osaka city in the 2010s osaka city is an extreme scenario because it completed its major urbanization process in the 1970s saito et al 2018 piu data are not parameters that need calibrating in the swat cup they are directly defined as input data in swat additionally the default cn2 of each urban region should be updated in the swat database based on piu information soil conservation service engineering division 1986 2 5 model implementation the swat required warm up calibration and validation periods arnold et al 2012 the simulation was separated into five periods one for each decade to match the year of land use data the calibration period was selected for 1969 1978 and validated for 1979 1988 1989 1998 1999 2008 and 2009 2018 based on the review by douglas mankin et al 2010 the warm up period was set as two years and is not included in the above periods calibration and validation of the model were performed using the sufi 2 approach within the swat cup which runs in monthly time step to analyze the accuracy of the modeling results using the observed hydrological data of kashiwara and kaorigaoka fig 1 kashiwara covered both the second and third regions as the main channel is alternately distributed between the second and third regions it is difficult to simulate these two regions separately kaorigaoka hydrologic station comprised the whole catchment outlet before the river mouth area streamflow data was not recorded before 1980 thus we calculated the rating curve by exponential function from daily water levels and streamflow data throughout the1980s and estimated streamflow before 1980 from the rating curve for other periods we used the streamflow data directly the kaorigaoka hydrologic station was discontinued in 2006 thus we had to replace it with the newly built oriono hydrologic station since 2006 based on the above we assign kashiwara hydrologic station double weightage in the accuracy evaluation processes during the calibration and validation work owing to the long timespan of this study to ensure that parameters can be applied to all periods after the preliminary calibration work is completed we applied adjusted parameter ranges for four validation periods if swat obtained satisfactory results in validation periods then the parameter range can be narrowed as per the feedback calibration and validation finished only when a group of parameter ranges returned the same fitted parameter values depending on the situation if calibration always fails the parameter ranges may need re select fig s2 some studies may obtain different fitted parameters in different periods in the studied catchment the climate and geological conditions did not change significantly and the changes due to urbanization were directly input to swat to avoid the difference in results due to parameter changes in this study we selected a group of parameters that can be used in all periods we designed some scenarios to verify or compare the impact of piu changes on water balance table 1 for monthly scenarios the simulated periods were 2009 2018 for daily scenarios the simulated period was 2016 scenarios 1 3 applied the land use and piu data of the 1970s 1990s and 2010s respectively to eliminate the climate change impact and compare daily simulation time step results to compare the importance and significance of piu changes to the water balance we designed a comparison scenario that only considers area and piu changes scenarios 4 6 scenario 4 is taken as a baseline neither the area nor the piu increased scenario 5 was the only case of area expansion and scenario 6 was the only case of piu increase fig s1 scenarios 7 and 8 were simulated for future piu in the 2030s and 2050s using the land use area data from the 2010s 2 6 statistical and analytical methods swat output files can be printed for each hru and allow the user to extract the hru of specific land use types to determine how the piu influenced the water balance this study extracted the all hru of each urban region in the yamato river catchment we calculated the relationship between the precipitation and simulated surface runoff in all urban hru and fitted by directly proportional function which no intercept as follows 12 12 y k x where y is the simulated surface runoff in the hru mm x is the observed precipitation mm and k is the precise slope of the line which means the ratio of the surface runoff sur ratio this coefficient reflects the dynamic ratio of surface runoff per unit area in urban regions which can rule out the impact of changing area sur ratio can be calculated on the daily monthly or yearly time scale water yield is also an important indicator of water balance and limits the availability of water resources this value is the amount of water contribution to streamflow within a specific period of time it can reflect the impact of changes in land use characteristics on the water balance bosch and hewlett 1982 surface runoff reaches the main channel faster than the baseflow discharge usually has the greatest impact on water yield baker and miller 2013 we compared the impact of piu changes by comparing the change in water balance results in the simulation scenarios including the average annual urban surface runoff discharge usurq and the average annual urban rainwater discharge from rainwater drainage system rwq other water balance ratio used in this study are as follows and calculated by annual average 13 groundwater r e c h a r g e

fig 2 the average piu in the study catchment increased by 17 over the last 50 years the first region underwent the most rapid urbanization processes within the study catchment and its piu increased by 20 from the 1970s 2010s this will be close to the piu of osaka city in the 2030s the piu of osaka city in the 2010s was 75 and reach osaka s piu in the 2050s if the same urbanization rate is maintained the second region saw the lowest urbanization rate with piu increasing by 14 over the last 50 years the third region was rural in the 1970s but its rate of urbanization was higher than in the second region and the piu increased by 16 over the last 50 years at the same time the average pic in the study catchment increased from 14 to 37 and the increase in the piu speed in different regions was the same with the first region having the highest rate 3 2 evaluation of the main parameters and the simulation accuracy according to the relative sensitivity values during model calibration 16 sensitive parameters were considered applicable for estimating streamflow in the study catchment these parameters were associated with surface runoff groundwater soil evaporation soil properties river channel properties and hru characteristics table s2 we simulated scenario 5 using monthly simulation which only considered the area expansion without piu increase the average nse of hydrologic stations was 0 59 in 2009 2018 which was far from the scenario that considered the piu in the validation period during the 2010s when the average nse was 0 85 this difference was significant but it still exceeded 0 5 this was the reason why the piu was easily overlooked in long term land use change studies even if city density information was ignored models might still realize satisfactory statistical results during the calibration period in the 1970s r2 reached 0 83 nse reached 0 80 and rsr decreased to 0 45 table 2 this simulation performance can be considered very good the same parameters also require that the simulation be validated to confirm its viability during the validation periods from the 1980s 2010s r2 and nse were higher than 0 75 and rsr lower than 0 5 this indicates that the simulation performance of the parameters selected for this study during the validation period were also very good and that the swat model constructed for this study features excellent simulation performance and its results are reliable fig s3 swat does not require detailed drainage system distribution information this is an advantage because it is less restricted by data availability it is also a disadvantage because it cannot simulate urban rainwater with the same accuracy as some urban hydrological models jacobson 2011 this may affect the results especially peak value estimation another uncertainty is the simulation of future scenarios we linearly estimated the future piu and pic but the ground truth may not agree with our results 3 3 urban water balance to urban piu we compared the sur ratio influenced by the piu for different time periods and steps the r2 of the function fitting results for all linear fitting was 0 95 fig 4 the slopes k dynamic sur ratio constantly increased in all situations and those in daily time steps were greater than the monthly ones therefore the dynamic sur ratio has may possess the different sensitivity for precipitation and initial losses at different time scales but the increase in the slopes was the same in addition this increase in the slopes was the same regardless of same or different climatic conditions these results fully illustrate the direct impact of the piu on the urban water balance that increased piu caused more surface runoff generated in urban regions than before the slope in the yamato river catchment increased by 0 2 over the last 50 years meaning that per 100 mm precipitation over 20 mm more surface runoff will be generated in urbanized areas than 50 years ago and more urban surface runoff will lead to urban areas being at greater risk during flash floods kadoya et al 1993 brath et al 2006 during the same period different urban regions have different dynamic sur ratios due to different piu the first region has a higher piu than the other regions and a higher level of urban development due to different urbanization processes and goals hoshino 1996 because the urbanization processes in different regions differs the water balance in different periods has also been differently affected the average annual sur ratio disparity during 1970s between the first and second regions was 0 07 table 3 the faster urbanization processes in the first region exacerbated the difference after the 1990s and the difference in the sur ratio increased to 0 16 in the 2010s the difference in sur ratio between the first and third regions increased from 0 17 to 0 27 at the same period although they belonged to the same catchment the possibility of flash floods in the first area was much higher than that in the second and third regions under a heavy rainfall event if the piu of different cities in the catchment is not distinguished it may lead to erroneous assessment of flooding risks in the simulation scenario we compared the changes in the internal urban water balance with the growth of the piu fig 5 as the analysis objects are all within the urban region the difference in the urban area does not affect the results with the increases in the piu the urban sur ratio increased smoothly the piu increased by 17 causing the urban surface runoff ratio to increase by 0 2 however with the increase in the surface runoff the decrease in the groundwater recharge ratio and evapotranspiration ratio showed different trends in the situation of piu being less than 50 as per the increasing of sur ratio the groundwater recharge ratio decreases rapidly whereas the evapotranspiration ratio decreases slowly however as the piu situation is higher than 50 the evapotranspiration ratio decreases rapidly but the groundwater recharge ratio gradually stabilizes because it is already very difficult to recharge groundwater in urban settings the reduced groundwater recharge ratio will then lead to a reduction in baseflow which is an important water resource in summary we note that piu seriously affects the water balance of urban regions and impacts urban water resource management maybe the impact of piu on urban water balance deserves more attention than urban expansion as can be seen in fig 6 a the difference between scenarios 4 and 6 was higher than the difference between scenarios 4 and 5 for an actual change in the validation period in the 2010s this difference was obvious hence the impact of increasing piu was more significant than urban expansion on urban water balance for long term hydrological studies ignoring the piu may seriously underestimate the actual urban surface runoff which may neglect the potential flood crisis 3 4 the impact of increasing piu on the water balance of catchment in the yamato river catchment the sur ratios for each decade considered in this study were 0 112 0 137 0 163 0 171 and 0 231 respectively fig 3 in the last 50 years land use has undergone continuous changes in area and piu under the influence of land use change the water balance has changed to varying degrees the most obvious change is the surface runoff which increased it is generally understood that the surface runoff is the most sensitive aspect of land use impact gatwaza et al 2016 the surface runoff increased and the baseflow ratio decreased the precipitation in the 2000s was less than that in other periods and so the evapotranspiration ratio during this period was higher we calculated the average annual baseflow ratio and sur ratio in catchment scale in different urban areas and piu situations fig 7 comparing scenarios 4 and 5 we found that both baseflow decreased and surface runoff increased however in scenario 6 the lower baseflow ratio and the higher sur ratio than scenario 5 means the impact of the increase in the piu was more significant than area impact the actual change should constitute the validation period in the 2010s and the surface runoff is significantly increased whereas the baseflow also significantly decreased in the 1970s the urban area accounted for 17 of the total catchment area the urban piu increased by 17 causing a decrease in the baseflow ratio of the catchment by 0 08 scenarios 4 and 6 in the scenario portrayed in the 2010s land use map the urban area accounted for about 29 with the piu increasing by 17 which resulted in a decrease in the baseflow ratio of 0 14 scenario 5 validation in the 2010s as is shown in fig 7 a in scenarios 7 and 8 as the urban area in the 2010s was larger than that in the 1970s the impact of the increase in the piu was stronger either the surface runoff or the water yield significantly increased and the baseflow ratio decreases to 0 4 in the 2050s too low of a baseflow will lead to a higher risk of drought in the catchment in years with lower precipitation and will see a rise in river water temperature and reduce the availability of water resources affecting the ecological environment meisner et al 1988 the sur ratio is opposite to the baseflow the increase in the piu leads to a rapid increase in the sur ratio of the catchment as is shown in fig 7 b the larger the area of the urban region the stronger is this influence due to the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of the urban flow changing the quantity of rainwater discharge from rainwater drainage also increased as can be seen in fig 6 b and this mainly depends on the pic increasing as the response speed of rainwater drainage is usually fast the river water level may rise rapidly during heavy rainfall events carlos and tucci 2007 moreover with the pic increases the amount of rainwater infiltration decreased this led to a reduction in available water resources which is not conducive to the management and control of catchment water resources markovi et al 2014 on the other hand multiple rainwater pools were used for collected rainwater in the drainage system of the first region compared with the other region the rainwater pool in first region could collect rainwater which passed through drainage system to control the peak during heavy rainfall event and adjust the river flow during droughts wilson 1994 this is a highly effective management method for maintaining water resources on an urbanization catchment scale the impact of the increase in piu is even more serious than the urban area expansion in reality these two types of changes happened together and the impact of the area and piu changes on the water balance was superimposed if the urbanization impact of both areas and the piu simultaneously increased this would be much more serious than the impact of urbanization in terms of area expansion moreover these changes will ultimately increase the risk of floods and droughts pattanayak and kramer 2001 therefore assessments of urban or catchment scale water resources that do not consider piu may underestimate the impact of urbanization and ignore its potential risks in summary we note that piu seriously affects the water balance in catchments and has an impact on catchment water resource management 4 conclusions we conducted a study of the detailed time evolution of urban density increase and its impact on the hydrological response of a same catchment with different urbanization levels at different periods piu and pic describe the spatial flow pattern of water and the hydraulic efficiency of urban flows which has a stronger impact on water balance than urban area expansion rapid urbanization has resulted in a rapid increase in the piu which in turn increased the surface runoff and water yield and decreased the baseflow and evapotranspiration the area expansion and piu increase occurred simultaneously and led to a more significant change in the water balance piu is an important factor influencing the long term water balance and must be considered in urban catchments this study furthers understanding of land use change using more appropriate models this study employed a combination of remote sensing method and numerous hydrological and geographical data to incorporate both area and piu aspects into a hydrological evaluation thus providing a potentially improved method for quantifying changes in piu and their impact on spatial and time scales piu has a serious impact on the water balance in urban and catchment areas the effects of changes in these areas and piu on the water balance are superimposed influencing the management and control of catchment water resources and collectively exacerbate the risk of the occurrence of flooding or droughts ignoring the long term changes in piu may underestimate the potential risks therefore we again emphasize that changes in the piu cannot be ignored in research on urban or catchment water resources where necessary it is also important to distinguish the piu of different cities in catchment areas 5 data

4247,harmful algal blooms habs have increased in the ohio river basin over the past decade fine sediment dynamics are now recognized to play an important role in the proliferation and toxicity of habs as a result the fate of sediment at confluences of tributaries and regulated river systems may be important zones for sediment retention and burial the objective of this study was to improve understanding of watershed sediment loading dynamics and backwater inundation impacts on sedimentation within confluence watersheds the study site selected for this work was the fourpole creek watershed in the western allegheny plateau ecoregion of appalachia which is a mixed use watershed with predominantly forested and urban landcover with a backwater floodplain wetland at the confluence with the ohio river approximately 16 months of high frequency 15 minute turbidity data was used as a surrogate for total suspended solids at upstream and downstream nodes of the backwater confluence feature continuous sediment yield estimates suggested an annual sediment yield of 82 t km2 and was found to be higher than sediment yields reported elsewhere in appalachian watersheds without mining disturbances a modified sediment rating curve using both seasonal and annual regression approaches were found to underpredict sediment yield by 29 and 80 respectively a hysteresis based source unmixing method and hysteresis index were used to quantify sediment source and flow pathways during events and suggested high variability in sediment source contributions both seasonally and within seasons suggesting three likely sediment sources in the watershed including in channel gully erosion resuspension of recently deposited sediment in the fluvial network and erosion of subsurface macropores from forested uplands upstream downstream monitoring of the confluence floodplain suggested 34 of the annual sediment inputs were retained during the continuously monitored 2019 calendar year our results suggest that confluence floodplains play an important role in intercepting and storing sediment inputs efforts to limit downstream sediment loads should ensure the function of confluence floodplains is maintained or enhanced when considering watershed management strategies in these landscapes keywords backwater confluence floodplain sediment fate and transport high resolution water quality monitoring sediment hysteresis mixed use appalachian watershed harmful algal blooms 1 introduction the upper ohio river basin draining much of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion of appalachia has experienced river spanning toxic cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms habs over the past five years reflecting a growing trend among freshwater rivers smith 2003 chaffin et al 2013 noaa us department of commerce 2014 graham et al 2017 suspended sediments transported to riverine environments are increasingly recognized to play an important role in proliferation and toxicity of habs because they promote harsh environmental conditions that favor harmful algae over other plankton walsby et al 1997 paerl and huisman 2008 levy 2017 dijkstra et al 2019 they impact nutrient dynamics of the riverine system elser et al 2007 lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2016 and they have the potential to seed habs conroy et al 2014 kitchens et al 2018 management of sediment may be most effectively achieved by focusing on small tributaries that have confluences in close proximity to the regulated rivers given sediments in these systems experience limited transit time for attenuation alexander et al 2008 small confluence watersheds in this region of appalachia are characterized by mixed use forested land cover in the steep gradient uplands that transition to urban and suburban landscapes in the lower gradient downstream portions of the watershed omernik 1987 united states geological survey n d the tributaries often discharge to the regulated river through a hydraulically complex floodplain confluence zone which is prone to inundation from backwaters of the regulated river and stormflows from the watershed jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 this study focuses on quantifying watershed sediment fluxes prominent sediment sources and sedimentation dynamics within confluence floodplains for small tributary watersheds of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion review of existing studies reporting sediment yields from appalachian watersheds suggests there has been limited study of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion and the impact of urban landcover on watershed sediment yields see table 1 of the studies reporting sediment yields in appalachia the majority were focused on watersheds in the central appalachian ecoregion studies have emphasized the impact of mining on watershed sediment fluxes but largely ignored effects from other land use and land cover types burns and macarthur 1996 ward 1984 fox and martin 2015 although two of the studies from our review were conducted in mixed use watersheds maryland department of the environment 2007 williams and reed 1972 none explicitly examined the influence of landcover on watershed sediment fluxes and more specifically the role of urban and suburban landscapes which are prominent in the confluence watersheds of the region studies in appalachia have broadly used variations of sediment rating curves to estimate annual sediment loads ward 1984 burns and macarthur 1996 bolstad et al 2006 nevertheless others have documented that rating curves may not capture the temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration prompting a need to evaluate this methodology in mixed use appalachian watersheds lewis and eads 2009 schilling et al 2011 quantification of prominent sediment sources during storm events can be conducted using hysteresis based analyses megnounif et al 2013 lloyd et al 2016a wymore et al 2019 sediment hysteresis has been used to link sediment source availability and flow pathway dynamics to watershed sediment fluxes in mixed use watersheds the supply and location of sediment sources within the watershed have a strong influence on the hysteretic behavior during storm events resulting in clockwise single line counterclockwise or complex loop structures gellis 2013 in forested watersheds the suspended sediment in streams is typically supplied from surface erosion on hillslopes subsurface erosion sources and previously deposited sediments in the stream network resulting in clockwise counterclockwise and complex hysteresis gomi et al 2005 rivenbark and jackson 2004 wymore et al 2019 paustian and beschta 1979 sidle and campbell 1985 sediment sources in urban watersheds often include upland sediments that are connected on the receding limb of the hydrograph due to a dilution effect resulting in counterclockwise hysteresis as well as enhanced gully and streambank erosion resulting in single line linear hysteresis devereux et al 2010 gellis 2013 williams 1989 megnounif et al 2013 both qualitative and quantitative metrics are used to characterize hysteretic behavior of sediment during storm events normalized flow and sediment concentration plots and quantitative hysteresis indices provide insights into the shape and magnitude of hysteretic patterns lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016b quantitative indices can also provide insight into seasonality of dominant sources and the environmental variables driving sediment source loading dynamics sherriff et al 2016 methods have also been developed for source unmixing based on hysteretic patterns in which source signals are used to partition sediment yields into baseload and wash load sources megnounif et al 2013 coupling these analytical hysteresis methods for continuously monitored events throughout a year can provide insight into prominent sediment sources being delivered from tributaries to backwater confluences backwater confluences are defined in this study as low gradient regions where low order tributaries discharge to larger high order regulated rivers during flooding the tributary and the floodplain become hydrologically connected when the riverine floodwaters meet the locally derived water in a process known as perirheic mixing junk et al 1989 tockner et al 1999 jones et al 2014 zones of perirheic mixing promote deposition dynamics and nutrient transformation processes due to increased hydraulic residence times and steep redox gradients mertes 1997 banach et al 2009 chow et al 2013 jones et al 2014 jensen and ford 2019 historically research on sedimentation dynamics associated with confluence features began with a focus on confluence geometry and geomorphology and the implications for depositional fluxes in downstream portions of the main stem river reach contemporary research on sedimentation dynamics in confluences of small tributaries with large rivers have continued to focus on downstream sedimentation dynamics e g benda et al 2004 leite ribeiro et al 2012 marren et al 2014 only recently have studies began to assess sedimentation dynamics of backwater confluence features ford et al 2020 a need exists to quantify dynamics of sediment retention in confluence floodplains quantifying sediment yields sediment source pathway dynamics and sediment retention dynamics in confluence features is now economically feasible because of improvements in high frequency sensors in recent years schilling et al 2011 lloyd et al 2016a vaughan et al 2017 wymore et al 2019 in situ high frequency turbidity sensors are a widely used surrogate for suspended sediment concentrations capable of capturing within event sediment dynamics snyder et al 2018 turbidity is a measurement of the optical clarity of water and correlates well with suspended sediment concentrations because the turbidity is largely controlled by suspended particles in the water column that scatter light rasmussen et al 2009 jastram et al 2010 continuous measurements of sediment concentrations are important in mixed use catchments since traditional methods such as sediment rating curves may not be able to capture time varying sediment transport dynamics resulting in inaccurate sediment yield estimates lewis and eads 2009 seasonal and event to event variability in sediment source activation may result in temporally varied hysteresis patterns and continuous data is needed to identify time varying contributions of prominent sediment sources sherriff et al 2016 high frequency sensors can aid in informing sediment inputs and outputs associated with the highly variable hydraulic conditions at boundaries of a control volume such as in tributary river confluences jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 based on our review table 1 we find long term high frequency sensing studies are lacking in this region of appalachia the focus of this paper is on quantifying sediment source and transport dynamics in a confluence tributary watershed characteristic of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion the three primary objectives of this research were to 1 measure sediment yields from a mixed use watershed in the western allegheny plateau and assess the impact of hysteresis on sediment load estimation methods 2 quantify temporal variability of sediment source and pathway dynamics using a hysteresis based source unmixing analysis and 3 measure capacity of backwater floodplains occurring at confluences of small tributaries and large riverine systems to buffer sediment fluxes delivered to regulated rivers 2 methods 2 1 study site to meet the objectives of the study the fourpole creek watershed 61 km2 located in southwestern west virginia was selected as the study site fourpole creek is a fourth order tributary of the ohio river and the outlet of the watershed is located along the ohio river in huntington wv fig 1 this watershed was selected for study because 1 the watershed is part of a broader project focused on studying controls of habs in the ohio river 2 previous studies have been conducted on sediment and nitrogen dynamics in the watershed jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 3 the fourpole creek watershed reflects the broader land cover geology and topography in the ecoregion jensen and ford 2019 and 4 the presence of a backwater confluence floodplain at the watershed outlet that has well defined upstream and downstream boundaries for monitoring and control volume analysis characteristics of the fourpole creek watershed are typical of disturbed confluence watersheds of the ecoregion the majority of the watershed has moderately steep gradients in upland hillslopes in which the steepest gradients are found in the southwestern portions of the watershed and drastically decrease as the tributary approaches the low gradient region adjacent to the ohio river fig 1 the primary soil type in the watershed is gilphin upshur found in different textures silt loam and complex and at different slopes 15 70 percent slopes throughout the uplands along fourpole creek and its headwaters sensabaugh vandalia urban land complex 3 to 15 percent slopes is prevalent in the heavily developed areas of the watershed urban land wheeling complex 0 6 percent slopes and urban land ashton lindside complex can be found the fourpole creek watershed has geological formations of shale sandstone and alluvium with predominantly c hydrologic group soils the steep gradient uplands of the watershed are primarily deciduous forest with areas of mixed forest and small areas of developed or pasture grassland lowland downstream portions of the watershed have the highest intensity of urban development with high intensity development near the watershed outlet and low medium intensity development moving upstream from the ohio river at the confluence of fourpole creek and the ohio river is a backwater confluence forested wetland fig 1 which is influenced by the contrasting hydrologic regimes of the ohio river and fourpole creek ford et al 2020 the floodplain wetland area is 0 78 km2 most of the wetland is classified as a palustrine forested wetland meaning it is a wetland dominated by trees shrubs mosses and lichens jensen and ford 2019 the water regime is classified as temporarily flooded so surface water is often present throughout the wetland for short periods of time the inundation levels of the wetland are primarily controlled by backwaters from the ohio river but could also be influenced by extreme local events the stream channel is well defined and the streambed is comprised primarily of coarse grained 53 µm sediments ford et al 2020 the floodplain soils are primarily classified as chargin melvin and chargrin silt loams that frequently flood 2 2 data collection and analysis our data collection and analysis methods were focused on obtaining continuous estimates of suspended sediment concentrations and suspended sediment properties e g particle size in order to estimate sediment flux dynamics at upstream and downstream boundaries of the confluence floodplain wetland we established high frequency monitoring platforms upstream of the confluence feature integrating watershed inputs and at the tributary river confluence see fig 1 at the upstream location a ysi exo2 sonde was deployed from august 2018 to december 2019 at the downstream station a ysi exo2 sonde and two teledyne 6712 automated samplers were located at the fourpole creek floodwall station and were deployed from june 2017 to december 2019 at both upstream and downstream locations time integrated sediment trap samplers were deployed and collected at weekly biweekly intervals from july 2016 december 2019 phillips et al 2000 continuous high frequency sensor data was collected at both stations including measurements of turbidity fdom conductivity temperature ph dissolved oxygen and depth at a 15 minute resolution the sonde probes were cleaned and calibrated once a month to prevent instrument drift six quality control checks were used as outlined by campbell et al 2013 including date and time range persistence change in slope internal consistency and spatial consistency linear interpolation was used to gap fill data that was deemed erroneous campbell et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 automated grab samples were collected in order to develop surrogate tss turbidity curves for continuously estimating tss concentrations at the floodwall monitoring station samplers were utilized from november 2018 to august 2019 the isco line was placed on the interior structural wall at the downstream monitoring platform roughly 15 cm off the streambed the lines were located in the concrete culvert at the downstream monitoring station away from erodible sediment sources to minimize biasing or overprediction of sediment concentration in total we collected 126 samples over the deployment period at low medium and high flow conditions each of the isco grab samples were filtered using whatman gf c 1 2 µm filters dried and then reweighed to determine the total suspended solids tss concentration per epa method 160 2 ncast 1977 prior to filtration a turbidity measurement of the homogenized sample was obtained for each isco sample using a turbidity probe identical to the one in the field and 50 ml of each sample was subsampled for particle size distribution analysis a lisst portable xr laser diffraction particle size analyzer from sequoia scientific was used to obtain particle size distribution for each sample linear regression of log transformed tss and turbidity values was performed glysson 1987 curtis et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2009 we found a p value of 0 001 suggesting turbidity is a significant predictor of tss α 0 05 with turbidity explaining approximately 95 of the variance in tss fig 2 similarly a power function was found to describe the relationship between turbidity and median particle diameter d50 of the suspended sediment particle size distribution with a p value 0 001 and an r2 value of 0 71 fig 2 since isco grab samples could not be collected at the upstream site during storm events we assumed that the tss turbidity curve developed at the downstream site was applicable at the upstream site to verify this assumption a small laboratory investigation was conducted archived sediment trap samples ford et al 2020 from both sites were used to create artificial tss concentrations the concentrations of the artificial samples ranged from 50 mg l to 1200 mg l and were created using sediment samples from different seasons over multiple years to account for temporal variability in sediment turbidity measurements were taken for each sample using a ysi exo2 sonde regressions were performed for the upstream and downstream sediment trap tss turbidity relationships we did not observe differences between the upstream and downstream sediment trap calibration curves providing confidence in our assumption of analogous tss turbidity curves at the upstream and downstream monitoring site 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 watershed sediment yield and hysteresis analysis discharge of suspended sediment qss is defined by the integral of the product of sediment concentration and flow velocity with depth eq 1 chang 1988 1 q ss a d c z u z d z where qss was the suspended sediment flux per unit width of the channel mg s m d was the flow depth m a was the depth at which sediment suspension begins m z was the depth of interest m c was the suspended sediment concentration at a given z in the vertical profile mg m3 and u was the velocity at a given z in the vertical profile m s we evaluated the sensitivity of vertical concentration gradients to sediment loading see methodology in supplemental material s1 and found that a uniform concentration profile provided similar estimates of sediment loads this finding reflects the fine textured nature of suspended solids in our system which had d50 that decreased with increasing sediment concentration fig 2 therefore we estimated sediment fluxes as the product of volumetric flowrate and sediment concentration there are no gaging stations monitoring flowrate within fourpole creek and there is often non uniform flow conditions so the flowrates at the upstream location were estimated using an area weighted discharge method based on flowrates at a nearby stream gage hurricane creek usgs 03201405 with comparable watershed characteristics jensen and ford 2019 emerson et al 2005 for the investigation of individual events e g hysteresis analyses the peak depth and peak discharge were aligned using an event specific lag time which varied between 0 75 and 5 h for continuous monitoring e g sediment rating curve analysis the impact of discharge lag time was found to have a negligible impact on sediment yield results therefore a uniform 2 5 hour discharge lag was assumed for continuous analyses to compare sediment yields using continuous sediment measurements to typical sediment rating curve approaches the annual sediment yield for the 2019 calendar year was estimated sediment rating curves were developed both on an annual and seasonal basis to evaluate impacts of seasonal differences in sediment source pathway dynamics due to hysteretic relationship between suspended sediment and discharge separate rating curves were generated for the rising and falling limb of the hydrographs which is similar to methods used in other appalachian sediment transport studies to account for hysteresis effects e g bolstad et al 2006 the curves were derived from hourly paired sediment flux and discharge measurements the sediment flux measurements were found from the continuous model and discharge measurements were calculated using the area weighted method the paired data was separated in to rising and falling limb datasets and a unique power function was fit to each set the power functions were used to predict concentrations from 15 minute discharge data the rising limb function was used when discharge rates were increasing over time and falling limb function was used when discharge rates were decreasing over time the predicted concentrations were used to estimate mass fluxes and summed up to reach a total annual sediment yield measurement in addition to annual analyses we also performed event based analysis for the entire 16 month monitoring period we defined an event as any hydrological response to precipitation that resulted in a rising and falling limb lloyd et al 2016a events were identified by an increase in discharge by at least 20 above flowrates prior to precipitation the discharge can recede for long periods of time depending on the intensity of the storm so the falling limb ended when the flowrate came within 5 of the initial flowrate on the rising limb if another storm occurred before the discharge had the chance to return to prior baseflow conditions the falling limb ended at the lowest flowrate before the discharge began to increase again using this criterion we identified 19 storm events where we had both upstream and downstream data hysteresis analysis was performed with discharge and suspended sediment concentrations for each of the 19 storm events at the upstream site hysteresis was based on the response time of discharge and sediment concentration so the flowrate timing using the area weighted method was adjusted for each event individually so that the peak discharge and the peak flow depth occurred simultaneously sediment concentrations were plotted against discharge for each event and hysteresis loops were assessed regarding categorization we classified hysteresis loop shapes in to five defined classes based on williams 1989 the size and shape of hysteresis loops can be quantified using a hysteresis index butturini et al 2008 langlois et al 2005 lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016a the recent method proposed by lloyd et al 2016a was used to determine the hysteresis index for each event loop first the event flowrates and the sediment concentrations are normalized for each event using the following equations 2a normalized q i q i q min q max q min where q i was the discharge at timestep i q min was the minimum event flowrate and q max was the maximum event flowrate 2b normalized c i c i c min c max c min where c i was the suspended sediment concentration at timestep i c min was the minimum event suspended sediment concentration and c max was the maximum event suspended sediment concentration the normalization of concentration and flowrate allow for the comparison of events with different magnitudes the hysteresis index was calculated using the following equation 2c hi qi c rl q i c fl q i where h i qi was the index at percentile i of q c rl q i was the normalized concentration on the rising limb at percentile i of q and c fl q i was the normalized concentration on the falling limb at the equivalent q the percentiles of discharge were calculated using the following equation 2d q i k q max q min q min where k was the discharge percentile the hysteresis index was calculated for every 5 change in discharge and then averaged over the course of the event the hysteresis index ranges from 1 to 1 and the sign of the index indicates the direction of the loop negative is counterclockwise and positive is clockwise and the magnitude of the number represents the thickness of the loop lloyd et al 2016a 2 3 2 sediment source contributions to further quantify the source dynamics occurring during each event a hysteresis based unmixing method was used to estimate the contributions from two different classifications of sources megnounif et al 2013 detailed description of the methodology is provided in supplemental material s2 the total suspended sediment yield ys for each event can be estimated as follows y s y s 1 y s 2 j 0 n c j q j c j 1 q j 1 2 t j 1 t j 10 3 3a where q j was the discharge m3 s at time t j c j was the sediment concentration g l at time t j and n was the number of measurements for the event y s 1 was classified as the base load and represented sediment production from weathering processes occurring in the stream network such as streambed bank and gully erosion y s 2 was classified as the wash load and represented the supply of new sediment sources that become available such as material from uplands bank caving and re suspension of fresh deposits within the stream network megnounif et al 2013 the type of hysteresis loop observed for each event can be used to identify sediment sources by decomposing the loops into a series of stages the number of stages is dependent upon the hydrograph and loop type and a specific sediment rating curve was defined for each stage and expressed as the function c k i t j f ik q j 3b where i refers to the hysteresis class type i vi and k refers to the stage number 1 5 detailed descriptions of ys1 and ys2 calculations for each class type are provided in supplemental information s1 in addition to the ys1 and ys2 unmixing analysis the ys2 component was further decomposed the ys2 component was often found to have two peaks during events this suggests activation of distinct sediment sources source a that is activated on the rising limb of the event and gets depleted before peak flow ys2 a and source b that is activated on the receding limb of the hydrograph ys2 b for events that had multiple sediment peaks and only one discharge peak the ys2 component was separated at the local minimum between the two peaks the ys2 sediment yield prior to the local minimum was assumed to be associated with source a and the ys2 yield after the minimum was assumed to be source b 2 3 3 sediment retention in backwater confluences sediment fluxes into and out of the backwater confluence control volume at the watershed outlet were used to assess sediment retention on an event and annual basis the nineteen events investigated in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 were examined from september 2018 to december 2019 sediment fluxes were calculated at the upstream and downstream site at a 15 minute interval since the downstream site is often subject to backwater from the ohio river during events fluxes measured during negative flowrates were considered to be inputs qssi n down into the control volume and fluxes measured during positive flowrates were considered outputs qssou t down the fluxes into the wetland at the upstream site were always considered as inputs qssi n up net retention in the control volume was estimated using a mass balance for the system netretention q s s i n up q s s i n down q s s o u t down 4 downstream sediment fluxes were estimated using an analogous approach to that described in section 2 3 1 for the upstream location the flowrates downstream at the confluence of the ohio river and fourpole creek were estimated using a previously published hec ras unsteady flow model for the study site jensen and ford 2018 jensen and ford 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment yield measurements from disturbed appalachian watersheds continuous estimates of sediment flux suggest that sediment fluxes from fourpole creek are comparable to other regions of appalachia with watershed disturbances table 1 the continuous sediment yield for calendar year 2019 was estimated to be 82 6 t km 2 yr 1 reported annual sediment loading estimates throughout appalachia ranged from 3 6 to 273 t km2 averaging around 52 t km2 table 1 nevertheless the studies that reported the highest sediment loadings were influenced by mining disturbances watersheds that did not experience mining disturbances had average sediment loadings of 26 t km2 which was less than one third the measured yield for fourpole creek comparison of sediment yield results using the continuous monitoring and sediment rating curve approaches showed that both seasonal and annual rating curve methods underpredicted sediment loads table 2 fig 3 the annual power regression fit to the rising and falling limb datasets had strong r2 values of 0 852 and 0 805 respectively however the sediment rating curve estimated a suspended sediment yield of 16 9 t km 2 yr 1 for the 2019 calendar year which was only 20 of the yield predicted by the continuous data over predication occurred at lower base fluxes and the under prediction periods occurred during higher event fluxes fig 3c the annual sediment rating curve estimated every event yield significantly lower estimating anywhere from 4 6 to 30 of the modeled event yields table 2 seasonal rating curves were found to be more accurate than the annual curve but still severely underpredicted annual yields and generally had equivalent or improved r2 values as compared with the annual curve fig 3a b this method predicted 59 0 t km2 yr which was greater than three fold higher than yields predicted from the annual curves but still only about 71 of the continuously monitored estimates the seasonal rating curve approach improved prediction of low flow periods and peak concentrations although peak concentrations were still often underpredicted fig 3c regarding individual events several events in the winter and spring were well predicted by the rating curve nevertheless the results were highly variable and similar magnitude events would be well predicted during one event but poorly predicted in the next e g 5 12 19 and 5 17 19 hysteresis analysis results displayed a variety of hysteresis loop types and magnitudes throughout the monitoring period resulting in seasonality of hysteresis dynamics table 3 figs 4 and 5 the most frequent loop shape was the figure eight shape that occurred during nine of the events followed by five counterclockwise loops three single lines one single line with a clockwise loop and one clockwise loop the figure eight shape occurred during four out of the six summer events but was also seen periodically in the winter spring and fall months in the spring the counterclockwise and figure eight loops were equally prevalent the fall experienced three different hysteresis shapes a fig 8 a single line and a counterclockwise loop winter was the most diverse season in which all hysteresis classifications were observed except a line with loop hysteresis index was also observed to vary seasonally fig 5 a timeseries of the average event hysteresis indices shows that the hysteresis loops in the winter display weak positive patterns average hi 0 05 this suggests either single line hysteresis with fairly balanced contributions of clockwise and counterclockwise sources the loops in the summer transition to stronger negative patterns suggesting prominence of the counterclockwise source average hi 0 34 our result corroborates findings that have identified deficiencies in sediment rating curve approaches for estimating sediment yields and suggest that caution should be used in mixed use watersheds of this region where complex hysteresis patterns vary on an event to event basis lewis and eads 2009 investigated the performance of the sediment rating curve in a 689mi2 mountainous watershed that was predominately forested with some agricultural 21 and urban disturbances 0 2 in the south fork eel river daily suspended sediment concentrations when compared to estimates from 10 minute turbidity poorly represented the actual patterns and grossly underestimated the daily sediment loads lewis and eads 2009 rating curves usually result in poor estimates for three main reasons 1 suspended sediment concentration is often out of phase with discharge and leads to biases in load estimation 2 high discharge and sediment concentrations are inadequately represented and 3 rating curves cannot account for intermittent sediment delivery from erosion events or account for differences between rainfall and snowmelt runoff walling and webb 1981 lewis and eads 2009 while seasonal rating curves for fourpole creek improved sediment predictions variability in hysteretic patterns also existed within seasons resulting in poor predictions of sediment loadings cumulatively these finding suggest that other disturbed systems with complex temporally varied hysteresis patterns in the region may underpredict downstream sediment fluxes when using sediment rating curve methods the higher sediment fluxes for fourpole creek as compared to other appalachian watersheds may reflect methodological differences in sediment yield estimates or differences in disturbance and more monitoring efforts are needed in this region using high frequency sensors 3 2 sediment source contributions unmixing analysis results suggest high variability in source contributions between baseload stream network sources and wash load sources in the watershed table 3 fig 6 cumulatively results of our event analysis show that 53 of the sediment yield was associated with baseload ys1 and 47 was associated with wash load ys2 the base load source ys1 was highly variable between events accounting for between 11 and 100 of the suspended sediment yield all three single line hysteresis patterns 100 baseload were found in late fall and early winter suggesting other sources become exhausted or disconnected during this time of year regarding the washload source ys2 a and ys2 b contributed 22 and 26 of the total sediment yield respectively for the nineteen monitored events while the ys2 b source was generally found be the most prominent washload source during the majority of the monitoring period ys2 a was observed to be the prominent washload source during the saturated period of mid winter through mid spring comparison of sediment source unmixing results for the baseload source ys1 with reported loads from other appalachian watersheds suggest that urban landcover in the watershed likely exacerbates in channel and gully erosion for fourpole creek we found the ys1 source to comprise 53 of the total sediment yields from our 19 monitored storm events in channel erosion has been recognized as the major contributor to long term sediment yields in urban watersheds on average accounting for about two thirds of the annual sediment yield trimble 1997 rapid runoff from impervious areas imparts high shear stresses on the stream channel that result in erosion of bed and bank material megnounif et al 2013 further while gully erosion is most commonly documented in agricultural environments high erosion rates have also been observed in urban areas wolman 1967 gudino elizondo et al 2018 appalachian watersheds with urban disturbances williams and reed 1972 maryland department of the environment 2007 reported higher sediment yields than watersheds that were predominately undisturbed forests e g bolstad et al 2006 dun et al 2013 cumulatively these results suggest urban disturbances may significantly influence annual sediment budgets in mixed use watersheds typical of tributaries draining to regulated rivers of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion likewise our results suggest that the sensitivity of the analytical method to urban disturbance could enable quantification of the impact of watershed management practices e g low impact development on sediment load reductions in urban watersheds highlighting the utility of this approach for watershed managers our results suggest that the clockwise source ys2 a is likely associated with previously deposited sediments in the channel that are flushed at the onset of the event and the counterclockwise source ys2 b is likely associated with sediments eroded from macropores in the forested uplands of the watershed broadly the wash load ys2 represents the supply of new sediment sources that become available such as material from hillslopes bank caving and re suspension of fresh deposits megnounif et al 2013 the ys2 a yields were found to be a more prominent component of the sediment yield for events with higher antecedent moisture e g winter and spring as evidenced by the seasonality in the hysteresis index fig 5 while high antecedent moisture conditions have been shown to cause more upland connectivity forested uplands of the watershed were distal sources which typically produce counterclockwise hysteresis loops further counterclockwise hysteresis is often found to occur in urbanizing basins with high sediment availability since stormwater runoff dilutes suspended sediment on the rising limb and upland sediments arrive on the falling limb on the hydrograph e g gellis 2013 as a result we postulate that clockwise sources are associated with re suspension of fresh deposits within the fluvial network from previous events the counterclockwise loops and negative hi values from the second wash load source ys2 b often occurred in warm summer months low antecedent moisture conditions wymore et al 2019 recently found peak concentrations on receding limbs of the hydrograph in forested watersheds to be attributed to connectivity of macropore channels and subsurface sediment erosion to the fluvial network laboratory scale studies have shown that during warm dry conditions macropores develop thin easily erodible surface crusts along macropore walls that are eroded during subsequent storm events wilson et al 2018 these lines of evidence support macroporous subsurface erosion in forested areas as an important ambient sediment source to consider in watershed sediment budgets in the region timing of sediment source connectivity and flux in small tributary watersheds of regulated rivers may have important broader implications for hab development and thus may be important considerations in watershed management strategies the ys2 b source was the primary sediment source occurring in the dry summer prior to the hab that occurred on the ohio river in late september 2019 during storm events in the wet summer of 2018 the base load sources dominated the three monitored events however in the events of the dry summer of 2019 the wash load sources were the dominant sources for those events particularly ys2 b given the findings that suggests the source is derived from macropores of forested uplands this could be a prominent source of sediment supplied to the ohio river basin during the dry summer months in the western allegheny plateau this is significant given baseflow of the regulated river promotes favorable conditions to retain sediments and sediments have been recently recognized to influence habs through seeding the river with harmful cyanobacteria supplying nutrients for hab growth and providing a competitive advantage for hab proliferation by creating adverse conditions for green algae kitchens et al 2018 paerl and huisman 2008 walsby et al 1997 levy 2017 further investigations are needed to assess the prominence of this sediment source at broader spatial scales and to characterize biochemical compositions of this sediment source and it s potential role in hab formation and proliferation 3 3 sediment retention in backwater confluences source sink dynamics were highly variable for the nineteen monitored events with periods of net positive and net negative sediment retention table 4 fig 7 for sixteen events the confluence control volume was found to be a net sink of sediment positive sediment retention and three events showed that the control volume was a net source of sediment negative sediment retention the percentage of sediment retention during each event ranged from 29 to 94 with the highest percent in the winter events the three source events occurred in the spring and summer event 1 had the highest inputs at 741 785 kg being transported into the system however event 9 was the largest sink with 483 674 kg of sediment retained this is likely attributed to the extent of inundation from riverine backwaters given the maximum stage at the outlet was more than three fold greater during event 9 as compared to event 1 outlet stage correlated with volume of water stored in the floodplain jensen and ford 2019 and these conditions promote increased residence times decreasing flow velocities and thus increasing deposition the impacts of this can be visualized when comparing the turbidity measurements at the upstream and downstream monitoring station for each event fig 7 during event 1 the turbidity peaks at the upstream and downstream site are only about 45 min apart the sediment was routed quickly through the system allowing only about a 15 decrease in peak turbidity between the monitoring stations during event 9 the extreme backwater conditions greatly increased the residence time and the turbidity peaks at the upstream and downstream site are about 10 5 h apart the slower flow conditions enhanced depositional fluxes and decreased the peak turbidity between the monitoring stations by 47 the cumulative impact of floodplain inundation on sediment retention in the confluence floodplain wetland was observed using our continuous flux estimates over the 2019 calendar year fig 8 during periods of increasing depth an increase in sediment retention occurs and the magnitude or slope of the increase is often proportional to the magnitude of the outlet stage for the event these increases reflect either transient storage within the water column or depositional fluxes within the inundated floodplain as outlet stage recedes net retention becomes negative suggesting either erosion of the floodplain soils or sediments in the water column are transported downstream to the ohio river the average outlet stage throughout the winter was 2 5 m and during this period net retention increased by 1 446 23 tons of sediment cumulatively 61 of the annual net retention occurred during the first 3 months of the calendar year our results suggest confluence floodplains of tributary watersheds in appalachia promote high rates of retention through deposition in the regulated river backwaters and this retention is predominantly associated with tributary sediment inputs the continuous sediment yield results for 2019 showed that about 34 of total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained and that much of the retention was associated with storm event inputs from fourpole creek table 4 we estimate fourpole creek transported 5 007 1 tons of suspended sediment into the confluence control volume and the ohio river transported 1993 9 tons of suspended sediment into the confluence control volume over the 2019 calendar year at the outlet 4643 6 tons of suspended sediment was exported to the ohio river from fourpole creek a net retention of 2357 3 tons of sediment within the 0 78 km2 confluence floodplain was estimated and approximately 55 of this retention was estimated to occur during the fifteen events suggesting much of the retention was associated with fourpole creek sediment inputs our findings are supported by results from riverine floodplains in estuarine environments highlighting the importance of inundation and residence time to retain sediments from tributary inputs in general riparian wetlands located along low order streams are recognized to be important sites for sediment retention whigham et al 1988 for fourpole creek 34 of the total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained no studies to our knowledge have quantified sediment depositional fluxes in backwater confluence floodplains of regulated rivers but our results are supported by a study measuring sediment deposition in floodplain confluences in tributaries of the chesapeake bay noe and hupp 2009 in their study the floodplain retention was reported as the proportion of each river s annual load upstream of the floodplain sediment accumulation in the floodplains represented from 30 to 690 of the tributaries sediment loads for the fourpole creek confluence floodplain sediment retention cumulatively represented 47 of the tributary s sediment load noe and hupp found sediment retention was correlated with river sediment loads and floodplain inundation our results corroborate this finding given that 61 of the annual net retention occurred during the first 3 months of the year when the outlet stage caused extended periods of inundation and high residence times since floodplain deposition can only occur during infrequent high magnitude storm events event retention rates were also examined of the events in which the floodplain was a sink retention rates were found to range from 29 to as high as 94 the event retention was highest during periods of high inundation and on average 61 of sediment during the winter event inputs were retained in the floodplain these results show that backwater confluence floodplains have a quantitatively large role in intercepting and storing sediment inputs from upstream tributaries therefore efforts to limit downstream sediment loads should ensure the function of floodplains is maintained or enhanced particularly in periods where retention is low e g summer events where floodplain connectivity was minimal that often coincide with presence of toxic habs 4 conclusions the major findings of this work are as follows the measured sediment yields from the small watershed in the western allegheny plateau were found to fall within loads reported in watersheds from other regions of appalachia although on the high side of loadings for systems without mining which may be attributed to the urban disturbances in the watershed or the methodology used to quantify yields sediment rating curves underpredicted sediment fluxes which was attributed to results of our hysteresis analysis that showed seasonal and within season variability of sediment source contributions and source activation in the mixed use watershed results of the source unmixing analysis suggest in channel erosion recently deposited sediments and erosion of subsurface macropores in the forested uplands are likely significant sources of sediment in the mixed use watershed and have high temporal variability that should be considered in watershed management strategies confluence floodplains were found to have a quantitatively large role in intercepting and storing sediment inputs in our system 34 of the total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained annually and event sediment retention of the watershed inputs was found to be as high as 94 despite the wetland comprising only 0 78 km2 of the watershed drainage area these results demonstrate the ability confluence floodplains have to buffer sediment fluxes from small tributaries to regulated rivers while our work provides new insights into sediment fate and transport dynamics in backwater confluence tributaries further work is needed to build upon the results of this study in particular replication of high frequency sediment monitoring in different watersheds is needed within this important ecoregion which strongly influences water quality in the ohio river the magnitude of sediment retention in backwater confluences suggests there may also be significant implications for carbon and nutrient budgets when integrated along the extent of river basin the fate of these nutrients is an important area of future work given the perirheic mixing zone that develops within these confluences are recognized biogeochemical hotspots jones et al 2014 jensen and ford 2019 credit

4247,harmful algal blooms habs have increased in the ohio river basin over the past decade fine sediment dynamics are now recognized to play an important role in the proliferation and toxicity of habs as a result the fate of sediment at confluences of tributaries and regulated river systems may be important zones for sediment retention and burial the objective of this study was to improve understanding of watershed sediment loading dynamics and backwater inundation impacts on sedimentation within confluence watersheds the study site selected for this work was the fourpole creek watershed in the western allegheny plateau ecoregion of appalachia which is a mixed use watershed with predominantly forested and urban landcover with a backwater floodplain wetland at the confluence with the ohio river approximately 16 months of high frequency 15 minute turbidity data was used as a surrogate for total suspended solids at upstream and downstream nodes of the backwater confluence feature continuous sediment yield estimates suggested an annual sediment yield of 82 t km2 and was found to be higher than sediment yields reported elsewhere in appalachian watersheds without mining disturbances a modified sediment rating curve using both seasonal and annual regression approaches were found to underpredict sediment yield by 29 and 80 respectively a hysteresis based source unmixing method and hysteresis index were used to quantify sediment source and flow pathways during events and suggested high variability in sediment source contributions both seasonally and within seasons suggesting three likely sediment sources in the watershed including in channel gully erosion resuspension of recently deposited sediment in the fluvial network and erosion of subsurface macropores from forested uplands upstream downstream monitoring of the confluence floodplain suggested 34 of the annual sediment inputs were retained during the continuously monitored 2019 calendar

most effectively achieved by focusing on small tributaries that have confluences in close proximity to the regulated rivers given sediments in these systems experience limited transit time for

suburban landscapes in the lower gradient downstream portions of the watershed omernik 1987 united states geological survey n d the tributaries often discharge to the regulated river through a hydraulically complex floodplain confluence zone which is prone to inundation from backwaters of the regulated river and stormflows from the watershed jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 this study focuses on quantifying watershed sediment fluxes prominent sediment sources and sedimentation dynamics within confluence floodplains for small tributary watersheds of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion review of existing studies reporting sediment yields from appalachian watersheds suggests there has been limited study of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion and the impact of urban landcover on watershed sediment yields see table 1 of the studies reporting sediment yields in appalachia the majority were focused on watersheds in the central appalachian ecoregion studies have emphasized the impact of mining on watershed sediment fluxes but largely ignored effects from other land use and land cover types burns and macarthur 1996 ward 1984 fox and martin 2015 although two of the studies from our review were conducted in mixed use watersheds maryland department of the environment 2007 williams and reed 1972 none explicitly examined the influence of landcover on watershed sediment fluxes and more specifically the role of urban and suburban landscapes which are prominent in the confluence watersheds of the region studies in appalachia have broadly used variations of sediment rating curves to estimate annual sediment loads ward 1984 burns and macarthur 1996 bolstad et al 2006 nevertheless others have documented that rating curves may not capture the temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration prompting a need to evaluate this methodology in mixed use appalachian watersheds lewis and eads 2009 schilling et al 2011 quantification of prominent sediment sources during storm events can be conducted using hysteresis based analyses megnounif et al 2013 lloyd et al 2016a wymore et al 2019 sediment hysteresis has been used to link sediment source availability and flow pathway dynamics to watershed sediment fluxes in mixed use watersheds the supply and location of sediment sources within the watershed have a strong influence on the hysteretic behavior during storm events resulting in clockwise single line counterclockwise or complex loop structures gellis 2013 in forested watersheds the suspended sediment in streams is typically supplied from surface erosion on hillslopes subsurface erosion sources and previously deposited sediments in the stream network resulting in clockwise counterclockwise and complex hysteresis gomi et al 2005 rivenbark and jackson 2004 wymore et al 2019 paustian and beschta 1979 sidle and campbell 1985 sediment sources in urban watersheds often include upland sediments that are connected on the receding limb of the hydrograph due to a dilution effect resulting in counterclockwise hysteresis as well as enhanced gully and streambank erosion resulting in single line linear hysteresis devereux et al 2010 gellis 2013 williams 1989 megnounif et al 2013 both qualitative and quantitative metrics are used to characterize hysteretic behavior of sediment during storm events normalized flow and sediment concentration plots and quantitative hysteresis indices provide insights into the shape and magnitude of hysteretic patterns lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016b quantitative indices can also provide insight into seasonality of dominant sources and the environmental variables driving sediment source loading dynamics sherriff et al 2016 methods have also been developed for source unmixing based on hysteretic patterns in which source signals are used to partition sediment yields into baseload and wash load sources megnounif et al 2013 coupling these analytical hysteresis methods for continuously monitored events throughout a year can provide insight into prominent sediment sources being delivered from tributaries to backwater confluences backwater confluences are defined in this study as low gradient regions where low order tributaries discharge to larger high order regulated rivers during flooding the tributary and the floodplain become hydrologically connected when the riverine floodwaters meet the locally derived water in a process known as perirheic mixing junk et al 1989 tockner et al 1999 jones et al 2014 zones of perirheic mixing promote deposition dynamics and nutrient transformation processes due to increased hydraulic residence times and steep redox gradients mertes 1997 banach et al 2009 chow et al 2013 jones et al 2014 jensen and ford 2019 historically research on sedimentation dynamics associated with confluence features began with a focus on confluence geometry and geomorphology and the implications for depositional fluxes in downstream portions of the main stem river reach contemporary research on sedimentation dynamics in confluences of small tributaries with large rivers have continued to focus on downstream sedimentation dynamics e g benda et al 2004 leite ribeiro et al 2012 marren et al 2014 only recently have studies began to assess sedimentation dynamics of backwater confluence features ford et al 2020 a need exists to quantify dynamics of sediment retention in confluence floodplains quantifying sediment yields sediment source pathway dynamics and sediment retention dynamics in confluence features is now economically feasible because of improvements in high frequency sensors in recent years schilling et al 2011 lloyd et al 2016a vaughan et al 2017 wymore et al 2019 in situ high frequency turbidity sensors are a widely used surrogate for suspended sediment concentrations capable of capturing within event sediment dynamics snyder et al 2018 turbidity is a measurement of the optical clarity of water and correlates well with suspended sediment concentrations because the turbidity is largely controlled by suspended particles in the water column that scatter light rasmussen et al 2009 jastram et al 2010 continuous measurements of sediment concentrations are important in mixed use catchments since traditional methods such as sediment rating curves may not be able to capture time varying sediment transport dynamics resulting in inaccurate sediment yield estimates lewis and eads 2009 seasonal and event to event variability in sediment source activation may result in temporally varied hysteresis patterns and continuous data is needed to identify time varying contributions of prominent sediment sources sherriff et al 2016 high frequency sensors can aid in informing sediment inputs and outputs associated with the highly variable hydraulic conditions at boundaries of a control volume such as in tributary river confluences jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 based on our review table 1 we find long term high frequency sensing studies are lacking in this region of appalachia the focus of this paper is on quantifying sediment source and transport dynamics in a confluence tributary watershed characteristic of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion the three primary objectives of this research were to 1 measure sediment yields from a mixed use watershed in the western allegheny plateau and assess the impact of hysteresis on sediment load estimation methods 2 quantify temporal variability of sediment source and pathway dynamics using a hysteresis based source unmixing analysis and 3 measure capacity of backwater floodplains occurring at confluences of small tributaries and large riverine systems to buffer sediment fluxes delivered to regulated rivers 2 methods 2 1 study site to meet the objectives of the study the fourpole creek watershed 61 km2 located in southwestern west virginia was selected as the study site fourpole creek is a fourth order tributary of the ohio river and the outlet of the watershed is located along the ohio river in huntington wv fig 1 this watershed was selected for study because 1 the watershed is part of a broader project focused on studying controls of habs in the ohio river 2 previous studies have been conducted on sediment and nitrogen dynamics in the watershed jensen and ford 2019 ford et al 2020 3 the fourpole creek watershed reflects the broader land cover geology and topography in the ecoregion jensen and ford 2019 and 4 the presence of a backwater confluence floodplain at the watershed outlet that has well defined upstream and downstream boundaries for monitoring and control volume analysis characteristics of the fourpole creek watershed are typical of disturbed confluence watersheds of the ecoregion the majority of the watershed has moderately steep gradients in upland hillslopes in which the steepest gradients are found in the southwestern portions of the watershed and drastically decrease as the tributary approaches the low gradient region adjacent to the ohio river fig 1 the primary soil type in the watershed is gilphin upshur found in different textures silt loam and complex and at different slopes 15 70 percent slopes throughout the uplands along fourpole creek and its headwaters sensabaugh vandalia urban land complex 3 to 15 percent slopes is prevalent in the heavily developed areas of the watershed urban land wheeling complex 0 6 percent slopes and urban land ashton lindside complex can be found the fourpole creek watershed has geological formations of shale sandstone and alluvium with predominantly c hydrologic group soils the steep gradient uplands of the watershed are primarily deciduous forest with areas of mixed forest and small areas of developed or pasture grassland lowland downstream portions of the watershed have the highest intensity of urban development with high intensity development near the watershed outlet and low medium intensity development moving upstream from the ohio river at the confluence of fourpole creek and the ohio river is a backwater confluence forested wetland fig 1 which is influenced by the contrasting hydrologic regimes of the ohio river and fourpole creek ford et al 2020 the floodplain wetland area is 0 78 km2 most of the wetland is classified as a palustrine forested wetland meaning it is a wetland dominated by trees shrubs mosses and lichens jensen and ford 2019 the water regime is classified as temporarily flooded so surface water is often present throughout the wetland for short periods of time the inundation levels of the wetland are primarily controlled by backwaters from the ohio river but could also be influenced by extreme local events the stream channel is well defined and the streambed is comprised primarily of coarse grained 53 µm sediments ford et al 2020 the floodplain soils are primarily classified as chargin melvin and chargrin silt loams that frequently flood 2 2 data collection and analysis our data collection and analysis methods were focused on obtaining continuous estimates of suspended sediment concentrations and suspended sediment properties e g particle size in order to estimate sediment flux dynamics at upstream and downstream boundaries of the confluence floodplain wetland we established high frequency monitoring platforms upstream of the confluence feature integrating watershed inputs and at the tributary river confluence see fig 1 at the upstream location a ysi exo2 sonde was deployed from august 2018 to december 2019 at the downstream station a ysi exo2 sonde and two teledyne 6712 automated samplers were located at the fourpole creek floodwall station and were deployed from june 2017 to december 2019 at both upstream and downstream locations time integrated sediment trap samplers were deployed and collected at weekly biweekly intervals from july 2016 december 2019 phillips et al 2000 continuous high frequency sensor data was collected at both stations including measurements of turbidity fdom conductivity temperature ph dissolved oxygen and depth at a 15 minute resolution the sonde probes were cleaned and calibrated once a month to prevent instrument drift six quality control checks were used as outlined by campbell et al 2013 including date and time range persistence change in slope internal consistency and spatial consistency linear interpolation was used to gap fill data that was deemed erroneous campbell et al 2013 snyder et al 2018 automated grab samples were collected in order to develop surrogate tss turbidity curves for continuously estimating tss concentrations at the floodwall monitoring station samplers were utilized from november 2018 to august 2019 the isco line was placed on the interior structural wall at the downstream monitoring platform roughly 15 cm off the streambed the lines were located in the concrete culvert at the downstream monitoring station away from erodible sediment sources to minimize biasing or overprediction of sediment concentration in total we collected 126 samples over the deployment period at low medium and high flow conditions each of the isco grab samples were filtered using whatman gf c 1 2 µm filters dried and then reweighed to determine the total suspended solids tss concentration per epa method 160 2 ncast 1977 prior to filtration a turbidity measurement of the homogenized sample was obtained for each isco sample using a turbidity probe identical to the one in the field and 50 ml of each sample was subsampled for particle size distribution analysis a lisst portable xr laser diffraction particle size analyzer from sequoia scientific was used to obtain particle size distribution for each sample linear regression of log transformed tss and turbidity values was performed glysson 1987 curtis et al 2006 rasmussen et al 2009 we found a p value of 0 001 suggesting turbidity is a significant predictor of tss α 0 05 with turbidity explaining approximately 95 of the variance in tss fig 2 similarly a power function was found to describe the relationship between turbidity and median particle diameter d50 of the suspended sediment particle size distribution with a p value 0 001 and an r2 value of 0 71 fig 2 since isco grab samples could not be collected at the upstream site during storm events we assumed that the tss turbidity curve developed at the downstream site was applicable at the upstream site to verify this assumption a small laboratory investigation was conducted archived sediment trap samples ford et al 2020 from both sites were used to create artificial tss concentrations the concentrations of the artificial samples ranged from 50 mg l to 1200 mg l and were created using sediment samples from different seasons over multiple years to account for temporal variability in sediment turbidity measurements were taken for each sample using a ysi exo2 sonde regressions were performed for the upstream and downstream sediment trap tss turbidity relationships we did not observe differences between the upstream and downstream sediment trap calibration curves providing confidence in our assumption of analogous tss turbidity curves at the upstream and downstream monitoring site 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 watershed sediment yield and hysteresis analysis discharge of suspended sediment qss is defined by the integral of the product of sediment concentration and flow velocity with depth eq 1 chang 1988 1 q ss a d c z u z d z where qss was the suspended sediment flux per unit width of the channel mg s m d was the flow depth m a was the depth at which sediment suspension begins m z was the depth of interest m c was the suspended sediment concentration at a given z in the vertical profile mg m3 and u was the velocity at a given z in the vertical profile m s we evaluated the sensitivity of vertical concentration gradients to sediment loading see methodology in supplemental material s1 and found that a uniform concentration profile provided similar estimates of sediment loads this finding reflects the fine textured nature of suspended solids in our system which had d50 that decreased with increasing sediment concentration fig 2 therefore we estimated sediment fluxes as the product of volumetric flowrate and sediment concentration there are no gaging stations monitoring flowrate within fourpole creek and there is often non uniform flow conditions so the flowrates at the upstream location were estimated using an area weighted discharge method based on flowrates at a nearby stream gage hurricane creek usgs 03201405 with comparable watershed characteristics jensen and ford 2019 emerson et al 2005 for the investigation of individual events e g hysteresis analyses the peak depth and peak discharge were aligned using an event specific lag time which varied between 0 75 and 5 h for continuous monitoring e g sediment rating curve analysis the impact of discharge lag time was found to have a negligible impact on sediment yield results therefore a uniform 2 5 hour discharge lag was assumed for continuous analyses to compare sediment yields using continuous sediment measurements to typical sediment rating curve approaches the annual sediment yield for the 2019 calendar year was estimated sediment rating curves were developed both on an annual and seasonal basis to evaluate impacts of seasonal differences in sediment source pathway dynamics due to hysteretic relationship between suspended sediment and discharge separate rating curves were generated for the rising and falling limb of the hydrographs which is similar to methods used in other appalachian sediment transport studies to account for hysteresis effects e g bolstad et al 2006 the curves were derived from hourly paired sediment flux and discharge measurements the sediment flux measurements were found from the continuous model and discharge measurements were calculated using the area weighted method the paired data was separated in to rising and falling limb datasets and a unique power function was fit to each set the power functions were used to predict concentrations from 15 minute discharge data the rising limb function was used when discharge rates were increasing over time and falling limb function was used when discharge rates were decreasing over time the predicted concentrations were used to estimate mass fluxes and summed up to reach a total annual sediment yield measurement in addition to annual analyses we also performed event based analysis for the entire 16 month monitoring period we defined an event as any hydrological response to precipitation that resulted in a rising and falling limb lloyd et al 2016a events were identified by an increase in discharge by at least 20 above flowrates prior to precipitation the discharge can recede for long periods of time depending on the intensity of the storm so the falling limb ended when the flowrate came within 5 of the initial flowrate on the rising limb if another storm occurred before the discharge had the chance to return to prior baseflow conditions the falling limb ended at the lowest flowrate before the discharge began to increase again using this criterion we identified 19 storm events where we had both upstream and downstream data hysteresis analysis was performed with discharge and suspended sediment concentrations for each of the 19 storm events at the upstream site hysteresis was based on the response time of discharge and sediment concentration so the flowrate timing using the area weighted method was adjusted for each event individually so that the peak discharge and the peak flow depth occurred simultaneously sediment concentrations were plotted against discharge for each event and hysteresis loops were assessed regarding categorization we classified hysteresis loop shapes in to five defined classes based on williams 1989 the size and shape of hysteresis loops can be quantified using a hysteresis index butturini et al 2008 langlois et al 2005 lawler et al 2006 lloyd et al 2016a the recent method proposed by lloyd et al 2016a was used to determine the hysteresis index for each event loop first the event flowrates and the sediment concentrations are normalized for each event using the following equations 2a normalized q i q i q min q max q min where q i was the discharge at timestep i q min was the minimum event flowrate and q max was the maximum event flowrate 2b normalized c i c i c min c max c min where c i was the suspended sediment concentration at timestep i c min was the minimum event suspended sediment concentration and c max was the maximum event suspended sediment concentration the normalization of concentration and flowrate allow for the comparison of events with different magnitudes the hysteresis index was calculated using the following equation 2c hi qi c rl q i c fl q i where h i qi was the index at percentile i of q c rl q i was the normalized concentration on the rising limb at percentile i of q and c fl q i was the normalized concentration on the falling limb at the equivalent q the percentiles of discharge were calculated using the following equation 2d q i k q max q min q min where k was the discharge percentile the hysteresis index was calculated for every 5 change in discharge and then averaged over the course of the event the hysteresis index ranges from 1 to 1 and the sign of the index indicates the direction of the loop negative is counterclockwise and positive is clockwise and the magnitude of the number represents the thickness of the loop lloyd et al 2016a 2 3 2 sediment source contributions to further quantify the source dynamics occurring during each event a hysteresis based unmixing method was used to estimate the contributions from two different classifications of sources megnounif et al 2013 detailed description of the methodology is provided in supplemental material s2 the total suspended sediment yield ys for each event can be estimated as follows y s y s 1 y s 2 j 0 n c j q j c j 1 q j 1 2 t j 1 t j 10 3 3a where q j was the discharge m3 s at time t j c j was the sediment concentration g l at time t j and n was the number of measurements for the event y s 1 was classified as the base load and represented sediment production from weathering processes occurring in the stream network such as streambed bank and gully erosion y s 2 was classified as the wash load and represented the supply of new sediment sources that become available such as material from uplands bank caving and re suspension of fresh deposits within the stream network megnounif et al 2013 the type of hysteresis loop observed for each event can be used to identify sediment sources by decomposing the loops into a series of stages the number of stages is dependent upon the hydrograph and loop type and a specific sediment rating curve was defined for each stage and expressed as the function c k i t j f ik q j 3b where i refers to the hysteresis class type i vi and k refers to the stage number 1 5 detailed descriptions of ys1 and ys2 calculations for each class type are provided in supplemental information s1 in addition to the ys1 and ys2 unmixing analysis the ys2 component was further decomposed the ys2 component was often found to have two peaks during events this suggests activation of distinct sediment sources source a that is activated on the rising limb of the event and gets depleted before peak flow ys2 a and source b that is activated on the receding limb of the hydrograph ys2 b for events that had multiple sediment peaks and only one discharge peak the ys2 component was separated at the local minimum between the two peaks the ys2 sediment yield prior to the local minimum was assumed to be associated with source a and the ys2 yield after the minimum was assumed to be source b 2 3 3 sediment retention in backwater confluences sediment fluxes into and out of the backwater confluence control volume at the watershed outlet were used to assess sediment retention on an event and annual basis the nineteen events investigated in sections 2 3 1 and 2 3 2 were examined from september 2018 to december 2019 sediment fluxes were calculated at the upstream and downstream site at a 15 minute interval since the downstream site is often subject to backwater from the ohio river during events fluxes measured during negative flowrates were considered to be inputs qssi n down into the control volume and fluxes measured during positive flowrates were considered outputs qssou t down the fluxes into the wetland at the upstream site were always considered as inputs qssi n up net retention in the control volume was estimated using a mass balance for the system netretention q s s i n up q s s i n down q s s o u t down 4 downstream sediment fluxes were estimated using an analogous approach to that described in section 2 3 1 for the upstream location the flowrates downstream at the confluence of the ohio river and fourpole creek were estimated using a previously published hec ras unsteady flow model for the study site jensen and ford 2018 jensen and ford 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment yield measurements from disturbed appalachian watersheds continuous estimates of sediment flux suggest that sediment fluxes from fourpole creek are comparable to other regions of appalachia with watershed disturbances table 1 the continuous sediment yield for calendar year 2019 was estimated to be 82 6 t km 2 yr 1 reported annual sediment loading estimates throughout appalachia ranged from 3 6 to 273 t km2 averaging around 52 t km2 table 1 nevertheless the studies that reported the highest sediment loadings were influenced by mining disturbances watersheds that did not experience mining disturbances had average sediment loadings of 26 t km2 which was less than one third the measured yield for fourpole creek comparison of sediment yield results using the continuous monitoring and sediment rating curve approaches showed that both seasonal and annual rating curve methods underpredicted sediment loads table 2 fig 3 the annual power regression fit to the rising and falling limb datasets had strong r2 values of 0 852 and 0 805 respectively however the sediment rating curve estimated a suspended sediment yield of 16 9 t km 2 yr 1 for the 2019 calendar year which was only 20 of the yield predicted by the continuous data over predication occurred at lower base fluxes and the under prediction periods occurred during higher event fluxes fig 3c the annual sediment rating curve estimated every event yield significantly lower estimating anywhere from 4 6 to 30 of the modeled event yields table 2 seasonal rating curves were found to be more accurate than the annual curve but still severely underpredicted annual yields and generally had equivalent or improved r2 values as compared with the annual curve fig 3a b this method predicted 59 0 t km2 yr which was greater than three fold higher than yields predicted from the annual curves but still only about 71 of the continuously monitored estimates the seasonal rating curve approach improved prediction of low flow periods and peak concentrations although peak concentrations were still often underpredicted fig 3c regarding individual events several events in the winter and spring were well predicted by the rating curve nevertheless the results were highly variable and similar magnitude events would be well predicted during one event but poorly predicted in the next e g 5 12 19 and 5 17 19 hysteresis analysis results displayed a variety of hysteresis loop types and magnitudes throughout the monitoring period resulting in seasonality of hysteresis dynamics table 3 figs 4 and 5 the most frequent loop shape was the figure eight shape that occurred during nine of the events followed by five counterclockwise loops three single lines one single line with a clockwise loop and one clockwise loop the figure eight shape occurred during four out of the six summer events but was also seen periodically in the winter spring and fall months in the spring the counterclockwise and figure eight loops were equally prevalent the fall experienced three different hysteresis shapes a fig 8 a single line and a counterclockwise loop winter was the most diverse season in which all hysteresis classifications were observed except a line with loop hysteresis index was also observed to vary seasonally fig 5 a timeseries of the average event hysteresis indices shows that the hysteresis loops in the winter display weak positive patterns average hi 0 05 this suggests either single line hysteresis with fairly balanced contributions of clockwise and counterclockwise sources the loops in the summer transition to stronger negative patterns suggesting prominence of the counterclockwise source average hi 0 34 our result corroborates findings that have identified deficiencies in sediment rating curve approaches for estimating sediment yields and suggest that caution should be used in mixed use watersheds of this region where complex hysteresis patterns vary on an event to event basis lewis and eads 2009 investigated the performance of the sediment rating curve in a 689mi2 mountainous watershed that was predominately forested with some agricultural 21 and urban disturbances 0 2 in the south fork eel river daily suspended sediment concentrations when compared to estimates from 10 minute turbidity poorly represented the actual patterns and grossly underestimated the daily sediment loads lewis and eads 2009 rating curves usually result in poor estimates for three main reasons 1 suspended sediment concentration is often out of phase with discharge and leads to biases in load estimation 2 high discharge and sediment concentrations are inadequately represented and 3 rating curves cannot account for intermittent sediment delivery from erosion events or account for differences between rainfall and snowmelt runoff walling and webb 1981 lewis and eads 2009 while seasonal rating curves for fourpole creek improved sediment predictions variability in hysteretic patterns also existed within seasons resulting in poor predictions of sediment loadings cumulatively these finding suggest that other disturbed systems with complex temporally varied hysteresis patterns in the region may underpredict downstream sediment fluxes when using sediment rating curve methods the higher sediment fluxes for fourpole creek as compared to other appalachian watersheds may reflect methodological differences in sediment yield estimates or differences in disturbance and more monitoring efforts are needed in this region using high frequency sensors 3 2 sediment source contributions unmixing analysis results suggest high variability in source contributions between baseload stream network sources and wash load sources in the watershed table 3 fig 6 cumulatively results of our event analysis show that 53 of the sediment yield was associated with baseload ys1 and 47 was associated with wash load ys2 the base load source ys1 was highly variable between events accounting for between 11 and 100 of the suspended sediment yield all three single line hysteresis patterns 100 baseload were found in late fall and early winter suggesting other sources become exhausted or disconnected during this time of year regarding the washload source ys2 a and ys2 b contributed 22 and 26 of the total sediment yield respectively for the nineteen monitored events while the ys2 b source was generally found be the most prominent washload source during the majority of the monitoring period ys2 a was observed to be the prominent washload source during the saturated period of mid winter through mid spring comparison of sediment source unmixing results for the baseload source ys1 with reported loads from other appalachian watersheds suggest that urban landcover in the watershed likely exacerbates in channel and gully erosion for fourpole creek we found the ys1 source to comprise 53 of the total sediment yields from our 19 monitored storm events in channel erosion has been recognized as the major contributor to long term sediment yields in urban watersheds on average accounting for about two thirds of the annual sediment yield trimble 1997 rapid runoff from impervious areas imparts high shear stresses on the stream channel that result in erosion of bed and bank material megnounif et al 2013 further while gully erosion is most commonly documented in agricultural environments high erosion rates have also been observed in urban areas wolman 1967 gudino elizondo et al 2018 appalachian watersheds with urban disturbances williams and reed 1972 maryland department of the environment 2007 reported higher sediment yields than watersheds that were predominately undisturbed forests e g bolstad et al 2006 dun et al 2013 cumulatively these results suggest urban disturbances may significantly influence annual sediment budgets in mixed use watersheds typical of tributaries draining to regulated rivers of the western allegheny plateau ecoregion likewise our results suggest that the sensitivity of the analytical method to urban disturbance could enable quantification of the impact of watershed management practices e g low impact development on sediment load reductions in urban watersheds highlighting the utility of this approach for watershed managers our results suggest that the clockwise source ys2 a is likely associated with previously deposited sediments in the channel that are flushed at the onset of the event and the counterclockwise source ys2 b is likely associated with sediments eroded from macropores in the forested uplands of the watershed broadly the wash load ys2 represents the supply of new sediment sources that become available such as material from hillslopes bank caving and re suspension of fresh deposits megnounif et al 2013 the ys2 a yields were found to be a more prominent component of the sediment yield for events with higher antecedent moisture e g winter and spring as evidenced by the seasonality in the hysteresis index fig 5 while high antecedent moisture conditions have been shown to cause more upland connectivity forested uplands of the watershed were distal sources which typically produce counterclockwise hysteresis loops further counterclockwise hysteresis is often found to occur in urbanizing basins with high sediment availability since stormwater runoff dilutes suspended sediment on the rising limb and upland sediments arrive on the falling limb on the hydrograph e g gellis 2013 as a result we postulate that clockwise sources are associated with re suspension of fresh deposits within the fluvial network from previous events the counterclockwise loops and negative hi values from the second wash load source ys2 b often occurred in warm summer months low antecedent moisture conditions wymore et al 2019 recently found peak concentrations on receding limbs of the hydrograph in forested watersheds to be attributed to connectivity of macropore channels and subsurface sediment erosion to the fluvial network laboratory scale studies have shown that during warm dry conditions macropores develop thin easily erodible surface crusts along macropore walls that are eroded during subsequent storm events wilson et al 2018 these lines of evidence support macroporous subsurface erosion in forested areas as an important ambient sediment source to consider in watershed sediment budgets in the region timing of sediment source connectivity and flux in small tributary watersheds of regulated rivers may have important broader implications for hab development and thus may be important considerations in watershed management strategies the ys2 b source was the primary sediment source occurring in the dry summer prior to the hab that occurred on the ohio river in late september 2019 during storm events in the wet summer of 2018 the base load sources dominated the three monitored events however in the events of the dry summer of 2019 the wash load sources were the dominant sources for those events particularly ys2 b given the findings that suggests the source is derived from macropores of forested uplands this could be a prominent source of sediment supplied to the ohio river basin during the dry summer months in the western allegheny plateau this is significant given baseflow of the regulated river promotes favorable conditions to retain sediments and sediments have been recently recognized to influence habs through seeding the river with harmful cyanobacteria supplying nutrients for hab growth and providing a competitive advantage for hab proliferation by creating adverse conditions for green algae kitchens et al 2018 paerl and huisman 2008 walsby et al 1997 levy 2017 further investigations are needed to assess the prominence of this sediment source at broader spatial scales and to characterize biochemical compositions of this sediment source and it s potential role in hab formation and proliferation 3 3 sediment retention in backwater confluences source sink dynamics were highly variable for the nineteen monitored events with periods of net positive and net negative sediment retention table 4 fig 7 for sixteen events the confluence control volume was found to be a net sink of sediment positive sediment retention and three events showed that the control volume was a net source of sediment negative sediment retention the percentage of sediment retention during each event ranged from 29 to 94 with the highest percent in the winter events the three source events occurred in the spring and summer event 1 had the highest inputs at 741 785 kg being transported into the system however event 9 was the largest sink with 483 674 kg of sediment retained this is likely attributed to the extent of inundation from riverine backwaters given the maximum stage at the outlet was more than three fold greater during event 9 as compared to event 1 outlet stage correlated with volume of water stored in the floodplain jensen and ford 2019 and these conditions promote increased residence times decreasing flow velocities and thus increasing deposition the impacts of this can be visualized when comparing the turbidity measurements at the upstream and downstream monitoring station for each event fig 7 during event 1 the turbidity peaks at the upstream and downstream site are only about 45 min apart the sediment was routed quickly through the system allowing only about a 15 decrease in peak turbidity between the monitoring stations during event 9 the extreme backwater conditions greatly increased the residence time and the turbidity peaks at the upstream and downstream site are about 10 5 h apart the slower flow conditions enhanced depositional fluxes and decreased the peak turbidity between the monitoring stations by 47 the cumulative impact of floodplain inundation on sediment retention in the confluence floodplain wetland was observed using our continuous flux estimates over the 2019 calendar year fig 8 during periods of increasing depth an increase in sediment retention occurs and the magnitude or slope of the increase is often proportional to the magnitude of the outlet stage for the event these increases reflect either transient storage within the water column or depositional fluxes within the inundated floodplain as outlet stage recedes net retention becomes negative suggesting either erosion of the floodplain soils or sediments in the water column are transported downstream to the ohio river the average outlet stage throughout the winter was 2 5 m and during this period net retention increased by 1 446 23 tons of sediment cumulatively 61 of the annual net retention occurred during the first 3 months of the calendar year our results suggest confluence floodplains of tributary watersheds in appalachia promote high rates of retention through deposition in the regulated river backwaters and this retention is predominantly associated with tributary sediment inputs the continuous sediment yield results for 2019 showed that about 34 of total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained and that much of the retention was associated with storm event inputs from fourpole creek table 4 we estimate fourpole creek transported 5 007 1 tons of suspended sediment into the confluence control volume and the ohio river transported 1993 9 tons of suspended sediment into the confluence control volume over the 2019 calendar year at the outlet 4643 6 tons of suspended sediment was exported to the ohio river from fourpole creek a net retention of 2357 3 tons of sediment within the 0 78 km2 confluence floodplain was estimated and approximately 55 of this retention was estimated to occur during the fifteen events suggesting much of the retention was associated with fourpole creek sediment inputs our findings are supported by results from riverine floodplains in estuarine environments highlighting the importance of inundation and residence time to retain sediments from tributary inputs in general riparian wetlands located along low order streams are recognized to be important sites for sediment retention whigham et al 1988 for fourpole creek 34 of the total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained no studies to our knowledge have quantified sediment depositional fluxes in backwater confluence floodplains of regulated rivers but our results are supported by a study measuring sediment deposition in floodplain confluences in tributaries of the chesapeake bay noe and hupp 2009 in their study the floodplain retention was reported as the proportion of each river s annual load upstream of the floodplain sediment accumulation in the floodplains represented from 30 to 690 of the tributaries sediment loads for the fourpole creek confluence floodplain sediment retention cumulatively represented 47 of the tributary s sediment load noe and hupp found sediment retention was correlated with river sediment loads and floodplain inundation our results corroborate this finding given that 61 of the annual net retention occurred during the first 3 months of the year when the outlet stage caused extended periods of inundation and high residence times since floodplain deposition can only occur during infrequent high magnitude storm events event retention rates were also examined of the events in which the floodplain was a sink retention rates were found to range from 29 to as high as 94 the event retention was highest during periods of high inundation and on average 61 of sediment during the winter event inputs were retained in the floodplain these results show that backwater confluence floodplains have a quantitatively large role in intercepting and storing sediment inputs from upstream tributaries therefore efforts to limit downstream sediment loads should ensure the function of floodplains is maintained or enhanced particularly in periods where retention is low e g summer events where floodplain connectivity was minimal that often coincide with presence of toxic habs 4 conclusions the major findings of this work are as follows the measured sediment yields from the small watershed in the western allegheny plateau were found to fall within loads reported in watersheds from other regions of appalachia although on the high side of loadings for systems without mining which may be attributed to the urban disturbances in the watershed or the methodology used to quantify yields sediment rating curves underpredicted sediment fluxes which was attributed to results of our hysteresis analysis that showed seasonal and within season variability of sediment source contributions and source activation in the mixed use watershed results of the source unmixing analysis suggest in channel erosion recently deposited sediments and erosion of subsurface macropores in the forested uplands are likely significant sources of sediment in the mixed use watershed and have high temporal variability that should be considered in watershed management strategies confluence floodplains were found to have a quantitatively large role in intercepting and storing sediment inputs in our system 34 of the total inputs into the confluence floodplain were retained annually and event sediment retention of the watershed inputs was found to be as high as 94 despite the wetland comprising only 0 78 km2 of the watershed drainage area these results demonstrate the ability confluence floodplains have to buffer sediment fluxes from small tributaries to regulated rivers while our work provides new insights into sediment fate and transport dynamics in backwater confluence tributaries further work is needed to build upon the results of this study in particular replication of high frequency sediment monitoring in different watersheds is needed within this important ecoregion which strongly influences water quality in the ohio river the magnitude of sediment retention in backwater confluences suggests there may also be significant implications for carbon and nutrient budgets when integrated along the extent of river basin the fate of these nutrients is an important area of future work given the perirheic mixing zone that develops within these confluences are recognized biogeochemical hotspots jones et al 2014 jensen and ford 2019 credit

as northern ecosystems change there is increasing pressure on water managers first nations and other stakeholders to understand and adapt to future water resources as river regimes shift from declines in the cryosphere and changes in weather and climate ipcc 2019 the additional pressures of transitioning ecosystems must be assessed as et strongly influences water partitioning in relatively dry northern ecosystems however predicting et over large scales is challenging particularly in cold alpine environments where observations are sparse and landscapes are heterogeneous bring et al 2016 to address this and to evaluate the potential impacts of shifting ecosystem types we ask the question how does energy partitioning and et dynamics vary across an ecological functional gradient within a heterogeneous subarctic alpine watershed using six years of observations from three subarctic ecosites across a thermal gradient specifically a 1 white spruce forest 2 tall dense shrub and 3 short sparse shrub sites we compare seasonal and inter annual surface energy partitioning and et dynamics subsequently we highlight the role of shifting vegetation on the water and energy balance and discuss hydrological implications of ecosystem change for northern alpine catchments 2 methods 2 1 study sites wolf creek research basin wcrb is located in yukon territory canada 60 5 n 135 2 w 15 km

leaf area index lai was measured by integral ecology group using a lai 2200c licor and adjusted for clumping of needles and leaves according to species within the measurement growing season lai at

each site analysis presented here includes flux data year round from 2017 to 2020 at forest and april to october from 2015 to 2020 at buckbrush and sparse shrub each tower was instrumented with a 3 axis sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer irga a closed path licor 7200rs was installed at forest and an open path licor 7500a at the two shrub sites buckbrush and sparse shrub all signals were

net radiometer kipp zonen ground heat flux was directly measured using heat flux plates hukseflux at 2 and 5 cm at all sites rainfall was measured at forest and buckbrush using te525m texas tipping buckets above the canopy rainfall measured at buckbrush was assumed to be representative of sparse shrub due to their proximity 2 6 km soil temperature and moisture were measured at multiple depths 5 15 30 and 80 cm at forest and buckbrush and 5 15 and 30 cm at sparse shrub using hydraprobes stevens at all sites from 2015 onwards with teros21 soil water potential sensors meter installed to the same depths in june 2019 at all sites 2 3 data processing gap filling and energy balance closure open path irga gas concentration density fluctuations were compensated using the webb pearman and

using net radiation vapour pressure deficit vpd wind speed downward shortwave radiation and air temperature mean coefficients of determination for the gap filled λve data were 0 82 at forest 0 76 at buckbrush and 0 76 at sparse shrub table s2 remaining gaps in data were filled using the mean diurnal variation method falge et al 2001 replacing missing values with the mean for that time over the previous and subsequent 7 day period missing data from may to september for each tower are summarized in table s2 with mean values of 35 30 and 41 missing at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub

climate results are confined from may to september for inter comparison purposes and direct comparisons will be made from 2017 to 2020 when all sites were operational unless otherwise stated average air temperature at the study sites decreased with increasing elevation with mean may to september air temperatures of 11 1 8 2 and 7 2 c at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 2 table 2 the coolest year was 2020 when air temperatures were 0 8 1 0 and 0 8 c lower than the mean at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively the warmest year was 2019 when air temperatures 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 c above the mean table 2 at all sites mean monthly air temperature peaked in july fig 2 total days per year with average air temperature above 0 c decreased with elevation forest averaged 222 days 3 while buckbrush and sparse shrub averaged 173 12 and 168 10 days may to september precipitation 2017 2020 averaged 166 33 mm at the forest compared to 209 47 mm at the higher elevation sites this compares to the 30 year climate normal 1981 2010 of 156 mm recorded 14 km north of the forest site at the whitehorse airport environment canada 2021 at all sites 2020 was the wettest with may to september rainfall totals of 228 mm at forest and 325 mm rainfall at the shrub sites the driest year was 2018 with 132 and 182 mm received at the forest and shrub sites respectively over the same period growing season length was defined as the number of days where net ecosystem co2 exchange nee was 0 g c m2 over a 24 hour period between 2017 and 2020 mean growing season length was 175 15 days at forest 139 18 days at buckbrush and 107 15 days at sparse shrub the shortest growing season was 2020 with 154 127 and 89 days at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture patterns were consistent among years and sites with volumetric water content vwc greatest immediately after snowmelt followed by a gradual decline and intermittent responses to rain events throughout the year fig 3 fig 3 presents vwc and soil tension at each site in 2019 and 2020 which were years with differing precipitation regimes soil moisture was higher in 2020 than 2019 at all sites due to large growing season rainfall totals there was a considerable difference in vwc between the forest and shrub sites soils were consistently drier throughout the year at forest and had muted responses to melt and rainfall while soil moisture at buckbrush and sparse shrub were similar and maintained wet conditions throughout the year soil matric potential sensors indicated that despite fluctuation in vwc with rainfall soil tensions at all depths at buckbrush and sparse shrub never fell below 25 kpa despite periods without rain in 2019 in contrast forest soil tension was much lower with near surface tensions falling below 30 kpa and 15 cm suctions below 90 kpa in 2019 soil tension at 30 cm fell below 2500 kpa later in the summer far below the average wilting point for plants 1500 kpa at forest in 2020 the soil tension was similar among depths and higher than 2019 with the minimum soil tension falling to only 45 kpa at 30 cm 3 3 surface energy dynamics 3 3 1 albedo the partitioning of available energy varied within and among years albedo was calculated using half hour incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation between 11 00 14 00 during the middle growing season june to august albedo was similar among sites although values increased with increasing elevation and decreasing vegetation height with mean albedo of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 at the forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 4 at forest albedo was less variable than the shrub sites ranging from 0 08 in july to a maximum of 0 21 in december in contrast intra and inter annual variability was large at the shrub sites where peak mean daytime albedo during the snow covered months was 0 50 at buckbrush and 0 82 at sparse shrub although the dominant species cover at buckbrush and sparse shrub were similar birch and willow shrubs were on average 0 42 and 0 79 m taller at buckbrush than sparse shrub in concurrent years of mid february to mid april snow survey data 2018 2020 average snow depth at buckbrush was 62 cm compared with 37 cm at sparse shrub this equates to on average birch and willow protruding by 21 and 62 cm at buckbrush and 3 and 17 cm at plateau respectively in late winter this increased net radiation rn during snowmelt and the initial snow covered period in the fall fig 4 3 3 2 energy partitioning the partitioning of energy among the study years showed marked yet consistent variability among sites fig 4 on average rn peaked in june at forest and may at both shrub sites although there were subtle differences among sites particularly the shrubs where maximum rn could occur in later summer months this timing is primarily due to incoming shortwave radiation which was slightly higher in may 19 7 21 5 21 2 mj m 2 d 1 than june 19 6 20 1 20 3 mj m 2 d 1 at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively due to atmospheric conditions net radiation was higher at the shrub sites than forest early in may because of higher longwave outgoing radiation from forest which had warmer surface temperatures for example mean net longwave radiation in may was 5 8 mj m 2 d 1 at forest compared to 4 6 mj m 2 d 1 at buckbrush and 3 8 mj m 2 d 1 sparse shrub all sites had higher h early in the season and then shifted to λve dominated as the season progressed fig 4 the transition from h to λve occurred later in the year with increasing elevation on average occurring on may 31 june 14 and june 29 at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively from may to september mean λve rn at forest was 0 47 0 01 while λve rn was similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub with λve rn of 0 31 0 02 and 0 04 respectively table 2 generally variability in all interannual energy balance terms increased with elevation and reduced vegetation table 2 fig 4 the enhanced variability in energy partitioning both annual and monthly at the sparse shrub was highlighted in the dry growing season of 2018 when may to september λve rn dropped to 0 27 while λve rn at buckbrush was 0 32 partitioning of rn to h was similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub with h rn of 0 42 0 04 and 0 43 0 04 respectively while at forest h rn was 0 45 0 01 ground heat flux g was largest at sparse shrub and smallest at forest although g was low at all sites when averaged from may to september with g rn of 0 02 at forest and buckbrush and 0 07 at sparse shrub at forest and sparse shrub the highest monthly g occurred in may while at buckbrush the peak occurred in june 3 4 et dynamics annual growing season et declined with increasing elevation while interannual variability increased mean may to september et totals were 349 3 mm 249 10 mm and 240 26 mm at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 5 table 2 at forest cumulative et was consistent among the four years of study regardless of growing season rainfall the sparse shrub site had the greatest year to year variability compared to buckbrush where cumulative et was relatively more consistent fig 5 from 2015 to 2020 at the shrub sites total growing season et was highest in the 2016 with cumulative et higher at sparse shrub 285 mm than buckbrush 261 mm this year had slightly higher mean may to september air temperature and rainfall table 2 conversely in the driest year 2018 where the shrub sites only received 182 mm of rainfall we observed the lowest amount of et at the sparse shrub 192 mm while et at buckbrush was close to the interannual mean of 236 mm although 2020 was very wet receiving 62 mm and 97 mm more rainfall than average from may to september cumulative et losses at all sites were close to the mean over the study years ratios of may to september et to rainfall et r table 2 were the highest and most variable at forest with mean et r of 2 19 0 37 compared to 1 22 0 09 and 1 14 0 05 at buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively the decrease in variability with increasing vegetation cover is also apparent seasonally the overall pattern of et was more dynamic on a seasonal basis at the shrub sites reflecting plant growth and senescence with notable declines in et rates between august and september figs 5 6 comparatively daily et at forest was more consistent between months increasing in spring with a gradual decline in september daily et peaked in july at all sites with 2017 2020 mean july et rates of 3 05 0 17 2 48 0 09 and 2 13 0 31 mm day fig 6 the largest difference between mean monthly et rates between forest and the two shrub sites occurred in june forest rates 1 0 mm day greater than buckbrush and 0 9 mm day greater than sparse shrub while the largest difference between buckbrush and sparse shrub occurred in july during the peak growing season buckbrush et rates greater by 0 35 mm day in all other months while sampling error was low table s3 mean et rates at the shrub sites were similar with differences 0 17 mm day moving 14 day mean daily et rates fig 6 show larger variability at the sparse shrub site than buckbrush or forest particularly early in the season variability in et rates among years was lowest in the late growing season at all sites early august 4 discussion 4 1 influence of changing vegetation cover on energy partitioning small decreases in albedo will have a considerable positive impact on atmospheric temperatures even with modest shifts in the landscape bonfils et al 2012 chapin et al 2005 in all seasons albedo at the forest was lower than the buckbrush and sparse shrub sites and the difference between winter and summer was low fig 4 a characteristic of boreal forests betts and ball 1997 mean mid day snow free albedo of buckbrush 0 12 was slightly lower than sparse shrub 0 15 which was similar to shrub and shrub taiga sites reported at a number of northern sites beringer et al 2005 eugster et al 2000 lafleur and humphreys 2018 williamson et al 2016 unlike williamson et al 2016 who suggested an increase in albedo along a successional gradient in yukon territory we observed a more widely reported decline in albedo with increased abundance and height of shrubs during the snow free season important feedbacks from future vegetation shifts on energy partitioning occur during winter and the melt accumulation season bonfils et al 2012 the influence of shrub height and emergence during melt on snow accumulation albedo and the energy balance has been well documented in northern environments and wcrb bewley et al 2010 marsh et al 2010 ménard 2014 pomeroy et al 2006 when considering early season surface energy balances in varying shrub cover the abundance of exposed branches controls albedo which is dependent on the amount of snow wind redistribution the plasticity of woody stems and importantly shrub height sturm et al 2005 for low stature shrubs 0 6 m lafleur and humphreys 2018 found no difference in late winter spring albedo here however differences in peak winter albedo between shrub sites were large 0 5 at buckbrush and 0 82 at sparse shrub similar to the results of sturm et al 2005 who reported mid winter albedo of 0 85 for snow covered shrubs and 0 6 when exposed while the interplay between snow burial and shrub height varies regionally across the pan arctic in all cases shifts in vegetation that act to increase shrub height and abundance will lower albedo as well the encroachment of forests with global radiative impacts considering the current rate of ecosystem change the influence of vegetation on energy partitioning of turbulent fluxes has highlighted differences between shrub and forest species across a range of environments eaton and rouse 2001 eugster et al 2000 kasurinen et al 2014 with respect to shrubs extent and wetness play a significant role whereas for forests the role of lai meteorological conditions and physiological regulation by vegetation and the distinction between conifer and deciduous species has been highlighted brümmer et al 2012 kasurinen et al 2014 while synthesis studies provide important information on partitioning controls generalizations occur due to the large variability in climate across northern biomes there have been few studies comparing vegetation assemblages in the same hydroclimatological regime over several years with the most similar study being beringer et al 2005 who compared surface energy partitioning over a single growing season at nearby sites in alaska among tundra shrubs and boreal forests they reported that the greatest increases in h were between tall shrubs and forest but not between tundra and tall shrubs which is similar to our sites in that there was less difference in the magnitude and timing of energy partitioning among the shrub and forest sites while mean h was greater at the forest the relative partitioning of turbulent energy favoured λve in all years table 2 this contrasts with beringer et al 2005 who report higher partitioning of available energy to h with a bowen ratio β of 1 22 from june to august at their white spruce site in one year compared to our average of 0 95 over four years the lower β we report may in part be explained by a greater lai 3 22 vs 2 76 and the lowland position of the forest in the landscape at forest there was a gradual decline and stabilization in β throughout the growing season where in contrast β at the shrub sites was much more variable on an annual basis and controlled by vegetation phenology fig s1 with higher β occurring in the shoulder season when vegetation was not transpiring whereas there is equivocal evidence as to how height and abundance affects λve and total water loss lafleur and humphreys 2018 our results suggest shrubification will likely result in an increased β early in the year and lower β in mid growing season however the change in net radiation seasonality of vegetation growth nature of precipitation delivery and physiological response will all control total evaporative losses despite shifts in ratios of turbulent fluxes the hydrological implications for this discussed below are that transitions in vegetation cover in wcrb will likely enhance water loss through an increase in et 4 2 hydrological implications of vegetation change while research indicates that increased terrestrial productivity in northern environments will increase et bring et al 2016 rawlins et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 there is limited empirical data as to how treeline advance and shrub height and abundance affect ecosystem et and other components of the hydrological cycle our results are similar to those that showed negligible differences in et among shrubs of different heights lafleur and humphreys 2018 mcfadden et al 2003 however while seasonal et totals were similar there were distinct processes operating that distinguished the two shrub sites diurnal monthly traces of et and nee fig 7 suggest that during july increased et at buckbrush is driven by enhanced transpiration as reflected by the greater nee compared with sparse shrub which has more modest mid season nee however during may when photosynthesis transpiration was low the sparse shrub site has greater et most likely driven by enhanced direct soil evaporation as there is much more exposed bare ground these offsetting processes result in annual et totals being similar yet the reduced influence of vegetation at the sparse shrub site increases et variability during wet years et is similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub yet during dry years such as 2018 et at sparse shrub is notably lower while shrubs can effectively utilize available soil moisture sustaining high rates at buckbrush where vegetation coverage is dense bare ground evaporation at sparse shrub becomes suppressed during dry periods lowering overall et of note the length of growing season did not influence total et between the two shrub sites fig 3 again supporting the role of bare ground evaporation at the sparse shrub site although warmer temperatures and a longer growing season partly explain greater total et at forest than the shrub sites fig 7 physiological and ecosystem processes help explain enhanced water loss and low et variability both forest and buckbrush have relatively low variability in et rates among years particularly later in the growing season july august relative to the sparse shrub site fig 6 highlighting a mediating effect of vegetation during the prime growing season monthly diurnal traces of et and nee from the three sites indicate that as soon as soils thaw in may transpiration photosynthesis begins at forest whereas at the shrub sites et and nee in may are small before bud burst in late may or early june fig 7 similar timing of senescence between both shrub sites is apparent in lower et rates and declines in carbon uptake while differing water use efficiencies and respiration rates influence nee and are an area for future study we suggest that high mid summer et rates and relatively low carbon uptake at forest is in part explained by direct canopy evaporation of intercepted water and enhanced understory evaporation which can be considerable in northern boreal forests baldocchi et al 2000 blanken et al 2001 ikawa et al 2015 kelliher et al 1997 the seasonal differences in et and nee among these sites demonstrate that although increased vegetation cover will likely increase et both physiologically through increased transpiration and structurally through increased interception and canopy storage the timing and magnitude of these roles will differ across ecosystem types in subarctic alpine ecosystems the role of vegetation in making et a conservative process has been outlined in theoretical jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 and field studies oishi et al 2010 phillips and oren 2001 roberts 1983 therefore we assert that treeline advance and shrub proliferation will result in more stable higher et rates that are less responsive to inter annual variation in precipitation compared to areas with shorter less dense shrub cover however the total increase in et from shrub infilling will be muted and increase primarily in the mid growing season the nature of evaporative fluxes coupled with the timing magnitude and phase of precipitation delivery has important implications for watershed scale hydrological processes a critical implication of the higher et at forest is the increased et r 2 19 and considerable water deficit from may to september fig 5 suggesting the site is heavily reliant on snowmelt recharge late season rains and potential deeper soil water to sustain these rates as the forest is in a lowland adjacent to the river corridor there is the potential for supplemental lateral water sources from the riparian zone which may in part sustain et during dry periods in contrast the shrub sites evaporate at rates just greater than summer rainfall et r 1 20 and 1 14 at buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively in a synthesis of northern watersheds tetzlaff et al 2013 suggest that with climate change catchments will move towards increasing aridity as et increases at a rate greater than precipitation however in this region total precipitation is expected to increase with enhanced rainfall contributions tetzlaff et al 2013 ipcc 2019 climate and vegetation change modelling by rasouli et al 2019b in wcrb suggest that at higher elevations increased in snow trapping due to higher stature shrubs will likely offset the decrease in snow water equivalent due to climate change this compensation does not however apply to boreal forest covers at low elevations considering the large growing season water deficit and drier soils decreases in snow input early in the season or more periods of extreme weather and potentially drought could push the forest into a situation of moisture stress the growth of white spruce forests in areas of low precipitation and rapid warming is known to be limited due to water deficits and future climate change may cause higher tree mortality in these populations in high latitudes of north america hynes and hamann 2020 we found the primary hydrological difference between shrub sites was during the mid growing season fig 7 although on an annual timescale over six years there does not appear to be a large difference in et when shrubs increase in height and density this may change as warming alters the timing of snowmelt and growing season length resulting in a longer mid season difference between shrub covers of varying height the greater influence is the enhanced snow trapping associated with shrub growth pomeroy et al 2006 rasouli et al 2019b which will enhance recharge and runoff generation particularly during freshet 4 3 considerations for predicting future hydrologic regimes in northern regions despite accelerating research in the north and a new dominance of remote sensing and model based outcomes at the expense of empirical data there remains a nascent understanding of how integrated environmental changes will alter the storage and cycling of water in cold regions while hydrological changes are most often ascribed to warmer air temperatures and changes in frozen ground status at larger scales walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the influence of changing vegetation communities on hydrological storage and flux remains uncertain as there have been few studies showing only modest influences there has been considerable research documenting rapid vegetation change particularly the advance of tree dominated communities into tundra ecosystems danby and hik 2007 conway and danby 2014 harsch et al 2009 lloyd and fastie 2003 and the proliferation of tall shrubs into low tundra myers smith and hik 2017 tape et al 2006 tremblay et al 2012 feedbacks from shrub expansion include enhanced snow trapping warming soils and enhanced nutrient availability all of which enhance further shrub growth and potential for tree establishment myers smith et al 2011 sturm et al 2001 the timescales of these changes must be considered however in future hydrological projections as treeline advance and infilling is slow danby and hik 2007 compared with rapid increases in shrub extent density and height myers smith et al 2011 tape et al 2006 these changes are also highly dependent on permafrost thaw and disturbances such as fire which are expected to continue increasing in rate in coming decades lantz et al 2010a this will to varying degrees start new successional shifts depending on the severity and may result in more deciduous forest rather than boreal conifer species to our knowledge there has been no documentation of surface energy and evaporative fluxes across a northern alpine watershed over multiple years from an et perspective increased forest abundance and shrub proliferation will lead to changing soil moisture regimes and runoff timing and volume specifically increases in et will reduce runoff generation particularly in the growing season for wcrb most of the streamflow is generated in the alpine and subalpine zone and upward expansions of trees would reduce total catchment yield while increase shrubs may trap more snow and provide more water during freshet mid season flows are expected to become less variable and decline with increasing shrub abundance perhaps the greatest challenge in understanding the role of vegetation change on catchment hydrology is the role of precipitation changes from snow to rain enhanced periods of drought or intense precipitation all of which are predicted for pan arctic ecosystems ipcc 2019 will have profound effects on runoff regimes while et is a large flux increased vegetation will likely reduce its variability emphasizing the role of future precipitation uncertainty in watershed scale hydrological processes the role of interception on total et is an area for additional research to evaluate the relative impact of plant structure and physiology while zweibeck 2019 suggested that shrub interception reduced below canopy rainfall by 15 30 for shrub species the role of rainfall interception has not been directly evaluated in this environment the high lai and et rates with modest nee suggests that rainfall interception at the forest is considerable however we have a much greater understanding on how vegetation influences snow processes than rainfall processes in cold environments and is a topic for future consideration 5 conclusion the impact of vegetation change on energy and water cycling in the pan arctic is an area of intense research with literature syntheses bring et al 2016 wrona et al 2016 numerical model outputs rawlins et al 2010 and remote sensing zhang et al 2009 suggesting et will increase from increased air temperature vpd precipitation a longer growing season and an expansion of shrubs and trees there remains however few field based studies that directly evaluate these processes in northern ecosystems in this multi year study we highlight differences and similarities in the timing and magnitude of energy and mass fluxes among boreal forest and shrub taiga ecosystems in an alpine environment where elevation controls temperature and moisture regimes results indicate that the greatest change in water and energy fluxes will occur from changes in treeline compared with shrubification across all seasons as they have distinct regimes et was greatest at the forest site compared with the shrub sites and varied little over 4 years despite differences in meteorology and a considerable growing season water deficit in contrast et was considerably less at the cooler higher elevation shrub sites which exhibited similar et losses over 6 years despite differences in shrub height and abundance while the observation of limited differences in et has been reported before for a single year our results indicate that et variance is much greater at the short sparse shrub site compared with the tall dense shrub site due the reduced influence of vegetation controls on total et while there are multiple interacting processes our results support the assertion that a greening north will have lower albedos and higher et losses how this affects catchment response will be strongly influenced by precipitation timing phase and magnitude growing season length and vegetation snow and rain interactions 6 data availability data is available from https doi org 10 20383 102 0474 database frdr or a request to the primary

4248,as a result of altitude and latitude amplified climate change widespread changes in vegetation composition density and distribution have been observed across northern regions despite wide documentation of shrub proliferation and treeline advance few field based studies have evaluated the hydrological implications of these changes quantification of total evapotranspiration et across a range of vegetation gradients is essential for predicting water yield yet challenging in cold alpine catchments due to heterogeneous land cover including both boreal forest and shrub taiga ecosystems here we present six years of surface energy balance components and et dynamics at three sites along an elevational gradient in a subarctic alpine catchment near whitehorse yukon territory canada these sites span a gradient of thermal and vegetation regimes providing a space for time comparison for future ecosystem shifts 1 a low elevation boreal white spruce forest 12 20 m 2 a mid elevation subalpine taiga comprised of tall dense willow salix and birch betula shrubs 1 3 m and 3 a high elevation subalpine taiga with short sparse shrub cover 0 75 m and moss lichen and bare rock eddy covariance instrumentation ran year round at the forest and during the growing season at the two shrub sites total et decreased and interannual variability increased with elevation with mean may to september et totals of 349 3 mm at the forest 249 10 mm at the tall dense shrub site and 240 26 mm at the short sparse shrub site comparatively over the same period et r ratios were the highest and most variable at the forest 2 19 0 37 and similar at the tall dense shrub 1 22 0 09 and short sparse shrub 1 14 0 05 sites our results suggest that advances in treeline will increase overall et and lower interannual variability however the large growing season water deficit at the forest indicates strong reliance on soil moisture from late fall and snowmelt recharge in contrast et was considerably less at the cooler higher elevation shrub sites which exhibited similar et losses over 6 years despite differences in shrub height and abundance et rates between the two shrub sites were similar throughout the year except during the peak growing season greater interannual variability in et at the short sparse shrub site indicates the reduced influence of vegetation controls on et results suggest that predicted changes in vegetation type and structure in northern regions will have a considerable impact on water partitioning and will vary in a complex way in response to changing

myers smith et al 2020 changes in vegetation type and structure result in complex soil plant atmosphere feedbacks that alter how catchments collect store and release water which directly impacts the global climate cycle through the albedo feedback and energy partitioning bonan 2008 chapin et al 2005 lafleur and humphreys 2018 sturm et al 2005 for example snow and rainfall accumulation and interception are strongly dependent upon vegetation type height and density pomeroy et al 2006 sturm et al 2001 zwieback et al 2019 leaf area controls rain and snow interception in northern boreal forests hedstrom and pomeroy 1998 whereas increases in shrub height enhances snow trapping pomeroy et al 2006 shrubs can also play a substantial role in rainfall interception although this process is dependent on plant height and density for example zwieback et al 2019 found a 15 30 reduction in effective rainfall under birch shrubs but reduced interception under alder vegetation influences the surface energy balance affecting the rate and timing of snowmelt and evapotranspiration et brümmer et al 2012 kasurinen et al 2014 lafleur and humphreys 2018 tall shrubs accelerate melt through the

processes are complicated by dynamic and changing vegetation covers both through greening of northern ecosystems from climate change and increasing risk of fire lantz et al 2010 while the literature on surface atmosphere interactions has grown in recent decades current understanding of these hydrological interactions along a vegetation gradient poorly represents alpine environments and has primarily focused on surface energy partitioning i e beringer et al 2005 therefore the net impact of alpine shrub proliferation and treeline advance on the critical zone water balance remains unclear as northern ecosystems change there is increasing pressure on water managers first nations and other stakeholders to understand and adapt to future water resources as river regimes shift from declines in the cryosphere and changes in weather and climate ipcc 2019 the additional pressures of transitioning ecosystems must be assessed as et strongly influences water partitioning in relatively dry northern ecosystems however predicting et over large scales is challenging particularly in cold alpine environments where observations are sparse and landscapes are heterogeneous bring et al 2016 to address this and to evaluate the potential impacts of shifting ecosystem types we ask the question how does energy partitioning and et dynamics vary across an ecological functional gradient within a heterogeneous subarctic alpine watershed using six years of observations from three subarctic ecosites across a thermal gradient specifically a 1 white spruce forest 2 tall dense shrub and 3 short sparse shrub sites we compare seasonal and inter annual surface energy partitioning and et dynamics subsequently we highlight the role of shifting vegetation on the water and energy balance and discuss hydrological implications of ecosystem change for northern alpine catchments 2 methods 2 1 study sites wolf creek research basin wcrb is located in yukon territory canada 60 5 n 135 2 w 15 km

leaf area index lai was measured by integral ecology group using a lai 2200c licor and adjusted for clumping of needles and leaves according to species within the measurement growing season lai at

each site analysis presented here includes flux data year round from 2017 to 2020 at forest and april to october from 2015 to 2020 at buckbrush and sparse shrub each tower was instrumented with a 3 axis sonic anemometer and infrared gas analyzer irga a closed path licor 7200rs was installed at forest and an open path licor 7500a at the two shrub sites buckbrush and sparse shrub all signals were

net radiometer kipp zonen ground heat flux was directly measured using heat flux plates hukseflux at 2 and 5 cm at all sites rainfall was measured at forest and buckbrush using te525m texas tipping buckets above the canopy rainfall measured at buckbrush was assumed to be representative of sparse shrub due to their proximity 2 6 km soil temperature and moisture were measured at multiple depths 5 15 30 and 80 cm at forest and buckbrush and 5 15 and 30 cm at sparse shrub using hydraprobes stevens at all sites from 2015 onwards with teros21 soil water potential sensors meter installed to the

using net radiation vapour pressure deficit vpd wind speed downward shortwave radiation and air temperature mean coefficients of determination for the gap filled λve data were 0 82 at forest 0 76 at buckbrush and 0 76 at sparse shrub table s2 remaining gaps in data were filled using the mean diurnal variation method falge et al 2001 replacing missing values with the mean for that time over the previous and subsequent 7 day period missing data from may to september for each tower are summarized in table s2 with mean values of 35 30 and 41 missing at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub

climate results are confined from may to september for inter comparison purposes and direct comparisons will be made from 2017 to 2020 when all sites were operational unless otherwise stated average air temperature at the study sites decreased with increasing elevation with mean may to september air temperatures of 11 1 8 2 and 7 2 c at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 2 table 2 the coolest year was 2020 when air temperatures were 0 8 1 0 and 0 8 c lower than the mean at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively the warmest year was 2019 when air temperatures 0 9 1 0 and 1 2 c above the mean table 2 at all sites mean monthly air temperature peaked in july fig 2 total days per year with average air temperature above 0 c decreased with elevation forest averaged 222 days 3 while buckbrush and sparse shrub averaged 173 12 and 168 10 days may to september precipitation 2017 2020 averaged 166 33 mm at the forest compared to 209 47 mm at the higher elevation sites this compares to the 30 year climate normal 1981 2010 of 156 mm recorded 14 km north of the forest site at the whitehorse airport environment canada 2021 at all sites 2020 was the wettest with may to september rainfall totals of 228 mm at forest and 325 mm rainfall at the shrub sites the driest year was 2018 with 132 and 182 mm received at the forest and shrub sites respectively over the same period growing season length was defined as the number of days where net ecosystem co2 exchange nee was 0 g c m2 over a 24 hour period between 2017 and 2020 mean growing season length was 175 15 days at forest 139 18 days at buckbrush and 107 15 days at sparse shrub the shortest growing season was 2020 with 154 127 and 89 days at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively 3 2 soil moisture soil moisture patterns were consistent among years and sites with volumetric water content vwc greatest immediately after snowmelt followed by a gradual decline and intermittent responses to rain events throughout the year fig 3 fig 3 presents vwc and soil tension at each site in 2019 and 2020 which were years with differing precipitation regimes soil moisture was higher in 2020 than 2019 at all sites due to large growing season rainfall totals there was a considerable difference in vwc between the forest and shrub sites soils were consistently drier throughout the year at forest and had muted responses to melt and rainfall while soil moisture at buckbrush and sparse shrub were similar and maintained wet conditions throughout the year soil matric potential sensors indicated that despite fluctuation in vwc with rainfall soil tensions at all depths at buckbrush and sparse shrub never fell below 25 kpa despite periods without rain in 2019 in contrast forest soil tension was much lower with near surface tensions falling below 30 kpa and 15 cm suctions below 90 kpa in 2019 soil tension at 30 cm fell below 2500 kpa later in the summer far below the average wilting point for plants 1500 kpa at forest in 2020 the soil tension was similar among depths and higher than 2019 with the minimum soil tension falling to only 45 kpa at 30 cm 3 3 surface energy dynamics 3 3 1 albedo the partitioning of available energy varied within and among years albedo was calculated using half hour incoming and outgoing shortwave radiation between 11 00 14 00 during the middle growing season june to august albedo was similar among sites although values increased with increasing elevation and decreasing vegetation height with mean albedo of 0 09 0 12 and 0 15 at the forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 4 at forest albedo was less variable than the shrub sites ranging from 0 08 in july to a maximum of 0 21 in december in contrast intra and inter annual variability was large at the shrub sites where peak mean daytime albedo during the snow covered months was 0 50 at buckbrush and 0 82 at sparse shrub although the dominant species cover at buckbrush and sparse shrub were similar birch and willow shrubs were on average 0 42 and 0 79 m taller at buckbrush than sparse shrub in concurrent years of mid february to mid april snow survey data 2018 2020 average snow depth at buckbrush was 62 cm compared with 37 cm at sparse shrub this equates to on average birch and willow protruding by 21 and 62 cm at buckbrush and 3 and 17 cm at plateau respectively in late winter this increased net radiation rn during snowmelt and the initial snow covered period in the fall fig 4 3 3 2 energy partitioning the partitioning of energy among the study years showed marked yet consistent variability among sites fig 4 on average rn peaked in june at forest and may at both shrub sites although there were subtle differences among sites particularly the shrubs where maximum rn could occur in later summer months this timing is primarily due to incoming shortwave radiation which was slightly higher in may 19 7 21 5 21 2 mj m 2 d 1 than june 19 6 20 1 20 3 mj m 2 d 1 at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively due to atmospheric conditions net radiation was higher at the shrub sites than forest early in may because of higher longwave outgoing radiation from forest which had warmer surface temperatures for example mean net longwave radiation in may was 5 8 mj m 2 d 1 at forest compared to 4 6 mj m 2 d 1 at buckbrush and 3 8 mj m 2 d 1 sparse shrub all sites had higher h early in the season and then shifted to λve dominated as the season progressed fig 4 the transition from h to λve occurred later in the year with increasing elevation on average occurring on may 31 june 14 and june 29 at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively from may to september mean λve rn at forest was 0 47 0 01 while λve rn was similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub with λve rn of 0 31 0 02 and 0 04 respectively table 2 generally variability in all interannual energy balance terms increased with elevation and reduced vegetation table 2 fig 4 the enhanced variability in energy partitioning both annual and monthly at the sparse shrub was highlighted in the dry growing season of 2018 when may to september λve rn dropped to 0 27 while λve rn at buckbrush was 0 32 partitioning of rn to h was similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub with h rn of 0 42 0 04 and 0 43 0 04 respectively while at forest h rn was 0 45 0 01 ground heat flux g was largest at sparse shrub and smallest at forest although g was low at all sites when averaged from may to september with g rn of 0 02 at forest and buckbrush and 0 07 at sparse shrub at forest and sparse shrub the highest monthly g occurred in may while at buckbrush the peak occurred in june 3 4 et dynamics annual growing season et declined with increasing elevation while interannual variability increased mean may to september et totals were 349 3 mm 249 10 mm and 240 26 mm at forest buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively fig 5 table 2 at forest cumulative et was consistent among the four years of study regardless of growing season rainfall the sparse shrub site had the greatest year to year variability compared to buckbrush where cumulative et was relatively more consistent fig 5 from 2015 to 2020 at the shrub sites total growing season et was highest in the 2016 with cumulative et higher at sparse shrub 285 mm than buckbrush 261 mm this year had slightly higher mean may to september air temperature and rainfall table 2 conversely in the driest year 2018 where the shrub sites only received 182 mm of rainfall we observed the lowest amount of et at the sparse shrub 192 mm while et at buckbrush was close to the interannual mean of 236 mm although 2020 was very wet receiving 62 mm and 97 mm more rainfall than average from may to september cumulative et losses at all sites were close to the mean over the study years ratios of may to september et to rainfall et r table 2 were the highest and most variable at forest with mean et r of 2 19 0 37 compared to 1 22 0 09 and 1 14 0 05 at buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively the decrease in variability with increasing vegetation cover is also apparent seasonally the overall pattern of et was more dynamic on a seasonal basis at the shrub sites reflecting plant growth and senescence with notable declines in et rates between august and september figs 5 6 comparatively daily et at forest was more consistent between months increasing in spring with a gradual decline in september daily et peaked in july at all sites with 2017 2020 mean july et rates of 3 05 0 17 2 48 0 09 and 2 13 0 31 mm day fig 6 the largest difference between mean monthly et rates between forest and the two shrub sites occurred in june forest rates 1 0 mm day greater than buckbrush and 0 9 mm day greater than sparse shrub while the largest difference between buckbrush and sparse shrub occurred in july during the peak growing season buckbrush et rates greater by 0 35 mm day in all other months while sampling error was low table s3 mean et rates at the shrub sites were similar with differences 0 17 mm day moving 14 day mean daily et rates fig 6 show larger variability at the sparse shrub site than buckbrush or forest particularly early in the season variability in et rates among years was lowest in the late growing season at all sites early august 4 discussion 4 1 influence of changing vegetation cover on energy partitioning small decreases in albedo will have a considerable positive impact on atmospheric temperatures even with modest shifts in the landscape bonfils et al 2012 chapin et al 2005 in all seasons albedo at the forest was lower than the buckbrush and sparse shrub sites and the difference between winter and summer was low fig 4 a characteristic of boreal forests betts and ball 1997 mean mid day snow free albedo of buckbrush 0 12 was slightly lower than sparse shrub 0 15 which was similar to shrub and shrub taiga sites reported at a number of northern sites beringer et al 2005 eugster et al 2000 lafleur and humphreys 2018 williamson et al 2016 unlike williamson et al 2016 who suggested an increase in albedo along a successional gradient in yukon territory we observed a more widely reported decline in albedo with increased abundance and height of shrubs during the snow free season important feedbacks from future vegetation shifts on energy partitioning occur during winter and the melt accumulation season bonfils et al 2012 the influence of shrub height and emergence during melt on snow accumulation albedo and the energy balance has been well documented in northern environments and wcrb bewley et al 2010 marsh et al 2010 ménard 2014 pomeroy et al 2006 when considering early season surface energy balances in varying shrub cover the abundance of exposed branches controls albedo which is dependent on the amount of snow wind redistribution the plasticity of woody stems and importantly shrub height sturm et al 2005 for low stature shrubs 0 6 m lafleur and humphreys 2018 found no difference in late winter spring albedo here however differences in peak winter albedo between shrub sites were large 0 5 at buckbrush and 0 82 at sparse shrub similar to the results of sturm et al 2005 who reported mid winter albedo of 0 85 for snow covered shrubs and 0 6 when exposed while the interplay between snow burial and shrub height varies regionally across the pan arctic in all cases shifts in vegetation that act to increase shrub height and abundance will lower albedo as well the encroachment of forests with global radiative impacts considering the current rate of ecosystem change the influence of vegetation on energy partitioning of turbulent fluxes has highlighted differences between shrub and forest species across a range of environments eaton and rouse 2001 eugster et al 2000 kasurinen et al 2014 with respect to shrubs extent and wetness play a significant role whereas for forests the role of lai meteorological conditions and physiological regulation by vegetation and the distinction between conifer and deciduous species has been highlighted brümmer et al 2012 kasurinen et al 2014 while synthesis studies provide important information on partitioning controls generalizations occur due to the large variability in climate across northern biomes there have been few studies comparing vegetation assemblages in the same hydroclimatological regime over several years with the most similar study being beringer et al 2005 who compared surface energy partitioning over a single growing season at nearby sites in alaska among tundra shrubs and boreal forests they reported that the greatest increases in h were between tall shrubs and forest but not between tundra and tall shrubs which is similar to our sites in that there was less difference in the magnitude and timing of energy partitioning among the shrub and forest sites while mean h was greater at the forest the relative partitioning of turbulent energy favoured λve in all years table 2 this contrasts with beringer et al 2005 who report higher partitioning of available energy to h with a bowen ratio β of 1 22 from june to august at their white spruce site in one year compared to our average of 0 95 over four years the lower β we report may in part be explained by a greater lai 3 22 vs 2 76 and the lowland position of the forest in the landscape at forest there was a gradual decline and stabilization in β throughout the growing season where in contrast β at the shrub sites was much more variable on an annual basis and controlled by vegetation phenology fig s1 with higher β occurring in the shoulder season when vegetation was not transpiring whereas there is equivocal evidence as to how height and abundance affects λve and total water loss lafleur and humphreys 2018 our results suggest shrubification will likely result in an increased β early in the year and lower β in mid growing season however the change in net radiation seasonality of vegetation growth nature of precipitation delivery and physiological response will all control total evaporative losses despite shifts in ratios of turbulent fluxes the hydrological implications for this discussed below are that transitions in vegetation cover in wcrb will likely enhance water loss through an increase in et 4 2 hydrological implications of vegetation change while research indicates that increased terrestrial productivity in northern environments will increase et bring et al 2016 rawlins et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 there is limited empirical data as to how treeline advance and shrub height and abundance affect ecosystem et and other components of the hydrological cycle our results are similar to those that showed negligible differences in et among shrubs of different heights lafleur and humphreys 2018 mcfadden et al 2003 however while seasonal et totals were similar there were distinct processes operating that distinguished the two shrub sites diurnal monthly traces of et and nee fig 7 suggest that during july increased et at buckbrush is driven by enhanced transpiration as reflected by the greater nee compared with sparse shrub which has more modest mid season nee however during may when photosynthesis transpiration was low the sparse shrub site has greater et most likely driven by enhanced direct soil evaporation as there is much more exposed bare ground these offsetting processes result in annual et totals being similar yet the reduced influence of vegetation at the sparse shrub site increases et variability during wet years et is similar between buckbrush and sparse shrub yet during dry years such as 2018 et at sparse shrub is notably lower while shrubs can effectively utilize available soil moisture sustaining high rates at buckbrush where vegetation coverage is dense bare ground evaporation at sparse shrub becomes suppressed during dry periods lowering overall et of note the length of growing season did not influence total et between the two shrub sites fig 3 again supporting the role of bare ground evaporation at the sparse shrub site although warmer temperatures and a longer growing season partly explain greater total et at forest than the shrub sites fig 7 physiological and ecosystem processes help explain enhanced water loss and low et variability both forest and buckbrush have relatively low variability in et rates among years particularly later in the growing season july august relative to the sparse shrub site fig 6 highlighting a mediating effect of vegetation during the prime growing season monthly diurnal traces of et and nee from the three sites indicate that as soon as soils thaw in may transpiration photosynthesis begins at forest whereas at the shrub sites et and nee in may are small before bud burst in late may or early june fig 7 similar timing of senescence between both shrub sites is apparent in lower et rates and declines in carbon uptake while differing water use efficiencies and respiration rates influence nee and are an area for future study we suggest that high mid summer et rates and relatively low carbon uptake at forest is in part explained by direct canopy evaporation of intercepted water and enhanced understory evaporation which can be considerable in northern boreal forests baldocchi et al 2000 blanken et al 2001 ikawa et al 2015 kelliher et al 1997 the seasonal differences in et and nee among these sites demonstrate that although increased vegetation cover will likely increase et both physiologically through increased transpiration and structurally through increased interception and canopy storage the timing and magnitude of these roles will differ across ecosystem types in subarctic alpine ecosystems the role of vegetation in making et a conservative process has been outlined in theoretical jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 rodríguez iturbe and porporato 2005 and field studies oishi et al 2010 phillips and oren 2001 roberts 1983 therefore we assert that treeline advance and shrub proliferation will result in more stable higher et rates that are less responsive to inter annual variation in precipitation compared to areas with shorter less dense shrub cover however the total increase in et from shrub infilling will be muted and increase primarily in the mid growing season the nature of evaporative fluxes coupled with the timing magnitude and phase of precipitation delivery has important implications for watershed scale hydrological processes a critical implication of the higher et at forest is the increased et r 2 19 and considerable water deficit from may to september fig 5 suggesting the site is heavily reliant on snowmelt recharge late season rains and potential deeper soil water to sustain these rates as the forest is in a lowland adjacent to the river corridor there is the potential for supplemental lateral water sources from the riparian zone which may in part sustain et during dry periods in contrast the shrub sites evaporate at rates just greater than summer rainfall et r 1 20 and 1 14 at buckbrush and sparse shrub respectively in a synthesis of northern watersheds tetzlaff et al 2013 suggest that with climate change catchments will move towards increasing aridity as et increases at a rate greater than precipitation however in this region total precipitation is expected to increase with enhanced rainfall contributions tetzlaff et al 2013 ipcc 2019 climate and vegetation change modelling by rasouli et al 2019b in wcrb suggest that at higher elevations increased in snow trapping due to higher stature shrubs will likely offset the decrease in snow water equivalent due to climate change this compensation does not however apply to boreal forest covers at low elevations considering the large growing season water deficit and drier soils decreases in snow input early in the season or more periods of extreme weather and potentially drought could push the forest into a situation of moisture stress the growth of white spruce forests in areas of low precipitation and rapid warming is known to be limited due to water deficits and future climate change may cause higher tree mortality in these populations in high latitudes of north america hynes and hamann 2020 we found the primary hydrological difference between shrub sites was during the mid growing season fig 7 although on an annual timescale over six years there does not appear to be a large difference in et when shrubs increase in height and density this may change as warming alters the timing of snowmelt and growing season length resulting in a longer mid season difference between shrub covers of varying height the greater influence is the enhanced snow trapping associated with shrub growth pomeroy et al 2006 rasouli et al 2019b which will enhance recharge and runoff generation particularly during freshet 4 3 considerations for predicting future hydrologic regimes in northern regions despite accelerating research in the north and a new dominance of remote sensing and model based outcomes at the expense of empirical data there remains a nascent understanding of how integrated environmental changes will alter the storage and cycling of water in cold regions while hydrological changes are most often ascribed to warmer air temperatures and changes in frozen ground status at larger scales walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the influence of changing vegetation communities on hydrological storage and flux remains uncertain as there have been few studies showing only modest influences there has been considerable research documenting rapid vegetation change particularly the advance of tree dominated communities into tundra ecosystems danby and hik 2007 conway and danby 2014 harsch et al 2009 lloyd and fastie 2003 and the proliferation of tall shrubs into low tundra myers smith and hik 2017 tape et al 2006 tremblay et al 2012 feedbacks from shrub expansion include enhanced snow trapping warming soils and enhanced nutrient availability all of which enhance further shrub growth and potential for tree establishment myers smith et al 2011 sturm et al 2001 the timescales of these changes must be considered however in future hydrological projections as treeline advance and infilling is slow danby and hik 2007 compared with rapid increases in shrub extent density and height myers smith et al 2011 tape et al 2006 these changes are also highly dependent on permafrost thaw and disturbances such as fire which are expected to continue increasing in rate in coming decades lantz et al 2010a this will to varying degrees start new successional shifts depending on the severity and may result in more deciduous forest rather than boreal conifer species to our knowledge there has been no documentation of surface energy and evaporative fluxes across a northern alpine watershed over multiple years from an et perspective increased forest abundance and shrub proliferation will lead to changing soil moisture regimes and runoff timing and volume specifically increases in et will reduce runoff generation particularly in the growing season for wcrb most of the streamflow is generated in the alpine and subalpine zone and upward expansions of trees would reduce total catchment yield while increase shrubs may trap more snow and provide more water during freshet mid season flows are expected to become less variable and decline with increasing shrub abundance perhaps the greatest challenge in understanding the role of vegetation change on catchment hydrology is the role of precipitation changes from snow to rain enhanced periods of drought or intense precipitation all of which are predicted for pan arctic ecosystems ipcc 2019 will have profound effects on runoff regimes while et is a large flux increased vegetation will likely reduce its variability emphasizing the role of future precipitation uncertainty in watershed scale hydrological processes the role of interception on total et is an area for additional research to evaluate the relative impact of plant structure and physiology while zweibeck 2019 suggested that shrub interception reduced below canopy rainfall by 15 30 for shrub species the role of rainfall interception has not been directly evaluated in this environment the high lai and et rates with modest nee suggests that rainfall interception at the forest is considerable however we have a much greater understanding on how vegetation influences snow processes than rainfall processes in cold environments and is a topic for future consideration 5 conclusion the impact of vegetation change on energy and water cycling in the pan arctic is an area of intense research with literature syntheses bring et al 2016 wrona et al 2016 numerical model outputs rawlins et al 2010 and remote sensing zhang et al 2009 suggesting et will increase from increased air temperature vpd precipitation a longer growing season and an expansion of shrubs and trees there remains however few field based studies that directly evaluate these processes in northern ecosystems in this multi year study we highlight differences and similarities in the timing and magnitude of energy and mass fluxes among boreal forest and shrub taiga ecosystems in an alpine environment where elevation controls temperature and moisture regimes results indicate that the greatest change in water and energy fluxes will occur from changes in treeline compared with shrubification across all seasons as they have distinct regimes et was greatest at the forest site compared with the shrub sites and varied little over 4 years despite differences in meteorology and a considerable growing season water deficit in contrast et was considerably less at the cooler higher elevation shrub sites which exhibited similar et losses over 6 years despite differences in shrub height and abundance while the observation of limited differences in et has been reported before for a single year our results indicate that et variance is much greater at the short sparse shrub site compared with the tall dense shrub site due the reduced influence of vegetation controls on total et while there are multiple interacting processes our results support the assertion that a greening north will have lower albedos and higher et losses how this affects catchment response will be strongly influenced by precipitation timing phase and magnitude growing season length and vegetation snow and rain interactions 6 data availability data is available from https doi org 10 20383 102 0474 database frdr or a request to the primary

4249,in construction and maintenance of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions frost proof is a key factor to keep the stability of embankment dams and the water heat mechanics process is the basis to reveal the evolution of frost damage for embankment dams in cold regions in this paper a novel embankment dam with two phase closed thermosyphons tpcts for reducing frost heave in seasonally frozen regions was presented two embankment dam cases with and without tpcts during freeze thaw processes under different reservoir water levels were tested in laboratory the variations of temperature volumetric unfrozen water content and deformation were monitored it is found that to some extent the frozen depths at the downstream sides of the two dam cases were larger than those at the upstream sides because of the different thermal properties among the concrete slab soil materials and reservoir water meanwhile during the cold periods the frozen depths and vertical deformations at the upstream sides of the embankment dam case 1 with tpcts were far less than those of the embankment dam case 2 without tpcts furthermore the volumetric unfrozen water contents for the embankment dam case 1 with tpcts were larger than those for the embankment dam case 2 without tpcts at the same freezing position this is from the fact that after the tpcts begin to work during the cold periods the tpcts are transferring the heat in the dam from below the reservoir water levels to above it which effectively reduces the freezing of the embankment dam therefore the embankment dam with tpcts could be applied as an effective measure to alleviate the frost heave in seasonally frozen regions keywords laboratory study frost proof performance embankment dam tpct reservoir water level seasonally frozen regions 1 introduction dams as a part of reservoirs are important infrastructures with specific functions such as water supply irrigation flood protection sedimentation control and hydropower jia et al 2016 kang et al 2019 the stability of the dams significantly affects the safety of personal property and the ecological environment in the area around the dams kang et al 2019 zhong et al 2011 in the past decade many of the dams have been constructed in seasonally frozen regions in china which are subjected to freeze thaw cycles not only in china also dams in other continents are subjected to freeze thaw cycles for examples dams in olomouc region adam et al 2016 dams in vilyui river basin of the yakut assr biyanov 1970 and dams in arctic rivers e g pechora kolyma and lena in permafrost regions mcclelland et al 2004 due to the special climate and complex environment in cold regions the frost damage of embankment dams is serious and frequent and the mechanism of frost damage is complicated resulting in different kinds of diseases the water heat mechanics interaction process is the basis to reveal the evolution of frost damage for embankment dams in cold regions some studies have been done on water heat mechanics process for freezing soils lai et al 2014 carried out a one side freezing experiments of saturated soil in an open system with no pressure water supplement and obtained that temperature gradient overburden pressure and cooling temperature are key factors to determine the frost heave and moisture migration li et al 2015 conducted a model experiment of canal and established a numerical water heat mechanics model to explore the frost damage mechanisms of canal in seasonally frozen regions concluded that under the drive of temperature the total water contents in freezing thawing fronts were very high and even a part of the freezing front was filled with ice and unfrozen water which causes high tensile stress and significant frost heave zhang et al 2017a performed a full scale field experiment of highway with asphalt pavement to explore the water heat process and predicted the long term stability of the embankment with a climate warming the study would be helpful for the design and maintenance of the embankments in permafrost regions furthermore some studies have been carried out to study the variation characteristics of temperature bai et al 2020 lu et al 2019a unfrozen water content lu et al 2019b wan and yang 2020 and deformation lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b during the freeze thaw processes more recently some dam researches have also been conducted to better understand the processes of temperature moisture and deformation luo et al 2019 monitored and analyzed the deformation and seepage of an embankment dam made of compacted earth with a clay core and a concrete cutoff wall in the center over an 18 year period with water level fluctuation and obtained that the deformation on the upstream side of the dam was larger due to the dynamic seepage induced by the reservoir water level changes qin et al 2017 studied the influence of heterogeneity on the hydro thermal behaviors of an embankment dam in north quebec and the results showed that spatial variations of hydraulic conductivity had significant impacts on the thermal response of the dam djemili and chiblak 2007 studied the temperature distribution on the concrete slab of a dam in the semi arid region of west algeria and concluded that the maximum temperature on the surface of the concrete slab was proportional to the air temperature of the site and also depended on the climatic geographical and geometric factors based on the in field investigation adam et al 2016 studied the temperature of the asphalt concrete slab of embankment dams and the result showed that during cold seasons the asphalt concrete slab became frozen however few studies have focused on the water heat mechanics processes of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions alleviating frost heave is one of the major challenges to keep the stability of embankment dams in cold regions generally the most frequent method is coarse grain soil replacement which replaces the fine grain soil strong frost heave soil with coarse grain soil weak frost heave soil or localizes the fine grain soil to the non frost depth with asphalt concrete or concrete cover however the coarse grain soils usually have high penetrability which might exceed the limited seepage regulations for dams besides if the frozen depth is large or there is no enough replaced soil in the site then other frost proof measures can be applied in seasonally frozen regions e g thermal insulation zhang et al 2011a and concrete slab coating control sun and li 2009 thermal insulation is a widespread method to increase the thermal resistance and decrease the heat exchange the insulation materials e g polystyrene insulation material and polyurethane insulation material are used in the embankment dam construction chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2011a although the thermal insulation can reduce the immersion of cold energy into embankment dams during cold periods the strength deterioration of the insulation boards with time may have a potential safety risk for the embankment dams in terms of the concrete slab coating control the concrete slab is sprayed with some functional coatings to improve their impermeability and durability sun and li 2009 however if the ambient temperature is too low the concrete slab coating control may be unable to effectively alleviate the freezing damages of embankment dams therefore it is crucial to propose a novel and eco friendly measure to efficiently alleviate the frost damages of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions here a novel embankment dam with two phase closed thermosyphons tpcts for alleviating freezing in seasonally frozen regions is presented in order to investigate the frost proof performance of tpcts for embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions two embankment dam cases with and without tpcts during freeze thaw processes under different reservoir water levels i e 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm were tested in laboratory and the variations of temperature volumetric unfrozen water content and deformation were monitored the results could be helpful for a better understanding of the water heat mechanics processes of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions and it is hoped that this study could provide a novel technique for the construction and maintenance of embankment dams and to ensure the safety of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions 2 theoretical background over the last fifty years many embankment dams sometimes called plain reservoir dams were constructed in seasonally frozen regions due to the advantages of rich materials construction materials principally supplied near the dam site fast construction speed and low cost especially in the arid irrigative areas of northern china usually these embankment dams which have low dam height and long dam axis are homogeneous earth fill dam with concrete slab generally at all dams certain seepage and deformation can be identified if the values of seepage and deformation and their trends keep within prescribed limits it is usually not necessary to adopt remedial works however when the dams are subjected to freeze thaw cycles the changing characteristics of seepage and deformation become more complicated when the dams are subjected to negative ambient temperature and the soil temperature is below the freezing point the water ice phase change will occur the water is frozen into ice the volume will expand by 9 when the water turns into ice then the volume expansion caused by water ice phase change will extrude soil particles consequently the frost heave occurs otherwise during warming processes when the soil temperature is above the freezing point the frozen soil will thaw and then thaw settlement will occur generally because the properties of soils are changed in the freeze thaw cycles the concrete slabs and soils will not return to the original position thus many diseases will occur e g cracks of dam slabs uplift and dislocation of dam slabs fig 1 a two phase closed thermosyphon tpct is one of highly efficient heat transfer devices without the aid of external energy which can transfer a large number of heat between the evaporator and condenser sections noie 2005 pei et al 2017 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2011b 2013 when the temperature of the condenser section is lower than that of the evaporator section and the temperature difference between the condenser and evaporator sections exceeds a certain level the working fluid in the evaporator section absorbs heat energy and turns into vapor fig 2 the vapor moves toward the condenser section due to the vapor pressure gradients in the condenser section the vapor condenses back into liquid releasing the latent heat subsequently the condensate turns to the evaporator section under gravity where it evaporates again and repeats the cycles otherwise the heat transfer process would stop noie 2005 pei et al 2019a b zhang et al 2017c zhuang and zhang 2000 due to the high efficiency of heat transfer and simples structure tpcts have been widely used in many applications e g embankments of the railways and highways cheng et al 2008 doré et al 2016 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2011b fig 3 a 3b tower foundations guo et al 2016 mu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 fig 3c and tunnel zhang et al 2017c fig 3d etc these applications in ground temperature control are mainly related to the engineering in permafrost regions however it is significant different in ground temperature control between the seasonally frozen regions and permafrost regions 3 materials and methods 3 1 experiment apparatus the experimental apparatus used in this study is shown schematically in fig 4 it consisted of three parts i e insulation box temperature control system and data acquisition system the inner dimension of the insulation box was 5 5 m length 3 2 m width 2 7 m height the temperature control system was composed of a double heat sanyo compressor an automatic temperature controller pipes for the refrigerant circulation and an evaporator the temperature control system kept the inner ambient temperature close to the desired temperature after it was set manually the data acquisition system was composed of temperature sensors volumetric unfrozen water content sensors and displacement sensors the temperature sensors are thermistors with an accuracy of 0 05 c the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 are based on the relationship between the dielectric permittivity and volumetric unfrozen water content and the displacement sensors are linear displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 1f s full scale all sensors were connected to a data logger and the data were automatically collected every 10 min 3 2 experiment models in order to investigate the frost proof performance of tpcts for embankment dams under the stepwise rise of reservoir water level two embankment dam cases were designed in this study i e case 1 was the embankment dam with tpcts fig 5 a and case 2 was the embankment dam without tpcts fig 5b the two embankment dam cases had the same geometric sizes in detail the height was 0 9 m the top width was 0 3 m the bottom width was 3 9 m and the slope gradients were 1 2 in the upstream side and downstream side of the two dam cases fig 5 the soil parameters e g density water content thermal conductivity and heat capacity influence the heat flow of embankment dam the silt clay was used as the soil material for the soil dam bodies of the two cases the grain size distribution of the soil was shown in fig 6 and its liquid and plastic limits are 29 05 and 18 64 respectively the soil materials were spread in layers of required depth and then compacted by hammering besides the thermal conductivities of the soil in frozen and unfrozen states are 1 80 w m c and 1 20 w m c respectively and the heat capacities of the soil in frozen and unfrozen states are 1 713 106 j m3 c and 1 927 106 j m3 c respectively three layers were set in the upstream side of dam slope after the both dams were constructed in detail the bottom layer was coarse sand with a thickness of 4 0 cm the middle layer was impermeable geotextile and the top layer was concrete slab with a thickness of 6 0 cm and a strength of c30 fig 5 for the dam case 1 with tpcts the tpcts were buried between the dam body and the coarse sand layer fig 5a and fig 7 a the tpcts used in this study were stainless steel pipe with a length of 1 525 m an outer diameter of 0 051 m and a wall thickness of 0 004 m and ammonia was used as the working fluid besides the interfaces between the two dams were insulated with a 0 10 m thick rigid polyurethane board fig 7b all of the sensors i e temperature sensors volumetric unfrozen water content sensors and displacement sensors arranged in the middle cross sections of the two dam cases are shown in figs 5 and 7 3 3 experiment procedure the ambient temperature in the insulation box was designed as follows 1 t t 15 150 n 150 t 150 n 125 5 0 20 0 cos 2 π t 150 150 n 125 t 150 n 25 15 150 n 25 t 150 n where t t is the ambient temperature c t is time h and n is the number of experimental cycle before the tests the dam cases were kept at indoor temperature near 15 c for 72 h to ensure a relatively steady initial temperature distribution and then the test was started from the highest temperature and repeated periodically in this study the reservoir water level was raised by 4 steps namely 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm after each reservoir water level was set a freeze thaw cycle was performed by eq 1 every freeze thaw cycle lasted for 150 h and four cycles were carried out for the four reservoir water levels fig 8 is the controlled reservoir water level and monitored ambient temperature changing with time in the insulation box 4 experimental results and analyses 4 1 analysis of the temperatures to show the frost proof performance of tpcts for the embankment dams the temperature profiles for the middle cross sections of the two dam cases i e case 1 with tpcts and case 2 without tpcts are compared fig 9 is the initial temperature profiles for the middle cross sections of the two dam cases it can be seen that the initial temperature profiles of the two dam cases are almost the same fig 9 figs 10 13 are the temperature profiles for the middle cross sections at the ends of negative ambient temperatures for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively we can find that at ends of negative ambient temperatures the soil temperatures at the upstream side of the dams are higher than those at the downstream side of the dams this is due to the significantly different thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and heat capacity among the concrete slab constructed soil and reservoir water usually compared with the concrete slab and constructed soil the reservoir water has relative large heat capacity and low thermal conductivity which have insulating or heating effect on the soil at the upstream sides of the dam cases to some extent besides it will release lots of heat to the upstream sides of dam cases with the fluctuation of reservoir water level thus the temperature profiles of the embankment dams are not symmetrical figs 10 13 moreover the frozen depths of the dam crest for the dam case 1 with tpcts are shallower than those for the dam case 2 without tpcts except for the reservoir water level of 42 cm figs 10 13 in detail for the dam case 1 with tpcts the maximum frozen depths of dam crest are 15 9 cm 17 4 cm 18 6 cm and 14 2 cm for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively figs 10a 11a 12a and 13a while for the dam case 2 the maximum frozen depths of dam crest are 15 3 cm 21 3 cm 23 5 cm and 18 9 cm for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively figs 10b 11b 12b and 13b after the tpcts begin to work during the cold periods the tpcts are transferring the heat below the reservoir water levels to the dam body above the reservoir water levels and can effectively alleviate the freezing of soils above the reservoir water level besides at the ends of negative ambient temperatures the soil temperatures inside the dam case with tpcts are slightly higher overall than those without tpcts at the same positions due to the heat transfer of tpcts figs 10 13 to show the frost proof performance of the tpcts for the embankment dam in detail the temperatures of the points t27 and t61 fig 5 for the two dam cases are compared shown in fig 14 the temperature sensor t27 in fig 5a and the temperature sensor t61 in fig 5b were located at the same positions between the concrete slabs and coarse sand layers the two temperature sensors are all above the reservoir water level and can typically illustrate the frost proof effect of the tpcts for the four freeze thaw cycles the temperatures of points t27 and t61 rapidly decrease with the decreased ambient temperature and increase with the increased ambient temperature fig 14 the lowest temperatures of points t27 and t61 remain relatively changeless under the four reservoir water levels however the lowest temperature is always near 0 c for the point t27 case 1 with tpcts while is always below 0 c for the point t61 case 2 without tpcts the differences of the lowest temperatures between the points t27 and t61 is about 2 0 c fig 14 these facts show that the tpcts can increase the soil temperature above the reservoir water level and can effectively alleviate the freezing of embankment dams during the cold periods namely when the soil temperature around the condenser sections of tpcts is lower than that around the evaporator sections and the temperature difference betweeen the condenser and evaporator sections exceeds a certain level the tpcts can transfer the heat in the dam body from below the reservoir water level to above it and the heat will also move from reservoir water to the dam body below the reservoir water level however when the soil temperature around the condenser sections of tpcts equals or is higher than that around the evaporator sections the heat transfer of tpcts stops besides fig 14 also shows that the highest temperatures of points t27 and t61 slightly change with the freeze thaw cycles ranging from 13 c to 11 c this may be the result of the heat transfer and heat balance between the environment and the embankment dams fig 8 and fig 14 additionally although the highest temperatures of the two point t27 and t61 have slightly differences the temperature range difference between the highest temperature and lowest temperature of point t61 is far larger than that of point t27 because of the differences of the lowest temperatures between the two points which indicates that tpcts can reduce the soil temperature range of dam body around them fig 14 consequently the relatively large range of soil temperature might affect the characteristics of soils especially when the soils suffers from the subzero process fig 15 shows the variation of water temperatures in the reservoir model during the stepwise rise of water level it can be seen that the water temperatures are significantly influenced by the ambient temperature fig 3 and fig 15 the water temperatures near the water level drastically change with the depth and then tends to be steady fig 15 also presents that the water temperatures near the bottom of reservoir are similar ranging from 3 c to 9 c after the first freeze thaw cycle although the reservoir water level is gradually rising fig 15 4 2 analysis of the volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 16 shows the variations of the volumetric unfrozen water contents at the centerlines of the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w1 and w2 were located at the centerline of the dam case 1 with tpcts which were buried at the depth of 5 cm and 25 cm from the top respectively fig 5a similarly the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w5 and w6 were located at the same position in the dam case 2 without tpcts respectively fig 5b from fig 16 it can be seen that for each reservoir water level the variations of volumetric unfrozen water contents for w1 and w5 are larger than those for w2 and w6 because the sensors w1 and w5 are closer to the top of dam and the soil temperatures near the surface of the dams are lower during the cold periods therefore at the positions of w1 and w5 there are more liquid water frozen into ice than those of w2 and w6 besides the volumetric unfrozen water contents for the dam case 1 with tpcts are larger than those for the case 2 without tpcts at the same freezing position during the cold periods fig 16 because of the heat transferring of tpcts during the cold periods which slows the freezing of soils in the dam case 1 with tpcts additionally fig 16 also shows that the volumetric unfrozen water contents for w1 w2 w5 and w6 initially decrease and later after the end of the second freeze thaw cycle have increasing trends fig 16 it may be from the fact that water initially infiltrates downwards because of the high initial water contents and after the second freeze thaw cycle the increasing trends occur because of the migration of liquid water from the unfrozen zone to the frozen zone during the freezing process as well as the infiltration of water into the embankment dams with the stepwise rise of reservoir water level fig 17 shows the variations of volumetric unfrozen water contents at the upstream sides and downstream sides of the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w3 and w4 were located at the upstream and downstream sides of the dam case 1 with tpcts respectively fig 5a while the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w7 and w8 were installed at the upstream and downstream sides of the dam case 2 without tpcts respectively fig 5b the four volumetric unfrozen water content sensors all were located at the middle cross sections of the dams fig 5 fig 17 indicates that the volumetric unfrozen water contents of w3 w4 w7 and w8 all periodically fluctuate under different reservoir water levels however the volumetric unfrozen water contents of w3 the upstream side of the case 1 with tpcts only has a small fluctuation under the experimental conditions however it is always higher than that of w7 the upstream side of the case 2 without tpcts due to the heat transferring of tpcts the dam body under the concrete slab with tpcts is almost not frozen while the dam body under the concrete slab without tpcts is freezing during the cold periods moreover the volumetric unfrozen water content of w4 the downstream side of the case 1 with tpcts is more than that of w8 the downstream side of the case 2 without tpcts during the cold periods which indicates that the heat transferring of tpcts has also a little influence on the freezing of soils at the downstream side of the dam in the experiment fig 17 4 3 analysis of the deformations the variations of the vertical deformations at the surfaces of concrete slabs for the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level are shown in fig 18 the deformation sensors d1 and d2 are vertically installed at the surfaces of concrete slabs for the two dam cases with and without tpcts respectively figs 4 and 5 fig 18 indicates that the vertical deformation of concrete slab for the dam case 1 with tpcts is all through smaller than that for the dam case 2 without tcpts in detail in the four freeze thaw cycles the maximum vertical deformation of concrete slab for the case 1 with tpcts has only a slight change and ranges from 0 32 cm to 0 41 cm while the maximum vertical deformation of concrete slab for the case 2 without tpcts is seldom changed in the first two freeze thaw cycles and then increases from the second to the fourth freeze thaw cycles the reservoir water levels from 50 cm to 70 cm increased from 0 48 cm to 1 07 cm fig 18 the difference variations of vertical deformation for the two dam cases are mainly related to the heat transferring of tpcts furthermore fig 18 also shows that there are both reversal deformation and residual deformation on the concrete slabs for the two dam cases during the freeze thaw cycles for the two dam cases the residual vertical deformations gradually increase with the freeze thaw cycles the final residual vertical deformations of concrete slabs for the dam cases with and without tpcts are 0 22 cm and 0 57 cm at the end of the fourth freeze thaw cycle respectively fig 18 it is from the fact that for the dam case 1 with tpcts the soil temperature at the same freezing positions under the concrete slabs is higher than that for the dam case 2 without tpcts which leads to the different freezing intensities for the two dam cases besides the residual deformation on the concrete slabs is mainly related to the effect of freeze thaw cycle and it has been recognized that the freeze thaw processes influence the structure of soils qi et al 2006 and thus the dry densities of the soils are changed some studies have found that the freeze thaw processes could cause the densification of loose soils and opposite result occurs for dense soils chamberlain and gow 1979 viklander 1998 qi et al 2006 consequently the unrecoverable vertical deformation on the concrete slabs occurred from the above analyses it is concluded that the embankment dam case 1 with tpcts is verified to be a preliminary successful measure to alleviate the frost heave of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions however the circumstance conditions are more complex e g reservoir water in laboratory experiment is basically kept motionless in horizontal directions while reservoir water in field is randomly waving because of the influence of circumstance therefore it is necessary to validate the measure by some full scale in situ experiments 5 conclusions from the experimental results and above analyses some preliminary conclusions and suggestions can be drawn as follows 1 the different thermal properties among the concrete slab dam soil and reservoir water result in the insulating or heating effect on the soil at the upstream side of embankment dam to some extent consequently the frozen depth at the downstream side of embankment dam is larger than that at the upstream side 2 the frozen depth at the upstream side of the dam case 1 with tpcts is far less than that of the case 2 without tpcts during the cold periods consequently the volumetric unfrozen water contents for the dam case 1 with tpcts are higher than those for the dam case 2 without tpcts at the same freezing positions of upstream sides besides the vertical deformation at the concrete slab of the dam case 1 with tpcts is smaller than that of the case 2 without tpcts during the freeze thaw cycles 3 the experimental results indicate that tpcts could be applied as an effective measure to alleviate the frost heave of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions however the circumstance conditions are more complex and many factors changes randomly in field e g air temperature water temperature and water wave therefore in the future studies it will be focused on validating the novel embankment dam with tpcts by some full scale in situ experiments credit authorship contribution

jia et al 2016 kang et al 2019 the stability of the dams significantly affects the safety of personal property and the ecological environment in the area around the dams kang et al 2019 zhong et al 2011 in the past decade many of the dams have been constructed in seasonally frozen regions in china which are subjected to freeze thaw cycles not only in china also dams in other continents are subjected to freeze thaw cycles for examples dams in olomouc region adam et al 2016 dams in vilyui river basin of the yakut assr biyanov 1970 and dams in arctic rivers e g pechora kolyma and lena in permafrost regions mcclelland et al 2004 due to the special climate and complex environment in cold regions the frost damage of embankment dams is serious and frequent and the mechanism of frost damage is complicated resulting in different kinds of diseases the water heat mechanics interaction process is the basis to reveal the evolution of frost damage for embankment dams in cold regions some studies have been done on water heat mechanics process for freezing soils lai et al 2014 carried out a one side freezing experiments of saturated soil in an open system with no pressure water supplement and obtained that temperature gradient overburden pressure and cooling temperature are key factors to determine the frost heave and moisture migration li et al 2015 conducted a model experiment of canal and established a numerical water heat mechanics model to explore the frost damage mechanisms of canal in seasonally frozen regions concluded that under the drive of temperature the total water contents in freezing thawing fronts were very high and even a part of the freezing front was filled with ice and unfrozen water which causes high tensile stress and significant frost heave zhang et al 2017a performed a full scale field experiment of highway with asphalt pavement to explore the water heat process and predicted the long term stability of the embankment with a climate warming the study would be helpful for the design and maintenance of the embankments in permafrost regions furthermore some studies have been carried out to study the variation characteristics of temperature bai et al 2020 lu et al 2019a unfrozen water content lu et al 2019b wan and yang 2020 and deformation lu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b during the freeze thaw processes more recently some dam researches have also been conducted to better understand the processes of temperature moisture and deformation luo et al 2019 monitored and analyzed the deformation and seepage of an embankment dam made of compacted earth with a clay core and a concrete cutoff wall in the center over an 18 year period with water level fluctuation and obtained that the deformation on the upstream side of the dam was larger due to the dynamic seepage induced by the reservoir water level changes qin et al 2017 studied the influence of heterogeneity on the hydro thermal behaviors of an embankment dam in north quebec and the results showed that spatial variations of hydraulic conductivity had significant impacts on the thermal response of the dam djemili and chiblak 2007 studied the temperature distribution on the concrete slab of a dam in the semi arid region of west algeria and concluded that the maximum temperature on the surface of the concrete slab was proportional to the air temperature of the site and also depended on the climatic geographical and geometric factors based on the in field investigation adam et al 2016 studied the temperature of the asphalt concrete slab of embankment dams and the result showed that during cold seasons the asphalt concrete slab became frozen however few studies have focused on the water heat mechanics processes of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions alleviating frost heave is one of the major challenges to keep the stability of embankment dams in cold regions generally the most frequent method is coarse grain soil replacement which replaces the fine grain soil strong frost heave soil with coarse grain soil weak frost heave soil or localizes the fine grain soil to the non frost depth with asphalt concrete or concrete cover however the coarse grain soils usually have high penetrability which might exceed the limited seepage regulations for dams besides if the frozen depth is large or there is no enough replaced soil in the site then other frost proof measures can be applied in seasonally frozen regions e g thermal insulation zhang et al 2011a and concrete slab coating control sun and li 2009 thermal insulation is a widespread method to increase the thermal resistance and decrease the heat exchange the insulation materials e g polystyrene insulation material and polyurethane insulation material are used in the embankment dam construction chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2011a although the thermal insulation can reduce the immersion of cold energy into embankment dams during cold periods the strength deterioration of the insulation boards with time may have a potential safety risk for the embankment dams in terms of the concrete slab coating control the concrete slab is sprayed with some functional coatings to improve their impermeability and durability sun and li 2009 however if the ambient temperature is too low the concrete slab coating control may be unable to effectively alleviate the freezing damages of embankment dams therefore it is crucial to propose a novel and eco friendly measure to efficiently alleviate the frost damages of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions here a novel embankment dam with two phase closed thermosyphons tpcts for alleviating freezing in seasonally frozen regions is presented in order to investigate the frost proof performance of tpcts for embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions two embankment dam cases with and without tpcts during freeze thaw processes under different reservoir water levels i e 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm were tested in laboratory and the variations of temperature volumetric unfrozen water content and deformation were monitored the results could be helpful for a better understanding of the water heat mechanics processes of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions and it is hoped that this study could provide a novel technique for the construction and maintenance of embankment dams and to ensure the safety of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions 2 theoretical background over the last fifty years many embankment dams sometimes called plain reservoir dams were constructed in seasonally frozen regions due to the advantages of rich materials construction materials principally supplied near the dam site fast construction speed and low cost especially in the arid irrigative areas of northern china usually these embankment dams which have low dam height and long dam axis are homogeneous earth fill dam with concrete slab generally at all dams certain seepage and deformation can be identified if the values of seepage and deformation and their trends keep within prescribed limits it is usually not necessary to adopt remedial works however when the dams are subjected to freeze thaw cycles the changing characteristics of seepage and deformation become more complicated when the dams are subjected to negative ambient temperature and the soil temperature is below the freezing point the water ice phase change will occur the water is frozen into ice the volume will expand by 9 when the water turns into ice then the volume expansion caused by water ice phase change will extrude soil particles consequently the frost heave occurs otherwise during warming processes when the soil temperature is above the freezing point the frozen soil will thaw and then thaw settlement will occur generally because the properties of soils are changed in the freeze thaw cycles the concrete slabs and soils will not return to the original position thus many diseases will occur e g cracks of dam slabs uplift and dislocation of dam slabs fig 1 a two phase closed thermosyphon tpct is one of highly efficient heat transfer devices without the aid of external energy which can transfer a large number of heat between the evaporator and condenser sections noie 2005 pei et al 2017 yan et al 2020 zhang et al 2011b 2013 when the temperature of the condenser section is lower than that of the evaporator section and the temperature difference between the condenser and evaporator sections exceeds a certain level the working fluid in the evaporator section absorbs heat energy and turns into vapor fig 2 the vapor moves toward the condenser section due to the vapor pressure gradients in the condenser section the vapor condenses back into liquid releasing the latent heat subsequently the condensate turns to the evaporator section under gravity where it evaporates again and repeats the cycles otherwise the heat transfer process would stop noie 2005 pei et al 2019a b zhang et al 2017c zhuang and zhang 2000 due to the high efficiency of heat transfer and simples structure tpcts have been widely used in many applications e g embankments of the railways and highways cheng et al 2008 doré et al 2016 song et al 2013 zhang et al 2011b fig 3 a 3b tower foundations guo et al 2016 mu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 fig 3c and tunnel zhang et al 2017c fig 3d etc these applications in ground temperature control are mainly related to the engineering in permafrost regions however it is significant different in ground temperature control between the seasonally frozen regions and permafrost regions 3 materials and methods 3 1 experiment apparatus the experimental apparatus used in this study is shown schematically in fig 4 it consisted of three parts i e insulation box temperature control system and data acquisition system the inner dimension of the insulation box was 5 5 m length 3 2 m width 2 7 m height the temperature control system was composed of a double heat sanyo compressor an automatic temperature controller pipes for the refrigerant circulation and an evaporator the temperature control system kept the inner ambient temperature close to the desired temperature after it was set manually the data acquisition system was composed of temperature sensors volumetric unfrozen water content sensors and displacement sensors the temperature sensors are thermistors with an accuracy of 0 05 c the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors with an accuracy of 0 03 m3 m3 are based on the relationship between the dielectric permittivity and volumetric unfrozen water content and the displacement sensors are linear displacement sensors with an accuracy of 0 1f s full scale all sensors were connected to a data logger and the data were automatically collected every 10 min 3 2 experiment models in order to investigate the frost proof performance of tpcts for embankment dams under the stepwise rise of reservoir water level two embankment dam cases were designed in this study i e case 1 was the embankment dam with tpcts fig 5 a and case 2 was the embankment dam without tpcts fig 5b the two embankment dam cases had the same geometric sizes in detail the height was 0 9 m the top width was 0 3 m the bottom width was 3 9 m and the slope gradients were 1 2 in the upstream side and downstream side of the two dam cases fig 5 the soil parameters e g density water content thermal conductivity and heat capacity influence the heat flow of embankment dam the silt clay was used as the soil material for the soil dam bodies of the two cases the grain size distribution of the soil was shown in fig 6 and its liquid and plastic limits are 29 05 and 18 64 respectively the soil materials were spread in layers of required depth and then compacted by hammering besides the thermal conductivities of the soil in frozen and unfrozen states are 1 80 w m c and 1 20 w m c respectively and the heat capacities of the soil in frozen and unfrozen states are 1 713 106 j m3 c and 1 927 106 j m3 c respectively three layers were set in the upstream side of dam slope after the both dams were constructed in detail the bottom layer was coarse sand with a thickness of 4 0 cm the middle layer was impermeable geotextile and the top layer was concrete slab with a thickness of 6 0 cm and a strength of c30 fig 5 for the dam case 1 with tpcts the tpcts were buried between the dam body and the coarse sand layer fig 5a and fig 7 a the tpcts used in this study were stainless steel pipe with a length of 1 525 m an outer diameter of 0 051 m and a wall thickness of 0 004 m and ammonia was used as the working fluid besides the interfaces between the two dams were insulated with a 0 10 m thick rigid polyurethane board fig 7b all of the sensors i e temperature sensors volumetric unfrozen water content sensors and displacement sensors arranged in the middle cross sections of the two dam cases are shown in figs 5 and 7 3 3 experiment procedure the ambient temperature in the insulation box was designed as follows 1 t t 15 150 n 150 t 150 n 125 5 0 20 0 cos 2 π t 150 150 n 125 t 150 n 25 15 150 n 25 t 150 n where t t is the ambient temperature c t is time h and n is the number of experimental cycle before the tests the dam cases were kept at indoor temperature near 15 c for 72 h to ensure a relatively steady initial temperature distribution and then the test was started from the highest temperature and repeated periodically in this study the reservoir water level was raised by 4 steps namely 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm after each reservoir water level was set a freeze thaw cycle was performed by eq 1 every freeze thaw cycle lasted for 150 h and four cycles were carried out for the four reservoir water levels fig 8 is the controlled reservoir water level and monitored ambient temperature changing with time in the insulation box 4 experimental results and analyses 4 1 analysis of the temperatures to show the frost proof performance of tpcts for the embankment dams the temperature profiles for the middle cross sections of the two dam cases i e case 1 with tpcts and case 2 without tpcts are compared fig 9 is the initial temperature profiles for the middle cross sections of the two dam cases it can be seen that the initial temperature profiles of the two dam cases are almost the same fig 9 figs 10 13 are the temperature profiles for the middle cross sections at the ends of negative ambient temperatures for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively we can find that at ends of negative ambient temperatures the soil temperatures at the upstream side of the dams are higher than those at the downstream side of the dams this is due to the significantly different thermal properties e g thermal conductivity and heat capacity among the concrete slab constructed soil and reservoir water usually compared with the concrete slab and constructed soil the reservoir water has relative large heat capacity and low thermal conductivity which have insulating or heating effect on the soil at the upstream sides of the dam cases to some extent besides it will release lots of heat to the upstream sides of dam cases with the fluctuation of reservoir water level thus the temperature profiles of the embankment dams are not symmetrical figs 10 13 moreover the frozen depths of the dam crest for the dam case 1 with tpcts are shallower than those for the dam case 2 without tpcts except for the reservoir water level of 42 cm figs 10 13 in detail for the dam case 1 with tpcts the maximum frozen depths of dam crest are 15 9 cm 17 4 cm 18 6 cm and 14 2 cm for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively figs 10a 11a 12a and 13a while for the dam case 2 the maximum frozen depths of dam crest are 15 3 cm 21 3 cm 23 5 cm and 18 9 cm for the reservoir water levels of 42 cm 50 cm 60 cm and 70 cm respectively figs 10b 11b 12b and 13b after the tpcts begin to work during the cold periods the tpcts are transferring the heat below the reservoir water levels to the dam body above the reservoir water levels and can effectively alleviate the freezing of soils above the reservoir water level besides at the ends of negative ambient temperatures the soil temperatures inside the dam case with tpcts are slightly higher overall than those without tpcts at the same positions due to the heat transfer of tpcts figs 10 13 to show the frost proof performance of the tpcts for the embankment dam in detail the temperatures of the points t27 and t61 fig 5 for the two dam cases are compared shown in fig 14 the temperature sensor t27 in fig 5a and the temperature sensor t61 in fig 5b were located at the same positions between the concrete slabs and coarse sand layers the two temperature sensors are all above the reservoir water level and can typically illustrate the frost proof effect of the tpcts for the four freeze thaw cycles the temperatures of points t27 and t61 rapidly decrease with the decreased ambient temperature and increase with the increased ambient temperature fig 14 the lowest temperatures of points t27 and t61 remain relatively changeless under the four reservoir water levels however the lowest temperature is always near 0 c for the point t27 case 1 with tpcts while is always below 0 c for the point t61 case 2 without tpcts the differences of the lowest temperatures between the points t27 and t61 is about 2 0 c fig 14 these facts show that the tpcts can increase the soil temperature above the reservoir water level and can effectively alleviate the freezing of embankment dams during the cold periods namely when the soil temperature around the condenser sections of tpcts is lower than that around the evaporator sections and the temperature difference betweeen the condenser and evaporator sections exceeds a certain level the tpcts can transfer the heat in the dam body from below the reservoir water level to above it and the heat will also move from reservoir water to the dam body below the reservoir water level however when the soil temperature around the condenser sections of tpcts equals or is higher than that around the evaporator sections the heat transfer of tpcts stops besides fig 14 also shows that the highest temperatures of points t27 and t61 slightly change with the freeze thaw cycles ranging from 13 c to 11 c this may be the result of the heat transfer and heat balance between the environment and the embankment dams fig 8 and fig 14 additionally although the highest temperatures of the two point t27 and t61 have slightly differences the temperature range difference between the highest temperature and lowest temperature of point t61 is far larger than that of point t27 because of the differences of the lowest temperatures between the two points which indicates that tpcts can reduce the soil temperature range of dam body around them fig 14 consequently the relatively large range of soil temperature might affect the characteristics of soils especially when the soils suffers from the subzero process fig 15 shows the variation of water temperatures in the reservoir model during the stepwise rise of water level it can be seen that the water temperatures are significantly influenced by the ambient temperature fig 3 and fig 15 the water temperatures near the water level drastically change with the depth and then tends to be steady fig 15 also presents that the water temperatures near the bottom of reservoir are similar ranging from 3 c to 9 c after the first freeze thaw cycle although the reservoir water level is gradually rising fig 15 4 2 analysis of the volumetric unfrozen water contents fig 16 shows the variations of the volumetric unfrozen water contents at the centerlines of the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w1 and w2 were located at the centerline of the dam case 1 with tpcts which were buried at the depth of 5 cm and 25 cm from the top respectively fig 5a similarly the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w5 and w6 were located at the same position in the dam case 2 without tpcts respectively fig 5b from fig 16 it can be seen that for each reservoir water level the variations of volumetric unfrozen water contents for w1 and w5 are larger than those for w2 and w6 because the sensors w1 and w5 are closer to the top of dam and the soil temperatures near the surface of the dams are lower during the cold periods therefore at the positions of w1 and w5 there are more liquid water frozen into ice than those of w2 and w6 besides the volumetric unfrozen water contents for the dam case 1 with tpcts are larger than those for the case 2 without tpcts at the same freezing position during the cold periods fig 16 because of the heat transferring of tpcts during the cold periods which slows the freezing of soils in the dam case 1 with tpcts additionally fig 16 also shows that the volumetric unfrozen water contents for w1 w2 w5 and w6 initially decrease and later after the end of the second freeze thaw cycle have increasing trends fig 16 it may be from the fact that water initially infiltrates downwards because of the high initial water contents and after the second freeze thaw cycle the increasing trends occur because of the migration of liquid water from the unfrozen zone to the frozen zone during the freezing process as well as the infiltration of water into the embankment dams with the stepwise rise of reservoir water level fig 17 shows the variations of volumetric unfrozen water contents at the upstream sides and downstream sides of the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w3 and w4 were located at the upstream and downstream sides of the dam case 1 with tpcts respectively fig 5a while the volumetric unfrozen water content sensors w7 and w8 were installed at the upstream and downstream sides of the dam case 2 without tpcts respectively fig 5b the four volumetric unfrozen water content sensors all were located at the middle cross sections of the dams fig 5 fig 17 indicates that the volumetric unfrozen water contents of w3 w4 w7 and w8 all periodically fluctuate under different reservoir water levels however the volumetric unfrozen water contents of w3 the upstream side of the case 1 with tpcts only has a small fluctuation under the experimental conditions however it is always higher than that of w7 the upstream side of the case 2 without tpcts due to the heat transferring of tpcts the dam body under the concrete slab with tpcts is almost not frozen while the dam body under the concrete slab without tpcts is freezing during the cold periods moreover the volumetric unfrozen water content of w4 the downstream side of the case 1 with tpcts is more than that of w8 the downstream side of the case 2 without tpcts during the cold periods which indicates that the heat transferring of tpcts has also a little influence on the freezing of soils at the downstream side of the dam in the experiment fig 17 4 3 analysis of the deformations the variations of the vertical deformations at the surfaces of concrete slabs for the two embankment dam cases during the stepwise rise of reservoir water level are shown in fig 18 the deformation sensors d1 and d2 are vertically installed at the surfaces of concrete slabs for the two dam cases with and without tpcts respectively figs 4 and 5 fig 18 indicates that the vertical deformation of concrete slab for the dam case 1 with tpcts is all through smaller than that for the dam case 2 without tcpts in detail in the four freeze thaw cycles the maximum vertical deformation of concrete slab for the case 1 with tpcts has only a slight change and ranges from 0 32 cm to 0 41 cm while the maximum vertical deformation of concrete slab for the case 2 without tpcts is seldom changed in the first two freeze thaw cycles and then increases from the second to the fourth freeze thaw cycles the reservoir water levels from 50 cm to 70 cm increased from 0 48 cm to 1 07 cm fig 18 the difference variations of vertical deformation for the two dam cases are mainly related to the heat transferring of tpcts furthermore fig 18 also shows that there are both reversal deformation and residual deformation on the concrete slabs for the two dam cases during the freeze thaw cycles for the two dam cases the residual vertical deformations gradually increase with the freeze thaw cycles the final residual vertical deformations of concrete slabs for the dam cases with and without tpcts are 0 22 cm and 0 57 cm at the end of the fourth freeze thaw cycle respectively fig 18 it is from the fact that for the dam case 1 with tpcts the soil temperature at the same freezing positions under the concrete slabs is higher than that for the dam case 2 without tpcts which leads to the different freezing intensities for the two dam cases besides the residual deformation on the concrete slabs is mainly related to the effect of freeze thaw cycle and it has been recognized that the freeze thaw processes influence the structure of soils qi et al 2006 and thus the dry densities of the soils are changed some studies have found that the freeze thaw processes could cause the densification of loose soils and opposite result occurs for dense soils chamberlain and gow 1979 viklander 1998 qi et al 2006 consequently the unrecoverable vertical deformation on the concrete slabs occurred from the above analyses it is concluded that the embankment dam case 1 with tpcts is verified to be a preliminary successful measure to alleviate the frost heave of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions however the circumstance conditions are more complex e g reservoir water in laboratory experiment is basically kept motionless in horizontal directions while reservoir water in field is randomly waving because of the influence of circumstance therefore it is necessary to validate the measure by some full scale in situ experiments 5 conclusions from the experimental results and above analyses some preliminary conclusions and suggestions can be drawn as follows 1 the different thermal properties among the concrete slab dam soil and reservoir water result in the insulating or heating effect on the soil at the upstream side of embankment dam to some extent consequently the frozen depth at the downstream side of embankment dam is larger than that at the upstream side 2 the frozen depth at the upstream side of the dam case 1 with tpcts is far less than that of the case 2 without tpcts during the cold periods consequently the volumetric unfrozen water contents for the dam case 1 with tpcts are higher than those for the dam case 2 without tpcts at the same freezing positions of upstream sides besides the vertical deformation at the concrete slab of the dam case 1 with tpcts is smaller than that of the case 2 without tpcts during the freeze thaw cycles 3 the experimental results indicate that tpcts could be applied as an effective measure to alleviate the frost heave of embankment dams in seasonally frozen regions however the circumstance conditions are more complex and many factors changes randomly in field e g air temperature water temperature and water wave therefore in the future studies it will be focused on validating the novel embankment dam with tpcts by some full scale in situ experiments credit authorship contribution
