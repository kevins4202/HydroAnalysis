805,a two phase numerical model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is developed to model the scouring of two phase liquid sediments flows with large deformation the rheology of sediment scouring due to flows with slow kinematics and high shear forces presents a challenge in terms of spurious numerical fluctuations this paper bridges the gap between the non newtonian and newtonian flows by proposing a model that combines the yielding shear and suspension layer mechanics which are needed to predict accurately the local erosion phenomena a critical bed mobility condition based on the shields criterion is imposed to the particles located at the sediment surface thus the onset of the erosion process is independent on the pressure field and eliminates the numerical problem of pressure dependant erosion at the interface this is combined with the drucker prager yield criterion to predict the onset of yielding of the sediment surface and a concentration suspension model the multi phase model has been implemented in the open source dualsphysics code accelerated with a graphics processing unit gpu the multi phase model has been compared with 2 d reference numerical models and new experimental data for scour with convergent results numerical results for a dry bed dam break over an erodible bed shows improved agreement with experimental scour and water surface profiles compared to well known sph multi phase models 1 introduction sediment scouring and fluvial suspension due to liquid flows are common phenomena in many river flows however the construction of reservoirs interrupts the natural equilibrium of basins and leads to sedimentation siltation of artificial lakes affects water supply systems by reducing the storage capacity and eventually affects other reservoir functions such as irrigation supply energy production navigation and flood control schleiss et al 2016 more than 80 of the world s total storage capacity of artificial reservoirs belongs to hydropower dams icold 2012 in which sedimentation may also cause damages to turbines by abrasion or occlusion and loss of power production the prediction of erosion rates is a key issue for siltation management and long term operation plans of reservoirs dams and other hydraulic structures flows involving sedimentation are characterised by a shear layer of soil particles under large relative motions at the interface between the sediment and the fluid numerical modelling enables prediction of the changes in the sediment balance upstream and downstream of a hydraulic structure permitting different scenarios to be investigated quickly with relatively low cost as well as supporting field solutions however the presence of two phases the combination of interfacial and free surface flows in addition to particle entrainment of the sediment by the fluid phase are the main challenges of traditional mesh based methods to simulate erosion and sedimentation processes liu 2003 in recent years the alternative option of meshless methods has emerged gingold and monaghan 1977 koshizuka and oka 1996 oñate and idelsohn 1998 of all the meshless methods now available smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph has unique advantages when modelling problems involving large deformation of interfacial and free surface flows or large sediment motions and mixing that occur during soil erosion sph is a lagrangian method that was initially developed to study astrophysical problems gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and has been extended to a wide range of engineering applications geotechnical and geoenvironmental applications include flood and river dynamics prakash et al 2014 vacondio et al 2012 williams et al 2016 soil mechanics bui et al 2011 bui 2008 chen and qiu 2014 reyes et al 2013 simulation of landslides manenti et al 2016 pastor et al 2009 ran et al 2015 tan and chen 2017 xenakis et al 2017 seepage problems bui and fukagawa 2013 maeda et al 2006 and sediment transport falappi et al 2007 fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2012 shi et al 2017 ulrich et al 2013 the simulation of sediment scour using sph has developed steadily over the last decade falappi et al 2007 simulated sediment scour in a reservoir flushing experiment using a pseudo newtonian approach based on mohr coulomb parameters guandalini et al 2012 used the shields erosion criterion to predict scouring and in subsequent work manenti et al 2012 compared the mohr coulomb pseudo newtonian approach with the shields erosion criterion with experimental data the results of manenti et al 2012 showed that the eroded volume and the profile evolution were better reproduced by the shields criterion however the methodology treats the non eroded sediment particles at subsurface layers as a fixed boundary and prevents the shields approach from being able to simulate the rheology of the material at subsurface layers ulrich et al 2013 also used a yield criterion based on mohr coulomb parameters to simulate ship induced scouring near ports the model combines a linear elastic approach with a pseudo newtonian model for the un yielded and yielded material respectively the model was supplemented by a suspension layer based on the chezy relation to account for the viscosity transition between the sediment and the water nevertheless in order to avoid singularities on the viscosity value the pseudo newtonian treatment requires the definition of a maximum value for viscosity which may be case dependent fourtakas and rogers 2016 used the drucker prager yield criterion which is also based on mohr coulomb parameters to simulate the rheology of sediment induced by rapid flows the model uses a pseudo newtonian approach based on the bingham type herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp model that allows simulating the rheology of the un yielded and the yielded material without needing to define a maximum value for viscosity the vand equation vand 1948 is used to account for sediment suspension at the surface layer the model showed good results for problems involving impact of rapid flows in the bed of sediment however numerical tests have shown spurious pressure fields in the sediment at areas of large deformation as for example near the wave fronts at these large shear regions deformation occurs as the kinematics of the liquid phase is sufficient to yield the sediment phase which exhibits slow kinematics and high shear forces this discontinuity at the interface is known to cause the erroneous pressure due to the shear forces discontinuity which requires a second gradient summation for calculating the shear rates fatehi and manzari 2011 these slow kinematics exhibited by the sediment phase under high shear rate have been addressed in sph more generally using diffusion based techniques including the xsph approach of monaghan 1992 with an additional smoothing manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 or by using the particle shifting algorithm of lind et al 2012 as employed in the work of fourtakas and rogers 2016 these techniques improve the particle distribution and avoid particle clustering which allows for a better sampled kernel nevertheless the issue is not entirely eliminated in the recent work of amicarelli et al 2017 a model for erosional dam break floods is presented the model simulates the sediment bed as a mixture type material using a mixture viscosity and a constitutive model based on coulomb parameters for fully saturated soil the aforementioned models use the so called weakly compressible sph wcsph schemes where pressure is related to density through an equation of state alternatively truly incompressible sph isph formulations that couple the governing equations have also been applied to sediment transport problems ran et al 2015 comparisons of wcsph and isph for free surface flow have shown that improved velocity and pressure fields are obtained with the isph method lee et al 2010 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2009 incompressible sph formulations can be an alternative to improve the pressure fields which are essential to better reproduce the dynamics and erosion patterns of the sediment phase in the work of ran et al 2015 an isph scheme and an interface erosion criterion which is based on the fluid and grain properties similar to shields criterion is used to simulate erosion and entrainment of the sediment grain by the water non eroded particles are treated as fixed boundaries like in the model presented by manenti et al 2012 satisfactory results with respect to experimental profiles were obtained by ran et al 2015 however wcsph formulations present some advantages over isph schemes in terms of computational efficiency isph generally produces reduced pressure fluctuations in the pressure field and larger time steps are possible wcsph schemes demand smaller times steps to keep density variations within acceptable levels but on the other hand the formulation avoids solving the poisson equation which is computationally expensive and numerical solutions are obtained by explicit algorithms in this work a wcsph scheme is used to simulate erosion and scouring of a sediment bed a critical bed mobility condition based on the shields criterion is imposed to the particles located at the sediment surface thus the onset of the erosion process is independent on the pressure field and eliminates the problem of pressure dependant erosion at the interface the mohr coulomb parameters refer to the mechanical properties of the soil thus the yield criteria based on mohr coulomb parameters are suitable to simulate the rheology of the subsurface domain of sediment however erosion at the fluid sediment interface is dominated by the flux characteristics and physical properties of the sediment e g particle diameter and specific weight the onset of the motion at the surface layer of a bed of sediment may be accurately modelled by the shield s parameter as shown by manenti et al 2012 and ghaitanellis et al 2017 this paper is intended to bridge the gap between these mechanical and physical approaches by proposing a model that aims to predict erosion rates at the bed surface and scour profiles due to the effect of the water on the sediment the two phase wcsph model of fourtakas and rogers 2016 applicable to rapidly varying flows is complemented by the shields theory to deal with the suspension of sediment under low velocity flow these two criteria have been combined in order to maximise the applicability of the model to both the entrainment of soil by water as occurs in fluvial environments and the impact of rapidly varying flows in a bed of sediment the computational demands make the problem ideal for sph development on graphics processing units gpus to enable simulations with a large number of particles required for real engineering problems the open source dualsphysics solver crespo et al 2015 that is accelerated by gpus and extended by fourtakas and rogers 2016 for sediments has been used to implement the computational algorithm the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the computational model is presented a detailed description of the equations for the water and sediment phases including the erosion criteria and the suspension treatment is given numerical results are presented in section 3 first the implementation of the shields criterion is compared to numerical and experimental results then a flume experiment over an erodible bed of non cohesive sediment is presented and the total amount of bed material transported by the wave is compared with the experimental results finally the combined drucker prager and shields criteria approach is tested against experimental results of a dam break over erodible beds conclusions are presented in section 4 2 computational model the physical domain of the simulation may be represented by five regions as shown in fig 1 region 1 represents the un yielded sediment which remains almost static due to its large apparent viscosities region 2 consists of sediment with an apparent viscosity small enough to allow particle movement according to a non newtonian flow model see section 2 4 4 region 3 represents the sediment that reached the critical shields parameter and simulates bed load transport region 4 is composed of particles suspended in the fluid with a variable viscosity and region 5 represents only water particles the description of how these regions are a treated using sph is presented in the following sections 2 1 governing equations and sph formalism in this section we briefly describe the general governing equations and the sph modelling technique for the fluid and sediment vectors and tensors are defined by reference to cartesian coordinates using greek superscripts α β and γ to denote cartesian tensor coordinate directions and latin subscripts i and j to identify particle locations einstein s summation is employed over repeated greek superscripts the governing equations of fluids are described by the navier stokes equations written in lagrangian form the conservation of mass continuity and momentum equations read 1 d ρ d t ρ u α x α 0 and 2 d u α d t 1 ρ σ α β x β g α respectively where ρ is the density u α is the velocity σ α β is the total stress tensor and g α is the gravitational acceleration the total stress tensor σ α β comprises of two parts the isotropic pressure p and the viscous stresses τ α β 3 σ α β p δ α β τ α β where δαβ is kronecker s delta function which equals 1 for α β and 0 otherwise in order to relate pressure with density the fluid is considered to be weakly compressible and tait s equation of state is used to close the system of equations batchelor 1967 i e 4 p i c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ i ρ 0 γ p 1 where pi and ρ i are the pressure and density of the particle γ p is the polytrophic index set to 7 in this work as suggested by monaghan 2000 ρ0 is the reference density and c 0 is the numerical speed of sound that should be set to a value that guaranties small oscillations on pressure following monaghan 1994 c 0 is related to the maximum velocity magnitude in the domain u max as 5 c 0 10 u max in this work eqs 1 to 5 are used for all the phases however the viscous part of the stress tensor in eq 3 is modelled depending on the phase water or sediment via a constitutive model and will be discussed in sections 2 4 and 2 5 2 2 general sph approximation sph is a meshless particle method where particles represent the computational media and are assigned material properties the method is based on the integral representation of a function f x over a domain ω at a point x by the follow identity 6 f x ω f x δ d x x d x where δ d x x represents the dirac delta function the continuous approximation of eq 6 is obtained by replacing the dirac delta function by a normalized weighting or kernel function wij between particles i and j then the particle approximation is obtained by means of a summation over points inside the influence domain of the kernel function 7 f x i j 1 n f x j w i j v j where the subscript i refers to the interpolating particle and j refers to neighbouring particles v j m j ρ j is the discrete volume of the particle j and n is the number of particles within the influence domain of the kernel function a more detailed description of the sph formulation can be found in violeau 2012 the kernel function w i j w x i x j h is a smooth even and isotropic function that has a finite radius compact support around x i the smoothing length h defines the size of the support domain of the function following fourtakas and rogers 2016 the fifth order wendland kernel with compact support of 2h is used in the present study wendland 1995 8 w r h a d 1 r 2 4 2 r 1 with r x i x j h and the normalization constant ad equals to 7 4hπ2 and 21 16hπ3 in 2 d and 3 d space respectively 2 3 sph discretisation of the governing equations the transient evolution of the particle density and momentum within an sph approximation is given by 9 d ρ i d t j 1 n m j u i j α w i j x α and 10 d u i α d t j 1 n m j σ i α β σ j α β ρ i ρ j w i j x β g α respectively where the subscript i refers to the interpolating particle and j refers to neighbouring particles u i α is the velocity vector with relative velocity given by u i j α u i α u j α x i α is the position vector ρ i is the density σ i α β is the total stress tensor mj is the mass g i α is the gravitational acceleration and wij is the smoothing or kernel function further information regarding the weakly compressible sph approach wcsph may be found in monaghan 1994 and more recently in violeau and rogers 2016 the eqs 9 and 10 are for a general fluid description in order to distinguish between the water and sediment phases each one requires different treatment as now described below 2 4 fluid phase constitutive equation for the water the fluid phase is treated as a simple newtonian fluid thus the newtonian constitutive equations are used the viscous stresses of eq 3 are computed as 11 τ i α β 2 μ ɛ i α β where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water and ɛ i α β is the deviatoric strain rate defined as 12 ɛ i α β 1 2 u i β x i α u i α x i β 1 3 u i γ x i γ δ α β where i and j refers to neighbouring particles greek superscripts α and β are free indices γ is a dummy index and δαβ is kronecker s delta function the sph approximation of 12 may be written as 13 ɛ i α β 1 2 j n m j ρ j u j i β w i j x i α j n m j ρ j u j i α w i j x i β 1 3 j n m j ρ j u j i γ w i j x i γ γ δ α β this model has been validated for a range of free surface flows as described in fourtakas and rogers 2016 2 5 sediment phase constitutive equation for the sediment the sediment phase is considered to be fully saturated and is modelled as a slightly compressible pseudo newtonian fluid in line with the works of fourtakas et al 2013 fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 the viscous term of eq 3 is obtained as a function of the apparent viscosity μ app as 14 τ i α β 2 μ a p p ɛ i α β following fourtakas and rogers 2016 the apparent viscosity of the sediment is calculated using the herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp model thus in this work the symbol μ hbp is used to denote the apparent viscosity i e μ hbp μ app the hbp model reads 15 μ h b p τ c i i d 1 e m i i d 2 μ 4 i i d n 1 2 where m controls the exponential growth of stress and n is a power law index that enables simulation of shear thinning or shear thickening behaviour note that when m 0 and n 1 the model reduces to a newtonian model whereas when m and n 1 a simple bingham model is recovered the parameter τ c is the yield stress that should be defined by a yield criterion the advantage of the hbp model is that it provides information on the pre yield and post yield region and thereby avoids the need of setting a maximum threshold for the viscosity as required in other pseudo newtonian approaches manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 2 5 1 shields erosion criterion the shields criterion is based on the balance of the drag force imposed by the fluid flow and the particle weight the grain s motion is triggered when a certain critical stress is exceeded the dimensionless critical shear stress θ cr over a horizontal bed of uniform sediment is then defined as 16 θ c r τ b c r 0 ρ s ρ g d where τ bcr 0 is the critical bed shear stress for incipient motion over horizontal bottom ρ s is the saturated density of the sediment ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity and d is the characteristic particle diameter usually taken as the median diameter d 50 for non uniform materials similar to manenti et al 2012 the present study adopts the analytical relation proposed by van rijn 1993 to approximate the critical shields parameter as a function of the sediment reynolds number re 17 θ c r 0 010595 ln re 0 110476 re 0 0027197 for re 500 θ c r 0 068 for re 500 with re u d ν being ν the kinematic viscosity of water and u the friction velocity related to the bed shear stress τ b as van rijn 1993 18 u τ b ρ also as in the work of manenti et al 2012 it is assumed that a turbulent boundary layer is developed along the sediment fluid interface a logarithmic velocity law is assumed without resolving the velocity field inside the turbulent boundary layer if smooth flow conditions occur a viscous sub layer is considered along the sediment fluid interface the definition of smooth flow conditions is formulated in later time in the paper the thickness δ of this layer depends on the friction velocity and on the kinematic viscosity i e 19 δ 11 6 v u the velocity profile is then defined as the combination of a linear function for the laminar sub layer and the logarithmic velocity function for the turbulent layer 20 u z u 2 v z for z δ u z u 1 κ ln z z o for z δ where z is the position of the water particle measured as the vertical distance from the sediment surface using eq 26 given later to the vertical position of the point in the flow u z is the velocity of the water particle closest to the sediment particle for which the dynamic condition eroded or at rest is being evaluated ν the kinematic viscosity of water κ 0 41 is the von kármán constant and z 0 is the bottom roughness length scale parameter which depends on the flow regime as 21 z o 0 11 v u k s u v 5 smooth flow 0 033 k s k s u v 70 rough flow 0 11 v u 0 033 k s 5 k s u v 70 where ks is the equivalent grain roughness also known as nikuradse s roughness it is an empirical parameter and its value depends on the sediment characteristics and the flow condition for flat beds it is considered to be on the order of the median grain diameter van rijn 1993 wilson 1989 to calculate u from 20 it is necessary to know a priori the region laminar or turbulent where the water particle is located also the dependency of z 0 on u by eq 21 implies that 20 must be solved iteratively for u an iterative procedure suggested by manenti et al 2012 was implemented in dualsphysics as starting from the hypothesis that the smooth flow condition occurs i e ksu v 5 as given in eq 21 and that the water particle is located inside the viscous sub layer i e z δ until convergence of u once u is obtained it is possible to calculate τ b and τ bcr 0 from 18 and 16 respectively the gravitational influence for non horizontal beds is considered by means of the correction factors k β and k γ deduced by van rijn 1993 for small slopes 22 k β sin ϕ β sin ϕ 23 k γ cos γ 1 tan 2 γ tan 2 ϕ 0 5 where φ is the internal friction angle of the sediment β and γ are the longitudinal and transverse slope respectively the minus sign in 22 holds for down sloping and the plus for up sloping flows for a combination of longitudinal and transverse slope the critical bed stress is calculated as follows 24 τ b c r k β k γ τ b c r 0 finally a sediment particle is considered to be yielded if 25 τ b τ b c r in the dualsphysics implementation the closest water particle to a sediment particle is identified during the neighbour search at each time step and its distance to a sediment particle is stored however the calculation of the critical shields parameter and the iterative process for calculating u is performed only for particles identified as being near the sediment surface using two criteria i at least one water particle must be within the support of the smoothing kernel of the sediment particle and ii the summation of the mass of sediment particles within the support domain should be less than a fraction of the reference mass of sediment particles such as 26 m i j 1 n m j w i j v j m f where i and j denote the interpolated sediment particle and the neighbour particle respectively and mf represents a fraction of the reference mass of sediment particles this approach has been previously used by crespo et al 2011 and gómez gesteira et al 2005 to identify the free surface in order for a sediment particle be tagged to be near the surface conditions i and ii above should be satisfied simultaneously this procedure provides the sediment surface position that is used to define the value of z in eq 20 2 5 2 drucker prager yield criterion the drucker prager yield criterion is a pressure dependent model for determining whether a material has failed or undergone plastic yielding the yielding surface of the drucker prager criterion may be considered depending on the state of stress and on mechanical properties of the sediment desai and siriwardane 1984 27 j 2 d α j 1 κ c 0 where j 1 is the first invariant trace of the stress tensor that equals to pressure for fluids in repose in this particular case the sediment skeleton pressure and j 2d is the second invariant of the deviatoric shear stress tensor defined as 28 j 2 d 1 2 τ α β τ α β the parameters α and κ c can be related to the mohr coulomb parameters according to 29 α 2 sin ϕ 3 3 sin ϕ κ c 6 c cos ϕ 3 3 sin ϕ where φ and c are the angle of internal friction and cohesion respectively yielding requires the square root of the second invariant j 2d of the deviatoric shear stress tensor to exceed a threshold value τ y i e 30 j 2 τ y using eqs 27 and 30 a threshold criterion may be defined as 31 τ y α j 1 κ where τ y is the critical shear stress that should replace τ c in eq 15 if the drucker prager criterion is used to model the yielding mechanism of the sediment the reader is directed to fourtakas and rogers 2016 for details of the methodology used herein eq 31 means that the critical shear stress increases with pressure therefore the apparent viscosity calculated by eq 15 will increase with depth reducing the strain rate at points located at lower layers in contrast to the shields erosion criterion the drucker prager yield criterion enables computation of the stress tensor for all points at the sediment domain and update of the position and the velocity thus while the critical shield s parameter provides information about the onset of erosion at the bed surface the critical value of the shear stress defines the yielded or un yielded state of particles over the entire sediment domain this makes the approach ideal to reproduce the effect of the impact of rapid flows over subsurface layers of a bed of sediments as occurs for example at dam spillways 2 5 3 suspension treatment in line with fourtakas and rogers 2016 the viscosity of suspended particles is considered to be a function of a volumetric fraction this non dimensional concentration parameter cv is computed as the ratio of the volume of sediment particles to the total volume in the support domain of the kernel i e 32 c v i j sediment 2 h n m j ρ j j 2 h n m j ρ j the threshold for the onset of suspended transport is set to c v i 0 3 and the viscosity of the suspended material μ susp is computed using the vand experimental colloidal equation vand 1948 that reads 33 μ s u s p μ e 0 5 c v 1 39 64 c v c v 0 3 where μ is the viscosity of water thus when the volumetric concentration of a yielded sediment particle within the support domain of the sph kernel is below 0 3 the sediment particle is treated as a pseudo newtonian flow with a variable viscosity that approximates to the viscosity of the water as c v i 0 consequently as the density of the sediment is larger than that of the water sediment particles tend to settle when their viscosity diminishes this approach is also similar to the transition layer of suspended material proposed by ulrich et al 2013 2 5 4 modelling of the sediment subsurface and sediment water interface of a two phase sediment transport problem in order to simulate the dynamics of the subsurface sediment region and to avoid the noisy pressure fields at the sediment surface the drucker prager criterion describing the yield characteristics of the sediment phase was combined with the shields criterion to model the fluvial suspension of the sediment at the interface regions 1 3 in fig 1 are modelled as non newtonian fluids with an apparent viscosity computed by the hbp model the apparent viscosity of regions 1 and 2 is obtained by substituting the yield stress τ c in eq 15 by the critical shear stress τ y computed from the drucker prager criterion the apparent viscosity of region 3 is obtained by replacing the yield stress τ c in eq 15 by the critical bed stress τ bcr computed from the shields criterion thus the 3 regions are well defined region 1 is un yielded with a large yield stress region 2 which is yielded with an apparent viscosity derived from the hbp model and region 3 which is governed by the shields criterion which is pressure independent the transition between regions 1 and 2 is not explicitly defined but emerges naturally because of the increase in stress with depth using a pressure dependent yield criterion see eq 31 particles with higher critical shear stress τ y exhibit larger values of apparent viscosity and remain static the transition between regions 2 and 3 is defined by using the procedure to identify sediment particles located near the bed surface see section 2 5 1 in addition in order for a particle to be located at region 3 the condition of eq 25 should be assessed if eq 25 is valid then the particle is considered to be at region 3 and the critical bed stress τ bcr computed by the shields criterion replace the yield stress τ c in the hbp model to calculate the apparent viscosity μ hbp through eq 15 otherwise the particle is considered to remain at region 1 or 2 and the critical shear stress τ y of the drucker prager model is used to calculate μ hbp by making τ c τ y in eq 15 the flowchart of fig 2 shows the procedure for calculating the apparent viscosity of particles at different regions finally the suspended sediment is identified by the concentration parameter cv defined by eq 32 and the viscosity is computed from eq 33 with this approach the mechanical properties of the bed material are considered by means of the cohesion and friction angle while the effect of the physical properties are introduced by the particle diameter and the density within the shields erosion criterion thus the model is able to reproduce the entrainment of the sediment by the fluid phase which is dominated by the physical properties of the sediment and the hydraulic characteristics of the flow as well as the behaviour of the subsurface layers of sediment determined by the mechanical properties of the material 2 6 dualsphysics implementation time integration and boundary conditions the computational model herein presented has been implemented in the dualsphysics code crespo et al 2015 an sph c cuda open source solver the previous implementation of fourtakas and rogers 2016 was used as the starting point to implement the shields criterion and combine it with the druker prager yield criterion the predictor corrector algorithm described by monaghan 1989 bound by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition of force viscosity and speed of sound is employed for the time step integration wall boundaries are modelled using the dynamic boundary condition dbc of crespo et al 2007 implemented in dualsphysics 3 numerical results this section presents numerical results first the implementation of the shields criterion is validated using a 2 d flushing experiment and comparing the final profile with the experimental result and with numerical results of manenti et al 2012 then a flume experiment carried out by the authors with non cohesive sediment bed under fluvial conditions is presented this experiment was intended to evaluate the influence of an empirical parameter of the shields formulation the equivalent grain roughness ks on the rate of erosion predicted by the shields criterion thus the flume experiment is simulated using only the shields criterion at the surface treating the non eroded particles as a fixed boundary finally the combined approached presented in section 2 5 4 is used to simulate a 2 d dam break problem over erodible bed the results are qualitatively compared to results obtained by the shield and drucker prager criterion separately 3 1 2 d flushing experiment the flushing experiment of falappi et al 2007 represents the scour of a sediment bed due to constant water discharge from a tank in a similar manner to what happens when a water reservoir gets flushed this is an ideal test case to assess the effectiveness of the shields criterion in applications where erosion occurs at the bed surface only in the absence of sediment yielding therefore the drucker prager criterion is not necessary which deems this test case suitable for validation of the shields criterion this experiment has been widely used as a benchmark case for erosion models in sph falappi et al 2007 manenti et al 2012 ulrich and rung 2010 the case is presented as numerical validation of the implementation of the shields criterion in dualsphysics the geometry and dimensions of the experiment are shown in fig 3 the bulk density of the sediment is ρ s 1750kg m3 the mean diameter d50 and the kinematic viscosity of the sediment are taken to be 0 1 mm and 0 75 m2 s respectively a constant water discharge of 0 0079 m3 s was imposed by setting the horizontal particle velocity to 0 658 m s at the outlet the parameters of the hbp model were set to n 1 and m 0 in order to reproduce the newtonian behaviour of the eroded sediment employed by manenti et al 2012 in order to avoid excessive creeping of the sediment bed non eroded particles are treated as a fixed boundary this is the main disadvantage of the use of the shields criterion at the surface and justifies the need to use other complementary yield criteria to model the rheology of the subsurface sediment domain in order to provide a fair comparison the parameters for the numerical model and the material properties were set in accordance with manenti et al 2012 to assess the effect of resolution three different particle spacing were tested dp 0 01 m dp 0 005 m and dp 0 003 m giving simulations with 20 249 79 480 and 314 871 particles respectively fig 4 shows the bed profiles obtained with dualsphysics at t 48 s for each resolution the profiles are plotted in fig 5 together with the experimental profiles and the one found numerically by manenti et al 2012 it is observed that the profile computed with dualsphysics is in close agreement with the experimental one at the upper part although a small divergence can be seen at the base of the slope for the coarser resolutions although a direct comparison with manenti et al 2012 might indicate that the proposed method is less accurate no convergence study was presented by manenti et al so the effect of particle size is unknown in that work however in this paper with particle refinement it is demonstrated that the dualsphysics result is in increasingly closer agreement with the experimental result indicating convergence 3 2 flume experiment to simulate steady flow over a mobile bed numerical simulations were compared with a flume experiment carried out at the facilities of the lutheran university of brazil ulbra campus palmas to an experimental flume mark hm 160 produced by gunt hamburg was adapted in order to place a 5 5 cm bed of non cohesive sediment the flume has a closed water circuit and a trap of sediment was added downstream the cross section of the channel is 86 300 mm and the side walls are made of tempered glass which allows clear observation of the experiments the schematic arrangement of the experiment is shown in fig 6 the water entered the flume by the inlet reservoir the gate was completely open at the beginning of the experiment the equipment provided a steady flow with a fixed discharge over a mobile bed the bed was built by sand pluviation technique chaney and mulilis 1978 the bed material was a sand of 0 4 mm of mean diameter with a density of 2710 kg m3 the grain size distribution curve is shown in fig 7 during the experiment the water discharge was kept to a constant value of 2 m3 h and water level measurements were taken at the positions identified as p1 p2 and p3 in fig 6 the time elapsed from the instant that the water entered the channel and the instant the wave front reached the end of the channel was 8 s the experiment was run for 10 s after the wave front reached the end of the flume thus the experiment was run for a total time of t 18 s the test was performed three times in order to check for repeatability in the numerical simulation an upstream reservoir filled with water particles was created the reservoir had an orifice of 2 cm height at the entrance of the flume x 0 a constant water discharge was imposed by setting the horizontal particle velocity to 0 22 m s at the water inlet x 0 which corresponds to the exit of the orifice of the tank as shown in fig 8 the imposed velocity was calibrated considering the width of the flume in order to obtain the mas flow rate of 2 m3 h the hbp parameters were set to n 1 and m 0 in order to mimic a newtonian behaviour of the eroded material a spatial convergence study in terms of the position of the wave front was conducted using the following initial particle spacings of dp 0 016 m 0 008 m 0 004 m and 0 002 m with the experimental results as the reference solution fig 9 a shows the position of the wave front at t 8 s for all particle resolutions evidently the finer particle resolutions of dp 0 004 m and 0 002 m reproduced the experimental result dashed line as shown in fig 9b which shows a spatial convergence of the model concerning the viscous formulation and its ability to capture the physics of the flow hence a minimum particle spacing of dp 0 004 m is needed thus the numerical case with a particle spacing of dp 0 004 m leading to 24 909 water particles and 7 188 sediment particles has been used for the same physical time as with the experimental setup of 18 s 10 s after the wave front reach the end of the flume a collector was added for retaining the particles downstream the flume as shown in fig 8 thus the mass of the eroded sediment per meter wide at the end of the simulation may be calculated as 34 m e d p d p ρ s n p where dp is the particle spacing ρ s is the sediment density and np is the number of particles sediment particles collected at the end of the simulation in order to verify the influence of the equivalent grain roughness ks on the results six different values were tested i e k s d 50 1 2 3 5 7 10 the shields criterion was applied at the surface layer of sediment sediment particles outside the surface layer were fixed to the domain by explicitly setting the velocity and acceleration to zero the mass of eroded material per meter wide is plotted in fig 10 the first three bars show the experimental results while the last six bars present the results obtained by the sph simulations at t 18 s which signifies the end of the experiment the numerical results show that the mass of eroded material increases with ks until the ratio k s d 50 7 this is in agreement with the results reported by manenti et al 2012 and suggests a rough flow for ks d 50 7 therefore the grain is located inside the turbulent layer for ks d 50 7 the hydraulic regime varies from transitional to smooth leading to a reduction of the eroded mass for smaller values of ks the ratio that better reproduced the experimental results was k s d 50 3 as shown by the horizontal dotted line in fig 8 however no experimental evidence has been found to support this behaviour since the experimental results show scattered data kamphuis 1974 millar 1999 sumer et al 1996 williams 1967 a future study may consider the influence of the shields parameter on ks experimental results suggest that for flat beds the values of ks increase with the critical shields parameter camenen et al 2009 sumer et al 1996 note that in this approach particles that do not reach the critical shields parameter remain fixed to the domain for that reason this approach is appropriate for problems in which only the surface layer of sediment is affected by the flux as in fluvial channels or when flushing sediment from artificial reservoirs 3 3 2 d dam break over erodible bed in order to show the ability of the combined approach presented in 2 5 4 to simulate the scouring and erosion caused by the impact of the water on a bed of sediment the louvain erosional dam break of fraccarollo and capart 2002 is simulated the experiment has been use as a benchmark for various researchers fourtakas and rogers 2016 ulrich et al 2013 and will be used herein to compare the behaviour of the computational model using the erosion criteria separately and to compare the combined approach to other sph simulations the experiment consists of the collapse of a water column over a loose sediment bed in a prismatic channel the bed was built with cylindrical pvc pellets with an equivalent spherical diameter of 3 5 mm and saturated density of 1270 kg m3 in order to calculate the value of the saturated density a volume fraction of 0 5 was assumed following the suggestions of fraccarollo and capart 2002 fig 11 shows the initial set up of the experiment the 2 d computational case was configured using a particle spacing of 0 002 m in order to compare with the same case reported in fourtakas and rogers 2016 leading to 25 000 water particles and 49 450 sediment particles three cases were run using different models for the sediment phase i e a drucker prager yield criterion and hbp rheological model for the eroded sediment b shields erosion criterion and newtonian model for the eroded sediment c drucker prager yield criterion combined with shields erosion criterion and hbp rheological model the mechanical properties of the soil for the drucker prager criterion case a were set to ϕ 310 and c 0 pa in order to reproduce a cohesion less material as expected from pvc pellets since the values are not given by fraccarollo and capart 2002 fig 12 shows the three cases at the same instant in time where the particles belonging to each phase are coloured blue for water and red for sediment in order to show the effect on the deformation of the cases a b and c the equivalent grain roughness ks for the shields criterion case b was set to 5 times the value of the mean diameter which is expected to represent a transitional flow condition for this case sediment particles are fixed to the domain unless they reach the erosion criterion see fig 12a otherwise the impact of the water column over the soil produces excessive deformation of the sediment mass even if high viscosities are used see fig 12b for the example shown in fig 12b an upper limit of μmax 2500 pa s following the suggestions of ulrich et al 2013 and ulrich and rung 2012 however manenti et al 2012 set the upper limit to viscosity to several orders of magnitude higher than this which suggests that the maximum value of the apparent viscosity is case dependent the combination of the criteria case c eliminates the need of fixing the particles to the domain position because the shear stress is computed at each sediment particle as a function of the mechanical soil properties avoiding the excessive creeping resulting from a fluid model see fig 12c the parameters of the hbp model used in cases a and b were set to n 1 2 and m 100 in order to represent a non newtonian shear thinning material and to avoid the numerical instabilities for zero shear strain rate figs 13 16 show the snapshots of the erosional 2 d dam break experiments at times 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 s the experimental snapshots were presented by fraccarollo and capart 2002 showing the estimated interfaces between the sediment bed the eroded material and the water numerical experiments show three sub domains blue particles represent the water phase red particles are the un yielded sediment and green particles denote the eroded material two features may be analysed from the erosion patterns of figs 13 16 the bed profile formed by the motionless particles and the transport layer formed by the moving sediment particles represented by red and green particles in the numerical snapshots respectively from the a snapshots in figs 13 15 it may be observed that the bed profiles generated by the drucker prager criterion are similar to the experimental profiles reproducing the curve formed by the impact of the water in the bed of sediment at position x 0 05 m however the model is not able to correctly simulate the transport layer this effect is better reproduced by the shields criterion represented by the b snapshots where green particles show a well defined layer of eroded sediment the combined approach presented in the c snapshots keeps the positive features of each criterion i e it captures the effect of the impact as well as the entrainment of the sediment particles by the fluid phase showing satisfactory qualitative agreement between the numerical model and experimental observations the plots of figs 17 and 18 confirm this behaviour for t 0 25 s and t 1 00 s the root mean square rms error was used to quantify the deviation of the sph interface location from the experimental interfaces accordingly the acronyms rmse zw rmse zs and rmse zb in fig 17 and fig 18 represent the rms error of the free surface zw the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and the interface between moving and immobile grains at the bed zb the transport layer is defined by the region between the zs and zb interfaces the current model shows closer agreement to the experimental data both for the bed surface zb interface and for the transport layer region between zb and zs interfaces comparing the profiles obtained by the shields criterion with the profiles obtained by the combined approach here presented at t 0 25 s the current model demonstrate greater capability of capturing the yielding effect caused by the impact of the wave at the initial states see the shape of the wave front in fig 17b and 17c the yielding near the dam toe is also well captured by the drucker prager model as observed in fig 17a for t 1 00 s the drucker prager yield criterion shows a tiny transport layer near the wave front while the shields criterion and the combined approach show reasonable agreement with the experimental data the current model shows the smallest rms error for the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and for the interface between moving and immobile grains zb this means that the scouring profile is satisfactory predicted by the current model the current model that combines the drucker prager and the shields criteria shows the smallest rms error for the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and for the interface between moving and immobile grains zb this allows to conclude that the scouring profile is satisfactory predicted by the current model 4 conclusions in this paper a novel approached that combines two erosion criteria with a non newtonian rheological model to simulate surface erosion is presented the drucker prager yield criterion was complemented by the shields erosion criterion in order to model the relevant features of the erosive process by considering the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the sediment bed the implementation of the shields criterion into the dualsphysics code has been validated using experimental and numerical results the analysis of the equivalent grain roughness parameter showed that it has a strong influence on the on the prediction of the amount of eroded material significantly different behaviour was observed when the erosion criteria were used separately to simulate a 2 d dam break experiment the drucker prager yield criterion was able to reproduce the effect of the impact of the water in the bed at the dam toe while the shields criterion showed better agreement on simulating the transport layer formed by the entrainment of the sediment particles by water at final stages satisfactory results are observed when both criteria are combined keeping the positive features of each criterion i e the shape of the scouring profile and transport layer the combined approach here proposed is able to simulate the yielding of the sediment layer by considering the mechanical properties of the material thus the rheology of the domain of sediment under the impact of rapidly varying flows is satisfactory predicted also the entrainment of soil by water is accurately simulated by including the physical properties of the sediment and the hydraulic characteristics of the flow through the shields criterion acknowledgements

805,a two phase numerical model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is developed to model the scouring of two phase liquid sediments flows with large deformation the rheology of sediment scouring due to flows with slow kinematics and high shear forces presents a challenge in terms of spurious numerical fluctuations this paper bridges the gap between the non newtonian and newtonian flows by proposing a model that combines the yielding shear and suspension layer mechanics which are needed to predict accurately the local erosion phenomena a critical bed mobility condition based on the shields criterion is imposed to the particles located at the sediment surface thus the onset of the erosion process is independent on the pressure field and eliminates the numerical problem of pressure dependant erosion at the interface this is combined with the drucker prager yield criterion to predict the onset of yielding of the sediment surface and a concentration suspension model the multi phase model has been implemented in the open source dualsphysics code accelerated with a graphics processing unit gpu the multi phase model has been compared with 2 d reference numerical models and new experimental data for scour with convergent results numerical results for a dry bed dam break over an erodible bed shows improved agreement with experimental scour and water surface profiles compared to well known sph multi phase models 1 introduction sediment scouring and fluvial suspension due to liquid flows are common phenomena in many river flows however the construction of reservoirs interrupts the natural equilibrium of basins and leads to sedimentation siltation of artificial lakes affects water supply systems by reducing the storage capacity and eventually affects other reservoir functions such as irrigation supply energy production navigation and flood control schleiss et al 2016 more than 80 of the world s total storage capacity of artificial reservoirs belongs to hydropower dams icold 2012 in which sedimentation may also cause damages to turbines by abrasion or occlusion and loss of power production the prediction of erosion rates is a key issue for siltation management and long term operation plans of reservoirs dams and other hydraulic structures flows involving sedimentation are characterised by a shear layer of soil particles under large relative motions at the interface between the sediment and the fluid numerical modelling enables prediction of the changes in the sediment balance upstream and downstream of a hydraulic structure permitting different scenarios to be investigated quickly with relatively low cost as well as supporting field solutions however the presence of two phases the combination of interfacial and free surface flows in addition to particle entrainment of the sediment by the fluid phase are the main challenges of traditional mesh based methods to simulate erosion and sedimentation processes liu 2003 in recent years the alternative option of meshless methods has emerged gingold and monaghan 1977 koshizuka and oka 1996 oñate and idelsohn 1998 of all the meshless methods now available smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph has unique advantages when modelling problems involving large deformation of interfacial and free surface flows or large sediment motions and mixing that occur during soil erosion sph is a lagrangian method that was initially developed to study astrophysical problems gingold and monaghan 1977 lucy 1977 and has been extended to a wide range of engineering applications geotechnical and geoenvironmental applications include flood and river dynamics prakash et al 2014 vacondio et al 2012 williams et al 2016 soil mechanics bui et al 2011 bui 2008 chen and qiu 2014 reyes et al 2013 simulation of landslides manenti et al 2016 pastor et al 2009 ran et al 2015 tan and chen 2017 xenakis et al 2017 seepage problems bui and fukagawa 2013 maeda et al 2006 and sediment transport falappi et al 2007 fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2012 shi et al 2017 ulrich et al 2013 the simulation of sediment scour using sph has developed steadily over the last decade falappi et al 2007 simulated sediment scour in a reservoir flushing experiment using a pseudo newtonian approach based on mohr coulomb parameters guandalini et al 2012 used the shields erosion criterion to predict scouring and in subsequent work manenti et al 2012 compared the mohr coulomb pseudo newtonian approach with the shields erosion criterion with experimental data the results of manenti et al 2012 showed that the eroded volume and the profile evolution were better reproduced by the shields criterion however the methodology treats the non eroded sediment particles at subsurface layers as a fixed boundary and prevents the shields approach from being able to simulate the rheology of the material at subsurface layers ulrich et al 2013 also used a yield criterion based on mohr coulomb parameters to simulate ship induced scouring near ports the model combines a linear elastic approach with a pseudo newtonian model for the un yielded and yielded material respectively the model was supplemented by a suspension layer based on the chezy relation to account for the viscosity transition between the sediment and the water nevertheless in order to avoid singularities on the viscosity value the pseudo newtonian treatment requires the definition of a maximum value for viscosity which may be case dependent fourtakas and rogers 2016 used the drucker prager yield criterion which is also based on mohr coulomb parameters to simulate the rheology of sediment induced by rapid flows the model uses a pseudo newtonian approach based on the bingham type herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp model that allows simulating the rheology of the un yielded and the yielded material without needing to define a maximum value for viscosity the vand equation vand 1948 is used to account for sediment suspension at the surface layer the model showed good results for problems involving impact of rapid flows in the bed of sediment however numerical tests have shown spurious pressure fields in the sediment at areas of large deformation as for example near the wave fronts at these large shear regions deformation occurs as the kinematics of the liquid phase is sufficient to yield the sediment phase which exhibits slow kinematics and high shear forces this discontinuity at the interface is known to cause the erroneous pressure due to the shear forces discontinuity which requires a second gradient summation for calculating the shear rates fatehi and manzari 2011 these slow kinematics exhibited by the sediment phase under high shear rate have been addressed in sph more generally using diffusion based techniques including the xsph approach of monaghan 1992 with an additional smoothing manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 or by using the particle shifting algorithm of lind et al 2012 as employed in the work of fourtakas and rogers 2016 these techniques improve the particle distribution and avoid particle clustering which allows for a better sampled kernel nevertheless the issue is not entirely eliminated in the recent work of amicarelli et al 2017 a model for erosional dam break floods is presented the model simulates the sediment bed as a mixture type material using a mixture viscosity and a constitutive model based on coulomb parameters for fully saturated soil the aforementioned models use the so called weakly compressible sph wcsph schemes where pressure is related to density through an equation of state alternatively truly incompressible sph isph formulations that couple the governing equations have also been applied to sediment transport problems ran et al 2015 comparisons of wcsph and isph for free surface flow have shown that improved velocity and pressure fields are obtained with the isph method lee et al 2010 lee et al 2008 xu et al 2009 incompressible sph formulations can be an alternative to improve the pressure fields which are essential to better reproduce the dynamics and erosion patterns of the sediment phase in the work of ran et al 2015 an isph scheme and an interface erosion criterion which is based on the fluid and grain properties similar to shields criterion is used to simulate erosion and entrainment of the sediment grain by the water non eroded particles are treated as fixed boundaries like in the model presented by manenti et al 2012 satisfactory results with respect to experimental profiles were obtained by ran et al 2015 however wcsph formulations present some advantages over isph schemes in terms of computational efficiency isph generally produces reduced pressure fluctuations in the pressure field and larger time steps are possible wcsph schemes demand smaller times steps to keep density variations within acceptable levels but on the other hand the formulation avoids solving the poisson equation which is computationally expensive and numerical solutions are obtained by explicit algorithms in this work a wcsph scheme is used to simulate erosion and scouring of a sediment bed a critical bed mobility condition based on the shields criterion is imposed to the particles located at the sediment surface thus the onset of the erosion process is independent on the pressure field and eliminates the problem of pressure dependant erosion at the interface the mohr coulomb parameters refer to the mechanical properties of the soil thus the yield criteria based on mohr coulomb parameters are suitable to simulate the rheology of the subsurface domain of sediment however erosion at the fluid sediment interface is dominated by the flux characteristics and physical properties of the sediment e g particle diameter and specific weight the onset of the motion at the surface layer of a bed of sediment may be accurately modelled by the shield s parameter as shown by manenti et al 2012 and ghaitanellis et al 2017 this paper is intended to bridge the gap between these mechanical and physical approaches by proposing a model that aims to predict erosion rates at the bed surface and scour profiles due to the effect of the water on the sediment the two phase wcsph model of fourtakas and rogers 2016 applicable to rapidly varying flows is complemented by the shields theory to deal with the suspension of sediment under low velocity flow these two criteria have been combined in order to maximise the applicability of the model to both the entrainment of soil by water as occurs in fluvial environments and the impact of rapidly varying flows in a bed of sediment the computational demands make the problem ideal for sph development on graphics processing units gpus to enable simulations with a large number of particles required for real engineering problems the open source dualsphysics solver crespo et al 2015 that is accelerated by gpus and extended by fourtakas and rogers 2016 for sediments has been used to implement the computational algorithm the paper is structured as follows in section 2 the computational model is presented a detailed description of the equations for the water and sediment phases including the erosion criteria and the suspension treatment is given numerical results are presented in section 3 first the implementation of the shields criterion is compared to numerical and experimental results then a flume experiment over an erodible bed of non cohesive sediment is presented and the total amount of bed material transported by the wave is compared with the experimental results finally the combined drucker prager and shields criteria approach is tested against experimental results of a dam break over erodible beds conclusions are presented in section 4 2 computational model the physical domain of the simulation may be represented by five regions as shown in fig 1 region 1 represents the un yielded sediment which remains almost static due to its large apparent viscosities region 2 consists of sediment with an apparent viscosity small enough to allow particle movement according to a non newtonian flow model see section 2 4 4 region 3 represents the sediment that reached the critical shields parameter and simulates bed load transport region 4 is composed of particles suspended in the fluid with a variable viscosity and region 5 represents only water particles the description of how these regions are a treated using sph is presented in the following sections 2 1 governing equations and sph formalism in this section we briefly describe the general governing equations and the sph modelling technique for the fluid and sediment vectors and tensors are defined by reference to cartesian coordinates using greek superscripts α β and γ to denote cartesian tensor coordinate directions and latin subscripts i and j to identify particle locations einstein s summation is employed over repeated greek superscripts the governing equations of fluids are described by the navier stokes equations written in lagrangian form the conservation of mass continuity and momentum equations read 1 d ρ d t ρ u α x α 0 and 2 d u α d t 1 ρ σ α β x β g α respectively where ρ is the density u α is the velocity σ α β is the total stress tensor and g α is the gravitational acceleration the total stress tensor σ α β comprises of two parts the isotropic pressure p and the viscous stresses τ α β 3 σ α β p δ α β τ α β where δαβ is kronecker s delta function which equals 1 for α β and 0 otherwise in order to relate pressure with density the fluid is considered to be weakly compressible and tait s equation of state is used to close the system of equations batchelor 1967 i e 4 p i c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ i ρ 0 γ p 1 where pi and ρ i are the pressure and density of the particle γ p is the polytrophic index set to 7 in this work as suggested by monaghan 2000 ρ0 is the reference density and c 0 is the numerical speed of sound that should be set to a value that guaranties small oscillations on pressure following monaghan 1994 c 0 is related to the maximum velocity magnitude in the domain u max as 5 c 0 10 u max in this work eqs 1 to 5 are used for all the phases however the viscous part of the stress tensor in eq 3 is modelled depending on the phase water or sediment via a constitutive model and will be discussed in sections 2 4 and 2 5 2 2 general sph approximation sph is a meshless particle method where particles represent the computational media and are assigned material properties the method is based on the integral representation of a function f x over a domain ω at a point x by the follow identity 6 f x ω f x δ d x x d x where δ d x x represents the dirac delta function the continuous approximation of eq 6 is obtained by replacing the dirac delta function by a normalized weighting or kernel function wij between particles i and j then the particle approximation is obtained by means of a summation over points inside the influence domain of the kernel function 7 f x i j 1 n f x j w i j v j where the subscript i refers to the interpolating particle and j refers to neighbouring particles v j m j ρ j is the discrete volume of the particle j and n is the number of particles within the influence domain of the kernel function a more detailed description of the sph formulation can be found in violeau 2012 the kernel function w i j w x i x j h is a smooth even and isotropic function that has a finite radius compact support around x i the smoothing length h defines the size of the support domain of the function following fourtakas and rogers 2016 the fifth order wendland kernel with compact support of 2h is used in the present study wendland 1995 8 w r h a d 1 r 2 4 2 r 1 with r x i x j h and the normalization constant ad equals to 7 4hπ2 and 21 16hπ3 in 2 d and 3 d space respectively 2 3 sph discretisation of the governing equations the transient evolution of the particle density and momentum within an sph approximation is given by 9 d ρ i d t j 1 n m j u i j α w i j x α and 10 d u i α d t j 1 n m j σ i α β σ j α β ρ i ρ j w i j x β g α respectively where the subscript i refers to the interpolating particle and j refers to neighbouring particles u i α is the velocity vector with relative velocity given by u i j α u i α u j α x i α is the position vector ρ i is the density σ i α β is the total stress tensor mj is the mass g i α is the gravitational acceleration and wij is the smoothing or kernel function further information regarding the weakly compressible sph approach wcsph may be found in monaghan 1994 and more recently in violeau and rogers 2016 the eqs 9 and 10 are for a general fluid description in order to distinguish between the water and sediment phases each one requires different treatment as now described below 2 4 fluid phase constitutive equation for the water the fluid phase is treated as a simple newtonian fluid thus the newtonian constitutive equations are used the viscous stresses of eq 3 are computed as 11 τ i α β 2 μ ɛ i α β where μ is the dynamic viscosity of water and ɛ i α β is the deviatoric strain rate defined as 12 ɛ i α β 1 2 u i β x i α u i α x i β 1 3 u i γ x i γ δ α β where i and j refers to neighbouring particles greek superscripts α and β are free indices γ is a dummy index and δαβ is kronecker s delta function the sph approximation of 12 may be written as 13 ɛ i α β 1 2 j n m j ρ j u j i β w i j x i α j n m j ρ j u j i α w i j x i β 1 3 j n m j ρ j u j i γ w i j x i γ γ δ α β this model has been validated for a range of free surface flows as described in fourtakas and rogers 2016 2 5 sediment phase constitutive equation for the sediment the sediment phase is considered to be fully saturated and is modelled as a slightly compressible pseudo newtonian fluid in line with the works of fourtakas et al 2013 fourtakas and rogers 2016 manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 the viscous term of eq 3 is obtained as a function of the apparent viscosity μ app as 14 τ i α β 2 μ a p p ɛ i α β following fourtakas and rogers 2016 the apparent viscosity of the sediment is calculated using the herschel bulkley papanastasiou hbp model thus in this work the symbol μ hbp is used to denote the apparent viscosity i e μ hbp μ app the hbp model reads 15 μ h b p τ c i i d 1 e m i i d 2 μ 4 i i d n 1 2 where m controls the exponential growth of stress and n is a power law index that enables simulation of shear thinning or shear thickening behaviour note that when m 0 and n 1 the model reduces to a newtonian model whereas when m and n 1 a simple bingham model is recovered the parameter τ c is the yield stress that should be defined by a yield criterion the advantage of the hbp model is that it provides information on the pre yield and post yield region and thereby avoids the need of setting a maximum threshold for the viscosity as required in other pseudo newtonian approaches manenti et al 2012 ulrich et al 2013 2 5 1 shields erosion criterion the shields criterion is based on the balance of the drag force imposed by the fluid flow and the particle weight the grain s motion is triggered when a certain critical stress is exceeded the dimensionless critical shear stress θ cr over a horizontal bed of uniform sediment is then defined as 16 θ c r τ b c r 0 ρ s ρ g d where τ bcr 0 is the critical bed shear stress for incipient motion over horizontal bottom ρ s is the saturated density of the sediment ρ is the fluid density g is the gravity and d is the characteristic particle diameter usually taken as the median diameter d 50 for non uniform materials similar to manenti et al 2012 the present study adopts the analytical relation proposed by van rijn 1993 to approximate the critical shields parameter as a function of the sediment reynolds number re 17 θ c r 0 010595 ln re 0 110476 re 0 0027197 for re 500 θ c r 0 068 for re 500 with re u d ν being ν the kinematic viscosity of water and u the friction velocity related to the bed shear stress τ b as van rijn 1993 18 u τ b ρ also as in the work of manenti et al 2012 it is assumed that a turbulent boundary layer is developed along the sediment fluid interface a logarithmic velocity law is assumed without resolving the velocity field inside the turbulent boundary layer if smooth flow conditions occur a viscous sub layer is considered along the sediment fluid interface the definition of smooth flow conditions is formulated in later time in the paper the thickness δ of this layer depends on the friction velocity and on the kinematic viscosity i e 19 δ 11 6 v u the velocity profile is then defined as the combination of a linear function for the laminar sub layer and the logarithmic velocity function for the turbulent layer 20 u z u 2 v z for z δ u z u 1 κ ln z z o for z δ where z is the position of the water particle measured as the vertical distance from the sediment surface using eq 26 given later to the vertical position of the point in the flow u z is the velocity of the water particle closest to the sediment particle for which the dynamic condition eroded or at rest is being evaluated ν the kinematic viscosity of water κ 0 41 is the von kármán constant and z 0 is the bottom roughness length scale parameter which depends on the flow regime as 21 z o 0 11 v u k s u v 5 smooth flow 0 033 k s k s u v 70 rough flow 0 11 v u 0 033 k s 5 k s u v 70 where ks is the equivalent grain roughness also known as nikuradse s roughness it is an empirical parameter and its value depends on the sediment characteristics and the flow condition for flat beds it is considered to be on the order of the median grain diameter van rijn 1993 wilson 1989 to calculate u from 20 it is necessary to know a priori the region laminar or turbulent where the water particle is located also the dependency of z 0 on u by eq 21 implies that 20 must be solved iteratively for u an iterative procedure suggested by manenti et al 2012 was implemented in dualsphysics as starting from the hypothesis that the smooth flow condition occurs i e ksu v 5 as given in eq 21 and that the water particle is located inside the viscous sub layer i e z δ until convergence of u once u is obtained it is possible to calculate τ b and τ bcr 0 from 18 and 16 respectively the gravitational influence for non horizontal beds is considered by means of the correction factors k β and k γ deduced by van rijn 1993 for small slopes 22 k β sin ϕ β sin ϕ 23 k γ cos γ 1 tan 2 γ tan 2 ϕ 0 5 where φ is the internal friction angle of the sediment β and γ are the longitudinal and transverse slope respectively the minus sign in 22 holds for down sloping and the plus for up sloping flows for a combination of longitudinal and transverse slope the critical bed stress is calculated as follows 24 τ b c r k β k γ τ b c r 0 finally a sediment particle is considered to be yielded if 25 τ b τ b c r in the dualsphysics implementation the closest water particle to a sediment particle is identified during the neighbour search at each time step and its distance to a sediment particle is stored however the calculation of the critical shields parameter and the iterative process for calculating u is performed only for particles identified as being near the sediment surface using two criteria i at least one water particle must be within the support of the smoothing kernel of the sediment particle and ii the summation of the mass of sediment particles within the support domain should be less than a fraction of the reference mass of sediment particles such as 26 m i j 1 n m j w i j v j m f where i and j denote the interpolated sediment particle and the neighbour particle respectively and mf represents a fraction of the reference mass of sediment particles this approach has been previously used by crespo et al 2011 and gómez gesteira et al 2005 to identify the free surface in order for a sediment particle be tagged to be near the surface conditions i and ii above should be satisfied simultaneously this procedure provides the sediment surface position that is used to define the value of z in eq 20 2 5 2 drucker prager yield criterion the drucker prager yield criterion is a pressure dependent model for determining whether a material has failed or undergone plastic yielding the yielding surface of the drucker prager criterion may be considered depending on the state of stress and on mechanical properties of the sediment desai and siriwardane 1984 27 j 2 d α j 1 κ c 0 where j 1 is the first invariant trace of the stress tensor that equals to pressure for fluids in repose in this particular case the sediment skeleton pressure and j 2d is the second invariant of the deviatoric shear stress tensor defined as 28 j 2 d 1 2 τ α β τ α β the parameters α and κ c can be related to the mohr coulomb parameters according to 29 α 2 sin ϕ 3 3 sin ϕ κ c 6 c cos ϕ 3 3 sin ϕ where φ and c are the angle of internal friction and cohesion respectively yielding requires the square root of the second invariant j 2d of the deviatoric shear stress tensor to exceed a threshold value τ y i e 30 j 2 τ y using eqs 27 and 30 a threshold criterion may be defined as 31 τ y α j 1 κ where τ y is the critical shear stress that should replace τ c in eq 15 if the drucker prager criterion is used to model the yielding mechanism of the sediment the reader is directed to fourtakas and rogers 2016 for details of the methodology used herein eq 31 means that the critical shear stress increases with pressure therefore the apparent viscosity calculated by eq 15 will increase with depth reducing the strain rate at points located at lower layers in contrast to the shields erosion criterion the drucker prager yield criterion enables computation of the stress tensor for all points at the sediment domain and update of the position and the velocity thus while the critical shield s parameter provides information about the onset of erosion at the bed surface the critical value of the shear stress defines the yielded or un yielded state of particles over the entire sediment domain this makes the approach ideal to reproduce the effect of the impact of rapid flows over subsurface layers of a bed of sediments as occurs for example at dam spillways 2 5 3 suspension treatment in line with fourtakas and rogers 2016 the viscosity of suspended particles is considered to be a function of a volumetric fraction this non dimensional concentration parameter cv is computed as the ratio of the volume of sediment particles to the total volume in the support domain of the kernel i e 32 c v i j sediment 2 h n m j ρ j j 2 h n m j ρ j the threshold for the onset of suspended transport is set to c v i 0 3 and the viscosity of the suspended material μ susp is computed using the vand experimental colloidal equation vand 1948 that reads 33 μ s u s p μ e 0 5 c v 1 39 64 c v c v 0 3 where μ is the viscosity of water thus when the volumetric concentration of a yielded sediment particle within the support domain of the sph kernel is below 0 3 the sediment particle is treated as a pseudo newtonian flow with a variable viscosity that approximates to the viscosity of the water as c v i 0 consequently as the density of the sediment is larger than that of the water sediment particles tend to settle when their viscosity diminishes this approach is also similar to the transition layer of suspended material proposed by ulrich et al 2013 2 5 4 modelling of the sediment subsurface and sediment water interface of a two phase sediment transport problem in order to simulate the dynamics of the subsurface sediment region and to avoid the noisy pressure fields at the sediment surface the drucker prager criterion describing the yield characteristics of the sediment phase was combined with the shields criterion to model the fluvial suspension of the sediment at the interface regions 1 3 in fig 1 are modelled as non newtonian fluids with an apparent viscosity computed by the hbp model the apparent viscosity of regions 1 and 2 is obtained by substituting the yield stress τ c in eq 15 by the critical shear stress τ y computed from the drucker prager criterion the apparent viscosity of region 3 is obtained by replacing the yield stress τ c in eq 15 by the critical bed stress τ bcr computed from the shields criterion thus the 3 regions are well defined region 1 is un yielded with a large yield stress region 2 which is yielded with an apparent viscosity derived from the hbp model and region 3 which is governed by the shields criterion which is pressure independent the transition between regions 1 and 2 is not explicitly defined but emerges naturally because of the increase in stress with depth using a pressure dependent yield criterion see eq 31 particles with higher critical shear stress τ y exhibit larger values of apparent viscosity and remain static the transition between regions 2 and 3 is defined by using the procedure to identify sediment particles located near the bed surface see section 2 5 1 in addition in order for a particle to be located at region 3 the condition of eq 25 should be assessed if eq 25 is valid then the particle is considered to be at region 3 and the critical bed stress τ bcr computed by the shields criterion replace the yield stress τ c in the hbp model to calculate the apparent viscosity μ hbp through eq 15 otherwise the particle is considered to remain at region 1 or 2 and the critical shear stress τ y of the drucker prager model is used to calculate μ hbp by making τ c τ y in eq 15 the flowchart of fig 2 shows the procedure for calculating the apparent viscosity of particles at different regions finally the suspended sediment is identified by the concentration parameter cv defined by eq 32 and the viscosity is computed from eq 33 with this approach the mechanical properties of the bed material are considered by means of the cohesion and friction angle while the effect of the physical properties are introduced by the particle diameter and the density within the shields erosion criterion thus the model is able to reproduce the entrainment of the sediment by the fluid phase which is dominated by the physical properties of the sediment and the hydraulic characteristics of the flow as well as the behaviour of the subsurface layers of sediment determined by the mechanical properties of the material 2 6 dualsphysics implementation time integration and boundary conditions the computational model herein presented has been implemented in the dualsphysics code crespo et al 2015 an sph c cuda open source solver the previous implementation of fourtakas and rogers 2016 was used as the starting point to implement the shields criterion and combine it with the druker prager yield criterion the predictor corrector algorithm described by monaghan 1989 bound by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition of force viscosity and speed of sound is employed for the time step integration wall boundaries are modelled using the dynamic boundary condition dbc of crespo et al 2007 implemented in dualsphysics 3 numerical results this section presents numerical results first the implementation of the shields criterion is validated using a 2 d flushing experiment and comparing the final profile with the experimental result and with numerical results of manenti et al 2012 then a flume experiment carried out by the authors with non cohesive sediment bed under fluvial conditions is presented this experiment was intended to evaluate the influence of an empirical parameter of the shields formulation the equivalent grain roughness ks on the rate of erosion predicted by the shields criterion thus the flume experiment is simulated using only the shields criterion at the surface treating the non eroded particles as a fixed boundary finally the combined approached presented in section 2 5 4 is used to simulate a 2 d dam break problem over erodible bed the results are qualitatively compared to results obtained by the shield and drucker prager criterion separately 3 1 2 d flushing experiment the flushing experiment of falappi et al 2007 represents the scour of a sediment bed due to constant water discharge from a tank in a similar manner to what happens when a water reservoir gets flushed this is an ideal test case to assess the effectiveness of the shields criterion in applications where erosion occurs at the bed surface only in the absence of sediment yielding therefore the drucker prager criterion is not necessary which deems this test case suitable for validation of the shields criterion this experiment has been widely used as a benchmark case for erosion models in sph falappi et al 2007 manenti et al 2012 ulrich and rung 2010 the case is presented as numerical validation of the implementation of the shields criterion in dualsphysics the geometry and dimensions of the experiment are shown in fig 3 the bulk density of the sediment is ρ s 1750kg m3 the mean diameter d50 and the kinematic viscosity of the sediment are taken to be 0 1 mm and 0 75 m2 s respectively a constant water discharge of 0 0079 m3 s was imposed by setting the horizontal particle velocity to 0 658 m s at the outlet the parameters of the hbp model were set to n 1 and m 0 in order to reproduce the newtonian behaviour of the eroded sediment employed by manenti et al 2012 in order to avoid excessive creeping of the sediment bed non eroded particles are treated as a fixed boundary this is the main disadvantage of the use of the shields criterion at the surface and justifies the need to use other complementary yield criteria to model the rheology of the subsurface sediment domain in order to provide a fair comparison the parameters for the numerical model and the material properties were set in accordance with manenti et al 2012 to assess the effect of resolution three different particle spacing were tested dp 0 01 m dp 0 005 m and dp 0 003 m giving simulations with 20 249 79 480 and 314 871 particles respectively fig 4 shows the bed profiles obtained with dualsphysics at t 48 s for each resolution the profiles are plotted in fig 5 together with the experimental profiles and the one found numerically by manenti et al 2012 it is observed that the profile computed with dualsphysics is in close agreement with the experimental one at the upper part although a small divergence can be seen at the base of the slope for the coarser resolutions although a direct comparison with manenti et al 2012 might indicate that the proposed method is less accurate no convergence study was presented by manenti et al so the effect of particle size is unknown in that work however in this paper with particle refinement it is demonstrated that the dualsphysics result is in increasingly closer agreement with the experimental result indicating convergence 3 2 flume experiment to simulate steady flow over a mobile bed numerical simulations were compared with a flume experiment carried out at the facilities of the lutheran university of brazil ulbra campus palmas to an experimental flume mark hm 160 produced by gunt hamburg was adapted in order to place a 5 5 cm bed of non cohesive sediment the flume has a closed water circuit and a trap of sediment was added downstream the cross section of the channel is 86 300 mm and the side walls are made of tempered glass which allows clear observation of the experiments the schematic arrangement of the experiment is shown in fig 6 the water entered the flume by the inlet reservoir the gate was completely open at the beginning of the experiment the equipment provided a steady flow with a fixed discharge over a mobile bed the bed was built by sand pluviation technique chaney and mulilis 1978 the bed material was a sand of 0 4 mm of mean diameter with a density of 2710 kg m3 the grain size distribution curve is shown in fig 7 during the experiment the water discharge was kept to a constant value of 2 m3 h and water level measurements were taken at the positions identified as p1 p2 and p3 in fig 6 the time elapsed from the instant that the water entered the channel and the instant the wave front reached the end of the channel was 8 s the experiment was run for 10 s after the wave front reached the end of the flume thus the experiment was run for a total time of t 18 s the test was performed three times in order to check for repeatability in the numerical simulation an upstream reservoir filled with water particles was created the reservoir had an orifice of 2 cm height at the entrance of the flume x 0 a constant water discharge was imposed by setting the horizontal particle velocity to 0 22 m s at the water inlet x 0 which corresponds to the exit of the orifice of the tank as shown in fig 8 the imposed velocity was calibrated considering the width of the flume in order to obtain the mas flow rate of 2 m3 h the hbp parameters were set to n 1 and m 0 in order to mimic a newtonian behaviour of the eroded material a spatial convergence study in terms of the position of the wave front was conducted using the following initial particle spacings of dp 0 016 m 0 008 m 0 004 m and 0 002 m with the experimental results as the reference solution fig 9 a shows the position of the wave front at t 8 s for all particle resolutions evidently the finer particle resolutions of dp 0 004 m and 0 002 m reproduced the experimental result dashed line as shown in fig 9b which shows a spatial convergence of the model concerning the viscous formulation and its ability to capture the physics of the flow hence a minimum particle spacing of dp 0 004 m is needed thus the numerical case with a particle spacing of dp 0 004 m leading to 24 909 water particles and 7 188 sediment particles has been used for the same physical time as with the experimental setup of 18 s 10 s after the wave front reach the end of the flume a collector was added for retaining the particles downstream the flume as shown in fig 8 thus the mass of the eroded sediment per meter wide at the end of the simulation may be calculated as 34 m e d p d p ρ s n p where dp is the particle spacing ρ s is the sediment density and np is the number of particles sediment particles collected at the end of the simulation in order to verify the influence of the equivalent grain roughness ks on the results six different values were tested i e k s d 50 1 2 3 5 7 10 the shields criterion was applied at the surface layer of sediment sediment particles outside the surface layer were fixed to the domain by explicitly setting the velocity and acceleration to zero the mass of eroded material per meter wide is plotted in fig 10 the first three bars show the experimental results while the last six bars present the results obtained by the sph simulations at t 18 s which signifies the end of the experiment the numerical results show that the mass of eroded material increases with ks until the ratio k s d 50 7 this is in agreement with the results reported by manenti et al 2012 and suggests a rough flow for ks d 50 7 therefore the grain is located inside the turbulent layer for ks d 50 7 the hydraulic regime varies from transitional to smooth leading to a reduction of the eroded mass for smaller values of ks the ratio that better reproduced the experimental results was k s d 50 3 as shown by the horizontal dotted line in fig 8 however no experimental evidence has been found to support this behaviour since the experimental results show scattered data kamphuis 1974 millar 1999 sumer et al 1996 williams 1967 a future study may consider the influence of the shields parameter on ks experimental results suggest that for flat beds the values of ks increase with the critical shields parameter camenen et al 2009 sumer et al 1996 note that in this approach particles that do not reach the critical shields parameter remain fixed to the domain for that reason this approach is appropriate for problems in which only the surface layer of sediment is affected by the flux as in fluvial channels or when flushing sediment from artificial reservoirs 3 3 2 d dam break over erodible bed in order to show the ability of the combined approach presented in 2 5 4 to simulate the scouring and erosion caused by the impact of the water on a bed of sediment the louvain erosional dam break of fraccarollo and capart 2002 is simulated the experiment has been use as a benchmark for various researchers fourtakas and rogers 2016 ulrich et al 2013 and will be used herein to compare the behaviour of the computational model using the erosion criteria separately and to compare the combined approach to other sph simulations the experiment consists of the collapse of a water column over a loose sediment bed in a prismatic channel the bed was built with cylindrical pvc pellets with an equivalent spherical diameter of 3 5 mm and saturated density of 1270 kg m3 in order to calculate the value of the saturated density a volume fraction of 0 5 was assumed following the suggestions of fraccarollo and capart 2002 fig 11 shows the initial set up of the experiment the 2 d computational case was configured using a particle spacing of 0 002 m in order to compare with the same case reported in fourtakas and rogers 2016 leading to 25 000 water particles and 49 450 sediment particles three cases were run using different models for the sediment phase i e a drucker prager yield criterion and hbp rheological model for the eroded sediment b shields erosion criterion and newtonian model for the eroded sediment c drucker prager yield criterion combined with shields erosion criterion and hbp rheological model the mechanical properties of the soil for the drucker prager criterion case a were set to ϕ 310 and c 0 pa in order to reproduce a cohesion less material as expected from pvc pellets since the values are not given by fraccarollo and capart 2002 fig 12 shows the three cases at the same instant in time where the particles belonging to each phase are coloured blue for water and red for sediment in order to show the effect on the deformation of the cases a b and c the equivalent grain roughness ks for the shields criterion case b was set to 5 times the value of the mean diameter which is expected to represent a transitional flow condition for this case sediment particles are fixed to the domain unless they reach the erosion criterion see fig 12a otherwise the impact of the water column over the soil produces excessive deformation of the sediment mass even if high viscosities are used see fig 12b for the example shown in fig 12b an upper limit of μmax 2500 pa s following the suggestions of ulrich et al 2013 and ulrich and rung 2012 however manenti et al 2012 set the upper limit to viscosity to several orders of magnitude higher than this which suggests that the maximum value of the apparent viscosity is case dependent the combination of the criteria case c eliminates the need of fixing the particles to the domain position because the shear stress is computed at each sediment particle as a function of the mechanical soil properties avoiding the excessive creeping resulting from a fluid model see fig 12c the parameters of the hbp model used in cases a and b were set to n 1 2 and m 100 in order to represent a non newtonian shear thinning material and to avoid the numerical instabilities for zero shear strain rate figs 13 16 show the snapshots of the erosional 2 d dam break experiments at times 0 25 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 s the experimental snapshots were presented by fraccarollo and capart 2002 showing the estimated interfaces between the sediment bed the eroded material and the water numerical experiments show three sub domains blue particles represent the water phase red particles are the un yielded sediment and green particles denote the eroded material two features may be analysed from the erosion patterns of figs 13 16 the bed profile formed by the motionless particles and the transport layer formed by the moving sediment particles represented by red and green particles in the numerical snapshots respectively from the a snapshots in figs 13 15 it may be observed that the bed profiles generated by the drucker prager criterion are similar to the experimental profiles reproducing the curve formed by the impact of the water in the bed of sediment at position x 0 05 m however the model is not able to correctly simulate the transport layer this effect is better reproduced by the shields criterion represented by the b snapshots where green particles show a well defined layer of eroded sediment the combined approach presented in the c snapshots keeps the positive features of each criterion i e it captures the effect of the impact as well as the entrainment of the sediment particles by the fluid phase showing satisfactory qualitative agreement between the numerical model and experimental observations the plots of figs 17 and 18 confirm this behaviour for t 0 25 s and t 1 00 s the root mean square rms error was used to quantify the deviation of the sph interface location from the experimental interfaces accordingly the acronyms rmse zw rmse zs and rmse zb in fig 17 and fig 18 represent the rms error of the free surface zw the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and the interface between moving and immobile grains at the bed zb the transport layer is defined by the region between the zs and zb interfaces the current model shows closer agreement to the experimental data both for the bed surface zb interface and for the transport layer region between zb and zs interfaces comparing the profiles obtained by the shields criterion with the profiles obtained by the combined approach here presented at t 0 25 s the current model demonstrate greater capability of capturing the yielding effect caused by the impact of the wave at the initial states see the shape of the wave front in fig 17b and 17c the yielding near the dam toe is also well captured by the drucker prager model as observed in fig 17a for t 1 00 s the drucker prager yield criterion shows a tiny transport layer near the wave front while the shields criterion and the combined approach show reasonable agreement with the experimental data the current model shows the smallest rms error for the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and for the interface between moving and immobile grains zb this means that the scouring profile is satisfactory predicted by the current model the current model that combines the drucker prager and the shields criteria shows the smallest rms error for the interface between the water and the moving grains zs and for the interface between moving and immobile grains zb this allows to conclude that the scouring profile is satisfactory predicted by the current model 4 conclusions in this paper a novel approached that combines two erosion criteria with a non newtonian rheological model to simulate surface erosion is presented the drucker prager yield criterion was complemented by the shields erosion criterion in order to model the relevant features of the erosive process by considering the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the sediment bed the implementation of the shields criterion into the dualsphysics code has been validated using experimental and numerical results the analysis of the equivalent grain roughness parameter showed that it has a strong influence on the on the prediction of the amount of eroded material significantly different behaviour was observed when the erosion criteria were used separately to simulate a 2 d dam break experiment the drucker prager yield criterion was able to reproduce the effect of the impact of the water in the bed at the dam toe while the shields criterion showed better agreement on simulating the transport layer formed by the entrainment of the sediment particles by water at final stages satisfactory results are observed when both criteria are combined keeping the positive features of each criterion i e the shape of the scouring profile and transport layer the combined approach here proposed is able to simulate the yielding of the sediment layer by considering the mechanical properties of the material thus the rheology of the domain of sediment under the impact of rapidly varying flows is satisfactory predicted also the entrainment of soil by water is accurately simulated by including the physical properties of the sediment and the hydraulic characteristics of the flow through the shields criterion acknowledgements

806,several algorithms have been used for mass transfer between particles undergoing advective and macro dispersive random walks the mass transfer between particles is required for general reactions on and among particles the mass transfer is shown to be diffusive and may be simulated using implicit explicit or mixed methods all algorithms investigated are accurate to o δ t for n particles the implicit and semi implicit methods require inverse matrix solutions and o n 3 calculations the explicit methods use forward matrix solves and require only o n 2 calculations practically this means that naïve implementations with more than about 5000 particles run more reliably using explicit methods keywords particle methods diffusion reaction equation advection diffusion reaction equation numerical methods 1 introduction the random walk particle tracking rwpt method was originally developed to simulate advective and dispersive transport of conservative or simply linearly instantaneously reversible sorbing solutes labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 the method is attractive because it does not suffer from numerical dispersion or negative concentrations the method was extended benson and meerschaert 2008 to nonlinearly interacting bimolecular chemical reactions by sequentially calculating the product of the probabilities of particle collision and thermodynamic reaction the actual reactions were then performed using monte carlo methods and particles were born or killed by a comparison of reaction probability to randomly generated numbers the method was originally restricted to one or a series of bimolecular reactions benson et al 2017 bolster et al 2016 ding et al 2012 ding and benson 2015 ding et al 2017 paster et al 2013 2014 because any particle was composed of only one chemical species if the reaction is viewed as a mixing process which may be denoted 2 p a 2 q a p q a p q a then particles can carry as many species as desired and mass transfer of all species occurs between particles benson and bolster 2016 the mass transfer still only occurs between particles with some probability of collision and these probabilities may be viewed as the weights associated with mass transfer benson and bolster 2016 suggested that this collision weighted mass transfer process follows a diffusion equation although this was not shown rigorously furthermore those authors chose a particular explicit mass transfer scheme while later studies used an implicit scheme engdahl et al 2017 because both explicit and implicit schemes appear to work it is plausible that a combination of these similar to the crank nicolson c n algorithm may increase accuracy the purpose of this paper is to first develop a framework to investigate whether the action of the mass transfer algorithm proposed by benson and bolster 2016 is actually diffusive once this diffusive nature is shown the convergence rates of the several algorithms that immediately present themselves can be demonstrated 2 semi implicit scheme among a total of n particles located at positions xi the collision weighted mass exchange over a time step δt is written 1 m j k 1 m j k i 1 n 1 2 m i k ℓ m j k ℓ p x i x j δ t where the superscript denotes timestep i e m j k m j k δ t ℓ 0 1 and p i j p x i x j δ t is the probability of particle collision this collision probability is shown to depend only upon the distance between particles though it may have a more complicated form if non isotropic or position dependent diffusion dispersion paradigms are considered nonetheless while the functional form of p may change the mass transfer algorithm would be unaltered for particles undergoing brownian motion this is the convolution of each particle s gaussian location density which is also gaussian see benson and meerschaert 2008 paster et al 2014 if ℓ 1 the calculation is implicit and if ℓ 0 the calculation is explicit which may take several forms for example sequentially calculated or simultaneously calculated a semi implicit form is reminiscent of the crank nicolson scheme and uses equal amounts of k and k 1 masses so that we may write 1 as 2 m j k 1 m j k α i 1 n 1 2 m i k 1 m j k 1 p i j 1 α i 1 n 1 2 m i k m j k p i j which uses α 1 1 2 and 0 for implicit semi implicit and explicit formulations respectively now denote the masses as a vector i e m m 1 m n t and if one constructs a matrix of particle collision probabilities p with entries pij then 2 can be expressed as 3 i α 2 diag 1 p p m k 1 i 1 α 2 diag 1 p p m k where a diag x denotes a diagonal matrix a with the entries of vector x along the main diagonal and 1 is an 1 n vector of ones 3 explicit schemes clearly setting α 0 in 3 results in an explicit forward matrix calculation we call this matrix explicit all of the masses used to calculate the transfer magnitudes are from the beginning of the timestep another method sequentially calculates 2 for j 1 n after the j th particle is updated its new mass can be used on the right side of the equation for subsequent calculations if the sum is calculated using one fixed value for mj then we call this vector explicit calculated as followed employing pseudo code where denotes the entry wise or hadamard product 4 for j 1 n δ m 1 2 m t m j t p j m t δ t m t δ m m j t δ t m j t δ m end furthermore if the sum is expanded then each calculation may use an updated mj accounting for all previous terms in the sum we call this explicit sequential and it is calculated as follows 5 for i 1 n for j 1 n δ m 1 2 m i t m j t p i j m i t δ t m i t δ m m j t δ t m j t δ m end end this method has a computational advantage in that there is no matrix multiplication required just two loops over particle numbers and hence it can accommodate huge particle numbers it turns out that the vector explicit algorithm is unstable for all ranges of parameters tested here and will not be explored further 4 accuracy as a function of repeated operation in general the particle positions change due to non uniform and potentially unsteady mean velocity the particles are also typically given a random component to represent diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion therefore each simulation in an ensemble has subtle differences labolle et al 1996 this is one advantage of the method the evolving particle spacings controlled by the number of particles and masses represent the heterogeneity of concentrations as defined by evolving auto and cross correlation functions and the resulting mixing process benson et al 2017 bolster et al 2016 paster et al 2014 however in order to check accuracy and convergence in this paper we must artificially remove the randomness of simulations this is done by eliminating the random movements of particles and spacing them evenly on the interval 0 1 where the number of particles dictates the size of the constant spacing this also allows us to construct the classical eulerian implicit finite difference fd approximation of diffusion using a 3 point space stencil for comparison we stress that our particle collision method may not be the most efficient way to simulate diffusion on a fixed grid of points but the method will continue to work no matter how mixed up the particle positions become we track errors over time as functions of n δt t and total time kδt in all simulations we choose a diffusion coefficient d 10 3 l2 1 and a total simulation time of 10 s unless specified otherwise for an initial condition ic we choose a heaviside function to represent the most unmixed and error inducing possible state we also choose a gaussian ic to determine if errors remain more stable over time our measure of error between simulations and analytic solutions uses the root mean square error rmse rmse s a 1 n j 1 n s j a j 2 1 2 where sj and aj denote simulated and analytic solutions at spatial point j we also utilized the infinity norm max j s j a j which showed similar scaling and is not shown here for brevity to illustrate the motivation for this technical note for n 50 we see that all solutions appear diffusive by visual inspection of the plots of m x t 10 fig 1 a on the other hand considering the various solution methods after one time step here δ t 0 1 it is clear that the methods differ significantly in their one step approximation of diffusion to isolate error incurred by time discretization we first fix δ t 0 1 and vary the number of particles fig 2 the errors are similar for n 500 1000 and 5000 indicating that as long as a sufficient minimum number of particles is used increasing particle number does not appreciably decrease error in subsequent simulations we use n 1000 for consistency all methods achieve their greatest error at the beginning of the simulation due to the unmixed or infinite gradient ic repeated applications of the operators result in reduced error in other words repeated application of the matrix operations converges to a true diffusive operator this is discussed further in section 6 also evident on the plot is the relatively poor performance of both implicit and semi implicit particle methods relative to the explicit matrix particle method that tends to converge quickly to the accuracy of the eulerian finite difference solution to which we compare 5 accuracy as a function of δt for a given number of particles here n 1000 the overall errors of all methods decrease over repeated application however we note that the mass transfer algorithm investigated here is only one component of a particle tracking simulation that may involve other processes like diffusive random walks advective motion and chemical reaction if these other processes are included it may negate this property one might expect that similar to the crank nicolson time stencil in an fd implementation the semi implicit solutions would improve as δt decreases relative to the explicit and implicit methods but this is not the case all methods tested here have errors approximately proportional to δt fig 1 b to better understand the relation between error and δt we wish to find the power p such that e a rmse s a c δ t p o δ t p given the simulated and analytic solution vectors s and a and some constant c conducting a convergence analysis for a one second simulation and refining δt by successive halves we compute an experimental value of p the estimated order of convergence eoc such that eoc log e old log e new δ t old δ t new 1 2 log e old log e new for the heaviside ic case we see in table 1 demonstrated first order convergence in δt for all the discussed matrix methods a plot of these errors is shown in fig 3 a with a reference line showing δt as well we see in table 1 that the explicit sequential method suffers in accuracy for small δt and does not attain asymptotic convergence of o δ t this is visually depicted in fig 1 b for δ t 0 01 6 convergence to a diffusive process in an infinite 1 d domain the solution to the diffusion equation at time t is 6 m x t g m x t r g x x 0 t m x 0 0 d x 0 where g x t 4 π d t 1 2 exp x 2 4 d t is the green s function for the diffusion equation and denotes convolution for time discretized simulations this convolution operation may be applied to the initial condition k t δ t times using g x δt to generate m x t in a space discretized particle case where our initial condition is composed of n dirac deltas each with position xi and mass mi this may be denoted m t t d k m 0 where d n is an n fold matrix product d i j g x i x j δ t and d our diffusion operator is the result of normalizing the columns of d in order to preserve mass for suitable ic the diffusion operator is virtually error free as compared to the analytic solution and error can be driven to machine precision with a sufficient level of discretization sufficiently large n in the particle case however the green s function used to generate d assumes an infinite domain and as a result is highly sensitive to boundary effects as compared to the various mass transfer algorithms developed in section 2 that naturally handle any boundary conditions since there are no particles to interact with outside the boundary while none of the typical numerical approximations e g finite difference finite element are exactly diffusive in that their matrix operator is exactly equivalent to d it suffices

summary in this technical note we show that the inter particle mass transfer algorithm can be simulated in implicit semi implicit pseudo crank nicolson and several explicit methods all have error that

matrix inversion for the implicit and semi implicit methods of o n 2 operations additionally this computational cost can be lowered further if sparse linear algebra methods are employed because in practice co location probability is often considered to be zero for particles separated by distances greater than a few standard deviations of the diffusion process we also show that for an infinite domain a simple convolution with the diffusion kernel has low error and effort of o n 2 however this method suffers error if natural boundaries exist because the kernel changes shape especially near the boundaries for the sake of brevity only 1d results have been presented in this text however 2d results for an analogous mass transfer algorithm are discussed in schmidt et al 2018 this technical note has at least one important theoretical implication benson and bolster 2016 suggested that the reactive rwpt method when combined with this mass transfer method could partition the diffusion dispersion process in any way that the physics demand imagine two systems with total molecular diffusion plus hydrodynamic dispersion of d m o l d h 10 3 one system with d m o l 10 6 would have more mass transfer between nearby particles and greater overall reaction rates than a system with d m o l 10 9 even though the hydrodynamic dispersion d h 10 3 would spread the species in nearly exactly the same way in fact as dmol 0 a simulation would revert to unreactive conservative components so if the dispersion tensor is thought of as a combination of velocity contrasts that promote spreading but not mixing on top of smaller scale mixing processes then the reactive rwpt method can very simply and separately perform true mixing by mass transfer shown here and macro scale spreading via random walks in this way the reactive rwpt method is solving a different equation than any eulerian method those methods cannot distinguish between the various components of the dispersion tensor d to

plus smaller scale transverse dispersion truly represents a mixing process while the addition of longitudinal dispersion accounts for velocity variations hence a spreading process our method can

806,several algorithms have been used for mass transfer between particles undergoing advective and macro dispersive random walks the mass transfer between particles is required for general reactions on and among particles the mass transfer is shown to be diffusive and may be simulated using implicit explicit or mixed methods all algorithms investigated are accurate to o δ t for n particles the implicit and semi implicit methods require inverse matrix solutions and o n 3 calculations the explicit methods use forward matrix solves and require only o n 2 calculations practically this means that naïve implementations with more than about 5000 particles run more reliably using explicit methods keywords particle methods diffusion reaction equation advection diffusion reaction equation numerical methods 1 introduction the random walk particle tracking rwpt method was originally developed to simulate advective and dispersive transport of conservative or simply linearly instantaneously reversible sorbing solutes labolle et al 1996 salamon et al 2006 the method is attractive because it does not suffer from numerical dispersion or negative concentrations the method was extended benson and meerschaert 2008 to nonlinearly interacting bimolecular chemical reactions by sequentially calculating the product of the probabilities of particle collision and thermodynamic reaction the actual reactions were then performed using monte carlo methods and particles were born or killed by a comparison of reaction probability to randomly generated numbers the method was originally restricted to one or a series of bimolecular reactions benson et al 2017 bolster et al 2016 ding et al 2012 ding and benson 2015 ding et al 2017 paster et al 2013 2014 because any particle was composed of only one chemical species if the reaction is viewed as a mixing process which may be denoted 2 p a 2 q a p q a p q a then particles can carry as many species as desired and mass transfer of all species occurs between particles benson and bolster 2016 the mass transfer still only occurs between particles with some probability of collision and these probabilities may be viewed as the weights associated with mass transfer benson and bolster 2016 suggested that this collision weighted mass transfer process follows a diffusion equation although this was not shown rigorously furthermore those authors chose a particular explicit mass transfer scheme while later studies used an implicit scheme engdahl et al 2017 because both explicit and implicit schemes appear to work it is plausible that a combination of these similar to the crank nicolson c n algorithm may increase accuracy the purpose of this paper is to first develop a framework to investigate whether the action of the mass transfer algorithm proposed by benson and bolster 2016 is actually diffusive once this diffusive nature is shown the convergence rates of the several algorithms that immediately present themselves can be demonstrated 2 semi implicit scheme among a total of n particles located at positions xi the collision weighted mass exchange over a time step δt is written 1 m j k 1 m j k i 1 n 1 2 m i k ℓ m j k ℓ p x i x j δ t where the superscript denotes timestep i e m j k m j k δ t ℓ 0 1 and p i j p x i x j δ t is the probability of particle collision this collision probability is shown to depend only upon the distance between particles though it may have a more complicated form if non isotropic or position dependent diffusion dispersion paradigms are considered nonetheless while the functional form of p may change the mass transfer algorithm would be unaltered for particles undergoing brownian motion this is the convolution of each particle s gaussian location density which is also gaussian see benson and meerschaert 2008 paster et al 2014 if ℓ 1 the calculation is implicit and if ℓ 0 the calculation is explicit which may take several forms for example sequentially calculated or simultaneously calculated a semi implicit form is reminiscent of the crank nicolson scheme and uses equal amounts of k and k 1 masses so that we may write 1 as 2 m j k 1 m j k α i 1 n 1 2 m i k 1 m j k 1 p i j 1 α i 1 n 1 2 m i k m j k p i j which uses α 1 1 2 and 0 for implicit semi implicit and explicit formulations respectively now denote the masses as a vector i e m m 1 m n t and if one constructs a matrix of particle collision probabilities p with entries pij then 2 can be expressed as 3 i α 2 diag 1 p p m k 1 i 1 α 2 diag 1 p p m k where a diag x denotes a diagonal matrix a with the entries of vector x along the main diagonal and 1 is an 1 n vector of ones 3 explicit schemes clearly setting α 0 in 3 results in an explicit forward matrix calculation we call this matrix explicit all of the masses used to calculate the transfer magnitudes are from the beginning of the timestep another method sequentially calculates 2 for j 1 n after the j th particle is updated its new mass can be used on the right side of the equation for subsequent calculations if the sum is calculated using one fixed value for mj then we call this vector explicit calculated as followed employing pseudo code where denotes the entry wise or hadamard product 4 for j 1 n δ m 1 2 m t m j t p j m t δ t m t δ m m j t δ t m j t δ m end furthermore if the sum is expanded then each calculation may use an updated mj accounting for all previous terms in the sum we call this explicit sequential and it is calculated as follows 5 for i 1 n for j 1 n δ m 1 2 m i t m j t p i j m i t δ t m i t δ m m j t δ t m j t δ m end end this method has a computational advantage in that there is no matrix multiplication required just two loops over particle numbers and hence it can accommodate huge particle numbers it turns out that the vector explicit algorithm is unstable for all ranges of parameters tested here and will not be explored further 4 accuracy as a function of repeated operation in general the particle positions change due to non uniform and potentially unsteady mean velocity the particles are also typically given a random component to represent diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion therefore each simulation in an ensemble has subtle differences labolle et al 1996 this is one advantage of the method the evolving particle spacings controlled by the number of particles and masses represent the heterogeneity of concentrations as defined by evolving auto and cross correlation functions and the resulting mixing process benson et al 2017 bolster et al 2016 paster et al 2014 however in order to check accuracy and convergence in this paper we must artificially remove the randomness of simulations this is done by eliminating the random movements of particles and spacing them evenly on the interval 0 1 where the number of particles dictates the size of the constant spacing this also allows us to construct the classical eulerian implicit finite difference fd approximation of diffusion using a 3 point space stencil for comparison we stress that our particle collision method may not be the most efficient way to simulate diffusion on a fixed grid of points but the method will continue to work no matter how mixed up the particle positions become we track errors over time as functions of n δt t and total time kδt in all simulations we choose a diffusion coefficient d 10 3 l2 1 and a total simulation time of 10 s unless specified otherwise for an initial condition ic we choose a heaviside function to represent the most unmixed and error inducing possible state we also choose a gaussian ic to determine if errors remain more stable over time our measure of error between simulations and analytic solutions uses the root mean square error rmse rmse s a 1 n j 1 n s j a j 2 1 2 where sj and aj denote simulated and analytic solutions at spatial point j we also utilized the infinity norm max j s j a j which showed similar scaling and is not shown here for brevity to illustrate the motivation for this technical note for n 50 we see that all solutions appear diffusive by visual inspection of the plots of m x t 10 fig 1 a on the other hand considering the various solution methods after one time step here δ t 0 1 it is clear that the methods differ significantly in their one step approximation of diffusion to isolate error incurred by time discretization we first fix δ t 0 1 and vary the number of particles fig 2 the errors are similar for n 500 1000 and 5000 indicating that as long as a sufficient minimum number of particles is used increasing particle number does not appreciably decrease error in subsequent simulations we use n 1000 for consistency all methods achieve their greatest error at the beginning of the simulation due to the unmixed or infinite gradient ic repeated applications of the operators result in reduced error in other words repeated application of the matrix operations converges to a true diffusive operator this is discussed further in section 6 also evident on the plot is the relatively poor performance of both implicit and semi implicit particle methods relative to the explicit matrix particle method that tends to converge quickly to the accuracy of the eulerian finite difference solution to which we compare 5 accuracy as a function of δt for a given number of particles here n 1000 the overall errors of all methods decrease over repeated application however we note that the mass transfer algorithm investigated here is only one component of a particle tracking simulation that may involve other processes like diffusive random walks advective motion and chemical reaction if these other processes are included it may negate this property one might expect that similar to the crank nicolson time stencil in an fd implementation the semi implicit solutions would improve as δt decreases relative to the explicit and implicit methods but this is not the case all methods tested here have errors approximately proportional to δt fig 1 b to better understand the relation between error and δt we wish to find the power p such that e a rmse s a c δ t p o δ t p given the simulated and analytic solution vectors s and a and some constant c conducting a convergence analysis for a one second simulation and refining δt by successive halves we compute an experimental value of p the estimated order of convergence eoc such that eoc log e old log e new δ t old δ t new 1 2 log e old log e new for the heaviside ic case we see in table 1 demonstrated first order convergence in δt for all the discussed matrix methods a plot of these errors is shown in fig 3 a with a reference line showing δt as well we see in table 1 that the explicit sequential method suffers in accuracy for small δt and does not attain asymptotic convergence of o δ t this is visually depicted in fig 1 b for δ t 0 01 6 convergence to a diffusive process in an infinite 1 d domain the solution to the diffusion equation at time t is 6 m x t g m x t r g x x 0 t m x 0 0 d x 0 where g x t 4 π d t 1 2 exp x 2 4 d t is the green s function for the diffusion equation and denotes convolution for time discretized simulations this convolution operation may be applied to the initial condition k t δ t times using g x δt to generate m x t in a space discretized particle case where our initial condition is composed of n dirac deltas each with position xi and mass mi this may be denoted m t t d k m 0 where d n is an n fold matrix product d i j g x i x j δ t and d our diffusion operator is the result of normalizing the columns of d in order to preserve mass for suitable ic the diffusion operator is virtually error free as compared to the analytic solution and error can be driven to machine precision with a sufficient level of discretization sufficiently large n in the particle case however the green s function used to generate d assumes an infinite domain and as a result is highly sensitive to boundary effects as compared to the various mass transfer algorithms developed in section 2 that naturally handle any boundary conditions since there are no particles to interact with outside the boundary while none of the typical numerical approximations e g finite difference finite element are exactly diffusive in that their matrix operator is exactly equivalent to d it suffices to show that after k applications of their matrix operator to m 0 the differences in m t are small in other words if some process m t a k m 0 is diffusive then repeated applications have e d rmse a k

all matrix algorithms are consistently o δ t additionally in order to avoid undesirable boundary effects experienced by the diffusion operator a domain centered gaussian ic was used in favor of the heaviside ic employed previously a plot of the initial condition and final solutions for the explicit matrix and diffusion operator algorithms is shown in fig 3 b for δ t 0 5 and one second of

interior boundary conditions at junctions of larger angles and or with substantial lateral inflows moreover the enclosed numerical investigations may enhance the understanding of the primary mechanisms contributing to hydraulic structure induced turbulent flow behavior and increased hydraulic resistance keywords computational fluid dynamics nonlinear mathematical models energy loss hydraulic resistance open channel junctions turbulence 1 introduction open channel junction flows are widely occurring in natural waterways as well as in irrigation channels and drainage networks the mixing processes and turbulent flow structures in the vicinity of confluences play an important role in the understanding and prediction of pollutant dispersal in rivers and morphological feedback ashmore et al 1992 bennett and best 1995 best and roy 1991 biron et al 1996a 1996b boyer et al 2006 de serres et al 1999 rhoads 1996 combining flow in open channel junctions is a function of many factors such as the contribution of lateral momentum channel layout geometry i e the junction angles of lateral with respect to centerline of main channel upstream tributaries to post confluence channel width ratios cross sectional shape etc tailwater froude number and flow resistance from the boundaries hsu et al 1998a 1998b ramamurthy et al 1988 taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 earlier experimental studies utilized dye tests to examine the mean flow pattern in simple junction configurations which generally consisted of prismatic channels of equal widths and flat smooth beds taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 more recent laboratory studies were primarily focused on the characterization of separation zone secondary flow pattern and mixing layer best and roy 1991 best 1987 biron et al 1996a 1996b hsu et al 1998a kenworthy and rhoads 1995 kumar gurram et al 1997 mosley 1976 rhoads 1996 weber et al 2001 yuan et al 2016 regardless the specific channel geometry and boundary conditions the major hydrodynamics that govern the open channel junction flow may be generalized using a simple geometry as shown in fig 1 a the inflows merge and the post confluence flow is constricted to a flow area less than that of the tailwater and always accompanied with a sink in the water surface the resultant contraction reduces the channel capacity and produces substantial turbulence within the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz which is defined as the region adjacent to a stream confluences and affected by hydrodynamic interaction between the merging flows kenworthy and rhoads 1995 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 a water surface rise is observed upstream of the junction as a result of the mutual obstruction effects of the main and branch channel flows another distinguishing feature is the appearance of a three dimensional shear plane shewed into a extent subject to the differences in flow velocities of the branch and main channel flows the entry of lateral inflow sets up helicoidal flow opposite to the deflection and a bottom upwelling current and also induces a secondary circulation rotating against the lateral inflow the secondary flow further results in a zone of intense turbulence close to the exit of junction where the flow may separate from the bed and with a zone of negative dynamic pressure forming in part of the flow turbulent mixing and contraction favors the exchange and equalization of momentum between moving body of fluid at different velocities as it meets another however accompanied by increased energy loss and hydraulic resistance thus a systematic analysis of this junction induced hydraulic resistance and flow contraction is important when designing drainage network to reduce the risks of flooding and overflows ramamurthy et al 1994 conventional 1d numerical modeling treats the junctions by means of internal boundary conditions for the shallow water equations by applying mass continuity combined with a simplified momentum or energy conservation at the junctions hsu et al 1998a kumar gurram et al 1997 mays 2001 ramamurthy et al 1988 taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 yen 1986 however such a boundary condition cannot be evaluated adequately due to the aforementioned highly 3d turbulent flow features at the chz recently shabayek et al 2002 developed a nonlinear dynamic junction flow model by constructing two control volumes along the interfacial shear layer this model parameterizes all the physical processes that are significant enough to be included in the channel reaches of network modeling without previous assumptions of equal upstream flow depths and free boundary friction however its accuracy is still subject to the empirical formulation of interfacial and separation shear forces which were developed from existing experimental results this method has yet to be applied to systematically analyze the junction induced increased hydraulic resistance and energy losses more recently ghostine et al 2010 studied combining flow at open channel junctions by solving the 2d depth averaged shallow water equations using an unstructured computational mesh ghostine et al 2012 also presented comparison with the 1d dynamic model proposed by shabayek et al 2002 and demonstrated that 2d tends to outperform the 1d approach as junction angles and downstream froude number increases nevertheless the underlying assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution and empirical treatment of dispersion terms resulting from the non uniformities of flow velocity still limits the accuracy of such 2d models in cases with adverse pressure gradient e g separation zone and strong secondary flows such as fluid flows through a river bend or channel junctions bates et al 2005 the uncertainties of 2d models also stem from the evaluation of bed shear stresses primarily due to turbulent flow interactions and the calibration of key parameters such as manning s n subject to flow conditions lane et al 1999 a 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd model solves the full 3d form of the navier stokes equations with reynolds averaging rans or without temporal averaging direct numerical simulation dns hence is capable of adequately reproducing the evolving primary and secondary flow patterns and turbulent flow structures the development of computing power facilitates the application of cfd models to open channel confluence problems however faces a number of challenges as i a non hydrostatic three dimensional solver combined with an appropriate turbulent closure for the estimation of reynold stresses is required to accurately predict the turbulent flow characteristics and separation zone ii a grid independent solution is somewhat difficult to achieve or illustrate hardy et al 1999 ma et al 2002 iii an appropriate technique is required to capture and locate the free surface evolution over space and time and iv limited reliable field or laboratory three dimensional high resolution datasets for confluences with different spatial and temporal boundary conditions are available to validate cfd models regardless of the aforementioned challenges once a 3d model is validated numerical experiments can be designed and conducted for a systematic examination of the standalone effects of different primary controls upon the development of flow structures existing 3d numerical studies on junction flows bradbrook et al 2000 huang et al 2002 shakibainia et al 2010 provided insight to flow characteristics of open channel confluences however a comprehensive quantitative study on the junction induced flow structure alteration and energy loss has yet to be performed the goal of this study is to present the numerical investigations conducted utilizing fully 3d cfd codes to a visualize the changing junction flow hydrodynamics in response to different controls and provide a physically based interpretation b examine variation of secondary flow pattern and intensity and size of separation zone to quantify the relative importance of the major mechanisms responsible for energy loss c compare junction hydraulics predicted by the modified 1d dynamic model and the 3d numerical model to assess the valid range of the 1d assumptions moreover high resolution cfd results allow analysis of the 3d flow structures effects on global parameters and processes that are relevant for the 1d modeling such as 1 the correction coefficients for flow velocity distribution 2 the maximum contraction in the post confluence flow and 3 the energy loss through the junction structure 2 1d dynamic model the adopted 1d mathematical formulation of the problem is the state of the art dynamic model introduced by shabayek et al 2002 ghostine et al 2012 showed that this model is the most accurate model among the existing 1d junction models 2 1 assumptions the underlying assumptions include 1 the flow is considered unidirectional in each channel and only the longitudinal variation is considered 2 the streamline curvature and vertical acceleration are neglected 3 the flow remains fully turbulent and subcritical throughout the combining channels 4 the temporal and volume storage of the junction with flat beds is negligible and 5 hydrostatic pressure distribution is assumed on the entire domain and uniform velocity is assumed at the inlet and outlet of the control volumes 2 2 mathematical formulation the model was developed by applying the momentum principle in the main channel stream wise direction x axis to the two control volumes cv in main c v 1 and lateral channel c v 2 respectively as shown in fig 1 b together with overall mass continuity fig 1 b illustrates the junction layout where the lengths of both the control volumes l 1

friction force by the rigid wall boundaries and f s shear force on the lateral channel control volume due to the separation zone forming downstream of the lateral channel entrance the detailed mathematical formulation of these forces can be referred to shabayek et al 2002 the model provides a framework in a 1d sense to account for all the important physics involved in the combining process by manipulating the formulation of the resultant forces in the present study one modification is adopted to advance the model by updating the formulation of separation shear force fs as flow separation is considered as one of the primary mechanisms contributing to energy losses which will be analyzed further in the following sections shabayek et al 2002 adopted the theory proposed by best 1987 that the width of separation zone is proportional to the square root of discharge ratio ξ q 2 q 3 and the shape index in terms of separation width length ratio bs ls remains constant more recent experimental work of kumar gurram et al 1997 suggested that the dimensions of the separation zone are not only a function of discharge ratio ξ and junction angle δ but also vary with downstream froude

tensor form as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i x j u i u j where p pressure ui mean velocity in the xi direction i 1 2 3 and ui is the corresponding fluctuating components reynolds averaging results in the appearance of additional terms u i u j in the momentum equations known as the turbulent reynolds stresses these represent the transport of momentum by turbulence which can never be zero in turbulent flow to represent the effects of turbulence upon the time averaged flow properties and close eq 6 the shear stress transport sst k ω model eq b 1 b 5 combined with the boussinesq assumption eq b 6 is adopted sst k ω model was originally developed by menter 1994 and it combines the robust and accurate formulation of the k ω model in the near wall region with the efficiency of k ϵ model in the free stream luo 2017 demonstrated that sst k ω yields similar secondary flow patterns as predicted by both re normalization group rng k ϵ and anisotropic reynolds stress model rsm however resembles with rsm in terms of the near wall velocity gradient the intensity of reverse flow and the size of separation zone the water surface at open channel junctions is subject to substantial spatial variation throughout the tributaries even for steady flows in the present study the volume of fluid vof method is adopted to track the moving water surface and to resolve the non hydrostatic components of the open channel flow the air water interface is calculated using a transport equation for the volume fraction of water 7 a w t a w u i x i 0 where aw is the volume fraction of water also the volume fractions of water and air aa should satisfy continuity 8 a w a a 1 which implies that for the volume fraction of the water three different cases are possible 1 aw 1 0 for which the cell is occupied by water 2 aw 0 0 for which the cell is occupied by air and 3 0 aw 1 0 for which the cell is located in the infinitesimal region where the free surface is defined more details of the implementation of the vof can be found in ansys inc 2016 for the solution of the time depended elliptic partial differential equations both spatial and temporal boundary conditions are required 1 at the inlet boundaries the mean velocity vector and turbulence parameters in terms of turbulence intensity are specified the velocity distribution at the upstream boundary are specified as predefined flow rates with an initial estimation of water surface 2 at the outlet boundary a pressure outlet boundary condition is implemented within which a hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity are specified in addition to the water surface 3 the walls are treated as impermeable walls the standard wall function and the no slip boundary condition have been employed a second order upwind scheme was adopted both for the momentum and turbulence transport equations for the transient simulations a second order implicit marching scheme was selected to allow the use of greater time steps while avoiding numerical instability and diffusivity finally the pressure velocity coupling was achieved by the pressure implicit splitting of operator piso algorithm issa 1986 3 2 computational domain the sharp edged 90 smooth combining flow flume fig 2 a data collected by weber et al 2001 was utilized to validate the numerical model the flume consisted of equal width channels i e b 1 b 2 b 3 w a four block hexahedral grid fig 2 b was constructed to capture the complex flow behavior happens within and near the 90 junction finer grids were imposed on the region close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected the computational domain was carefully chosen to impose the inflow and outflow boundary conditions and to allow the variation of water surface the upstream of main channel is 6 55 m long consisted of 80 50 25 grid cells the lateral channel is 5 59 m long consisted of 50 80 25 grid cells the downstream channel is 15 57 m long consisted of 120 50 25 grid cells the current grid selection is based on an grid independent study included in luo 2017 the steady state results were extracted when the system reached equilibrium state for both the mean flow and turbulence quantities at the monitored sections i e x 2 w 3 w 5 w and the outlet 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 numerical model validation the cartesian coordinates x y z are normalized by a length scale w resulted in a non dimensional system of coordinates x y and z all velocities are normalized by the downstream area average velocity u 0 the turbulent kinetic energy tke is normalized by u 0 2 as a general clarification the superscript indicates the normalized variable the simulation results for two distinct discharge ratios ξ q 2 q 3 0 25 and 0 75 were selected to evaluate the performance of the developed 3d numerical model to facilitate the 2d comparison of the velocity components and the tke both the vertical sampled measurements and numerical results were interpolated into uniform grid cells by triangulation based linear interpolation a point to point comparison was conducted at each cell center of three cross sections that are located at x 2 3 5 fig 3 a d show that a good agreement between the experimental and the numerical results was achieved concerning the primary flow u secondary flow v w turbulent kinetic energy k and water surface figs 3 also reveals that larger errors of all predicted quantities occur in the immediate vicinity of junction where the flow is characterized by high non uniformity strong secondary circulation and flow separation fig 3 a shows a single core of high velocity near the outer wall in the post confluence channel at each cross section higher local errors in the primary flow occur in the lateral separation zone which extends up to water surface as turbulence in separation zone is highly anisotropic due to its three dimensional characteristics fig 3 c errors may be introduced by the use of an isotropic turbulence model fig 3 b demonstrates that the secondary flow patterns are similar to the experimental measurements by weber et al 2001 and those identified by rhoads 1996 and bradbrook et al 2000 at the cross section x 2 the model shows divergent flow at the bed and converging flow close to inner junction corner further downstream at x 3 two counter rotating helical cells characterize the secondary circulation pattern with a stronger clockwise cell formed in the corner of inner bank and channel bed and a weaker but broader counter clockwise rotation centered at the outer near bed region the clockwise rotating flow is also evident in the experimental measurements in the vicinity of the junction until x 5 however due to the lack of measurements near the inner bank no closed counterclockwise circulation was identified experimentally the spatial pattern of turbulent kinetic energy fig 3 c agrees with that of the secondary flow with a high turbulence core initiates from the surface on the inner bank of the channel and moves towards to the bed for confluences with moderate momentum ratios as the one illustrated here the secondary vortices are mainly caused by the planform curvature and bed shear driven turbulence hence the stronger secondary flows are typically located near bed at the inner corner of the channel fig 3 d illustrates the good performance of vof at predicting the varying longitudinal water surface profiles across the stream due to the entry of different amount of lateral inflow three major features appear to characterize water profiles 1 an increase of water depth upstream 2 a depression at the postconfluence water surface in the vicinity of junction downstream 3 a regrowth of the water surface beyond the vena contracta but never exceeds the upstream levels the maximum drawdown happens between the section from x 1 to x 2 for ξ 0 25 while for ξ 0 75 the maximum happens further away between x 2 to x 3 the higher momentum ratio ξ appears to result in higher water surface rise in the upstream tributary and larger depression downstream of the junction which will be analyzed further in the following sections 3 4 influence of junction angles and discharge ratios on 3d flow structures to distinguish from previous numerical investigations which were primarily focused on qualitatively describing the time averaged flow field and the agreement of numerical predictions with specific experimental setup the present work aims at a comprehensive quantitative study on the variation of chz under the primary controls that are feasible to parameterize and or quantify previous research identified two primary groups that govern the hydrodynamics of open channel junction flows the planform curvature characterized by junction angles and the momentum ratios of inflows characterized by discharge ratios in this study the channels remain equal width with smooth and flat bed to exclude any topographic steering and boundary friction effects which are site specific and were qualitatively investigated by others best 1988 biron et al 1996a 1996b the present numerical experiments set junction angle and discharge ratio as controlling variables while keeping the other parameters as constants to isolate any interactive or combined effects in particular four junction angles were considered according to their occurrences in engineering design δ 30 45 60 and 90 with six discharge ratios ξ 0 083 0 25 0 417 0 583 0 75 and 0 917 3 4 1 streamline curvature due to asymmetry of the planform curvature as shown in fig 4 a the streamline deflects towards the inner bank as the flow aligns with the post confluence channel this planform asymmetry increases with δ thus results in higher centrifugal acceleration fig 4 b on the outer bank and a zone of reverse flow that forms near the inner bank as δ increases at given δ the magnitude of the reverse flow and lateral dimension of this zone increases with ξ as the centrifugal acceleration increases with the junction angles greater transverse gradient of u is observed for larger δ as ξ decreases the streamwise u isovels almost coincide with the contours of velocity magnitude u m a g u 2 v 2 w 2 as the decreased discharge ratio pare the effect of streamline curvature on secondary circulation the detailed solution of the three dimensional velocity components facilitated the mapping of the deflection angle θ which is defined as 9 θ tan 1 v u the deflection zone can be identified using the contours of θ as shown in fig 5 as the combination of δ and ξ determines the amount of lateral momentum entering the confluence increasing values of the two controlling parameters lead to a larger entrance angle i e larger θ adjacent to the downstream corner of the junction however the deflection zone is confined to the vicinity of junction and was observed not exceeding 2w upstream and downstream of the junction the y axis is pointing at the outer bank of the junction thus the negative values of deflections angles further downstream indicate the inflection of streamline towards the inner bank 3 4 2 secondary circulation fig 5 also illustrates that δ control the cross stream distribution of u v vectors for example at small junction angles e g δ 30 the lateral momentum has minor effect on the resolved post confluence flow direction thus weak secondary circulation is generated even if ξ is large as shown in fig 6 a and b as the length of longitudinal vortex increases with ξ and δ no helical cell can be distinguished for 30 at x 2 interestingly the secondary flow pattern is dominated by the single cell structure for 45 and 60 with higher momentum ratios weak irregular vortices were observed near the outer bank and shift to the inner bank as ξ decreases as seen earlier in fig 3 b the counter rotating helical cell forms at x 3 for ξ 0 25 when δ 90 however is absent from x 2 fig 6 g as ξ increases the counter rotating helical cell structure appears as shown in fig 6 h the reason may reside in the higher momentum of the main channel smaller ξ migrate the helical cell further downstream of the junction however the dual cells will be replaced by the single cell further downstream and diminishes eventually similarly fig 7 a shows that the vertical component w is small regardless of discharge ratios which confirms the earlier statement that secondary circulation is weak in general for junctions of small angles i e δ 30 given δ 30 the velocity profiles are almost identical for the two groups of scenarios with ξ 0 25 0 75 and ξ 0 083 0 917 when the flow travels beyond x 2 this interesting behavior of asymmetrical junction of small δ stems from its similarity with the symmetrical confluence where a symmetrical flow characteristic is expected about ξ 0 5 due to the similar intensity of shear driven turbulence and secondary circulation at ξ 0 5 minor interfacial shear is generated due to minimum momentum difference between the upstream two tributaries thus minor flow separation and contraction is generated downstream which results in lower flow acceleration and more uniform velocity distribution for junctions with δ 45 larger flow acceleration is observed in the vicinity of the junction due to the enhanced flow separation and contraction fig 4 b and fig 7 b in addition as ξ increases the intensity of secondary circulation increases which alters the direction of velocity vectors more downwelling secondary velocity components deflect the velocity vector towards the bed in the post confluence vicinity and the vertical component increases its magnitude and the area of influence as the discharge ratio increases fig 7 b clearly shows that as the secondary circulation increases the momentum transport caused by secondary flow results in the velocity dip phenomena as ξ increases the location of maximum velocity in the post confluence channel migrates below the water surface and moves towards the channel bed which results in an adverse velocity gradient towards the water surface and greater bed shear stress thus for larger ξ the merging flow travels further downstream to recover to uniform velocity distribution 3 4 3 water surface and separation zone apparently for a given junction angle δ 90 the increased lateral momentum larger ξ leads to larger water surface depression and super elevation which further contributes to larger longitudinal and transverse pressure gradient in the downstream vicinity of junction fig 8 this depression zone can extend from the exit of the junction i e x 1 to x 4 accordingly with increasing lateral inflows the water surface then redevelops and stabilizes rapidly when the flow travels beyond x 4 due to the flow contraction and acceleration the water surface in the upstream channels is generally higher than the recovered tail water surface and increases with respect to discharge ratios up to ξ 0 75 the interaction between the main and lateral water bodies lead to an increase of the water depth upstream of the junction which further decelerates the flow and converts the kinetic energy to potential energy a transverse gradient of the water surface forms with higher water depth near the outer wall the different degree of resultant traverse pressure gradient drives the production and transformation of the secondary helical cell motion as shown earlier in fig 6 g and h the momentum and entrance angle of the lateral inflow force the flow to detach from the inner bank downstream of the junction and to form a 3d separation zone of low pressure and recirculating flow best and reid 1984 see fig 1 a two widely accepted alternatives to define separation zone are presented in appendix b 2 in the present study the streamwise isovel of u 0 is used to determine the border of the separation zone accordingly fig 4 b shows that the width bs and length ls of the separation zone increase with respect to δ and ξ which further lead to a larger transverse pressure gradient and flow contraction this enlarged flow contraction may enhance the downstream convection of vorticity due to flow acceleration with increasing ξ more lateral flow momentum needs to be converted into the post confluence channel direction thus more energy loss is expected associated with larger flow diversion fig 5 and separation fig 4 b fig 6 also illustrates that the vertical separation zone increases its lateral width bs with respect to the water depth as a result at the section of x 2 a vertical separation zone cannot be identified graphically for 30 junction fig 6 a and b which is consistent with fig 4 b that shows a separation zone with a relative small length ls w for ξ 0 75 near the water surface the same cause applies to the absence of separation zone at x 2 for the case of 45 with discharge ratio ξ 0 25 fig 6 c these observations affirm that separation zone is a 3d feature with bs varies both vertically and longitudinally 4 comparative 1d and 3d analysis of open channel junction hydraulics the preceding analysis demonstrates the goodness of adopted 3d cfd model at capturing the variation of hydrodynamics at chz under different controls thus the 3d numerical results were used as the reference values in the following to assess the potential of the modified 1d dynamic junction model at predicting the water depths at the upstream boundary and the resultant energy losses 4 1 upstream water depth fig 9 shows a general good agreement between the 1d and 3d numerical model results for junction angles up to 60 with the maximum root mean square error rmse for both tributaries not exceeding 0 015 it appears that the 1d model slightly underestimates η 1 and overestimates η 2 as δ approaches 90 thus the applied 1d dynamic model is capable of predicting the upstream depths accurately by considering all the aforementioned mechanisms that contribute to the increased hydraulic resistance in addition the 3d numerical results may facilitate the calibration of the key parameters i e k and k to further improve the accuracy of the 1d model at 90 for which the effects of turbulent mixing and secondary circulation are maximized fig 9 also imply the stagnation or blockage upstream increases with the δ and ξ hence more kinetic energy was converted to potential energy to be noted regardless the fact that for the examined cases smooth lab flume and moderate downstream froude number the stage increase does not exceed 15 and the standalone effect might be considered insignificant the accumulated effect is not negligible in large networks the 1d model simulations show a parabola like shape symmetric about ξ 0 5 for the relations between upstream water depths and tailwater depth as a function of discharge ratios for junction angle δ 60 the symmetry of these curves decreases as δ increases when δ 90 the relations change to a monotonically increasing function of ξ and these results are confirmed by the 3d simulations fig 9 4 2 energy loss the energy head or specific energy is defined by chow 1959 as 10 h y z α v 2 2 g where y flow depth z bed elevation v cross sectional average velocity and α is the energy flux correction factor the one dimensional open channel flow analysis is carried out under two basic assumptions 1 the energy correction factor α remains constant and 2 the hydraulic gradient s e d h d x may be evaluated by manning s chezy s and darcy weisbach formula however these conventional one dimensional assumptions are only valid for gradually varied flow with unidirectional primary flow with the presence of significant lateral inflows non uniformity of flow field and energy loss are enhanced by turbulent mixing thus both α and se should be subject to change with respect to junction hydraulics in the present study the total energy loss at a junction is evaluated in a global sense hsu et al 1998a 1998b lin and soong 1979 as the difference between the entry and exit energies per unit time as follows 11 δ e 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 e i q i h i q i y i z i α i v 2 2 g i 1 2 3 an important measure of the energy loss termed as energy loss coefficient can be derived as a function of dimensionless parameters of ξ wi ηi where i 1 2 and f 3 as 12 k e δ e e 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 1 1 ξ 2 η 1 f 3 2 1 ξ 2 w 1 2 η 1 2 ξ 2 η 2 f 3 2 ξ 2 w 2 2 η 2 2 2 f 3 2 1 eq 12 is equivalent to the formulas derived by hsu et al 1998a and webber and greated 1966 for constant width open channels w 1 w 2 1 and under the assumption of equal upstream water depth η 1 η 2 thus energy loss depends on the planform geometry i e w 1 w 2 and δ the momentum ratio between the two branches i e ξ eq 12 also accounts for both boundary friction and turbulent mixing loss implicitly through the solution of η 1 and η 2 fig 10 shows that ke estimated using 3d numerical results agree better than the 1d dynamical model with the experimental data by weber et al 2001 though there is still an underestimation for the cases with discharge ratios close to 0 5 the evident disagreement between the 1d and 3d predictions at 90 junction implies even with the state of the art formulation of all important physics the secondary circulation and turbulent mixing effect are too complicated to be account for adequately in a 1d manner with the better knowledge of hydrodynamics provided by 3d cfd simulations a correction factor can be established for larger junction angles δ 60 90 as summarized in table c 2 to improve the prediction of 1d dynamic models similar pattern of 3d and 1d estimations indicates that junction loss increases with respect to ξ and the slope ke ξ increases as δ increases for δ 45 for smaller junction angles δ 45 ke is almost indifferent to the variation of ξ and scatters around 0 02 the symmetry of hydraulic behavior about ξ also leads to a symmetrical relation between energy loss and discharge ratio also for any given ξ the larger δ values associated with increased junction asymmetry result in larger energy losses due to the more intense turbulent mixing secondary circulation and larger flow separation on contrary small angles δ 30 lead to smaller energy losses due to the minor planform curvature which leads to smaller streamline curvature as well as the reduced transverse pressure gradient and momentum transfer thus small δ design poses the least resistance and obstruction to the incoming flow from both main and lateral tributaries and it is recommended from the perspective of flow conveyance and energy losses 5 implication of 3d flow features for 1d modeling 5 1 correction coefficients of velocity distribution the highly 3d nature of the flow field affect variables that are involved in the 1d models as integrated or area averaged quantities such as the mean flow velocity and specific energy as introduced in section 4 2 the conventional analysis of 1d gradually varied flows usually assumes the momentum and energy flux corrections remain constant however due to the flow three dimensionality and non uniformity in the chz this is no longer valid lin and soong 1979 showed that for the cases of open channel flow with significant lateral inflows the nonuniform flow field requires a streamwise variation of the correction factor and that the manning s formula substantially underestimates the total energy loss while ignoring the turbulent eddy loss utilizing the present 3d numerical results the correction coefficients for kinetic energy and momentum i e coriolis and boussinesq coefficients respectively can be computed to quantify the deviation of post confluence cross sectional flow velocity distribution from a uniform flow velocity distribution michelazzo et al 2015 the kinetic energy and momentum correction coefficients α and β can be calculated using the value of u at the cell center by means of a numerical integration over the cross section as follows 13 α a u 3 d a u m e a n 3 a i j u i j 3 a i j u m e a n 3 i j a i j 14 β a u 2 d a u m e a n 2 a i j u i j 2 a i j u m e a n 2 i j a i j where umean is area averaged flow velocity fig 11 a and b shows the comparison of the α and β calculated using the numerical results for four junction angles with two distinct discharge ratios the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the calculation based on available physical model of weber et al 2001 for 90 junction the maximum values of α and β happen approximately at x 2 for different δ and ξ values regardless of the varying distance to the end of junction due to the change of δ this indicates that the maximum α and β happen further downstream from the end of junction as the δ increases the minimum α and β values are observed for δ 30 which is in accordance with the analysis presented in section 3 4 both the α and β values increase as the confluence angle and discharge ratio increase due to the enhanced three dimensionality of the flow fig 12 shows α and β as a function of ξ for the four junction angles at x 2 the reported values are much higher than the common values for open channel flows without significant lateral inflows these values decrease rapidly as the flow travels further downstream from the chz where the influence of the junction diminishes and the flow gradually recovers its uniformity the shear induced turbulent mixing has been identified as one of the major mechanisms that drive junction energy losses lin and soong 1979 the increase of α and β with ξ and δ may also be correlated with the enhanced turbulence production as shown in fig 13 and flow complexity due to the increased secondary circulation as highlighted in fig 6 fig 13 shows the longitudinal profiles of area averaged turbulent kinetic energy k for various δ and ξ follow a similar pattern such that k increases with increasing δ and ξ the maximum k happens further away from the end of junction as the δ increases which indicates that the longitudinal vortex increases its length as the junction angle and discharge ratio increase the maximum k for the case with ξ 0 75 is as much as 3 times the value of case ξ 0 25 as the flow travels downstream from the junction the secondary circulation dampens and k decreases rapidly 5 2 post confluence contraction the post confluence contraction is a primary mechanism that drives head loss as it accelerates the flow and enhances the turbulent mixing in 1d models of open channel flow based on energy and momentum the contraction coefficient μ is normally interpreted as the ratio of effective width at maximum flow constriction also termed as vena contracta to channel width hager 1987 1989 kumar gurram et al 1997 15 μ w b s w thus the dimensions of separation zone as defined in fig 1 is important in determining the contraction in post confluence vicinity based eq 15 utilizing the maximum separation width determined by 3d cfd modeling the calculated μ were compared with the experimental measurements by best and reid 1984 hsu et al 1998a and weber et al 2001 for 90 junction as shown in fig 14 a the numerical predictions of μ agree with the physical model by weber et al 2001 but are consistently higher than the other two experimental data sets indicating a smaller maximum separation width this difference may be attributed to the different flume configuration boundary roughness as well as the resolution of measurements it may also be attributed to the fact that bs increases with increasing downstream froude number f 3 as suggested in the empirical relation introduced earlier in eq 3 as hsu et al 1998a reported a larger f 3 0 6 finally the disagreement may also arise due to the fact that earlier research adopted streamline approach fig 1 a which may lead to an overestimation of bs regardless of the differences in magnitudes the experimental results and the numerical predictions show consistent pattern that for a right angled junction the maximum contraction decreases with the increasing lateral discharge ratios as a result of the increased flow separation however such an interpretation of μ may be insufficient due to the difficulty of defining and measuring the maximum width of separation zone due to its strong 3d characteristics utilizing the present 3d numerical data the maximum contraction can be calculated precisely according to its physical interpretation that the flow contraction resides in the reduction of effective flow area as follows 16 μ a e f f a u where au is the entrance flow area in the main channel and aeff is the effective flow area in the vena contracta which is simply calculated as the post confluence flow rate q 3 divided by umean fig 14 b shows the contraction coefficient calculated using definitions as of eq 15 and eq a 4 the differences between the two approaches increases as the ξ increases specifically the area based approach eq a 4 consistently leads to higher values than the width based eq 15 which suggests that the use of the maximum width of separation overestimates the flow contraction in case of substantial lateral inflows finally fig 14 c shows the variation of contraction coefficient calculated using the 3d numerical data based on eq a 4 as a function of discharge ratios and for four junction angles the computed values are compared with the predictions based on the 1d analytical solution derived by hager 1987 eq a 3 and the empirical relation proposed by kumar gurram et al 1997 eq a 4 fig 14 c fig 14 c shows the agreement between the 3d and 1d concerning the general pattern that μ decreases with increasing discharge ratio ξ and or increasing junction angle δ the observed underestimation by the 1d formulas may be attributed to the insufficient definition of the separation zone and the contraction coefficient that the previous 1d approaches adopted comparing the two 1d mathematical formulas eq a 4 is in better agreement with the 3d cfd results in terms of the magnitude and the gradient μ ξ for given δ eq a 3 appears to overestimate the μ ξ indicating it is more sensitive to the change of lateral inflows which leads to higher deviation at larger ξ based on the comparison tabulated in table c 2 for the same ξ and δ in average the maximum bs determined by the 3d numerical results is approximately 50 of the ones predicted by the 1d formulas and the correction factor for μ can be as high as 1 51 this indicates that the 3d cfd results can provide correction factors to improve the 1d model results 6 conclusions the prediction of hydrodynamics and energy losses at junctions in open channels is important in the design of large drainage systems an existing 1d dynamic model was revised to incorporate the effect of froude number on separation zone predicting the stage rise in the upstream channel tributaries and the resultant junction energy loss the 1d nonlinear dynamic model provides a framework to parameterize the physical mechanisms that control the post confluence hydraulics and junction structure induced energy losses a fully 3d numerical model was developed utilizing a state of the art cfd code and was validated using experimental data the high resolution numerical results allow the systematic analysis of the primary and secondary flow patterns as well as the water surface variations and the 3d separation zone characteristics all of these features appear to be controlled by the δ and ξ the correction coefficients of the velocity distribution were calculated to quantify the non uniformity of the post confluence flow and were also found to be functions of ξ and δ the 1d and 3d modeling strategies introduced are ready to be applied to other flow diversion problems such as the flow at pipe bend flow splitter lateral weirs and river meander the dimensionless results presented in this study may be applied directly to open channel junctions with similar configurations the present study also enhances the understanding of confluence flow structures and the increased hydraulic resistance induced in junctions although 1d modeling is economic and often considered sufficient for real time monitoring and or forecasting during extreme event however this paper suggests that utilizing 3d modeling at the chz for selected configurations can provide relations giving correction factors these empirical factors then bring the hydrodynamic understanding rendered by the 3d cfd model into the efficiency of the 1d model improving the accuracy of unsteady flow

the two methods that were previously developed to identify the separation zone fig 15 a demonstrates the streamlines definition in this method the downstream corner of junction is considered as the starting point of the separation zone and the most downstream streamline that originates from the lateral channel is considered as the boundary of the separation zone yang et al 2009 similarly best 1987 utilized surface dye traces to identify the separation zone according to its notable features of reduced pressure and recirculating flow however due to the complex flow structures and 3d characteristics of the separation zone it can become difficult to obtain the accurate three dimensional dimensions of the separation zone by the surface streamline method fig 15 b illustrates an alternative isovel equal velocity line method proposed by yang et al 2009 which suggests the lateral inflow detaches from the wall boundary downstream of the junction where the flow velocity can not overcome the adverse pressure gradient as a result the velocity at the boundary of separation zone must be zero yang et al 2009 demonstrated that defining zero velocity isovel is a more convenient and efficient way to define the separation zone and showed the dimensions of the separation zone calculated by the isovel method are smaller than those of the streamline method supplementary material

807,the complexity of open channel confluences stems from flow mixing secondary circulation post confluence flow separation contraction and backwater effects these effects in turn result in a large

hydraulic resistance open channel junctions turbulence 1 introduction open channel junction flows are widely occurring in natural waterways as well as in irrigation channels and drainage networks the mixing processes and turbulent flow structures in the vicinity of confluences play an important role in the understanding and prediction of pollutant dispersal in rivers and morphological feedback ashmore et al 1992 bennett and best 1995 best and roy 1991 biron et al 1996a 1996b boyer et al 2006 de serres et al 1999 rhoads 1996 combining flow in open channel junctions is a function of many factors such as the contribution of lateral momentum channel layout geometry i e the junction angles of lateral with respect to centerline of main channel upstream tributaries to post confluence channel width ratios cross sectional shape etc tailwater froude number and flow resistance from the boundaries hsu et al 1998a 1998b ramamurthy et al 1988 taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 earlier experimental studies utilized dye tests to examine the mean flow pattern in simple junction configurations which generally consisted of prismatic channels of equal widths and flat smooth beds taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 more recent laboratory studies were primarily focused on the characterization of separation zone secondary flow pattern and mixing layer best and roy 1991 best 1987 biron et al 1996a 1996b hsu et al 1998a kenworthy and rhoads 1995 kumar gurram et al 1997 mosley 1976 rhoads 1996 weber et al 2001 yuan et al 2016 regardless the specific channel geometry and boundary conditions the major hydrodynamics that govern the open channel junction flow may be generalized using a simple geometry as shown in fig 1 a the inflows merge and the post confluence flow is constricted to a flow area less than that of the tailwater and always accompanied with a sink in the water surface the resultant contraction reduces the channel capacity and produces substantial turbulence within the confluence hydrodynamic zone chz which is defined as the region adjacent to a stream confluences and affected by hydrodynamic interaction between the merging flows kenworthy and rhoads 1995 sukhodolov and rhoads 2001 a water surface rise is observed upstream of the junction as a result of the mutual obstruction effects of the main and branch channel flows another distinguishing feature is the appearance of a three dimensional shear plane shewed into a extent subject to the differences in flow velocities of the branch and main channel flows the entry of lateral inflow sets up helicoidal flow opposite to the deflection and a bottom upwelling current and also induces a secondary circulation rotating against the lateral inflow the secondary flow further results in a zone of intense turbulence close to the exit of junction where the flow may separate from the bed and with a zone of negative dynamic pressure forming in part of the flow turbulent mixing and contraction favors the exchange and equalization of momentum between moving body of fluid at different velocities as it meets another however accompanied by increased energy loss and hydraulic resistance thus a systematic analysis of this junction induced hydraulic resistance and flow contraction is important when designing drainage network to reduce the risks of flooding and overflows ramamurthy et al 1994 conventional 1d numerical modeling treats the junctions by means of internal boundary conditions for the shallow water equations by applying mass continuity combined with a simplified momentum or energy conservation at the junctions hsu et al 1998a kumar gurram et al 1997 mays 2001 ramamurthy et al 1988 taylor 1944 webber and greated 1966 yen 1986 however such a boundary condition cannot be evaluated adequately due to the aforementioned highly 3d turbulent flow features at the chz recently shabayek et al 2002 developed a nonlinear dynamic junction flow model by constructing two control volumes along the interfacial shear layer this model parameterizes all the physical processes that are significant enough to be included in the channel reaches of network modeling without previous assumptions of equal upstream flow depths and free boundary friction however its accuracy is still subject to the empirical formulation of interfacial and separation shear forces which were developed from existing experimental results this method has yet to be applied to systematically analyze the junction induced increased hydraulic resistance and energy losses more recently ghostine et al 2010 studied combining flow at open channel junctions by solving the 2d depth averaged shallow water equations using an unstructured computational mesh ghostine et al 2012 also presented comparison with the 1d dynamic model proposed by shabayek et al 2002 and demonstrated that 2d tends to outperform the 1d approach as junction angles and downstream froude number increases nevertheless the underlying assumption of hydrostatic pressure distribution and empirical treatment of dispersion terms resulting from the non uniformities of flow velocity still limits the accuracy of such 2d models in cases with adverse pressure gradient e g separation zone and strong secondary flows such as fluid flows through a river bend or channel junctions bates et al 2005 the uncertainties of 2d models also stem from the evaluation of bed shear stresses primarily due to turbulent flow interactions and the calibration of key parameters such as manning s n subject to flow conditions lane et al 1999 a 3d computational fluid dynamics cfd model solves the full 3d form of the navier stokes equations with reynolds averaging rans or without temporal averaging direct numerical simulation dns hence is capable of adequately reproducing the evolving primary and secondary flow patterns and turbulent flow structures the development of computing power facilitates the application of cfd models to open channel confluence problems however faces a number of challenges as i a non hydrostatic three dimensional solver combined with an appropriate turbulent closure for the estimation of reynold stresses is required to accurately predict the turbulent flow characteristics and separation zone ii a grid independent solution is somewhat difficult to achieve or illustrate hardy et al 1999 ma et al 2002 iii an appropriate technique is required to capture and locate the free surface evolution over space and time and iv limited reliable field or laboratory three dimensional high resolution datasets for confluences with different spatial and temporal boundary conditions are available to validate cfd models regardless of the aforementioned challenges once a 3d model is validated numerical experiments can be designed and conducted for a systematic examination of the standalone effects of different primary controls upon the development of flow structures existing 3d numerical studies on junction flows bradbrook et al 2000 huang et al 2002 shakibainia et al 2010 provided insight to flow characteristics of open channel confluences however a comprehensive quantitative study on the junction induced flow structure alteration and energy loss has yet to be performed the goal of this study is to present the numerical investigations conducted utilizing fully 3d cfd codes to a visualize the changing junction flow hydrodynamics in response to different controls and provide a physically based interpretation b examine variation of secondary flow pattern and intensity and size of separation zone to quantify the relative importance of the major mechanisms responsible for energy loss c compare junction hydraulics predicted by the modified 1d dynamic model and the 3d numerical model to assess the valid range of the 1d assumptions moreover high resolution cfd results allow analysis of the 3d flow structures effects on global parameters and processes that are relevant for the 1d modeling such as 1 the correction coefficients for flow velocity distribution 2 the maximum contraction in the post confluence flow and 3 the energy loss through the junction structure 2 1d dynamic model the adopted 1d mathematical formulation of the problem is the state of the art dynamic model introduced by shabayek et al 2002 ghostine et al 2012 showed that this model is the most accurate model among the existing 1d junction models 2 1 assumptions the underlying assumptions include 1 the flow is considered unidirectional in each channel and only the longitudinal variation is considered 2 the streamline curvature and vertical acceleration are neglected 3 the flow remains fully turbulent and subcritical throughout the combining channels 4 the temporal and volume storage of the junction with flat beds is negligible and 5 hydrostatic pressure distribution is assumed on the entire domain and uniform velocity is assumed at the inlet and outlet of the control volumes 2 2 mathematical formulation the model was developed by applying the momentum principle in the main channel stream wise direction x axis to the two control volumes cv in main c v 1 and lateral channel c v 2 respectively as shown in fig 1 b together with overall mass continuity fig 1 b illustrates the junction layout where the lengths of both the control volumes l 1

friction force by the rigid wall boundaries and f s shear force on the lateral channel control volume due to the separation zone forming downstream of the lateral channel entrance the detailed mathematical formulation of these forces can be referred to shabayek et al 2002 the model provides a framework in a 1d sense to account for all the important physics involved in the combining process by manipulating the formulation of the resultant forces in the present study one modification is adopted to advance the model by updating the formulation of separation shear force fs as flow separation is considered as one of the primary mechanisms contributing to energy losses which will be analyzed further in the following sections shabayek et al 2002 adopted the theory proposed by best 1987 that the width of separation zone is proportional to the square root of discharge ratio ξ q 2 q 3 and the shape index in terms of separation width length ratio bs ls remains constant more recent experimental work of kumar gurram et al 1997 suggested that the dimensions of the separation zone are not only a function of discharge ratio ξ and junction angle δ but also vary with downstream froude number f 3 herein the following expression proposed by kumar gurram et al 1997 based on multidimensional fitting analysis of observations of the separation zone is adopted 2 l s 3 8 b 3 sin 2 δ 1 1 2

geometry if the junction is comprised of prismatic channels of equal widths w 1 and w 2 simply reduce to unity the non dimensional chezy coefficient is defined as c c z g where cz is chezy coefficient and g is gravitational acceleration in the current study c 17 is maintained for smooth lab flumes the interfacial shear coefficient k and separation shear coefficient k were estimated using relations presented in appendix a 1 the nonlinear system as of eq 4 is thereafter solved iteratively using newton raphson method for the depth ratios η 1 and η 2 at the equilibrium state 3 3d cfd modeling the three dimensional numerical modeling of the open channel junction flow was performed using the commercial available cfd codes fluent 15 0 and 16 2 while a steady water discharge of 0 170 m3 s has been used for the results presented in this paper the modeling techniques that have been implemented allow the simulation of unsteady flow with modification of boundary conditions 3 1 governing equations the numerical model solves the unsteady 3d reynolds averaged navier stokes equations urans using the finite volume method the governing equations of the mean flow field can be written in the cartesian tensor form as 5 u i x i 0 6 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i x j u i u j where p pressure ui mean velocity in the xi direction i 1 2 3 and ui is the corresponding fluctuating components reynolds averaging results in the appearance of additional terms u i u j in the momentum equations known as the turbulent reynolds stresses these represent the transport of momentum by turbulence which can never be zero in turbulent flow to represent the effects of turbulence upon the time averaged flow properties and close eq 6 the shear stress transport sst k ω model eq b 1 b 5 combined with the boussinesq assumption eq b 6 is adopted sst k ω model was originally developed by menter 1994 and it combines the robust and accurate formulation of the k ω model in the near wall region with the efficiency of k ϵ model in the free stream luo 2017 demonstrated that sst k ω yields similar secondary flow patterns as predicted by both re normalization group rng k ϵ and anisotropic reynolds stress model rsm however resembles with rsm in terms of the near wall velocity gradient the intensity of reverse flow and the size of separation zone the water surface at open channel junctions is subject to substantial spatial variation throughout the tributaries even for steady flows in the present study the volume of fluid vof method is adopted to track the moving water surface and to resolve the non hydrostatic components of the open channel flow the air water interface is calculated using a transport equation for the volume fraction of water 7 a w t a w u i x i 0 where aw is the volume fraction of water also the volume fractions of water and air aa should satisfy continuity 8 a w a a 1 which implies that for the volume fraction of the water three different cases are possible 1 aw 1 0 for which the cell is occupied by water 2 aw 0 0 for which the cell is occupied by air and 3 0 aw 1 0 for which the cell is located in the infinitesimal region where the free surface is defined more details of the implementation of the vof can be found in ansys inc 2016 for the solution of the time depended elliptic partial differential equations both spatial and temporal boundary conditions are required 1 at the inlet boundaries the mean velocity vector and turbulence parameters in terms of turbulence intensity are specified the velocity distribution at the upstream boundary are specified as predefined flow rates with an initial estimation of water surface 2 at the outlet boundary a pressure outlet boundary condition is implemented within which a hydraulic diameter and turbulence intensity are specified in addition to the water surface 3 the walls are treated as impermeable walls the standard wall function and the no slip boundary condition have been employed a second order upwind scheme was adopted both for the momentum and turbulence transport equations for the transient simulations a second order implicit marching scheme was selected to allow the use of greater time steps while avoiding numerical instability and diffusivity finally the pressure velocity coupling was achieved by the pressure implicit splitting of operator piso algorithm issa 1986 3 2 computational domain the sharp edged 90 smooth combining flow flume fig 2 a data collected by weber et al 2001 was utilized to validate the numerical model the flume consisted of equal width channels i e b 1 b 2 b 3 w a four block hexahedral grid fig 2 b was constructed to capture the complex flow behavior happens within and near the 90 junction finer grids were imposed on the region close to the junction and the walls where significant gradients are expected the computational domain was carefully chosen to impose the inflow and outflow boundary conditions and to allow the variation of water surface the upstream of main channel is 6 55 m long consisted of 80 50 25 grid cells the lateral channel is 5 59 m long consisted of 50 80 25 grid cells the downstream channel is 15 57 m long consisted of 120 50 25 grid cells the current grid selection is based on an grid independent study included in luo 2017 the steady state results were extracted when the system reached equilibrium state for both the mean flow and turbulence quantities at the monitored sections i e x 2 w 3 w 5 w and the outlet 3 3 results and discussion 3 3 1 numerical model validation the cartesian coordinates x y z are normalized by a length scale w resulted in a non dimensional system of coordinates x y and z all velocities are normalized by the downstream area average velocity u 0 the turbulent kinetic energy tke is normalized by u 0 2 as a general clarification the superscript indicates the normalized variable the simulation results for two distinct discharge ratios ξ q 2 q 3 0 25 and 0 75 were selected to evaluate the performance of the developed 3d numerical model to facilitate the 2d comparison of the velocity components and the tke both the vertical sampled measurements and numerical results were interpolated into uniform grid cells by triangulation based linear interpolation a point to point comparison was conducted at each cell center of three cross sections that are located at x 2 3 5 fig 3 a d show that a good agreement between the experimental and the numerical results was achieved concerning the primary flow u secondary flow v w turbulent kinetic energy k and water surface figs 3 also reveals that larger errors of all predicted quantities occur in the immediate vicinity of junction where the flow is characterized by high non uniformity strong secondary circulation and flow separation fig 3 a shows a single core of high velocity near the outer wall in the post confluence channel at each cross section higher local errors in the primary flow occur in the lateral separation zone which extends up to water surface as turbulence in separation zone is highly anisotropic due to its three dimensional characteristics fig 3 c errors may be introduced by the use of an isotropic turbulence model fig 3 b demonstrates that the secondary flow patterns are similar to the experimental measurements by weber et al 2001 and those identified by rhoads 1996 and bradbrook et al 2000 at the cross section x 2 the model shows divergent flow at the bed and converging flow close to inner junction corner further downstream at x 3 two counter rotating helical cells characterize the secondary circulation pattern with a stronger clockwise cell formed in the corner of inner bank and channel bed and a weaker but broader counter clockwise rotation centered at the outer near bed region the clockwise rotating flow is also evident in the experimental measurements in the vicinity of the junction until x 5 however due to the lack of measurements near the inner bank no closed counterclockwise circulation was identified experimentally the spatial pattern of turbulent kinetic energy fig 3 c agrees with that of the secondary flow with a high turbulence core initiates from the surface on the inner bank of the channel and moves towards to the bed for confluences with moderate momentum ratios as the one illustrated here the secondary vortices are mainly caused by the planform curvature and bed shear driven turbulence hence the stronger secondary flows are typically located near bed at the inner corner of the channel fig 3 d illustrates the good performance of vof at predicting the varying longitudinal water surface profiles across the stream due to the entry of different amount of lateral inflow three major features appear to characterize water profiles 1 an increase of water depth upstream 2 a depression at the postconfluence water surface in the vicinity of junction downstream 3 a regrowth of the water surface beyond the vena contracta but never exceeds the upstream levels the maximum drawdown happens between the section from x 1 to x 2 for ξ 0 25 while for ξ 0 75 the maximum happens further away between x 2 to x 3 the higher momentum ratio ξ appears to result in higher water surface rise in the upstream tributary and larger depression downstream of the junction which will be analyzed further in the following sections 3 4 influence of junction angles and discharge ratios on 3d flow structures to distinguish from previous numerical investigations which were primarily focused on qualitatively describing the time averaged flow field and the agreement of numerical predictions with specific experimental setup the present work aims at a comprehensive quantitative study on the variation of chz under the primary controls that are feasible to parameterize and or quantify previous research identified two primary groups that govern the hydrodynamics of open channel junction flows the planform curvature characterized by junction angles and the momentum ratios of inflows characterized by discharge ratios in this study the channels remain equal width with smooth and flat bed to exclude any topographic steering and boundary friction effects which are site specific and were qualitatively investigated by others best 1988 biron et al 1996a 1996b the present numerical experiments set junction angle and discharge ratio as controlling variables while keeping the other parameters as constants to isolate any interactive or combined effects in particular four junction angles were considered according to their occurrences in engineering design δ 30 45 60 and 90 with six discharge ratios ξ 0 083 0 25 0 417 0 583 0 75 and 0 917 3 4 1 streamline curvature due to asymmetry of the planform curvature as shown in fig 4 a the streamline deflects towards the inner bank as the flow aligns with the post confluence channel this planform asymmetry increases with δ thus results in higher centrifugal acceleration fig 4 b on the outer bank and a zone of reverse flow that forms near the inner bank as δ increases at given δ the magnitude of the reverse flow and lateral dimension of this zone increases with ξ as the centrifugal acceleration increases with the junction angles greater transverse gradient of u is observed for larger δ as ξ decreases the streamwise u isovels almost coincide with the contours of velocity magnitude u m a g u 2 v 2 w 2 as the decreased discharge ratio pare the effect of streamline curvature on secondary circulation the detailed solution of the three dimensional velocity components facilitated the mapping of the deflection angle θ which is defined as 9 θ tan 1 v u the deflection zone can be identified using the contours of θ as shown in fig 5 as the combination of δ and ξ determines the amount of lateral momentum entering the confluence increasing values of the two controlling parameters lead to a larger entrance angle i e larger θ adjacent to the downstream corner of the junction however the deflection zone is confined to the vicinity of junction and was observed not exceeding 2w upstream and downstream of the junction the y axis is pointing at the outer bank of the junction thus the negative values of deflections angles further downstream indicate the inflection of streamline towards the inner bank 3 4 2 secondary circulation fig 5 also illustrates that δ control the cross stream distribution of u v vectors for example at small junction angles e g δ 30 the lateral momentum has minor effect on the resolved post confluence flow direction thus weak secondary circulation is generated even if ξ is large as shown in fig 6 a and b as the length of longitudinal vortex increases with ξ and δ no helical cell can be distinguished for 30 at x 2 interestingly the secondary flow pattern is dominated by the single cell structure for 45 and 60 with higher momentum ratios weak irregular vortices were observed near the outer bank and shift to the inner bank as ξ decreases as seen earlier in fig 3 b the counter rotating helical cell forms at x 3 for ξ 0 25 when δ 90 however is absent from x 2 fig 6 g as ξ increases the counter rotating helical cell structure appears as shown in fig 6 h the reason may reside in the higher momentum of the main channel smaller ξ migrate the helical cell further downstream of the junction however the dual cells will be replaced by the single cell further downstream and diminishes eventually similarly fig 7 a shows that the vertical component w is small regardless of discharge ratios which confirms the earlier statement that secondary circulation is weak in general for junctions of small angles i e δ 30 given δ 30 the velocity profiles are almost identical for the two groups of scenarios with ξ 0 25 0 75 and ξ 0 083 0 917 when the flow travels beyond x 2 this interesting behavior of asymmetrical junction of small δ stems from its similarity with the symmetrical confluence where a symmetrical flow characteristic is expected about ξ 0 5 due to the similar intensity of shear driven turbulence and secondary circulation at ξ 0 5 minor interfacial shear is generated due to minimum momentum difference between the upstream two tributaries thus minor flow separation and contraction is generated downstream which results in lower flow acceleration and more uniform velocity distribution for junctions with δ 45 larger flow acceleration is observed in the vicinity of the junction due to the enhanced flow separation and contraction fig 4 b and fig 7 b in addition as ξ increases the intensity of secondary circulation increases which alters the direction of velocity vectors more downwelling secondary velocity components deflect the velocity vector towards the bed in the post confluence vicinity and the vertical component increases its magnitude and the area of influence as the discharge ratio increases fig 7 b clearly shows that as the secondary circulation increases the momentum transport caused by secondary flow results in the velocity dip phenomena as ξ increases the location of maximum velocity in the post confluence channel migrates below the water surface and moves towards the channel bed which results in an adverse velocity gradient towards the water surface and greater bed shear stress thus for larger ξ the merging flow travels further downstream to recover to uniform velocity distribution 3 4 3 water surface and separation zone apparently for a given junction angle δ 90 the increased lateral momentum larger ξ leads to larger water surface depression and super elevation which further contributes to larger longitudinal and transverse pressure gradient in the downstream vicinity of junction fig 8 this depression zone can extend from the exit of the junction i e x 1 to x 4 accordingly with increasing lateral inflows the water surface then redevelops and stabilizes rapidly when the flow travels beyond x 4 due to the flow contraction and acceleration the water surface in the upstream channels is generally higher than the recovered tail water surface and increases with respect to discharge ratios up to ξ 0 75 the interaction between the main and lateral water bodies lead to an increase of the water depth upstream of the junction which further decelerates the flow and converts the kinetic energy to potential energy a transverse gradient of the water surface forms with higher water depth near the outer wall the different degree of resultant traverse pressure gradient drives the production and transformation of the secondary helical cell motion as shown earlier in fig 6 g and h the momentum and entrance angle of the lateral inflow force the flow to detach from the inner bank downstream of the junction and to form a 3d separation zone of low pressure and recirculating flow best and reid 1984 see fig 1 a two widely accepted alternatives to define separation zone are presented in appendix b 2 in the present study the streamwise isovel of u 0 is used to determine the border of the separation zone accordingly fig 4 b shows that the width bs and length ls of the separation zone increase with respect to δ and ξ which further lead to a larger transverse pressure gradient and flow contraction this enlarged flow contraction may enhance the downstream convection of vorticity due to flow acceleration with increasing ξ more lateral flow momentum needs to be converted into the post confluence channel direction thus more energy loss is expected associated with larger flow diversion fig 5 and separation fig 4 b fig 6 also illustrates that the vertical separation zone increases its lateral width bs with respect to the water depth as a result at the section of x 2 a vertical separation zone cannot be identified graphically for 30 junction fig 6 a and b which is consistent with fig 4 b that shows a separation zone with a relative small length ls w for ξ 0 75 near the water surface the same cause applies to the absence of separation zone at x 2 for the case of 45 with discharge ratio ξ 0 25 fig 6 c these observations affirm that separation zone is a 3d feature with bs varies both vertically and longitudinally 4 comparative 1d and 3d analysis of open channel junction hydraulics the preceding analysis demonstrates the goodness of adopted 3d cfd model at capturing the variation of hydrodynamics at chz under different controls thus the 3d numerical results were used as the reference values in the following to assess the potential of the modified 1d dynamic junction model at predicting the water depths at the upstream boundary and the resultant energy losses 4 1 upstream water depth fig 9 shows a general good agreement between the 1d and 3d numerical model results for junction angles up to 60 with the maximum root mean square error rmse for both tributaries not exceeding 0 015 it appears that the 1d model slightly underestimates η 1 and overestimates η 2 as δ approaches 90 thus the applied 1d dynamic model is capable of predicting the upstream depths accurately by considering all the aforementioned mechanisms that contribute to the increased hydraulic resistance in addition the 3d numerical results may facilitate the calibration of the key parameters i e k and k to further improve the accuracy of the 1d model at 90 for which the effects of turbulent mixing and secondary circulation are maximized fig 9 also imply the stagnation or blockage upstream increases with the δ and ξ hence more kinetic energy was converted to potential energy to be noted regardless the fact that for the examined cases smooth lab flume and moderate downstream froude number the stage increase does not exceed 15 and the standalone effect might be considered insignificant the accumulated effect is not negligible in large networks the 1d model simulations show a parabola like shape symmetric about ξ 0 5 for the relations between upstream water depths and tailwater depth as a function of discharge ratios for junction angle δ 60 the symmetry of these curves decreases as δ increases when δ 90 the relations change to a monotonically increasing function of ξ and these results are confirmed by the 3d simulations fig 9 4 2 energy loss the energy head or specific energy is defined by chow 1959 as 10 h y z α v 2 2 g where y flow depth z bed elevation v cross sectional average velocity and α is the energy flux correction factor the one dimensional open channel flow analysis is carried out under two basic assumptions 1 the energy correction factor α remains constant and 2 the hydraulic gradient s e d h d x may be evaluated by manning s chezy s and darcy weisbach formula however these conventional one dimensional assumptions are only valid for gradually varied flow with unidirectional primary flow with the presence of significant lateral inflows non uniformity of flow field and energy loss are enhanced by turbulent mixing thus both α and se should be subject to change with respect to junction hydraulics in the present study the total energy loss at a junction is evaluated in a global sense hsu et al 1998a 1998b lin and soong 1979 as the difference between the entry and exit energies per unit time as follows 11 δ e 1 e 1 e 2 e 3 e i q i h i q i y i z i α i v 2 2 g i 1 2 3 an important measure of the energy loss termed as energy loss coefficient can be derived as a function of dimensionless parameters of ξ wi ηi where i 1 2 and f 3 as 12 k e δ e e 3 e 1 e 2 e 3 1 1 ξ 2 η 1 f 3 2 1 ξ 2 w 1 2 η 1 2 ξ 2 η 2 f 3 2 ξ 2 w 2 2 η 2 2 2 f 3 2 1 eq 12 is equivalent to the formulas derived by hsu et al 1998a and webber and greated 1966 for constant width open channels w 1 w 2 1 and under the assumption of equal upstream water depth η 1 η 2 thus energy loss depends on the planform geometry i e w 1 w 2 and δ the momentum ratio between the two branches i e ξ eq 12 also accounts for both boundary friction and turbulent mixing loss implicitly through the solution of η 1 and η 2 fig 10 shows that ke estimated using 3d numerical results agree better than the 1d dynamical model with the experimental data by weber et al 2001 though there is still an underestimation for the cases with discharge ratios close to 0 5 the evident disagreement between the 1d and 3d predictions at 90 junction implies even with the state of the art formulation of all important physics the secondary circulation and turbulent mixing effect are too complicated to be account for adequately in a 1d manner with the better knowledge of hydrodynamics provided by 3d cfd simulations a correction factor can be established for larger junction angles δ 60 90 as summarized in table c 2 to improve the prediction of 1d dynamic models similar pattern of 3d and 1d estimations indicates that junction loss increases with respect to ξ and the slope ke ξ increases as δ increases for δ 45 for smaller junction angles δ 45 ke is almost indifferent to the variation of ξ and scatters around 0 02 the symmetry of hydraulic behavior about ξ also leads to a symmetrical relation between energy loss and discharge ratio also for any given ξ the larger δ values associated with increased junction asymmetry result in larger energy losses due to the more intense turbulent mixing secondary circulation and larger flow separation on contrary small angles δ 30 lead to smaller energy losses due to the minor planform curvature which leads to smaller streamline curvature as well as the reduced transverse pressure gradient and momentum transfer thus small δ design poses the least resistance and obstruction to the incoming flow from both main and lateral tributaries and it is recommended from the perspective of flow conveyance and energy losses 5 implication of 3d flow features for 1d modeling 5 1 correction coefficients of velocity distribution the highly 3d nature of the flow field affect variables that are involved in the 1d models as integrated or area averaged quantities such as the mean flow velocity and specific energy as introduced in section 4 2 the conventional analysis of 1d gradually varied flows usually assumes the momentum and energy flux corrections remain constant however due to the flow three dimensionality and non uniformity in the chz this is no longer valid lin and soong 1979 showed that for the cases of open channel flow with significant lateral inflows the nonuniform flow field requires a streamwise variation of the correction factor and that the manning s formula substantially underestimates the total energy loss while ignoring the turbulent eddy loss utilizing the present 3d numerical results the correction coefficients for kinetic energy and momentum i e coriolis and boussinesq coefficients respectively can be computed to quantify the deviation of post confluence cross sectional flow velocity distribution from a uniform flow velocity distribution michelazzo et al 2015 the kinetic energy and momentum correction coefficients α and β can be calculated using the value of u at the cell center by means of a numerical integration over the cross section as follows 13 α a u 3 d a u m e a n 3 a i j u i j 3 a i j u m e a n 3 i j a i j 14 β a u 2 d a u m e a n 2 a i j u i j 2 a i j u m e a n 2 i j a i j where umean is area averaged flow velocity fig 11 a and b shows the comparison of the α and β calculated using the numerical results for four junction angles with two distinct discharge ratios the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the calculation based on available physical model of weber et al 2001 for 90 junction the maximum values of α and β happen approximately at x 2 for different δ and ξ values regardless of the varying distance to the end of junction due to the change of δ this indicates that the maximum α and β happen further downstream from the end of junction as the δ increases the minimum α and β values are observed for δ 30 which is in accordance with the analysis presented in section 3 4 both the α and β values increase as the confluence angle and discharge ratio increase due to the enhanced three dimensionality of the flow fig 12 shows α and β as a function of ξ for the four junction angles at x 2 the reported values are much higher than the common values for open channel flows without significant lateral inflows these values decrease rapidly as the flow travels further downstream from the chz where the influence of the junction diminishes and the flow gradually recovers its uniformity the shear induced turbulent mixing has been identified as one of the major mechanisms that drive junction energy losses lin and soong 1979 the increase of α and β with ξ and δ may also be correlated with the enhanced turbulence production as shown in fig 13 and flow complexity due to the increased secondary circulation as highlighted in fig 6 fig 13 shows the longitudinal profiles of area averaged turbulent kinetic energy k for various δ and ξ follow a similar pattern such that k increases with increasing δ and ξ the maximum k happens further away from the end of junction as the δ increases which indicates that the longitudinal vortex increases its length as the junction angle and discharge ratio increase the maximum k for the case with ξ 0 75 is as much as 3 times the value of case ξ 0 25 as the flow travels downstream from the junction the secondary circulation dampens and k decreases rapidly 5 2 post confluence contraction the post confluence contraction is a primary mechanism that drives head loss as it accelerates the flow and enhances the turbulent mixing in 1d models of open channel flow based on energy and momentum the contraction coefficient μ is normally interpreted as the ratio of effective width at maximum flow constriction also termed as vena contracta to channel width hager 1987 1989 kumar gurram et al 1997 15 μ w b s w thus the dimensions of separation zone as defined in fig 1 is important in determining the contraction in post confluence vicinity based eq 15 utilizing the maximum separation width determined by 3d cfd modeling the calculated μ were compared with the experimental measurements by best and reid 1984 hsu et al 1998a and weber et al 2001 for 90 junction as shown in fig 14 a the numerical predictions of μ agree with the physical model by weber et al 2001 but are consistently higher than the other two experimental data sets indicating a smaller maximum separation width this difference may be attributed to the different flume configuration boundary roughness as well as the resolution of measurements it may also be attributed to the fact that bs increases with increasing downstream froude number f 3 as suggested in the empirical relation introduced earlier in eq 3 as hsu et al 1998a reported a larger f 3 0 6 finally the disagreement may also arise due to the fact that earlier research adopted streamline approach fig 1 a which may lead to an overestimation of bs regardless of the differences in magnitudes the experimental results and the numerical predictions show consistent pattern that for a right angled junction the maximum contraction decreases with the increasing lateral discharge ratios as a result of the increased flow separation however such an interpretation of μ may be insufficient due to the difficulty of defining and measuring the maximum width of separation zone due to its strong 3d characteristics utilizing the present 3d numerical data the maximum contraction can be calculated precisely according to its physical interpretation that the flow contraction resides in the reduction of effective flow area as follows 16 μ a e f f a u where au is the entrance flow area in the main channel and aeff is the effective flow area in the vena contracta which is simply calculated as the post confluence flow rate q 3 divided by umean fig 14 b shows the contraction coefficient calculated using definitions as of eq 15 and eq a 4 the differences between the two approaches increases as the ξ increases specifically the area based approach eq a 4 consistently leads to higher values than the width based eq 15 which suggests that the use of the maximum width of separation overestimates the flow contraction in case of substantial lateral inflows finally fig 14 c shows the variation of contraction coefficient calculated using the 3d numerical data based on eq a 4 as a function of discharge ratios and for four junction angles the computed values are compared with the predictions based on the 1d analytical solution derived by hager 1987 eq a 3 and the empirical relation proposed by kumar gurram et al 1997 eq a 4 fig 14 c fig 14 c shows the agreement between the 3d and 1d concerning the general pattern that μ decreases with increasing discharge ratio ξ and or increasing junction angle δ the observed underestimation by the 1d formulas may be attributed to the insufficient definition of the separation zone and the contraction coefficient that the previous 1d approaches adopted comparing the two 1d mathematical formulas eq a 4 is in better agreement with the 3d cfd results in terms of the magnitude and the gradient μ ξ for given δ eq a 3 appears to overestimate the μ ξ indicating it is more sensitive to the change of lateral inflows which leads to higher deviation at larger ξ based on the comparison tabulated in table c 2 for the same ξ and δ in average the maximum bs determined by the 3d numerical results is approximately 50 of the ones predicted by the 1d formulas and the correction factor for μ can be as high as 1 51 this indicates that the 3d cfd results can provide correction factors to improve the 1d model results 6 conclusions the prediction of hydrodynamics and energy losses at junctions in open channels is important in the design of large drainage systems an existing 1d dynamic model was revised to incorporate the effect of froude number on separation zone predicting the stage rise in the upstream channel tributaries and the resultant junction energy loss the 1d nonlinear dynamic model provides a framework to parameterize the physical mechanisms that control the post confluence hydraulics and junction structure induced energy losses a fully 3d numerical model was developed utilizing a state of the art cfd code and was validated using experimental data the high resolution numerical results allow the systematic analysis of the primary and secondary flow patterns as well as the water surface variations and the 3d separation zone characteristics all of these features appear to be controlled by the δ and ξ the correction coefficients of the velocity distribution were calculated to quantify the non uniformity of the post confluence flow and were also found to be functions of ξ and δ the 1d and 3d modeling strategies introduced are ready to be applied to other flow diversion problems such as the flow at pipe bend flow splitter lateral weirs and river meander the dimensionless results presented in this study may be applied directly to open channel junctions with similar configurations the present study also enhances the understanding of confluence flow structures and the increased hydraulic resistance induced in junctions although 1d modeling is economic and often considered sufficient for real time monitoring and or forecasting during extreme event however this paper suggests that utilizing 3d modeling at the chz for selected configurations can provide relations giving correction factors these empirical factors then bring the hydrodynamic understanding rendered by the 3d cfd model into the efficiency of the 1d model improving the accuracy of unsteady flow

alternative isovel equal velocity line method proposed by yang et al 2009 which suggests the lateral inflow detaches from the wall boundary downstream of the junction where the flow velocity can not overcome the adverse pressure gradient as a result the velocity at the boundary of separation zone must be zero yang et al 2009 demonstrated that defining zero velocity isovel is a more convenient and efficient way to define the separation zone and showed the dimensions of the separation zone calculated by the isovel method are smaller than those of the streamline method supplementary material

808,quantifying the uncertainty in solute mass discharge at an environmentally sensitive location is key to assess the risks due to groundwater contamination solute mass fluxes are strongly affected by the spatial variability of hydrogeological properties as well as release conditions at the source zone this paper provides a methodological framework to investigate the interaction between the ubiquitous heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and the mass release rate at the source zone on the uncertainty of mass discharge through the use of perturbation theory we derive analytical and semi analytical expressions for the statistics of the solute mass discharge at a control plane in a three dimensional aquifer while accounting for the solute mass release rates at the source the derived solutions are limited to aquifers displaying low to mild heterogeneity results illustrate the significance of the source zone mass release rate in controlling the mass discharge uncertainty the relative importance of the mass release rate on the mean solute discharge depends on the distance between the source and the control plane on the other hand we find that the solute release rate at the source zone has a strong impact on the variance of the mass discharge within a risk context we also compute the peak mean discharge as a function of the parameters governing the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field and mass release rates at the source zone the proposed physically based framework is application oriented computationally efficient and capable of propagating uncertainty from different parameters onto risk metrics furthermore it can be used for preliminary screening purposes to guide site managers to perform system level sensitivity analysis

component in groundwater management the spatial variability of the subsurface s hydraulic properties plays a vital role in controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of a solute plume and therefore the concentration level at an environmentally sensitive target capturing the heterogeneous patterns of these properties at different scales requires large quantity of data which in general is not feasible given the inaccessibility of the subsurface environment and the high costs of data acquisition as a consequence subsurface transport model predictions are subject to uncertainty dagan 1989 rubin 2003 and probabilistic tools are needed to assess the risks associated with groundwater contamination de barros et al 2016 de barros and rubin 2008 ciriello et al 2013 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 tartakovsky 2013 additional challenges in contaminated groundwater risk management originate from the incomplete knowledge of the contaminant release rates at the source zone or engineered barrier improper waste disposal or failure in an engineered barrier system e g septic tanks surface impoundments and underground nuclear waster repositories can lead to uncertainty in solute mass release rates with consequences in the plume s dispersive behavior these facts contribute to uncertainty and variability in transport predictions risk estimates and consequently decision making for such reasons it is important to understand the interactions between natural heterogeneity of the aquifer and solute mass release conditions on risk metrics and associated uncertainties up to date most works focused on quantifying the effects of hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity on transport quantities such as the statistical moments of the resident concentration andricevic 2008 fiori 2001 fiori

2007 boso and tartakovsky 2016 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 moslehi and de barros 2017 sanchez vila et al 2009 on the other hand less attention has been given to the impact of mass release conditions at the source zone or engineered barrier on the uncertainty of transport quantities and risk metrics numerical and experimental works show evidence that the mass flux at the source zone has a significant effect on plume spreading and mixing rates de barros and nowak 2010 gueting and englert 2013 as well as aquifer clean up times berglund 1997 similar findings are reported in henri et al 2016 in the context of human health risk due to groundwater contamination of chlorinated solvents the importance of source zone mass flux on the detection of a dnapl plume is also reported in field frind et al 1999 and modeling berglund 1997 works andričević and cvetković 1996 and selroos 1997a discussed the importance of incorporating contaminant release models of the engineered barrier e g waste containment into risk and safety assessment frameworks given its practical relevance in site management and remediation several studies proposed methodologies for identifying the solute release history at the source zone location skaggs 1994 snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 koch and nowak 2015 emphasizes that a sound modeling framework should account for the mutual interactions of groundwater flow variability and contaminant source zone depletion times this paper focuses in quantifying the uncertainty of the solute mass discharge through a compliance plane within an application oriented framework i e risk analysis assessing the mass discharge and its uncertainty is important to estimate the natural attenuation rate of a plume basu et al 2006 evaluate a remediation design soga et al 2004 and to set priorities towards site characterization de barros and rubin 2008 following the approach described in selroos 1997a and fiori et al 2002 we develop analytical and semi analytical solutions to compute the uncertainty in solute mass discharge as a function of the spatial statistical structure of the hydraulic conductivity and mass release rate at the source zone thus integrating engineered i e source zone and natural systems the questions addressed in this study regard to the sensitivity of solute mass discharge uncertainty to parameters characterizing the degree of heterogeneity of the porous formation and the solute mass release rate at the source zone we analyze how the combined factors control the temporal evolution of the low order statistical moments of the solute discharge as well as the exceedance probability at an environmentally sensitive target finally we demonstrate the applicability of the solution to estimate safe setback distances as a function of key physical parameters and the maximum allowed probability of exceedance the solution is based on the lagrangian framework cvetković et al 1992 dagan 1984 fiori et al 2002 and is well aligned with existing analytical probabilistic groundwater contamination risk frameworks andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and fiori 2014 de barros and rubin 2008 molin and cvetković 2010 persson and destouni 2009 selroos 1997a the solutions developed are physically based computationally efficient and capable of propagating uncertainty from different parameters onto decision making 2 problem statement consider the case of a contaminant source zone located a distance l from an environmentally sensitive target represented by an infinite control plane cp the cp can represent a compliance boundary such as a battery of wells pumping over a large area or the boundary between an aquifer and a surface water body i e river or lake due to the uncertainty of the hydrogeological properties e g hydraulic conductivity the contaminant concentration field is a random space function and therefore transport needs to be quantified using a probabilistic framework in the context of risk assessment and remediation of groundwater contamination site managers are interested in determining the probability that the concentration of a given contaminant at the cp is above a certain threshold value i e p c f c c r i t where cf ml 3 is the flux averaged concentration and ccrit is the critical concentration level provided by an environmental or public health regulatory agency another meaningful environmental performance metric for risk assessment is the solute mass discharge q mt 1 through the cp the mass discharge is a concept closely related to solute travel times which is often used in regulatory standards and provides information about natural attenuation rates of the solute plume the flux averaged concentration at the cp situated at a distance l from the source zone can be related to the solute mass discharge as follows 1 q t l q w c f t l where qw l 3 t 1 is the measured volumetric water flux through the cp and assumed to be deterministic and measured at the field since the cp is infinite qw is deterministic on the other hand for finite sized cp e g of dimensions comparable to the permeability correlation scale the volumetric water flux would be subject to uncertainty as shown in the literature de barros and nowak 2010 since cf is a random function q is also subject to uncertainty using equation 1 the probability density function pdf of q represented by pq can be obtained from the pdf of cf denoted here by pc given the linear functional relationship 1 the pdfs of q and cf are related by 2 p q q t l 1 q w p c q q w similarly we can determine a relationship between the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of cf and q as follows p q q p c q q w where pc and pq are the cdfs of cf and q respectively in this work we assess the statistics of q as a function of aquifer heterogeneity and mass release rates at the source zone the environmental performance metrics of interest are the mean and variance of q we will also quantify the probability of exceedance ξ at the cp at any given time t 3 ξ q t l 1 p q q t l 3 methods 3 1 flow and transport a steady state groundwater flow takes place in a three dimensional 3d aquifer characterized by a spatially heterogeneous locally isotropic hydraulic conductivity field k x where x x 1 x 2 x 3 is the cartesian coordinate system the porosity ne of the aquifer is assumed to be constant the flow field is uniform in the mean with unidirectional mean velocity v x u 0 0 far from boundary effects and in the absence of sources and sinks in this work the angle brackets denote the expected value the log conductivity field y x ln k x is a stationary random space function rsf with a spatial correlation function c y mean value y variance σ y 2 and correlation scale in the ith direction λi where i 1 2 and 3 in this work we consider an anisotropic exponential covariance model for c y with a statistical anisotropic ratio f λv λ where λv λ 3 and λ λ 1 λ 2 4 c y r σ y 2 exp r 1 λ r 2 λ r 3 λ v with r r 1 r 2 r 3 denoting the lag distance the exponential model allows to use a compendium of analytical solutions for particle trajectory statistics previously derived see chapter 10 of rubin 2003 and references therein a solute is released into an aquifer from an initial location a ω where ω is the source zone volume as shown later the solute can be injected into the aquifer at different release rates the source zone volume has characteristic dimensions ℓ i along the ith direction transport is assumed to be purely advective as a consequence the risk estimates and corresponding uncertainty presented in this work are conservative local scale dispersion would smooth out concentration gradients thus reducing peak concentration values as well as the sample to sample fluctuations of the plume de barros and fiori 2014 fiori and dagan 2000 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 tonina and bellin 2008 for a given realization of the y field the solute discharge q at the cp can be written as fiori et al 2002 rubin 2003 5 q t τ l t o t ω m t a γ t t τ d t d a with τ denoting the solute travel time from the source to receptor e g control plane and m ml 3 t 1 represents the mass release strength the function γ accounts for reactive processes cvetkovic and dagan 1994 as explained in cvetkovic and dagan 1994 and chapter 10 of rubin 2003 the mathematical form of the function γ depends on specific reactive process and describes the modification of the migration of an instantaneous pulse injection with time due to chemical reactions the function m can be decomposed into m t a m o ζ a ϕ t where mo is the solute mass the spatial function ζ describes the spatial extent of the solute source whereas the temporal function ϕ characterizes the mass release rate from the source zone therefore eq 5 represents a convolution of γ with ϕ for the purpose of illustration we adopt a variation of the model reported in selroos 1997a b 6 ϕ t κ e κ t t o where to is the time of failure in the contaminant source zone set to zero for simplicity and κ is the release rate constant t 1 note that other release models can be employed if we were to assume an instantaneous release the release function becomes ϕ t δ t we will consider a non reactive solute released from a point source i e ℓ i λi for i 1 2 and 3 for a non reactive transport point source we have γ t t τ δ t t τ and ζ a δ a a o where δ represents the dirac delta function models for γ describing different reactions can be found in cvetkovic and dagan 1994 in addition we assume geological formations displaying low to mild heterogeneity i e σ y 2 1 which is in accordance with typical values reported in table 2 2 of rubin 2003 3 2 solute mass discharge uncertainty next we derive expressions to quantify the uncertainty of q under the conditions described in section 3 1 uncertainty in q will be estimated through its moments i e the mean and variance and cdf taking the ensemble expectation over all possible values of τ we obtain the expression for the mean solute mass discharge 7 μ q t l q t τ l τ q t τ l g 1 τ a l d τ where g 1 is the one particle travel time pdf and contains the effects of hydrogeological heterogeneity similarly we obtain the variance of the mass solute discharge at the cp 8 σ q 2 t l q t τ l 2 q t τ l 2 where the second moment is given by 9 q t τ l 2 τ τ q t τ l q t τ l g 2 τ τ a a l

of the solute discharge at the cp becomes 10 μ q t l m o τ 0 t ω ϕ t δ a a o δ t t τ g 1 τ a l d t d a d τ m o a t where the function a t is defined as follows 11 a t 0 t ϕ t g 1 t t a o l d t inserting the expression for the mass release function ϕ eq 6 into 11 yields 12 a t κ 0 t e κ t g 1 t t a o l d t the derived result for the mean solute discharge 10 is identical to the solution obtained for an ergodic solute plume i e ℓ λ fiori et al 2015 our following step is to compute the second order moment of q using eq 5 and 9 the second moment of the solute discharge can be written as

overestimates the variance of the solute discharge if we were to consider a large source zone i e ℓ λ the plume would approach ergodicity and consequently transport becomes less subject to uncertainty therefore the expression obtained for the variance represents an upper bound on the uncertainty estimation the mean and variance of the solute discharge do not a provide complete characterization of the mass discharge uncertainty for such reasons it is necessary to compute the pdf or cdf since it provides information regarding probability of occurrence de barros and fiori 2014 boso and tartakovsky 2016 for the purpose of this work we assume that q is lognormally distributed parameterized with the mean 10 and variance 19 numerical studies report evidence that the flux averaged concentration and consequently the solute discharge see eqs 1 and 2 can be approximated by a lognormal pdf henri et al 2015 moslehi and de barros 2017 schwede and cirpka 2010 troldborg et al 2010 we provide additional support for this assumption in the appendix where a comparison between the lognormal pdf and the empirical pdf originating from monte carlo numerical simulations is included furthermore the lagrangian framework used in this work has been tested against numerical simulations hassan et al 2001 derived analytical solutions for the first two moments of the solute discharge originating from an instantaneous release into a 2d aquifer and successfully compared their results against numerical simulations under the lognormal pdf assumption the cdf of q i e pq becomes 20 p q q t l 1 2 1 2 erf ln q t l μ q t l σ q t l 2 which is parameterized with the following expressions 21 μ q t l ln μ q t l 1 σ q t l μ q t l 2 σ q 2 t l ln 1 σ q t l μ q t l 2 therefore the exceedance probability 3 becomes 22 ξ q t l 1 2 1 2 erf ln q t l μ q t l σ q t l 2 in many applications other sources of uncertainty exist e g source zone architecture and mass transfer coefficients which can be included following the approach of berglund and cvetkovic 1995 these uncertainties can be incorporated through marginalizing pq for example let ϑ denote a vector containing uncertain parameters and characterized by the joint pdf p ϑ ϑ hence the impact of parametric uncertainty originating from ϑ on the uncertainty of the solute discharge can be estimated as follows 23 p q q t l ϑ p q q t l ϑ p ϑ ϑ d ϑ 3 3 travel time pdf for a statistically anisotropic 3d porous formation in order to estimate the statistics of the mass discharge we need to compute the travel time pdf following cvetković et al

approximation is valid for small variances of y namely σ y 2 1 e g low to mild heterogeneous formations see ch 10 p 254 256 of rubin 2003 and is further supported by numerical simulations bellin et al 1994 gotovac et al 2009 an alternative model for the travel time pdf is the inverse gaussian fiori et al 2017 kreft and zuber 1978 the lognormal travel time pdf of a solute particle originating from the source zone to the cp is parameterized with the following expressions for the travel time mean τ and variance σ τ 2 andričević and cvetković 1996 cvetković et al 1992 rubin 2003 24 τ l u 25 σ τ 2 1 u 2 x 11 l u where x 11 is the one particle displacement covariance function other expressions for the travel time moments that incorporate higher order effects are available in the literature cvetkovic et al 1996 guadagnini et al 2003 sanchez vila and guadagnini 2005 under the assumption that σ y 2 1 and a statistically anisotropic ratio f 1 i e stratified formation cvetkovic et al 1998

lognormal pdf is adopted for g 1 it is not feasible to obtain a full analytical solution for the solute discharge moments namely eqs 10 and 19 and numerical integrations are required in order to compute the coefficients a and b see eqs 12 and 18 4 preliminary analysis in the fickian regime analytical expressions for μq and σ q 2 see eqs 10 and 19 can be obtained under the fickian regime i e x

2 λ l u 2 high resolution numerical experiments reported in janković and fiori 2010 indicate that the fickian regime can be attained at x 1 20λ for levels of heterogeneity up to σ y 2 2 as for the travel time pdf we employ the gamma pdf 28 g 1 t 1 γ α β α t α 1 e t β with α and β denoting the shape and scale parameters where α τ 2 σ τ 2 and β σ τ 2 τ and γ is the gamma function the choice of 28 serves as a reasonable approximation for the lognormal distribution the gamma distribution has been used to quantify the travel time pdf in hill slope systems cvetkovic et al 2012 fiori and russo 2008 fiori et al 2009 as well as concentration breakthrough curves in catchments kirchner et al 2000 a comparison between the lognormal and gamma distributions parameterized by τ and σ τ 2 under the fickian limit is provided in fig 1 at two cp locations l 20 λ and 30λ as shown in fig 1 the gamma distribution represents a reasonable approximation for the lognormal pdf at large distances from the solute source zone using the gamma pdf we can derive closed form expressions for the coefficients a and b see eqs 12 and 18 in the fickian regime by inserting expression 28 into eqs 12 and 18 the integrations present in coefficients a and b can be solved analytically 29 a t κ e κ t γ l 2 α l t l 2 α l α l t u u α l 2 κ l 2 α l γ l 2 α l γ l 2 α l t u 2 α l κ 30 b t κ 2 e 2 κ t γ l 2 α l t l 2

macrodispersivity as defined by dagan 1984 note that the accuracy of 31 and 32 increases with distance l since at large distances the gamma pdf approaches the lognormal pdf see fig 1 we now investigate the interplay between aquifer heterogeneity manifested in αl and mass release rates on the low order moments of q in the fickian regime fig 2 illustrates the peak values of the mean q max and standard deviation σ q max as a function of l αl and κ these quantities are important for risk assessment and decision making as shown in fig 3 higher values of κ implies a faster solute release from the engineered barrier or source zone both the peak of the mean discharge fig 2 a and the peak standard deviation fig 2 b decreases with increasing l αl fig 2 clearly shows the significance of the mass release rate in controlling the uncertainty of the solute discharge we observe that the values of the peak discharge moments i e maximum values of the mean and standard deviation increase with the source zone mass release rate κ large values of κ indicate a faster release of the solute mass into the aquifer which leads to higher peak solute discharge moments on the other hand for lower release rates the plume is more dispersed along the longitudinal direction and therefore the values of the peak mean and standard deviation discharge reduce the effect of κ on the mean peak discharge becomes less pronounced with increasing values l αl fig 2 a for larger l the solute plume samples more heterogeneity and the memory effects originating from the source zone κ decrease as presented in fig 2 a the peak mean discharge tends to converge asymptotically for all values of κ at large l αl on the other hand the peak of the mass discharge standard deviation is strongly affected by the mass release rate at all l αl values see fig 2 b 5 results in this section we analyze how the mass release rate and the degree of heterogeneity affect the statistics of the solute discharge at different cps using the pre asymptotic particle trajectory covariance function 26 and the lognormal distribution for the travel time pdf parameterized by the mean 24 and variance 25 all upcoming results are displayed in terms of dimensionless numbers the dimensionless groups used in this section are 33 q q λ m o u σ q σ q λ m o u t t u λ l l λ κ λ u κ ϕ λ u ϕ fig 3 shows the normalized mass release function ϕ at the source zone see equation 6 for different values of κ higher values of κ indicate a faster release of solute mass from the engineered barrier whereas lower κ values implies slower mass release 5 1 low order moments the results depicted in figs 4 and 5 illustrate the effect of κ on the temporal evolution of the moments of q the normalized mean and standard deviation of q are computed at two cps located at l 5 and 20 see fig 4 a and b and fig 5 a and b juxtaposition of fig 4 a and b shows that the sensitivity of the mean solute discharge towards the mass release rate decreases with increasing distance l when l increases the plume samples more heterogeneity and memory effects stemming from source zone diminish therefore the mean solute discharge becomes less sensitive to κ at far distances from the source this is in agreement with the analytical results obtained under the fickian approximation depicted in fig 2 consequently the first order analysis carried out shows that improved characterization of the mass release rates at the source is important in the estimation of the mean mass discharge when the environmentally sensitive location is close to the source zone as shown in fig 4b the impact of the mass release rate on the mean mass discharge is not so evident for a cp located far from the source e g large values of l fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of the dimensionless standard deviation of q i e σ q as a function of the normalized mass release rate κ as opposed to fig 4 the standard deviation of q is strongly affected by the solute mass release rate at both cp locations explored the peak of the estimated solute mass discharge standard deviation decreases with κ at both l 5 and 20 see figs 5a and b this is further supported by the analytical results obtained under the fickian regime presented in fig 2b the results displayed in fig 5 also shows that the asymmetry in the temporal evolution of the standard deviation is more evident for l 5 when compared to the results obtained at l 20 next we investigate the peak expected value of the mass discharge as a function of the mass release rate at different cp locations namely l 5 10 and 20 fig 6 as the distance l increases the mean peak discharge decreases due to dilution see also fig 2a the results depicted in fig 6 also shows that the sensitivity of the peak mean mass discharge becomes less sensitive towards κ with increasing distance l the curves displayed in fig 6 show that the effect of κ on the peak mean discharge becomes negligible for κ 0 3 for a cp situated at l 20 this result is further supported by the fickian analysis carried out in fig 2a on the other hand when the cp is close to the source i e see curve for l 5 the mean peak discharge is more sensitive to changes in κ fig 6 5 2 occurrence probabilities and risk analysis in fig 7 we plot the exceedance probability ξ as defined in equation 22 for different values of solute mass release rates κ and compliance goals q c the exceedance probabilities displayed in fig 7a are computed at l 5 and t 5 whereas the results shown in fig 7 b are obtained at l 20 and t 20 as shown in fig 7 the exceedance probability is significantly impacted by the compliance goal q c and the distance l an increase in l from 5 to 20 leads to a remarkable decrease in the exceedance probability ξ for all values of q c compare figs 7a and b thus showing how the aquifer can act as a natural attenuating barrier this result shows how the methodology could be utilized to define a safe source receptor setback distance that complies with the requirements of a regulatory agency fig 7 also indicates the existence of a critical κ value where ξ approaches an asymptotic plateau this asymptotic value for ξ is achieved faster for lower values of q c previous results analyzed the combined effect of mass release rate and cp locations on the uncertainty of q next we will investigate the combined effect of heterogeneity epitomized by the log conductivity variance σ y 2 and mass release rates on the solute mass discharge cdf pq see eq 20 fig 8 displays the cdf for the normalized mass discharge for different values for κ and σ y 2 the results shown in fig 8a and b correspond to κ 0 25 and 1 respectively the effects of heterogeneity are not as pronounced on the mass discharge cdf when l 5 and κ 0 25 fig 8a as illustrated in fig 8a the impact of σ y 2 becomes noticeable when the distance between the source and cp increases compare curves for l 5 and 20 in fig 8a this is in agreement with physical intuition since higher heterogeneity larger σ y 2 leads to increased macro spreading of the plume and therefore l provides time for dispersion to act on the other hand fig 8b shows that the effects of natural heterogeneity is augmented at both cp locations when the source zone mass release rate increases from κ 0 25 to κ 1 the results displayed in fig 8 suggest that a slower mass release from the source zone may mask the effects of natural heterogeneity in the uncertainty of the mass discharge a temporally dispersed mass release at the source zone reduces the relevance of the arrival time uncertainty associated with natural heterogeneity this analysis highlights the importance of incorporating the proper mass release rate from the source zone or engineered barrier into the modeling framework since it can significantly impact the risk estimates and potentially the probability of the occurrence of extreme events e g high concentration values for the upcoming results we investigate how the mass release rate can impact the estimation of the required distance to achieve a maximum allowed probability of exceedance ξ determining this required distance also known as the safe setback distance between the contaminant source and the receptor is critical when designing waste disposal facilities and protecting water supply wells from contamination the concept of safe setback distances is also used to minimize the risks associated with microbial pollution molin et al 2010 an appealing aspect of the proposed solution is that it allows to determine the required distance to reach a maximum allowable exceedance probability as a function of several key parameters such as the injected mass the mass release rate at the source zone and the degree of heterogeneity of the conductivity field figs 9 and 10 illustrate the safe source receptor setback or required distance that meets a given regulatory standard for ξ both figs 9 and 10 show the probability that the solute discharge will exceed q c 0 1 value selected for the purpose of illustration as a function of normalized distance l at distinct times figs 9 and 10 show that we can estimate the required distance l for a given allowed ξ and time of interest as shown in figs 9 and 10 the mass release rate at the source zone has a profound impact of the exceedance probability 6 concluding remarks we derive new analytical and semi analytical solutions for the solute mass discharge uncertainty at a control plane for a 3d heterogeneous aquifer the solution incorporates the integrated effects of aquifer heterogeneity and solute mass release conditions through the use of the lagrangian framework semi closed expressions for the low order moments of the solute discharge are developed for a point like injection under the assumption of low to mild heterogeneity i e first order approximation in the log conductivity variance in addition we obtain full analytical expressions under the fickian approximation the results presented in this work indicate that the distance between the source and receptor i e control plane plays a key role in defining the relative importance of the parameters controlling the source zone mass release rate and the degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer on the overall mass discharge uncertainty the standard deviation of the mass discharge is strongly affected by the mass release rate at the source zone at all distances between the source and the receptor explored on the other hand the significance of the source zone mass release rate on the mean mass discharge reduces with increasing control plane distance under the context of risk assessment we illustrate how the peak expected solute discharge scales with on the mass release rate the semi analytical results indicate that when the solute is slowly released into the aquifer the effects of heterogeneity manifested through the log conductivity variance on the solute discharge uncertainty is diminished the methodological framework provides a transparent and relatively simple modeling tool that can be utilized for screening as well as regulatory purposes due to its analytical features the framework enables to quantify the propagation of uncertainty from both source zone release conditions e g engineered barriers and hydraulic conductivity to the final risk end point we showed how the solution can be used to estimate the required or setback distance between the source and receptor necessary to achieve an allowable exceedance probability this safe setback distance depends on the injected mass and release rates as well as the degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer moreover the solution allows to better engineer waste disposal facilities and safe setback distances that are aligned with regulatory standards given the analytical features of the framework the derived solutions for the mass discharge statistics can be linked to dose response curves as done in de barros and rubin 2008 to estimate adverse health effects on humans due to exposure to contaminated groundwater furthermore the proposed framework allows to condition predictions to hydrogeological measurements following the approach described in rubin and dagan 1992 and de barros et al 2012 other types of mass release functions can also be incorporated into the analysis the theoretical analysis carried out in this work provides additional insights into the complexities of making an informed management decision in the context of probabilistic risk analysis when accounting for the joint interactions between source zone characteristics and natural heterogeneity extending a similar analysis to aquifers displaying higher heterogeneity and non gaussian features may lead to many interesting conclusions when it comes to the interplay between natural heterogeneity and mass release rates the effects of well pumping operations can also impact the occurrence probabilities libera et al 2017a 2017b note that the developed lagrangian based solution can be extended to incorporate mass transfer mechanisms that can potentially describe rate limited chemical reactions and diffusion from immobile water regions accounting for these transport mechanisms in conjunction with heterogeneity in the permeability field is important in the context of remediation since they lead to tailing behavior in the solute breakthrough curve the commonly observed tails is mainly due to the large residence time of the solute in low conductivity zones using the same lagrangian framework adopted in this work berglund and cvetkovic 1995 coupled advective transport with rate limited mass transfer to predict clean up time in a pump and treat remediation of a stratified aquifer cvetkovic 2012 provides an extension of the lagrangian framework that incorporates both fickian and non fickian transport behavior caused by different mass transfer models however it is important to note the existence of alternative methodologies that are well suited to estimate the tailing of a plume such as multi rate mass transfer de barros et al 2013 carrera et al 1998 haggerty and gorelick 1995 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in this paper we did not consider the effects of local scale dispersion as shown in the literature local scale dispersion may play a significant role in risk analysis de barros and fiori 2014 libera et al 2017a expanding the semi analytical expressions to incorporate the effects of local scale dispersion can be done as shown in fiori et al 2002 local scale dispersion will smooth out concentration gradients which will reduce the peak mass discharge at the control plane however we point out that the effects of local scale dispersion on the statistics of mass discharge will be less pronounced when the area of the control plane is large when compared to the correlation length under these conditions the mixing effect induced by sampling becomes more relevant than local scale dispersion mechanisms it is important to emphasize that the point like approximation implies that all solute particles trajectories originating from the source zone and associated travel times are fully correlated this approximation together with the purely advective assumption adopted in this work overestimates the variance of the solute discharge acknowledgments this study

the pdf of the flux averaged concentration which is directly proportional to the solute discharge pdf see eq 2 to further support the choice of the lognormal pdf for the solute discharge we performed additional numerical simulations fig 11 depicts a comparison between the empirical pdf for the flux averaged concentration with the lognormal pdf at two cp locations l 5 and 10 the empirical pdf was obtained from monte carlo simulations a total of 500 realizations for flow and transport in a 3d aquifer characterized by f 1 σ y 2 1 and an exponential covariance function for y purely advective transport of a conservative tracer was simulated using the random walk particle tracking code reported in henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 salamon et al 2007 from the flux averaged concentration ensemble we estimated the empirical mean and variance these estimated parameters were used to fit a lognormal pdf model displayed in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the lognormal pdf model compares reasonably well with the empirical distribution 
808,quantifying the uncertainty in solute mass discharge at an environmentally sensitive location is key to assess the risks due to groundwater contamination solute mass fluxes are strongly affected by the spatial variability of hydrogeological properties as well as release conditions at the source zone this paper provides a methodological framework to investigate the interaction between the ubiquitous heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity and the mass release rate at the source zone on the uncertainty of mass discharge through the use of perturbation theory we derive analytical and semi analytical expressions for the statistics of the solute mass discharge at a control plane in a three dimensional aquifer while accounting for the solute mass release rates at the source the derived solutions are limited to aquifers displaying low to mild heterogeneity results illustrate the significance of the source zone mass release rate in controlling the mass discharge uncertainty the relative importance of the mass release rate on the mean solute discharge depends on the distance between the source and the control plane on the other hand we find that the solute release rate at the source zone has a strong impact on the variance of the mass discharge within a risk context we also compute the peak mean discharge as a function of the parameters governing the spatial heterogeneity of the hydraulic conductivity field and mass release rates at the source zone the proposed physically based framework is application oriented computationally efficient and capable of propagating uncertainty from different parameters onto risk metrics furthermore it can be used for preliminary screening purposes to guide site managers to perform system level sensitivity analysis

component in groundwater management the spatial variability of the subsurface s hydraulic properties plays a vital role in controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of a solute plume and therefore the concentration level at an environmentally sensitive target capturing the heterogeneous patterns of these properties at different scales requires large quantity of data which in general is not feasible given the inaccessibility of the subsurface environment and the high costs of data acquisition as a consequence subsurface transport model predictions are subject to uncertainty dagan 1989 rubin 2003 and probabilistic tools are needed to assess the risks associated with groundwater contamination de barros et al 2016 de barros and rubin 2008 ciriello et al 2013 maxwell and kastenberg 1999 tartakovsky 2013 additional challenges in contaminated groundwater risk management originate from the incomplete knowledge of the contaminant release rates at the source zone or engineered barrier improper waste disposal or failure in an engineered barrier system e g septic tanks surface impoundments and underground nuclear waster repositories can lead to uncertainty in solute mass release rates with consequences in the plume s dispersive behavior these facts contribute to uncertainty and variability in transport predictions risk estimates and consequently decision making for such reasons it is important to understand the interactions between natural heterogeneity of the aquifer and solute mass release conditions on risk metrics and associated uncertainties up to date most

2007 boso and tartakovsky 2016 dentz and tartakovsky 2010 moslehi and de barros 2017 sanchez vila et al 2009 on the other hand less attention has been given to the impact of mass release conditions at the source zone or engineered barrier on the uncertainty of transport quantities and risk metrics numerical and experimental works show evidence that the mass flux at the source zone has a significant effect on plume spreading and mixing rates de barros and nowak 2010 gueting and englert 2013 as well as aquifer clean up times berglund 1997 similar findings are reported in henri et al 2016 in the context of human health risk due to groundwater contamination of chlorinated solvents the importance of source zone mass flux on the detection of a dnapl plume is also reported in field frind et al 1999 and modeling berglund 1997 works andričević and cvetković 1996 and selroos 1997a discussed the importance of incorporating contaminant release models of the engineered barrier e g waste containment into risk and safety assessment frameworks given its practical relevance in site management and remediation several studies proposed methodologies for identifying the solute release history at the source zone location skaggs 1994 snodgrass and kitanidis 1997 koch and nowak 2015 emphasizes that a sound modeling framework should account for the mutual interactions of groundwater flow variability and contaminant source zone depletion times this paper focuses in quantifying the uncertainty of the solute mass discharge through a compliance plane within an application oriented framework i e risk analysis assessing the mass discharge and its uncertainty is important to estimate the natural attenuation rate of a plume basu et al 2006 evaluate a remediation design soga et al 2004 and to set priorities towards site characterization de barros and rubin 2008 following the approach described in selroos 1997a and fiori et al 2002 we develop analytical and semi analytical solutions to compute the uncertainty in solute mass discharge as a function of the spatial statistical structure of the hydraulic conductivity and mass release rate at the source zone thus integrating engineered i e source zone and natural systems the questions addressed in this study regard to the sensitivity of solute mass discharge uncertainty to parameters characterizing the degree of heterogeneity of the porous formation and the solute mass release rate at the source zone we analyze how the combined factors control the temporal evolution of the low order statistical moments of the solute discharge as well as the exceedance probability at an environmentally sensitive target finally we demonstrate the applicability of the solution to estimate safe setback distances as a function of key physical parameters and the maximum allowed probability of exceedance the solution is based on the lagrangian framework cvetković et al 1992 dagan 1984 fiori et al 2002 and is well aligned with existing analytical probabilistic groundwater contamination risk frameworks andričević and cvetković 1996 de barros and fiori 2014 de barros and rubin 2008 molin and cvetković 2010 persson and destouni 2009 selroos 1997a the solutions developed are physically based computationally efficient and capable of propagating uncertainty from different parameters onto decision making 2 problem statement consider the case of a contaminant source zone located a distance l from an environmentally sensitive target represented by an infinite control plane cp the cp can represent a compliance boundary such as a battery of wells pumping over a large area or the boundary between an aquifer and a surface water body i e river or lake due to the uncertainty of the hydrogeological properties e g hydraulic conductivity the contaminant concentration field is a random space function and therefore transport needs to be quantified using a probabilistic framework in the context of risk assessment and remediation of groundwater contamination site managers are interested in determining the probability that the concentration of a given contaminant at the cp is above a certain threshold value i e p c f c c r i t where cf ml 3 is the flux averaged concentration and ccrit is the critical concentration level provided by an environmental or public health regulatory agency another meaningful environmental performance metric for risk assessment is the solute mass discharge q mt 1 through the cp the mass discharge is a concept closely related to solute travel times which is often used in regulatory standards and provides information about natural attenuation rates of the solute plume the flux averaged concentration at the cp situated at a distance l from the source zone can be related to the solute mass discharge as follows 1 q t l q w c f t l where qw l 3 t 1 is the measured volumetric water flux through the cp and assumed to be deterministic and measured at the field since the cp is infinite qw is deterministic on the other hand for finite sized cp e g of dimensions comparable to the permeability correlation scale the volumetric water flux would be subject to uncertainty as shown in the literature de barros and nowak 2010 since cf is a random function q is also subject to uncertainty using equation 1 the probability density function pdf of q represented by pq can be obtained from the pdf of cf denoted here by pc given the linear functional relationship 1 the pdfs of q and cf are related by 2 p q q t l 1 q w p c q q w similarly we can determine a relationship between the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of cf and q as follows p q q p c q q w where pc and pq are the cdfs of cf and q respectively in this work we assess the statistics of q as a function of aquifer heterogeneity and mass release rates at the source zone the environmental performance metrics of interest are the mean and variance of q we will also quantify the probability of exceedance ξ at the cp at any given time t 3 ξ q t l 1 p q q t l 3 methods 3 1 flow and transport a steady state groundwater flow takes place in a three dimensional 3d aquifer characterized by a spatially heterogeneous locally isotropic hydraulic conductivity field k x where x x 1 x 2 x 3 is the cartesian coordinate system the porosity ne of the aquifer is assumed to be constant the flow field is uniform in the mean with unidirectional mean velocity v x u 0 0 far from boundary effects and in the absence of sources and sinks in this work the angle brackets denote the expected value the log conductivity field y x ln k x is a stationary random space function rsf with a spatial correlation function c y mean value y variance σ y 2 and correlation scale in the ith direction λi where i 1 2 and 3 in this work we consider an anisotropic exponential covariance model for c y with a statistical anisotropic ratio f λv λ where λv λ 3 and λ λ 1 λ 2 4 c y r σ y 2 exp r 1 λ r 2 λ r 3 λ v with r r 1 r 2 r 3 denoting the lag distance the exponential model allows to use a compendium of analytical solutions for particle trajectory statistics previously derived see chapter 10 of rubin 2003 and references therein a solute is released into an aquifer from an initial location a ω where ω is the source zone volume as shown later the solute can be injected into the aquifer at different release rates the source zone volume has characteristic dimensions ℓ i along the ith direction transport is assumed to be purely advective as a consequence the risk estimates and corresponding uncertainty presented in this work are conservative local scale dispersion would smooth out concentration gradients thus reducing peak concentration values as well as the sample to sample fluctuations of the plume de barros and fiori 2014 fiori and dagan 2000 kapoor and kitanidis 1998 tonina and bellin 2008 for a given realization of the y field the solute discharge q at the cp can be written as fiori et al 2002 rubin 2003 5 q t τ l t o t ω m t a γ t t τ d t d a with τ denoting the solute travel time from the source to receptor e g control plane and m ml 3 t 1 represents the mass release strength the function γ accounts for reactive processes cvetkovic and dagan 1994 as explained in cvetkovic and dagan 1994 and chapter 10 of rubin 2003 the mathematical form of the function γ depends on specific reactive process and describes the modification of the migration of an instantaneous pulse injection with time due to chemical reactions the function m can be decomposed into m t a m o ζ a ϕ t where mo is the solute mass the spatial function ζ describes the spatial extent of the solute source whereas the temporal function ϕ characterizes the mass release rate from the source zone therefore eq 5 represents a convolution of γ with ϕ for the purpose of illustration we adopt a variation of the model reported in selroos 1997a b 6 ϕ t κ e κ t t o where to is the time of failure in the contaminant source zone set to zero for simplicity and κ is the release rate constant t 1 note that other release models can be employed if we were to assume an instantaneous release the release function becomes

represents the dirac delta function models for γ describing different reactions can be found in cvetkovic and dagan 1994 in addition we assume geological formations displaying low to mild heterogeneity i e σ y 2 1 which is in accordance with typical values reported in table 2 2 of rubin 2003 3 2 solute mass discharge uncertainty next we derive expressions to quantify the uncertainty of q under the conditions described in section 3 1 uncertainty in q will be estimated through its moments i e the mean and variance and cdf taking the ensemble expectation over all possible values of τ we obtain the expression for the mean solute mass discharge 7 μ q t l q t τ l τ q t τ l g 1 τ a l d τ where g 1 is the one particle travel time pdf and contains the effects of hydrogeological heterogeneity similarly we obtain the variance of the mass solute discharge at the cp 8 σ q 2 t l q t τ l 2 q t τ l 2 where the second moment is given by 9 q t τ l 2 τ τ q t τ l q t τ l g 2 τ τ a a l d τ d τ the function g 2 represents the two particle joint pdf cvetković et al 1992 dagan et al 1992 employing the assumptions described in section 3 1 and substituting eq 5 into 7 the expected value of the solute discharge at the cp becomes 10 μ q t l m o τ 0 t ω ϕ t δ a a o δ t t τ g 1 τ a l d t d a d τ m o a t where the function a t is defined as follows 11 a t 0 t ϕ t g 1 t t a o l d t inserting the expression for the mass release function ϕ eq 6 into 11 yields 12 a t κ 0 t e κ t g 1 t t a o l d t the derived result for the mean solute discharge 10 is identical to the solution obtained for an ergodic solute plume i e ℓ λ fiori et al 2015 our following step is to compute the second order moment of q using eq 5 and 9 the second moment of the solute discharge can be written as

overestimates the variance of the solute discharge if we were to consider a large source zone i e ℓ λ the plume would approach ergodicity and consequently transport becomes less subject to uncertainty therefore the expression obtained for the variance represents an upper bound on the uncertainty estimation the mean and variance of the solute discharge do not a provide complete characterization of the mass discharge uncertainty for such reasons it is necessary to compute the pdf or cdf since it provides information regarding probability of occurrence de barros and fiori 2014 boso and tartakovsky 2016 for the purpose of this work we assume that q is lognormally distributed parameterized with the mean 10 and variance 19 numerical studies report evidence that the flux averaged concentration and consequently the solute discharge see eqs 1 and 2 can be approximated by a lognormal pdf henri et al 2015 moslehi and de barros 2017 schwede and cirpka 2010 troldborg et al 2010 we provide additional support for this assumption in the appendix where a comparison between the lognormal pdf and the empirical pdf originating from monte carlo numerical simulations is included furthermore the lagrangian framework used in this work has been tested against numerical simulations hassan et al 2001 derived analytical solutions for the first two moments of the solute discharge originating from an instantaneous release into a 2d aquifer and successfully compared their results against numerical simulations under the lognormal pdf assumption the cdf of q i e pq becomes 20 p q q t l 1 2 1 2 erf ln q t l μ q t l σ q t l 2 which is parameterized with the following expressions 21 μ q t l ln μ q t l 1 σ q t l μ q t l 2 σ q 2 t l ln 1 σ q t l μ q t l 2 therefore the exceedance probability 3 becomes 22 ξ q t l 1 2 1 2 erf ln q t l μ q t l σ q t l 2 in many applications other sources of uncertainty exist e g source zone architecture and mass transfer coefficients which can be included following the approach of berglund and cvetkovic 1995 these uncertainties can be incorporated through marginalizing pq for example let ϑ denote a vector containing uncertain parameters and characterized by the joint pdf p ϑ ϑ hence the impact of parametric uncertainty originating from ϑ on the uncertainty of the solute discharge can be estimated as follows 23 p q q t l ϑ p q q t l ϑ p ϑ ϑ d ϑ 3 3 travel time pdf for a statistically anisotropic 3d porous formation in order to estimate the statistics of the mass discharge we need to compute the travel time pdf following cvetković et al 1992 we assume a lognormal distribution for the travel time pdf g 1 see also andričević and cvetković 1996 andričević et al 1994 persson and destouni 2009 selroos 1997a selroos 1997b this approximation is valid for small variances of y namely σ y 2 1 e g low to mild heterogeneous formations see ch 10 p 254 256 of rubin 2003 and is further supported by numerical simulations bellin et al 1994 gotovac et al 2009 an alternative model for the travel time pdf is the inverse gaussian fiori et al 2017 kreft and zuber 1978 the lognormal travel time pdf of a solute particle originating from the source zone to the cp is parameterized with the following expressions for the travel time mean τ and variance σ τ 2 andričević and cvetković 1996 cvetković et al 1992 rubin 2003 24 τ l u 25 σ τ 2 1 u 2 x 11 l u where x 11 is the one particle displacement covariance function other expressions for the travel time moments that incorporate higher order effects are available in the literature cvetkovic et al 1996 guadagnini et al 2003 sanchez vila and guadagnini 2005 under the assumption that σ y 2 1 and a statistically anisotropic ratio f 1 i e stratified formation cvetkovic et al 1998 showed that the one particle displacement covariance reduces to 26 x 11 t 2 σ y 2 λ 2 b b u t λ e b u t λ 1 where 27 b 1 19 f 2 10 f 4 16 f 2 1 2 f 13 4 f 2 16 1 f 2 f 2 1 arcsin 1 f 2 given that a lognormal pdf is adopted for g 1 it is not feasible to obtain a full analytical solution for the solute discharge moments namely eqs 10 and 19 and numerical integrations are required in order to compute the coefficients a and b see eqs 12 and 18 4 preliminary analysis in the fickian regime analytical expressions for μq and σ q 2 see eqs 10 and 19 can be obtained under the fickian regime i e x 1 λ and for an approximation for the travel time pdf g 1 at the large time limit equation 26 becomes x 11 2 σ y 2 λ u t see dagan 1984 and the travel time variance 25 can be simplified to σ τ 2 2 σ y 2 λ l u 2 high resolution numerical experiments reported in janković and fiori 2010 indicate that the fickian regime can be attained at x 1 20λ for levels of heterogeneity up to σ y 2 2 as for the travel time pdf we employ the gamma pdf 28 g 1 t 1 γ α β α t α 1 e t β with α and β denoting the shape and scale parameters where α τ 2 σ τ 2 and β σ τ 2 τ and γ is the gamma function the choice of 28 serves as a reasonable approximation for the lognormal distribution the gamma distribution has been used to quantify the travel time pdf in hill slope systems cvetkovic et al 2012 fiori and russo 2008 fiori et al 2009 as well as concentration breakthrough curves in catchments kirchner et al 2000 a comparison between the lognormal and gamma distributions parameterized by τ and σ τ 2 under the fickian limit is provided in fig 1 at two cp locations l 20 λ and 30λ as shown in fig 1 the gamma distribution represents a reasonable approximation for the lognormal pdf at large distances from the solute source zone using the gamma pdf we can derive closed form expressions for the coefficients a and b see eqs 12 and 18 in the fickian regime by inserting expression 28 into eqs 12 and 18 the integrations present in coefficients a and b can be solved analytically 29 a t κ e κ t γ l 2 α l t l 2 α l α l t u u α l 2 κ l 2 α l γ l 2 α l γ l 2 α l t u 2 α l κ 30 b t κ 2 e 2 κ t γ l 2 α l t l 2

macrodispersivity as defined by dagan 1984 note that the accuracy of 31 and 32 increases with distance l since at large distances the gamma pdf approaches the lognormal pdf see fig 1 we now investigate the interplay between aquifer heterogeneity manifested in αl and mass release rates on the low order moments of q in the fickian regime fig 2 illustrates the peak values of the mean q max and standard deviation σ q max as a function of l αl and κ these quantities are important for risk assessment and decision making as shown in fig 3 higher values of κ implies a faster solute release from the engineered barrier or source zone both the peak of the mean discharge fig 2 a and the peak standard deviation fig 2 b decreases with increasing l αl fig 2 clearly shows the significance of the mass release rate in controlling the uncertainty of the solute discharge we observe that the values of the peak discharge moments i e maximum values of the mean and standard deviation increase with the source zone mass release rate κ large values of κ indicate a faster release of the solute mass into the aquifer which leads to higher peak solute discharge moments on the other hand for lower release rates the plume is more dispersed along the longitudinal direction and therefore the values of the peak mean and standard deviation discharge reduce the effect of κ on the mean peak discharge becomes less pronounced with increasing values l αl fig 2 a for larger l the solute plume samples more heterogeneity and the memory effects originating from the source zone κ decrease as presented in fig 2 a the peak mean discharge tends to converge asymptotically for all values of κ at large l αl on the other hand the peak of the mass discharge standard deviation is strongly affected by the mass release rate at all l αl values see fig 2 b 5 results in this section we analyze how the mass release rate and the degree of heterogeneity affect the statistics of the solute discharge at different cps using the pre asymptotic particle trajectory covariance function 26 and the lognormal distribution for the travel time pdf parameterized by the mean 24 and variance 25 all upcoming results are displayed in terms of dimensionless numbers the dimensionless groups used in this section are 33 q q λ m o u σ q σ q λ m o u t t u λ l l λ κ λ u κ ϕ λ u ϕ fig 3 shows the normalized mass release function ϕ at the source zone see equation 6 for different values of κ higher values of κ indicate a faster release of solute mass from the engineered barrier whereas lower κ values implies slower mass release 5 1 low order moments the results depicted in figs 4 and 5 illustrate the effect of κ on the temporal evolution of the moments of q the normalized mean and standard deviation of q are computed at two cps located at l 5 and 20 see fig 4 a and b and fig 5 a and b juxtaposition of fig 4 a and b shows that the sensitivity of the mean solute discharge towards the mass release rate decreases with increasing distance l when l increases the plume samples more heterogeneity and memory effects stemming from source zone diminish therefore the mean solute discharge becomes less sensitive to κ at far distances from the source this is in agreement with the analytical results obtained under the fickian approximation depicted in fig 2 consequently the first order analysis carried out shows that improved characterization of the mass release rates at the source is important in the estimation of the mean mass discharge when the environmentally sensitive location is close to the source zone as shown in fig 4b the impact of the mass release rate on the mean mass discharge is not so evident for a cp located far from the source e g large values of l fig 5 illustrates the temporal evolution of the dimensionless standard deviation of q i e σ q as a function of the normalized mass release rate κ as opposed to fig 4 the standard deviation of q is strongly affected by the solute mass release rate at both cp locations explored the peak of the estimated solute mass discharge standard deviation decreases with κ at both l 5 and 20 see figs 5a and b this is further supported by the analytical results obtained under the fickian regime presented in fig 2b the results displayed in fig 5 also shows that the asymmetry in the temporal evolution of the standard deviation is more evident for l 5 when compared to the results obtained at l 20 next we investigate the peak expected value of the mass discharge as a function of the mass release rate at different cp locations namely l 5 10 and 20 fig 6 as the distance l increases the mean peak discharge decreases due to dilution see also fig 2a the results depicted in fig 6 also shows that the sensitivity of the peak mean mass discharge becomes less sensitive towards κ with increasing distance l the curves displayed in fig 6 show that the effect of κ on the peak mean discharge becomes negligible for κ 0 3 for a cp situated at l 20 this result is further supported by the fickian analysis carried out in fig 2a on the other hand when the cp is close to the source i e see curve for l 5 the mean peak discharge is more sensitive to changes in κ fig 6 5 2 occurrence probabilities and risk analysis in fig 7 we plot the exceedance probability ξ as defined in equation 22 for different values of solute mass release rates κ and compliance goals q c the exceedance probabilities displayed in fig 7a are computed at l 5 and t 5 whereas the results shown in fig 7 b are obtained at l 20 and t 20 as shown in fig 7 the exceedance probability is significantly impacted by the compliance goal q c and the distance l an increase in l from 5 to 20 leads to a remarkable decrease in the exceedance probability ξ for all values of q c compare figs 7a and b thus showing how the aquifer can act as a natural attenuating barrier this result shows how the methodology could be utilized to define a safe source receptor setback distance that complies with the requirements of a regulatory agency fig 7 also indicates the existence of a critical κ value where ξ approaches an asymptotic plateau this asymptotic value for ξ is achieved faster for lower values of q c previous results analyzed the combined effect of mass release rate and cp locations on the uncertainty of q next we will investigate the combined effect of heterogeneity epitomized by the log conductivity variance σ y 2 and mass release rates on the solute mass discharge cdf pq see eq 20 fig 8 displays the cdf for the normalized mass discharge for different values for κ and σ y 2 the results shown in fig 8a and b correspond to κ 0 25 and 1 respectively the effects of heterogeneity are not as pronounced on the mass discharge cdf when l 5 and κ 0 25 fig 8a as illustrated in fig 8a the impact of σ y 2 becomes noticeable when the distance between the source and cp increases compare curves for l 5 and 20 in fig 8a this is in agreement with physical intuition since higher heterogeneity larger σ y 2 leads to increased macro spreading of the plume and therefore l provides time for dispersion to act on the other hand fig 8b shows that the effects of natural heterogeneity is augmented at both cp locations when the source zone mass release rate increases from κ 0 25 to κ 1 the results displayed in fig 8 suggest that a slower mass release from the source zone may mask the effects of natural heterogeneity in the uncertainty of the mass discharge a temporally dispersed mass release at the source zone reduces the relevance of the arrival time uncertainty associated with natural heterogeneity this analysis highlights the importance of incorporating the proper mass release rate from the source zone or engineered barrier into the modeling framework since it can significantly impact the risk estimates and potentially the probability of the occurrence of extreme events e g high concentration values for the upcoming results we investigate how the mass release rate can impact the estimation of the required distance to achieve a maximum allowed probability of exceedance ξ determining this required distance also known as the safe setback distance between the contaminant source and the receptor is critical when designing waste disposal facilities and protecting water supply wells from contamination the concept of safe setback distances is also used to minimize the risks associated with microbial pollution molin et al 2010 an appealing aspect of the proposed solution is that it allows to determine the required distance to reach a maximum allowable exceedance probability as a function of several key parameters such as the injected mass the mass release rate at the source zone and the degree of heterogeneity of the conductivity field figs 9 and 10 illustrate the safe source receptor setback or required distance that meets a given regulatory standard for ξ both figs 9 and 10 show the probability that the solute discharge will exceed q c 0 1 value selected for the purpose of illustration as a function of normalized distance l at distinct times figs 9 and 10 show that we can estimate the required distance l for a given allowed ξ and time of interest as shown in figs 9 and 10 the mass release rate at the source zone has a profound impact of the exceedance probability 6 concluding remarks we derive new analytical and semi analytical solutions for the solute mass discharge uncertainty at a control plane for a 3d heterogeneous aquifer the solution incorporates the integrated effects of aquifer heterogeneity and solute mass release conditions through the use of the lagrangian framework semi closed expressions for the low order moments of the solute discharge are developed for a point like injection under the assumption of low to mild heterogeneity i e first order approximation in the log conductivity variance in addition we obtain full analytical expressions under the fickian approximation the results presented in this work indicate that the distance between the source and receptor i e control plane plays a key role in defining the relative importance of the parameters controlling the source zone mass release rate and the degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer on the overall mass discharge uncertainty the standard deviation of the mass discharge is strongly affected by the mass release rate at the source zone at all distances between the source and the receptor explored on the other hand the significance of the source zone mass release rate on the mean mass discharge reduces with increasing control plane distance under the context of risk assessment we illustrate how the peak expected solute discharge scales with on the mass release rate the semi analytical results indicate that when the solute is slowly released into the aquifer the effects of heterogeneity manifested through the log conductivity variance on the solute discharge uncertainty is diminished the methodological framework provides a transparent and relatively simple modeling tool that can be utilized for screening as well as regulatory purposes due to its analytical features the framework enables to quantify the propagation of uncertainty from both source zone release conditions e g engineered barriers and hydraulic conductivity to the final risk end point we showed how the solution can be used to estimate the required or setback distance between the source and receptor necessary to achieve an allowable exceedance probability this safe setback distance depends on the injected mass and release rates as well as the degree of heterogeneity of the aquifer moreover the solution allows to better engineer waste disposal facilities and safe setback distances that are aligned with regulatory standards given the analytical features of the framework the derived solutions for the mass discharge statistics can be linked to dose response curves as done in de barros and rubin 2008 to estimate adverse health effects on humans due to exposure to contaminated groundwater furthermore the proposed framework allows to condition predictions to hydrogeological measurements following the approach described in rubin and dagan 1992 and de barros et al 2012 other types of mass release functions can also be incorporated into the analysis the theoretical analysis carried out in this work provides additional insights into the complexities of making an informed management decision in the context of probabilistic risk analysis when accounting for the joint interactions between source zone characteristics and natural heterogeneity extending a similar analysis to aquifers displaying higher heterogeneity and non gaussian features may lead to many interesting conclusions when it comes to the interplay between natural heterogeneity and mass release rates the effects of well pumping operations can also impact the occurrence probabilities libera et al 2017a 2017b note that the developed lagrangian based solution can be extended to incorporate mass transfer mechanisms that can potentially describe rate limited chemical reactions and diffusion from immobile water regions accounting for these transport mechanisms in conjunction with heterogeneity in the permeability field is important in the context of remediation since they lead to tailing behavior in the solute breakthrough curve the commonly observed tails is mainly due to the large residence time of the solute in low conductivity zones using the same lagrangian framework adopted in this work berglund and cvetkovic 1995 coupled advective transport with rate limited mass transfer to predict clean up time in a pump and treat remediation of a stratified aquifer cvetkovic 2012 provides an extension of the lagrangian framework that incorporates both fickian and non fickian transport behavior caused by different mass transfer models however it is important to note the existence of alternative methodologies that are well suited to estimate the tailing of a plume such as multi rate mass transfer de barros et al 2013 carrera et al 1998 haggerty and gorelick 1995 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in this paper we did not consider the effects of local scale dispersion as shown in the literature local scale dispersion may play a significant role in risk analysis de barros and fiori 2014 libera et al 2017a expanding the semi analytical expressions to incorporate the effects of local scale dispersion can be done as shown in fiori et al 2002 local scale dispersion will smooth out concentration gradients which will reduce the peak mass discharge at the control plane however we point out that the effects of local scale dispersion on the statistics of mass discharge will be less pronounced when the area of the control plane is large when compared to the correlation length under these conditions the mixing effect induced by sampling becomes more relevant than local scale dispersion mechanisms it is important to emphasize that the point like approximation implies that all solute particles trajectories originating from the source zone and associated travel times are fully correlated this approximation together with the purely advective assumption adopted in this work overestimates the variance of the solute discharge acknowledgments this study

the pdf of the flux averaged concentration which is directly proportional to the solute discharge pdf see eq 2 to further support the choice of the lognormal pdf for the solute discharge we performed additional numerical simulations fig 11 depicts a comparison between the empirical pdf for the flux averaged concentration with the lognormal pdf at two cp locations l 5 and 10 the empirical pdf was obtained from monte carlo simulations a total of 500 realizations for flow and transport in a 3d aquifer characterized by f 1 σ y 2 1 and an exponential covariance function for y purely advective transport of a conservative tracer was simulated using the random walk particle tracking code reported in henri and fernàndez garcia 2014 salamon et al 2007 from the flux averaged concentration ensemble we estimated the empirical mean and variance these estimated parameters were used to fit a lognormal pdf model displayed in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the lognormal pdf model compares reasonably well with the empirical distribution 
809,this paper aims to develop new resilience type metrics for long term water resources management under uncertain climate change and population growth resilience is defined here as the ability of a water resources management system to bounce back i e absorb and then recover from a water deficit event restoring the normal system operation ten alternative metrics are proposed and analysed addressing a range of different resilience aspects including duration magnitude frequency and volume of related water deficit events the metrics were analysed on a real world case study of the bristol water supply system in the uk and compared with current practice the analyses included an examination of metrics sensitivity and correlation as well as a detailed examination into the behaviour of metrics during water deficit periods the results obtained suggest that multiple metrics which cover different aspects of resilience should be used simultaneously when assessing the resilience of a water resources management system leading to a more complete understanding of resilience compared with current practice approaches it was also observed that calculating the total duration of a water deficit period provided a clearer and more consistent indication of system performance compared to splitting the deficit periods into the time to reach and time to recover from the worst deficit events keywords resilience climate change adaptation water resources management water supply performance metrics reliability 1 introduction multiple modern decision making methodologies are currently being trialled for application to water resources management wrm adaptation planning under deep uncertainty however the output results from these adaptation investigations can be highly dependent on the performance metrics employed terms such as robustness or flexibility are typically used to define the performance or pliability of a water system or adaptation strategy across a broad range of future conditions or scenarios groves et al 2008 maier et al 2016 matrosov et al 2013 moody and brown 2013 smit et al 2000 however it is the performance metrics or criteria indicators that will define the performance of a water system to a single future scenario or set of conditions despite the widening range of decision making approaches under development the outputs from these methods are highly dependent on how the water resource system performance itself is evaluated for example how to define the assessment metrics applied to quantify the performance of a water system to a given future scenario and how this performance can vary over the range of potential futures uncertainties it is within these more practical engineering features that a wider knowledge gap is often over looked the more well known performance metrics often cited within wrm literature are those of hashimoto et al 1982 who were among the first to propose the use of the terms reliability vulnerability and resilience for water resource system performance evaluation these performance criteria in general refer to how likely a system is to fail its reliability how severe the consequences of failure might be its vulnerability and how quickly it can bounce back which is the recovery from a failure its resilience the term resilience has gathered particular traction in recent studies with the general agreement that resilience as a concept for wrm should go beyond its original hashimoto definition walker and salt 2006 are advocates for the idea of resilience thinking which ventures beyond the concepts of optimization to believed knowns but instead fosters the capacity to look at social ecological systems as a whole and incorporate diverse approaches to increase resilience to both expected and unexpected disturbances this resilience thinking was applied in seekell et al 2017 as an indicator based analysis to compare the sustainability of global food systems it was found that very few countries performed high or low for all indicators emphasizing the complexity of system dynamics and the varied information provided by different metrics resilience has been previously defined in both an ecological and engineering sense by holling 1996 who describes the more engineering aspects of resilience as ones of efficiency constancy and predictability and the more ecological ones as persistence change and unpredictability a combined appreciation of both aspects was recommended to improve overall resilient system design carpenter et al 2005 2001 furthered the social ecological understanding of resilience by defining it as the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a system moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes however they registered the difficulties in measuring the thresholds or boundaries between states in a complex system dynamic and concluded the need for improved surrogate metrics to bridge the gap between resilience theory and applied resilience lansey 2012 defined the resilience of a water distribution system as its ability to gracefully degrade and subsequently recover from a failure event walker et al 2004 discussed resilience under the original holling 1986 definition as the ability capacity of a system to return to an equilibrium or steady state after a disturbance to absorb shocks but still maintain function structure identity and feedbacks an in depth review of resilience concepts in the context of socio ecological systems was conducted by folke 2006 who discussed the policies of adaptive capacity and transformability to better inform on system resilience a detailed review of cross sector resilience measures was also conducted by hosseini et al 2016 and angeler and allen 2016 davidson et al 2016 furthered the idea of resilience thinking by presenting a range of original definitions and typologies of resilience interpretations concluding that we must be open to alternative traditions and interpretations if it resilience is to become a theoretically and operationally powerful paradigm several examples of resilience being used as a quantified performance metric criterion in water management include matrosov et al 2012 and paton et al 2014 who calculated resilience as the average duration of time a system is under a temporary restriction fowler et al 2003 calculated it as a fraction of the total future time a system is under an unsatisfactory state loucks 1997 calculated it as the probability of a system recovering once it enters an unsatisfactory state jung 2013 calculated it as a function of system failure severity and recovery time butler et al 2016 defines it in terms of minimising both the magnitude and duration of level of service failures over a systems design life yazdani et al 2011 characterised resilience as a more complex combined metric of four infrastructural qualities of robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity linkov et al 2014 recommended breaking the resilience management of systems down into an analysis of the time to absorb and then recover from adverse conditions via an assessment into the depth of loss of functionality during these detrimental periods kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 calculated resilience in three alternative ways the inverse of the mean value of the time the system spends in an unsatisfactory state the maximum duration of an unsatisfactory state and the duration of the 90th fractile of observed unsatisfactory periods they concluded that the maximum duration metric provided the most accurate and comprehensible estimation of performance a direct maximum duration calculation was also the resilience metric of choice by moy et al 1986 who selected it to enable and simplify the quantification of resilience and its incorporation into a mathematical programming model kundzewicz and kindler 1995 also argued that a resilience definition based on maximum value is better than one based on a mean value as the presence of small insignificant events may lower the mean value and present an inaccurate picture of actual overall system performance as research into resilience principles increases throughout the water industry it is important to begin to bridge the gap between theory and practice this study aims to select analyse and compare several of the more industry understood metrics i e those that could be readily applied to indicate the changing performance of a water resource system to uncertain future circumstances e g future system states the variation in resilience metrics explored previously several listed above highlights how the interpretation of resilience is wide ranging across the literature and that often only individual isolated aspects of water system performance are assessed without attention given to the full comprehensive picture of this complex issue this work assesses a more complete picture of resilience by evaluating multiple aspects of water system performance simultaneously whilst expressing the complexity of the resilience paradigm beyond a conceptual or theoretical definition may be difficult as discussed above a comparative analysis of the outputs of alternative resilience indicators metrics from a real world case study can help clarify the sensitivity and correlation between different potential criterions of performance validating whether multiple or a single metric is suitable to quantitatively assess water system resilience identifying a set of candidate metrics to define resilience would also be highly beneficial in consolidating wrm adaptation investigations outputs across the industry this paper explores and analyses ten performance metrics using a detailed simulation of a real world wrm case system the alternative metrics address a wide variety of potential resilience aspects that could be considered when evaluating a water supply system s resilience to uncertain climate change and population growth i e to uncertain future supply and demand over a pre specified long term time horizon 2 methodology 2 1 overview the objective is to select analyse and compare a range of different metrics that could be used to assess and indicate the resilience of a water resource management system the metrics measure system performance in terms of maintaining the long term supply demand balance when planning for uncertain climate change and or population growth the chosen metrics are tested on a real world case study incorporating a range of plausible future scenarios of supply and demand as well as the application of future adaptations to the system in order to assess the effect changes in the system state parameters have on the resilience metric outputs 2 2 resilience metrics characteristics in order to select a range of metrics for analysis first a set of desirable metric characteristics are explored derived by reviewing a range of wrm documents and reports defra 2011 2013 2016 environment agency 2013 2015 ukwir 2016 some characteristics of a good metric in the context of wrm are listed in table 1 in reference to the resilience of a water supply system in no particular order different definitions of resilience exist within wrm practice in the uk and no quantitative metrics are currently used ofwat 2015 ukwir 2016 water uk 2016 for the purpose of this paper and to be compatible with current uk engineering practice the resilience metrics introduced here below all relate to aspects surrounding threshold levels and trigger points of low water resource periods i e water deficit events given this resilience of a water resources management system to uncertain future changes in supply and or demand caused in turn by uncertain climate change and or population growth is defined here in the engineering resilience form holling 1996 i e as the recovery time of a system to return to equilibrium following a water deficit event but here also incorporating aspects of deficit magnitudes and frequency a water deficit event is defined as the point at which a water system requires a temporary water restriction to be put in place e g a temporary use ban due to a critical threshold of low resource being surpassed a water deficit period is defined as the period of consecutive days months that the water system remains in deficit avoiding the initiation of a water deficit period is a resistive quality of a system ideally a water resource system will have high resistance to deficits however this metric investigation concentrates on the resilient characteristics of a system i e the way a system reacts once its resistance has been broken the circumstances that entail a water deficit event occurring are dependent on the system under study for instance in the case study assessment to follow see section 3 a water deficit is counted if the stored water levels in the main system reservoirs fall below an unacceptable pre specified threshold trigger level on a given time step day or month a water deficit may be allowed to occur occasionally in order to manage the water supply system during periods of drought however a particularly severe deficit event or prolonged deficit periods could lead to unacceptable levels of restrictions and at worst a failed system inability to meet necessary demands 2 3 proposed resilience metrics the proposed resilience metrics are shown in table 2 and fig 1 the ten metrics were selected to cover the whole range of different assessment features of water deficit events periods i e duration magnitude frequency volume of water not delivered and because they encapsulate many of the highlighted characteristics of what would make a good resilience based performance metric for wrm adaptation planning see table 1 for instance the metrics are all quantitative rather than qualitative item 1 in table 1 are transparent in their direct calculation item 3 are highly specific i e do not encompass too many aspects into one calculation item 4 are industry focused i e can be used to quantitatively express the industries qualitative goals item 7 can be used to directly monitor and adapt strategic plans item 8 can be calculated to an exact non approximated figure during uncertainty future scenario examinations item 9 and can be easily standardised i e examined understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties item 11 a detailed assessment is carried out here on a real world case study to examine several quantitative aspects of suggested resilience metrics a comprehensive range of system performance water deficit aspects are examined item 2 in table 1 this included an assessment of metrics sensitivity item 10 with the aim to identify metrics that are more sensitive to different supply demand scenarios and adaptation strategies hence more useful to assess resilience in addition a correlation analysis was carried out to identify the minimum number of independent metrics required to characterise and quantify resilience item 5 the metric outputs are also evaluated as to how informative they are to decision makers item 12 in terms of their consistency of outputs over varying future scenarios uncertainties and whether they adequately provide an accurate picture of water deficit periods to ultimately identify a metric s of resilience that is are defensible against conventional practices item 6 3 case study bristol water currently manages a region in the south west of the uk supplying approx 1 2 million customers as of 2015 which is expected to experience increasing pressures on local water resources from rising populations with a 15 projected increase in demand by 2045 and increased climate variability that could cause further reductions in the availability of established resources the climate variability is primarily exacerbated by expected increasing annual temperatures leading to a greater variation in projected rainfall patterns ultimately leading to increased and more regular periods of drought conditions bristol water 2014 the existing water resources are shown in figure 2 and listed in table 3 they consist of a variety of sources with approximately half of the required supply coming from the river severn via the sharpness canal a third from reservoirs fed from the mendip hills and the remainder from small wells and springs throughout the supply area bristol water 2014 the bristol water resource zone is based upon the operation of the company area as a single resource zone this means that all water resources river groundwater and reservoirs within the company area are capable of being shared throughout the zone at all times of the year via a comprehensive pipe transfer network and using multiple water treatment works bristol water 2014 in this way no part of the zone is solely dependent upon the yield of a single water source the priority order for abstraction of each resource shown in table 3 is based on the bwrz system priority of use the primary river and groundwater sources are considered reliable and sustainable over the next planning period 2015 2039 following the results of bw s company wide climate change vulnerability assessment bristol water 2014 whereas the resource available from the mendip reservoirs is anticipated to be impacted by climate change there are three main components to the reservoir system to be modelled when projecting climate scenarios these are the mendip catchment region direct reservoir inflows the river axe at cheddar and the lake at chew magna see fig 2 the examination of the bristol water system in roach et al 2015 included the generation of multiple discrete future supply and demand scenarios utilising the future flow scenarios methodology prudhomme et al 2012 to model the reservoir components listed above and demand projections from bristol water s water resources management plan wrmp bristol water 2014 which were subsequently ordered into a range of severity the future flow projections provide 11 plausible realisations of future river flows at various sites across the uk that are then resampled multiple times to provide a range of variable future supply source inputs the demand projects produced by bristol water are derived from projections of low to high population growth and include additional variable factors such as potential changes in per capita consumption and metering levels in order to examine the sensitivity of the metrics across a range of uncertain future supply and demand scenarios a subset of these scenarios 20 supply and 3 demand scenarios of varying severity but fixed monthly values are selected at intervals from across the range of uncertainty using a systematic sampling approach this produced a total of 60 future scenario combinations of supply and demand for assessment purposes that encompass projections of low to high demand and low to high changes in future supply availability but ensuring that the more extreme projections are also included to see how the system responds to being stressed beyond what it has been designed to four adaptation strategies i e combinations of different intervention options sequenced over a planning horizon are selected for the evaluation of the metrics with the aim to assess how resilience metrics perform under these conditions a 25 year planning horizon is selected for the analysis in order to resemble current uk water company planning horizons alternative planning horizons could also be examined to ascertain the effect changing this variable has on the metric results however this is an area for further work the four adaptation strategies selected entail a varying degree of system adaption and include a strategy of no adaptation i e no intervention options applied across the planning horizon through to low moderate and high level adaptation where multiple intervention options are applied as detailed in table 4 each intervention option will carry a level of uncertainty in their projected deployable output do however a single fixed daily do has been assumed for this study to simplify the simulation model operation as the focus here is on analysing the metric results not on accounting for uncertainties the four adaptation strategies were applied to the existing bristol water system configuration and tested over the 60 future scenario combinations of supply and demand over a 25 year planning horizon the resulting water deficits and resilience metric values were then assessed in relation to each listed performance metric m1 m10 the above was done by using a dynamic water resource simulation model that simulates using a monthly time step the supply and demand balance of the bristol water wrz in the uk over a pre established time horizon 25 years the developed model simulates the existing bristol water system and is fully described in roach et al 2015 different adaptation strategies can be examined over different future scenarios of supply and demand and their performance analysed under each resilience indicator see table 2 this allows us to compare the performance of resilience metrics across varying adaptation strategies and future conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 resilience metrics analysis sensitivity assessment the aim of the metrics sensitivity analysis is to assess the response of each of the proposed metrics to a range of stresses in order to identify its performance in describing system resilience to do so the resilience metrics values are calculated for each adaptation strategy over each future scenario combination of supply and demand resulting in 60 individual results for each performance metric under each strategy box plots are then produced for each set of metric results in order to gauge the sensitivity of each metric across the scenarios representing uncertain future and across different increasing levels of adaptation applied to the system see fig 3 the following can be noted from fig 3 a most metrics median i e trend values reduce i e improve with increasing levels of adaptation but not always as can be seen with metric m6 where the number e g frequency of water deficit periods detected from low to high adaptation exhibit the same median and min to max values the increasing level of system adaptation reduces the duration and magnitude of the detected water deficit periods this however highlights the misperception that can arise from using frequency only based metrics that do not make a more detailed assessment of water deficit duration or absolute magnitude b the variation e g min to max and interquartile range of most of metric values also reduces with increasing level of adaptation although again not necessarily always e g m3 and m6 therefore utilising metrics m3 and m6 would likely only lead to the recommendation of a lower level of adaptation whereas applying the alternative metrics would lead to greater adaptation recommendations to increase overall system resilience metrics that are more sensitive to changing conditions are preferable to those that indicate little change in system performance see table 1 as sensitive metrics can provide a clear indication of system improvement or deterioration in contrast overly sensitive measurements might over estimate the improvement or deterioration in resilience suggesting that a moderate and uniform sensitivity is most preferable to evaluate the relative sensitivity of each potential resilience metric heat surface graphs are plotted which show the normalised sensitivity of each metric for each strategy for all scenarios fig 4 normalisation was carried out on a 0 1 range in the min max form all metrics recorded an output minimum of 0 therefore normalisation is carried out by dividing each scenario adaptation strategy output value by the maximum output value for each metric for example if a given metric output for scenario strategy combination a is 3 months and the largest output for this metric recorded across all scenario strategy combinations is 12 months then the normalised value for combination a is 0 25 each coloured cell on fig 4 represents one individual discrete future scenario of supply and demand adaptation strategy combination and its respective normalised value for each metric metrics m1 m10 are indexed along the horizontal x axis with four columns under each metric title displaying the results for adaptation strategies of no to high adaptation from left to right with the 60 supply demand scenarios indexed down the vertical y axis fig 4 illustrates how one given scenario can produce very different results when analysed to one metric rather than another it also shows that magnitude metrics m7 m9 are the most sensitive of all metrics and maintain the greatest sensitivity across the increasing adaptations to the system as shown in the largest spread of colours across the scenarios strategies the least sensitive metrics are time to water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and number of water deficit periods m6 the duration based metrics total time under water deficit m1 and the duration of the longest water deficit m2 maintain the greater sensitivity across the scenarios fig 4 also shows that metrics m3 m5 tend to cluster more often around common values for multiple scenarios demonstrated by colours showing less variation across scenarios and adaptation strategies making the difference in performance under each scenario or from one strategy to another harder to ascertain the variation in recorded performance for the time to reach m3 and recover from m4 a water deficit of greatest magnitude also often tend to fluctuate between scenarios as shown by colours not matching when moving from one scenario to the next this presents a problem if utilising metrics m3 and m4 individually as the time for the system to recover m4 may be of low duration under a given scenario leading a decision analyst to believe this strategy is performing well over this scenario however it may instead exhibit a long duration of time to reach the deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and vice versa fig 4 also highlights the considerable sensitivity variation between metric m6 and the other metrics with multiple mid high cells on the normalised scale appearing across the range of scenario strategy combinations making the overall performance of the water system under this metric difficult to clearly ascertain across the range of adaptations and scenarios this lack of sensitivity in the frequency based metric m6 is shown more clearly in fig 5 each coloured line in fig 5 depicts normalised metrics values for a specific scenario adaptation strategy combination the scenario lines on fig 5 illustrate again how the performance of an adaptation strategy to a given future scenario of supply and demand can produce very different results when analysed to one metric rather than another i e how the lines cross fig 5 displays the significant clustering low sensitivity of metrics m3 and m6 the lowest clustering high sensitivity possibly overly so for magnitude metrics m7 m9 and the moderate clustering for metrics m1 m2 and m4 demonstrating their more uniform moderate sensitivity to analysed scenarios and adaptation strategies to investigate the low variation of the time to reach water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and the performance of the alternative metrics the largest deficit periods within a selection of scenarios are isolated and given a more detailed assessment three scenarios are selected from across the scenario severity range and the longest water deficit periods are examined in more detail as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows how the time to reach the water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 is constant for most scenarios across the strategies and it is the time to recover from largest deficits m4 that is more variable it is only possible to observe the above when a water deficit period is separated into the absorption m3 and recovery m4 periods i e it is not possible to observe this when an aggregate type metric is used for resilience e g m1 m6 or m10 which is what is currently proposed in the literature and utilised in current practice in addition fig 6 shows that the duration of the longest water deficit metric m2 provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the complete water deficit period without separating out the time to and recovery from aspects of the deficit period which as mentioned previously can produce variable performance results in the two aspects across the scenarios finally fig 6 shows that the water deficit of greatest magnitude m7 although highlighted previously as being very sensitive which is good also exhibited a fairly uniform reduction across the three scenarios and four strategies this may not provide the most informative assessment of the deficit periods as they are shown to have a clearly non uniform variation in the changes in maximum durations of the deficit periods recorded m2 and time to recover m3 the maximum and average magnitudes of water deficits are slightly less variable by percentage change but are still good indicators of the adaptation impacts on system performance the short time to reach the point of greatest deficit magnitude exhibited in most scenarios followed by the longer duration of recovery time suggests it is individual severe drought months that cause initial water deficit periods to form which are then recovered from over time the follow up peaks shown in the high and medium scenarios are caused by repeated water scarcity conditions occurring later in the same deficit period note that the above cannot be captured by using a single frequency based or aggregated type resilience metric the above observations clearly demonstrate that the choice of metric s has implications on the choice of interventions to implement decision makers could decide that small or medium magnitude deficit events can be dealt with via water restrictions alone however unforeseen extended duration recovery times could be costly and more detrimental to the system and to customers and require more extensive interventions from this examination at least moderate to high adaptation to the case study system would be recommended to reduce water deficit periods of protracted duration over the more extreme projections i e the high demand increase high supply reduction scenario in fig 6 whereas only low adaptation may be recommended if targeting a reduction in the magnitude or frequency of water deficits this example illustrates how examining a more diverse range of resilience metrics can better inform policy makers and strategic planners 4 2 resilience metrics analysis correlation assessment in order to see how the duration magnitude and frequency metric values cross over and compare with each other the correlation between individual metric values obtained is explored this is important as using two highly correlated metrics for resilience assessment is not desirable fig 7 shows the correlation results obtained for the ten metrics analysed across the 60 supply demand scenarios and four adaptation strategies as it can be seen from this figure strong correlations tend to exist within groups of the same metrics types e g m7 m9 and weaker correlations tend to exist across different metric groups to further examine the above the coefficients of determination i e the r2 values of each metric correlation are calculated and shown in fig 8 note that the r2 values obtained indicate the proportion of variance between two variables and are scored between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating perfect correlation between two variables fig 8 a highlights the low correlation between the frequency of water deficit periods metric m6 with all other metrics this low statistical correlation with the other metrics indicates that there is low connection between the changing frequency of water deficit periods and the changing duration magnitude aspects however the frequency based metric was also shown to be the least sensitive metric which will inherently reduce the correlation exhibited between this metric and others as can be seen by the straight lines for m6 on fig 7 this suggests that metric m6 can provide important deficit information that other metrics do not encompass but also that it cannot predict other performance aspects so should not be used on its own fig 8 a also indicates again that the metrics with the highest correlation are those within the same group suggesting that using more than one metric from within the same group is unnecessary it also shows that the aggregated total volume metric m10 incorporating both magnitude and duration of deficits has the highest correlation with metric m2 this is suggesting that metric m2 can cover multiple performance aspects in a single criterion of performance further highlighting its potential as a comprehensive duration based metric and as a potential candidate for a wrm resilience measure taking the average of all r2 values for each metric reveals the most all encompassing indicators see fig 8 b it shows that metric m2 has the highest average r2 value again indicating that evaluation of this particular duration based metric provides a wider indication of more system performance aspects in a single assessment for example it demonstrates high correlation with the volume metric m10 mentioned above as well as all magnitude m7 m9 and other duration based metrics m1 m5 indicating it can best encompass these multiple individual assessment aspects in a single metric information not as well encompassed by the assessment of the other metrics as displayed in fig 8 b include metrics m3 m4 and m6 additional evaluations of these metrics would be required if the exact characterisation of the time to reach m3 and time to recover from m4 the worst magnitude deficits and the total number of water deficits experienced m6 was desired 5 conclusions ten different metrics that could be potentially used to characterise the resilience of a water resources management system to uncertain future changes i e a given scenario of supply and demand were investigated an in depth analysis of the metrics was carried out on a real world case study of bristol water s supply system including an examination of metric sensitivity and correlation and a detailed examination of the behaviour of water deficit periods the results obtained lead to the following key recommendations for the selection of an appropriate resilience based performance metric 1 simultaneous use of multiple metrics covering different aspects of resilience and related water deficit events is recommended this does not seem to be the case currently in the literature where typically a single metric is used to assess water system s resilience nor in engineering practice where quantitative resilience metrics are not used much if at all 2 metric m2 the duration of longest water deficit period metric was observed to be one of the more informative and comprehensive performance metrics followed closely by metric m7 the water deficit of greatest magnitude recorded metric however the analysis demonstrated a relatively high correlation between the two metrics and therefore considering just a single metric may prove sufficient to evaluate the resilience of a water resource system a duration based metric would be a more logical assessment metric to use of the two types as it is the duration of temporary water restrictions that most impact on customers and supply whereas the magnitude of water deficit events is of less direct concern to customers and water companies so long as the magnitude is maintained within acceptable threshold levels all this seems consistent with the resilience metric suggested by hashimoto et al 1982 now supported with actual evidence 3 frequency type resilience metrics m6 and in essence m1 cover important aspects information and would also prove beneficial to measure as emphasised by the low correlation between m6 and all other metrics however metric m6 was also found to be highly un sensitive and unable to capture the size of impact on the system from water deficit periods so should not be used on its own 4 aggregated type resilience metrics e g averaging metrics m5 m8 m9 or sum volume type metrics such as m10 are fairly sensitive to different adaptation strategies and supply demand scenarios but there is also a considerable uncertainty in their calculation due to their nature i e is it a single big or several small deficit periods occurring to give the final values making it harder to clarify exact adaptation strategy and system performance 5 magnitude type resilience metrics m7 m9 are highly sensitive and provide useful information especially in terms of proximity to critical threshold levels however they do not provide a full picture of deficit events periods 6 duration type resilience metrics are also highly sensitive with the duration of longest water deficit period metric m2 providing the more complete picture of a deficit event it is also the metric that exhibits the highest correlation to all other metrics splitting the duration of a water deficit period into the time to max peak deficit m3 and time to recover from max peak deficit m4 as suggested in linkov et al 2014 provides more detailed water deficit period information but the relative performance of each aspect tends to be highly variable when assessed across multiple scenarios of future supply and demand reducing the clarity of each as a consistent measure of performance the above findings are limited to the bristol case study analysed here the metrics proposed in the paper are generic and hence could be readily applied to improve the resilience analysis of any number of different water resource systems the drawback is that a dynamic water resources network simulation model with a daily or monthly timestep would be required to accurately measure them the effect of utilising a single duration resilience based metric or a single current practice frequency reliability based metric for wrm adaptation planning should be examined more in depth on additional case studies to derive if both or a single metric is sufficient for effective resilience assessment i e optimal adaptation planning the effect of utilising a daily rather than monthly time step could also be examined as this will likely favour some of the metrics over others i e a single month duration deficit recorded may theoretically have multiple frequency individual deficits occurring within this single month a potential aspect not captured in a monthly time step this investigation also centralised around water deficit periods to define and analyse the various resilience metrics further work could investigate the definition of resilience beyond these concepts and whether the metrics investigated here could be applied to alternative sectors or systems i e forms of ecosystem resilience acknowledgments this work was

809,this paper aims to develop new resilience type metrics for long term water resources management under uncertain climate change and population growth resilience is defined here as the ability of a water resources management system to bounce back i e absorb and then recover from a water deficit event restoring the normal system operation ten alternative metrics are proposed and analysed addressing a range of different resilience aspects including duration magnitude frequency and volume of related water deficit events the metrics were analysed on a real world case study of the bristol water supply system in the uk and compared with current practice the analyses included an examination of metrics sensitivity and correlation as well as a detailed examination into the behaviour of metrics during water deficit periods the results obtained suggest that multiple metrics which cover different aspects of resilience should be used simultaneously when assessing the resilience of a water resources management system leading to a more complete understanding of resilience compared with current practice approaches it was also observed that calculating the total duration of a water deficit period provided a clearer and more consistent indication of system performance compared to splitting the deficit periods into the time to reach and time to recover from the worst deficit events keywords resilience climate change adaptation water resources management water supply performance metrics reliability 1 introduction multiple modern decision making methodologies are currently being trialled for application to water resources management wrm adaptation planning under deep uncertainty however the output results from these adaptation investigations can be highly dependent on the performance metrics employed terms such as robustness or flexibility are typically used to define the performance or pliability of a water system or adaptation strategy across a broad range of future conditions or scenarios groves et al 2008 maier et al 2016 matrosov et al 2013 moody and brown 2013 smit et al 2000 however it is the performance metrics or criteria indicators that will define the performance of a water system to a single future scenario or set of conditions despite the widening range of decision making approaches under development the outputs from these methods are highly dependent on how the water resource system performance itself is evaluated for example how to define the assessment metrics applied to quantify the performance of a water system to a given future scenario and how this performance can vary over the range of potential futures uncertainties it is within these more practical engineering features that a wider knowledge gap is often over looked the more well known performance metrics often cited within wrm literature are those of hashimoto et al 1982 who were among the first to propose the use of the terms reliability vulnerability and resilience for water resource system performance evaluation these performance criteria in general refer to how likely a system is to fail its reliability how severe the consequences of failure might be its vulnerability and how quickly it can bounce back which is the recovery from a failure its resilience the term resilience has gathered particular traction in recent studies with the general agreement that resilience as a concept for wrm should go beyond its original hashimoto definition walker and salt 2006 are advocates for the idea of resilience thinking which ventures beyond the concepts of optimization to believed knowns but instead fosters the capacity to look at social ecological systems as a whole and incorporate diverse approaches to increase resilience to both expected and unexpected disturbances this resilience thinking was applied in seekell et al 2017 as an indicator based analysis to compare the sustainability of global food systems it was found that very few countries performed high or low for all indicators emphasizing the complexity of system dynamics and the varied information provided by different metrics resilience has been previously defined in both an ecological and engineering sense by holling 1996 who describes the more engineering aspects of resilience as ones of efficiency constancy and predictability and the more ecological ones as persistence change and unpredictability a combined appreciation of both aspects was recommended to improve overall resilient system design carpenter et al 2005 2001 furthered the social ecological understanding of resilience by defining it as the magnitude of disturbance that can be tolerated before a system moves to a different region of state space controlled by a different set of processes however they registered the difficulties in measuring the thresholds or boundaries between states in a complex system dynamic and concluded the need for improved surrogate metrics to bridge the gap between resilience theory and applied resilience lansey 2012 defined the resilience of a water distribution system as its ability to gracefully degrade and subsequently recover from a failure event walker et al 2004 discussed resilience under the original holling 1986 definition as the ability capacity of a system to return to an equilibrium or steady state after a disturbance to absorb shocks but still maintain function structure identity and feedbacks an in depth review of resilience concepts in the context of socio ecological systems was conducted by folke 2006 who discussed the policies of adaptive capacity and transformability to better inform on system resilience a detailed review of cross sector resilience measures was also conducted by hosseini et al 2016 and angeler and allen 2016 davidson et al 2016 furthered the idea of resilience thinking by presenting a range of original definitions and typologies of resilience interpretations concluding that we must be open to alternative traditions and interpretations if it resilience is to become a theoretically and operationally powerful paradigm several examples of resilience being used as a quantified performance metric criterion in water management include matrosov et al 2012 and paton et al 2014 who calculated resilience as the average duration of time a system is under a temporary restriction fowler et al 2003 calculated it as a fraction of the total future time a system is under an unsatisfactory state loucks 1997 calculated it as the probability of a system recovering once it enters an unsatisfactory state jung 2013 calculated it as a function of system failure severity and recovery time butler et al 2016 defines it in terms of minimising both the magnitude and duration of level of service failures over a systems design life yazdani et al 2011 characterised resilience as a more complex combined metric of four infrastructural qualities of robustness redundancy resourcefulness and rapidity linkov et al 2014 recommended breaking the resilience management of systems down into an analysis of the time to absorb and then recover from adverse conditions via an assessment into the depth of loss of functionality during these detrimental periods kjeldsen and rosbjerg 2004 calculated resilience in three alternative ways the inverse of the mean value of the time the system spends in an unsatisfactory state the maximum duration of an unsatisfactory state and the duration of the 90th fractile of observed unsatisfactory periods they concluded that the maximum duration metric provided the most accurate and comprehensible estimation of performance a direct maximum duration calculation was also the resilience metric of choice by moy et al 1986 who selected it to enable and simplify the quantification of resilience and its incorporation into a mathematical programming model kundzewicz and kindler 1995 also argued that a resilience definition based on maximum value is better than one based on a mean value as the presence of small insignificant events may lower the mean value and present an inaccurate picture of actual overall system performance as research into resilience principles increases throughout the water industry it is important to begin to bridge the gap between theory and practice this study aims to select analyse and compare several of the more industry understood metrics i e those that could be readily applied to indicate the changing performance of a water resource system to uncertain future circumstances e g future system states the variation in resilience metrics explored previously several listed above highlights how the interpretation of resilience is wide ranging across the literature and that often only individual isolated aspects of water system performance are assessed without attention given to the full comprehensive picture of this complex issue this work assesses a more complete picture of resilience by evaluating multiple aspects of water system performance simultaneously whilst expressing the complexity of the resilience paradigm beyond a conceptual or theoretical definition may be difficult as discussed above a comparative analysis of the outputs of alternative resilience indicators metrics from a real world case study can help clarify the sensitivity and correlation between different potential criterions of performance validating whether multiple or a single metric is suitable to quantitatively assess water system resilience identifying a set of candidate metrics to define resilience would also be highly beneficial in consolidating wrm adaptation investigations outputs across the industry this paper explores and analyses ten performance metrics using a detailed simulation of a real world wrm case system the alternative metrics address a wide variety of potential resilience aspects that could be considered when evaluating a water supply system s resilience to uncertain climate change and population growth i e to uncertain future supply and demand over a pre specified long term time horizon 2 methodology 2 1 overview the objective is to select analyse and compare a range of different metrics that could be used to assess and indicate the resilience of a water resource management system the metrics measure system performance in terms of maintaining the long term supply demand balance when planning for uncertain climate change and or population growth the chosen metrics are tested on a real world case study incorporating a range of plausible future scenarios of supply and demand as well as the application of future adaptations to the system in order to assess the effect changes in the system state parameters have on the resilience metric outputs 2 2 resilience metrics characteristics in order to select a range of metrics for analysis first a set of desirable metric characteristics are explored derived by reviewing a range of wrm documents and reports defra 2011 2013 2016 environment agency 2013 2015 ukwir 2016 some characteristics of a good metric in the context of wrm are listed in table 1 in reference to the resilience of a water supply system in no particular order different definitions of resilience exist within wrm practice in the uk and no quantitative metrics are currently used ofwat 2015 ukwir 2016 water uk 2016 for the purpose of this paper and to be compatible with current uk engineering practice the resilience metrics introduced here below all relate to aspects surrounding threshold levels and trigger points of low water resource periods i e water deficit events given this resilience of a water resources management system to uncertain future changes in supply and or demand caused in turn by uncertain climate change and or population growth is defined here in the engineering resilience form holling 1996 i e as the recovery time of a system to return to equilibrium following a water deficit event but here also incorporating aspects of deficit magnitudes and frequency a water deficit event is defined as the point at which a water system requires a temporary water restriction to be put in place e g a temporary use ban due to a critical threshold of low resource being surpassed a water deficit period is defined as the period of consecutive days months that the water system remains in deficit avoiding the initiation of a water deficit period is a resistive quality of a system ideally a water resource system will have high resistance to deficits however this metric investigation concentrates on the resilient characteristics of a system i e the way a system reacts once its resistance has been broken the circumstances that entail a water deficit event occurring are dependent on the system under study for instance in the case study assessment to follow see section 3 a water deficit is counted if the stored water levels in the main system reservoirs fall below an unacceptable pre specified threshold trigger level on a given time step day or month a water deficit may be allowed to occur occasionally in order to manage the water supply system during periods of drought however a particularly severe deficit event or prolonged deficit periods could lead to unacceptable levels of restrictions and at worst a failed system inability to meet necessary demands 2 3 proposed resilience metrics the proposed resilience metrics are shown in table 2 and fig 1 the ten metrics were selected to cover the whole range of different assessment features of water deficit events periods i e duration magnitude frequency volume of water not delivered and because they encapsulate many of the highlighted characteristics of what would make a good resilience based performance metric for wrm adaptation planning see table 1 for instance the metrics are all quantitative rather than qualitative item 1 in table 1 are transparent in their direct calculation item 3 are highly specific i e do not encompass too many aspects into one calculation item 4 are industry focused i e can be used to quantitatively express the industries qualitative goals item 7 can be used to directly monitor and adapt strategic plans item 8 can be calculated to an exact non approximated figure during uncertainty future scenario examinations item 9 and can be easily standardised i e examined understood and agreed upon by all relevant parties item 11 a detailed assessment is carried out here on a real world case study to examine several quantitative aspects of suggested resilience metrics a comprehensive range of system performance water deficit aspects are examined item 2 in table 1 this included an assessment of metrics sensitivity item 10 with the aim to identify metrics that are more sensitive to different supply demand scenarios and adaptation strategies hence more useful to assess resilience in addition a correlation analysis was carried out to identify the minimum

consistency of outputs over varying future scenarios uncertainties and whether they adequately provide an accurate picture of water deficit periods to ultimately identify a metric s of resilience that is are defensible against conventional practices item 6 3 case study bristol water currently manages a region in the south west of the uk supplying approx 1 2 million customers as of 2015 which is expected to experience increasing pressures on local water resources from rising populations with a 15 projected increase in demand by 2045 and increased climate variability that could cause further reductions in the availability of established resources the climate variability is primarily exacerbated by expected increasing annual temperatures leading to a greater variation in projected rainfall patterns ultimately leading to increased and more regular periods of drought conditions bristol water 2014 the existing water resources are shown in figure 2 and listed in table 3 they consist of a variety of sources with approximately half of the required supply coming from the river severn via the sharpness canal a third from reservoirs fed from the mendip hills and the remainder from small wells and springs throughout the supply area bristol water 2014 the bristol water resource zone is based upon the operation of the company area as a single resource zone this means that all water resources river groundwater and reservoirs within the company area are capable of being shared throughout the zone at all times of the year via a comprehensive pipe transfer network and using multiple water treatment works bristol water 2014 in this way no part of the zone is solely dependent upon the yield of a single water source the priority order for abstraction of each resource shown in table 3 is based on the bwrz system priority of use the primary river and groundwater sources are considered reliable and sustainable over the next planning period 2015 2039 following the results of bw s company wide climate change vulnerability assessment bristol water 2014 whereas the resource available from the mendip reservoirs is anticipated to be impacted by climate change there are three main components to the reservoir system to be modelled when projecting climate scenarios these are the mendip catchment region direct reservoir inflows the river axe at cheddar and the lake at chew magna see fig 2 the examination of the bristol water system in roach et al 2015 included the generation of multiple discrete future supply and demand scenarios utilising the future flow scenarios methodology prudhomme et al 2012 to model the reservoir components listed above and demand projections from bristol water s water resources management plan wrmp bristol water 2014 which were subsequently ordered into a range of severity the future flow projections provide 11 plausible realisations of future river flows at various sites across the uk that are then resampled multiple times to provide a range of variable future supply source inputs the demand projects produced by bristol water are derived from projections of low to high population growth and include additional variable factors such as potential changes in per capita consumption and metering levels in order to examine the sensitivity of the metrics across a range of uncertain future supply and demand scenarios a subset of these scenarios 20 supply and 3 demand scenarios of varying severity but fixed monthly values are selected at intervals from across the range of uncertainty using a systematic sampling approach this produced a total of 60 future scenario combinations of supply and demand for assessment purposes that encompass projections of low to high demand and low to high changes in future supply availability but ensuring that the more extreme projections are also included to see how the system responds to being stressed beyond what it has been designed to four adaptation strategies i e combinations of different intervention options sequenced over a planning horizon are selected for the evaluation of the metrics with the aim to assess how resilience metrics perform under these conditions a 25 year planning horizon is selected for the analysis in order to resemble current uk water company planning horizons alternative planning horizons could also be examined to ascertain the effect changing this variable has on the metric results however this is an area for further work the four adaptation strategies selected entail a varying degree of system adaption and include a strategy of no adaptation i e no intervention options applied across the planning horizon through to low moderate and high level adaptation where multiple intervention options are applied as detailed in table 4 each intervention option will carry a level of uncertainty in their projected deployable output do however a single fixed daily do has been assumed for this study to simplify the simulation model operation as the focus here is on analysing the metric results not on accounting for uncertainties the four adaptation strategies were applied to the existing bristol water system configuration and tested over the 60 future scenario combinations of supply and demand over a 25 year planning horizon the resulting water deficits and resilience metric values were then assessed in relation to each listed performance metric m1 m10 the above was done by using a dynamic water resource simulation model that simulates using a monthly time step the supply and demand balance of the bristol water wrz in the uk over a pre established time horizon 25 years the developed model simulates the existing bristol water system and is fully described in roach et al 2015 different adaptation strategies can be examined over different future scenarios of supply and demand and their performance analysed under each resilience indicator see table 2 this allows us to compare the performance of resilience metrics across varying adaptation strategies and future conditions 4 results and discussion 4 1 resilience metrics analysis sensitivity assessment the aim of the metrics sensitivity analysis is to assess the response of each of the proposed metrics to a range of stresses in order to identify its performance in describing system resilience to do so the resilience metrics values are calculated for each adaptation strategy over each future scenario combination of supply and demand resulting in 60 individual results for each performance metric under each strategy box plots are then produced for each set of metric results in order to gauge the sensitivity of each metric across the scenarios representing uncertain future and across different increasing levels of adaptation applied to the system see fig 3 the following can be noted from fig 3 a most metrics median i e trend values reduce i e improve with increasing levels of adaptation but not always as can be seen with metric m6 where the number e g frequency of water deficit periods detected from low to high adaptation exhibit the same median and min to max values the increasing level of system adaptation reduces the duration and magnitude of the detected water deficit periods this however highlights the misperception that can arise from using frequency only based metrics that do not make a more detailed assessment of water deficit duration or absolute magnitude b the variation e g min to max and interquartile range of most of metric values also reduces with increasing level of adaptation although again not necessarily always e g m3 and m6 therefore utilising metrics m3 and m6 would likely only lead to the recommendation of a lower level of adaptation whereas applying the alternative metrics would lead to greater adaptation recommendations to increase overall system resilience metrics that are more sensitive to changing conditions are preferable to those that indicate little change in system performance see table 1 as sensitive metrics can provide a clear indication of system improvement or deterioration in contrast overly sensitive measurements might over estimate the improvement or deterioration in resilience suggesting that a moderate and uniform sensitivity is most preferable to evaluate the relative sensitivity of each potential resilience metric heat surface graphs are plotted which show the normalised sensitivity of each metric for each strategy for all scenarios fig 4 normalisation was carried out on a 0 1 range in the min max form all metrics recorded an output minimum of 0 therefore normalisation is carried out by dividing each scenario adaptation strategy output value by the maximum output value for each metric for example if a given metric output for scenario strategy combination a is 3 months and the largest output for this metric recorded across all scenario strategy combinations is 12 months then the normalised value for combination a is 0 25 each coloured cell on fig 4 represents one individual discrete future scenario of supply and demand adaptation strategy combination and its respective normalised value for each metric metrics m1 m10 are indexed along the horizontal x axis with four columns under each metric title displaying the results for adaptation strategies of no to high adaptation from left to right with the 60 supply demand scenarios indexed down the vertical y axis fig 4 illustrates how one given scenario can produce very different results when analysed to one metric rather than another it also shows that magnitude metrics m7 m9 are the most sensitive of all metrics and maintain the greatest sensitivity across the increasing adaptations to the system as shown in the largest spread of colours across the scenarios strategies the least sensitive metrics are time to water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and number of water deficit periods m6 the duration based metrics total time under water deficit m1 and the duration of the longest water deficit m2 maintain the greater sensitivity across the scenarios fig 4 also shows that metrics m3 m5 tend to cluster more often around common values for multiple scenarios demonstrated by colours showing less variation across scenarios and adaptation strategies making the difference in performance under each scenario or from one strategy to another harder to ascertain the variation in recorded performance for the time to reach m3 and recover from m4 a water deficit of greatest magnitude also often tend to fluctuate between scenarios as shown by colours not matching when moving from one scenario to the next this presents a problem if utilising metrics m3 and m4 individually as the time for the system to recover m4 may be of low duration under a given scenario leading a decision analyst to believe this strategy is performing well over this scenario however it may instead exhibit a long duration of time to reach the deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and vice versa fig 4 also highlights the considerable sensitivity variation between metric m6 and the other metrics with multiple mid high cells on the normalised scale appearing across the range of scenario strategy combinations making the overall performance of the water system under this metric difficult to clearly ascertain across the range of adaptations and scenarios this lack of sensitivity in the frequency based metric m6 is shown more clearly in fig 5 each coloured line in fig 5 depicts normalised metrics values for a specific scenario adaptation strategy combination the scenario lines on fig 5 illustrate again how the performance of an adaptation strategy to a given future scenario of supply and demand can produce very different results when analysed to one metric rather than another i e how the lines cross fig 5 displays the significant clustering low sensitivity of metrics m3 and m6 the lowest clustering high sensitivity possibly overly so for magnitude metrics m7 m9 and the moderate clustering for metrics m1 m2 and m4 demonstrating their more uniform moderate sensitivity to analysed scenarios and adaptation strategies to investigate the low variation of the time to reach water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 and the performance of the alternative metrics the largest deficit periods within a selection of scenarios are isolated and given a more detailed assessment three scenarios are selected from across the scenario severity range and the longest water deficit periods are examined in more detail as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows how the time to reach the water deficit of greatest magnitude m3 is constant for most scenarios across the strategies and it is the time to recover from largest deficits m4 that is more variable it is only possible to observe the above when a water deficit period is separated into the absorption m3 and recovery m4 periods i e it is not possible to observe this when an aggregate type metric is used for resilience e g m1 m6 or m10 which is what is currently proposed in the literature and utilised in current practice in addition fig 6 shows that the duration of the longest water deficit metric m2 provides a fairly comprehensive picture of the complete water deficit period without separating out the time to and recovery from aspects of the deficit period which as mentioned previously can produce variable performance results in the two aspects across the scenarios finally fig 6 shows that the water deficit of greatest magnitude m7 although highlighted previously as being very sensitive which is good also exhibited a fairly uniform reduction across the three scenarios and four strategies this may not provide the most informative assessment of the deficit periods as they are shown to have a clearly non uniform variation in the changes in maximum durations of the deficit periods recorded m2 and time to recover m3 the maximum and average magnitudes of water deficits are slightly less variable by percentage change but are still good indicators of the adaptation impacts on system performance the short time to reach the point of greatest deficit magnitude exhibited in most scenarios followed by the longer duration of recovery time suggests it is individual severe drought months that cause initial water deficit periods to form which are then recovered from over time the follow up peaks shown in the high and medium scenarios are caused by repeated water scarcity conditions occurring later in the same deficit period note that the above cannot be captured by using a single frequency based or aggregated type resilience metric the above observations clearly demonstrate that the choice of metric s has implications on the choice of interventions to implement decision makers could decide that small or medium magnitude deficit events can be dealt with via water restrictions alone however unforeseen extended duration recovery times could be costly and more detrimental to the system and to customers and require more extensive interventions from this examination at least moderate to high adaptation to the case study system would be recommended to reduce water deficit periods of protracted duration over the more extreme projections i e the high demand increase high supply reduction scenario in fig 6 whereas only low adaptation may be recommended if targeting a reduction in the magnitude or frequency of water deficits this example illustrates how examining a more diverse range of resilience metrics can better inform policy makers and strategic planners 4 2 resilience metrics analysis correlation assessment in order to see how the duration magnitude and frequency metric values cross over and compare with each other the correlation between individual metric values obtained is explored this is important as using two highly correlated metrics for resilience assessment is not desirable fig 7 shows the correlation results obtained for the ten metrics analysed across the 60 supply demand scenarios and four adaptation strategies as it can be seen from this figure strong correlations tend to exist within groups of the same metrics types e g m7 m9 and weaker correlations tend to exist across different metric groups to further examine the above the coefficients of determination i e the r2 values of each metric correlation are calculated and shown in fig 8 note that the r2 values obtained indicate the proportion of variance between two variables and are scored between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating perfect correlation between two variables fig 8 a highlights the low correlation between the frequency of water deficit periods metric m6 with all other metrics this low statistical correlation with the other metrics indicates that there is low connection between the changing frequency of water deficit periods and the changing duration magnitude aspects however the frequency based metric was also shown to be the least sensitive metric which will inherently reduce the correlation exhibited between this metric and others as can be seen by the straight lines for m6 on fig 7 this suggests that metric m6 can provide important deficit information that other metrics do not encompass but also that it cannot predict other performance aspects so should not be used on its own fig 8 a also indicates again that the metrics with the highest correlation are those within the same group suggesting that using more than one metric from within the same group is unnecessary it also shows that the aggregated total volume metric m10 incorporating both magnitude and duration of deficits has the highest correlation with metric m2 this is suggesting that metric m2 can cover multiple performance aspects in a single criterion of performance further highlighting its potential as a comprehensive duration based metric and as a potential candidate for a wrm resilience measure taking the average of all r2 values for each metric reveals the most all encompassing indicators see fig 8 b it shows that metric m2 has the highest average r2 value again indicating that evaluation of this particular duration based metric provides a wider indication of more system performance aspects in a single assessment for example it demonstrates high correlation with the volume metric m10 mentioned above as well as all magnitude m7 m9 and other duration based metrics m1 m5 indicating it can best encompass these multiple individual assessment aspects in a single metric information not as well encompassed by the assessment of the other metrics as displayed in fig 8 b include metrics m3 m4 and m6 additional evaluations of these metrics would be required if the exact characterisation of the time to reach m3 and time to recover from m4 the worst magnitude deficits and the total number of water deficits experienced m6 was desired 5 conclusions ten different metrics that could be potentially used to characterise the resilience of a water resources management system to uncertain future changes i e a given scenario of supply and demand were investigated an in depth analysis of the metrics was carried out on a real world case study of bristol water s supply system including an examination of metric sensitivity and correlation and a detailed examination of the behaviour of water deficit periods the results obtained lead to the following key recommendations for the selection of an appropriate resilience based performance metric 1 simultaneous use of multiple metrics covering different aspects of resilience and related water deficit events is recommended this does not seem to be the case currently in the literature where typically a single metric is used to assess water system s resilience nor in engineering practice where quantitative resilience metrics are not used much if at all 2 metric m2 the duration of longest water deficit period metric was observed to be one of the more informative and comprehensive performance metrics followed closely by metric m7 the water deficit of greatest magnitude recorded metric however the analysis demonstrated a relatively high correlation between the two metrics and therefore considering just a single metric may prove sufficient to evaluate the resilience of a water resource system a duration based metric would be a more logical assessment metric to use of the two types as it is the duration of temporary water restrictions that most impact on customers and supply whereas the magnitude of water deficit events is of less direct concern to customers and water companies so long as the magnitude is maintained within acceptable threshold levels all this seems consistent with the resilience metric suggested by hashimoto et al 1982 now supported with actual evidence 3 frequency type resilience metrics m6 and in essence m1 cover important aspects information and would also prove beneficial to measure as emphasised by the low correlation between m6 and all other metrics however metric m6 was also found to be highly un sensitive and unable to capture the size of impact on the system from water deficit periods so should not be used on its own 4 aggregated type resilience metrics e g averaging metrics m5 m8 m9 or sum volume type metrics such as m10 are fairly sensitive to different adaptation strategies and supply demand scenarios but there is also a considerable uncertainty in their calculation due to their nature i e is it a single big or several small deficit periods occurring to give the final values making it harder to clarify exact adaptation strategy and system performance 5 magnitude type resilience metrics m7 m9 are highly sensitive and provide useful information especially in terms of proximity to critical threshold levels however they do not provide a full picture of deficit events periods 6 duration type resilience metrics are also highly sensitive with the duration of longest water deficit period metric m2 providing the more complete picture of a deficit event it is also the metric that exhibits the highest correlation to all other metrics splitting the duration of a water deficit period into the time to max peak deficit m3 and time to recover from max peak deficit m4 as suggested in linkov et al 2014 provides more detailed water deficit period information but the relative performance of each aspect tends to be highly variable when assessed across multiple scenarios of future supply and demand reducing the clarity of each as a consistent measure of performance the above findings are limited to the bristol case study analysed here the metrics proposed in the paper are generic and hence could be readily applied to improve the resilience analysis of any number of different water resource systems the drawback is that a dynamic water resources network simulation model with a daily or monthly timestep would be required to accurately measure them the effect of utilising a single duration resilience based metric or a single current practice frequency reliability based metric for wrm adaptation planning should be examined more in depth on additional case studies to derive if both or a single metric is sufficient for effective resilience assessment i e optimal adaptation planning the effect of utilising a daily rather than monthly time step could also be examined as this will likely favour some of the metrics over others i e a single month duration deficit recorded may theoretically have multiple frequency individual deficits occurring within this single month a potential aspect not captured in a monthly time step this investigation also centralised around water deficit periods to define and analyse the various resilience metrics further work could investigate the definition of resilience beyond these concepts and whether the metrics investigated here could be applied to alternative sectors or systems i e forms of ecosystem resilience acknowledgments this work was
