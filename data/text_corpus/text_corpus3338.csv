16690,given that fluoroquinolone antibiotics fqs are frequently detected in aquatic environments there is an urgent need for the development of efficient water treatment technologies for their removal peracetic acid paa based advanced oxidation processes aops have increasingly attracted attention as promising technologies for water decontamination in this regard in this study a novel paa based aop the medium pressure ultraviolet mpuv paa process was employed to degrade norfloxacin nor which is an extensively applied fq that is widely present in water mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of ph on this nor degradation process were investigated the results obtained showed that the mpuv paa process could effectively degrade nor ph 5 9 and the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced at ph 7 and 9 compared with that at ph 5 this observation could be attributed to the effect of ph on the ionic forms of nor and the generation of reactive oxygen species ros further the rate of paa photolysis which resulted in the formation of reactive radicals increased with ph as evidenced by the observed increase in the molar absorption coefficient of paa εpaa electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests also indicated that the generation of ros was significantly enhanced when the ph increased from 5 to 7 and at ph 9 a large amount of oh were possibly consumed by paa to form organic radicals leading to a decrease in the oh signal furthermore it was observed that oh is primarily responsible for nor degradation in the mpuv paa process at ph 5 whereas organic radicals were primarily responsible for the degradation at ph 7 and 9 the identification of the transformation products tps led to the observation of different nor transformation pathways owing to the mpuv paa process under different ph conditions overall this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of ph on the mpuv paa degradation behavior of fqs graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone degradation reactive oxygen species peracetic acid advanced oxidation processes medium pressure uv 1 introduction since the advent of penicillin in 1929 the use of antibiotics in medicine aquaculture and livestock husbandry has become widespread however their overuse and abuse has contributed to the rise in the number of drug resistant superbugs specifically fluoroquinolones fqs are an important class of synthetic antimicrobials for human livestock and aquaculture disease control owing to their partial metabolism in human beings and slow degradation in natural environments the majority of consumed fqs are excreted into the environment in unchanged and active forms van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs are ubiquitous in various aquatic environments including surface water hao et al 2015 groundwater and wastewater at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in addition to inducing antibiotic resistance at even low concentrations oliveira et al 2020 fqs can directly result in non negligible adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic organisms li et al 2017 song et al 2017 wan et al 2020 furthermore mixtures of fqs with other antibiotics can exert growth inhibiting effects and genotoxicity in aquatic species gonzalez pleiter et al 2013 zounkova et al 2011 however due to the bioresistant properties and recalcitrant character of fqs adjei et al 2006 achieving a high fq removal efficiency via conventional water treatment processes e g biodegradation coagulation and sedimentation is difficult xu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 thus the immediate development of efficient treatment technologies for their removal from aquatic environments is a pressing priority advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied extensively and their application has been proposed for the degradation of emerging pollutants in water and wastewater these aops which include a large variety of technologies such as fenton like oxidation ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation are based on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl and sulfate radicals further peroxides including h2o2 ozone persulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have also been widely employed in aops given that their activation using energy e g uv and heat or catalysts e g transition metals can lead to the generation of ros specifically peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh which is an organic peroxide that has been increasingly applied to realize water wastewater disinfection has also attracted increasing interest as an agent from which ros for the aops can be generated to ensure the enhanced disinfection or degradation of micropollutants paa is a strong oxidizing agent with a high standard reduction potential of 1 0 1 96 v with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode she which is close to that of h2o2 e0 1 8 v however its o o bond is longer than that of h2o2 resulting in the requirement of a lower amount of energy for cleavage and in disinfection processes some of its advantages include the generation of nontoxic disinfection by products and its exhibition of a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity similar to chlorine this makes it a promising chlorine alternative in aops owing to its weak o o bond paa can be activated to generate ros with high oxidation ability via various activation methods including uv solar light irradiation ultrasound or catalysis metal ions activated carbon activation among paa based aops the uv paa process has gained increasing attention owing to its field applications traditionally uv treatment has been employed to realize drinking water and wastewater effluent disinfection and uv driven aops are considered to be simple clean and cost effective technologies that often generate dual benefits decontamination and disinfection to end users possibly the uv paa process predominantly generates organic per oxyl radicals e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and hydroxyl radicals oh both of which can contribute to the degradation of organic compounds in water ao et al 2021 caretti and lubello 2003 constructed a pilot plant and conducted a five month long study to evaluate the synergy between paa and uv when disinfecting wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent their results indicated that the disinfection efficacy was enhanced during the uv paa process while a much higher degradation efficacy was obtained during the paa uv process denoted as uv paa this higher treatment efficiency could be attributed to the formation of reactive radicals therefore the uv paa process may provide a new strategy for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms during water treatment recently some researchers used uv to activate paa and achieved good efficiency in the degradation of some micro organic pollutants in water including phenols sharma et al 2014 and pharmaceuticals cai et al 2017 hollman et al 2020 rizzo et al 2018 these successful applications indicated that the uv paa process can also be a promising technology for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern from water as a novel aop a systematic investigation of the feasibility of the uv paa process for the degradation of contaminants in water especially emerging contaminants is urgently needed however studies on applications of the uv paa process to degrade micro organic pollutants are still rather scarce to comprehensively understand the uv paa technology it would be necessary to determine the degradation kinetics and mechanisms and also clarify the influence of operational conditions and the characteristics of the water matrix on the performance of the process zhang and huang 2020 developed a model to elucidate the associated reaction mechanisms and simulate the reaction kinetics of the uv paa process which can be applied under neutral and slightly acidic ph conditions ph 5 8 7 2 further chen et al 2019 investigated the effect of the contents of the water matrix such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions humic acid and chloride ions on the degradation of naproxen via the uv paa process however the impact of some key factors such as ph on the degradation of contaminants during the uv paa process is still unclear and before any practical application of this novel aop it would be necessary to determine its most appropriate design and clarify the effect of operational variables including ph on its performance in aops ph is one of the most important parameters and plays an essential role in determining the chemistry of radicals catalysts oxidants and target compounds however its effects on the degradation of target compounds during the uv paa process have received little attention zhang et al 2020 indicated that the degradation of diclofenac using the uv paa process is ph dependent and the best degradation efficiency was obtained at a ph of 8 5 further zhang et al 2021 observed that using the uv paa system ph has little effect on the degradation of chloroanisoles but had some effect on the degradation of bromoanisole therefore there is still much uncertainty regarding the role of ph in the uv paa process first the effect of ph on the degradation kinetics and the reactive radical species that are involved in the uv paa process is unknown moreover it is also unclear whether ph influences the degradation pathways of the target compounds therefore in this study the feasibility of using the uv paa process for the removal of fqs from water was investigated for the first time and nor which is one of the most frequently detected fq in aquatic environments was chosen as the target compound a medium pressure ultraviolet mpuv lamp was used as a light source for the uv paa system and compared with low pressure uv lamps emitting uv light with a wavelength of 254 nm mpuv lamps are often employed for full scale applications given that their higher output power leads to a relatively smaller photoreactor size moreover as a polychromatic lamp emitting uv light with wavelengths in the range 200 400 nm mpuv lamps are generally more effective than low pressure uv lpuv lamps with respect to the photodegradation of organic pollutants this is because its light output spectrum possibly correlates well with the absorption spectrum of the target pollutants to the best of our knowledge until now the mpuv lamp has not been previously applied to activate paa in the development of the aop therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ph on the reaction kinetics and mechanisms corresponding to nor degradation during the mpuv paa process first under different ph conditions the performance of the mpuv paa process with respect to nor degradation was examined second the effect of ph on the contribution of the reactive radicals in the mpuv paa process was also examined and finally the transformation products tps and pathways of nor degradation under different ph conditions during the mpuv paa process were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials nor 98 purity para chlorobenzoic acid pcba 99 purity tert butanol tba and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa peracetic acid 15 w w h2o2 30 w w naoh and h2so4 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china further hplc or lc ms grade acetonitrile methanol meoh and h3po4 were supplied by fisher scientific usa and formic acid lc ms grade was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan the solutions used in this work were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milli q ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of paa solutions the paa stock solution including 18 1 wt paa and 17 8 wt h2o2 was regularly calibrated using a method that combines iodometry and potassium permanganate titration details regarding the procedures employed can be obtained from the national standard for the peracetic acid water solution gb t 19104 2008 china specifically paa working solutions at lower concentrations 1 g l were prepared weekly by diluting the standardized paa stock solution and were thereafter stored at 4 c further the concentrations of paa and h2o2 in the working solutions were analyzed using the modified spectrophotometric method described by wang et al 2019 2 3 collimated beam experiments the mpuv paa degradation experiments were conducted in a quasi collimated beam apparatus equipped with a 2 8 kw mp mercury vapor lamp philips eindhoven netherlands as shown in fig s1 before the experiments the uv lamp was warmed for at least 30 min to keep the light intensity stable the uv irradiance of the lamp was monitored using a radiometer international light inl 1700 with a calibrated uv detector international light sed 240w further the emission spectrum of the mpuv lamp was obtained using a uv spectrometer ocean optics usa and its uv dose was calculated using a bolton spreadsheet bolton and linden 2003 the distance between the uv lamp and the water surface was 60 cm the petri factor was in the range of 0 90 0 91 and the sample depth was 0 71 cm water samples 20 ml containing the target compounds and paa at predetermined concentrations were irradiated in a continuously stirred petri dish φ 60 mm during the collimated beam experiments furthermore at each uv dose interval 1 ml samples were drawn from the petri dish and injected into hplc vials containing excess sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 paa 0 5 the quenched samples were analyzed within 12 h of the process as described in section 2 4 owing to the presence of h2o2 in the paa solutions control experiments under mpuv irradiation only and mpuv h2o2 were also conducted and the concentration of h2o2 in the mpuv h2o2 system was equivalent to that in the paa mixed standard solution the initial ph of the water samples was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 initial and final ph values were monitored and the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 0 5 in all experiments all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates the second order rate constants of the reaction between nor and oh were determined via competition kinetics using pcba as the competitor the experiments were conducted in a lpuv h2o2 system details regarding the competition kinetics are shown in supplementary text s1 further to investigate the contributions of reactive radicals to nor degradation in the mpuv paa process the probe method was applied using pcba as the probe compound in this process it was necessary to choose a pcba concentration that would have as little influence on nor degradation as possible 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of nor and pcba were determined using an hplc system ld 20at shimadzu japan equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm agilent usa details regarding the hplc setup are provided in supplementary text s2 the tps of nor were measured using solid phase extraction ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry spe uplc qtof a detailed spe procedure for the enrichment of water samples has been provided in supplementary text s3 additionally the analytical details corresponding to both uplc and ms analyses are presented in supplementary text s4 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the reactive radicals trapped by 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were recorded using a jes fa200 spectrometer jeol japan the settings for the epr spectrometer were as follows center field 322 4 mt sweep width 7 5 1 mt microwave frequency 9051 5 mhz modulation frequency 100 khz and power 0 998 mw the solution ph was measured using a ph meter pb 21 sartorius germany and the uv absorption spectra of the samples were determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on nor degradation kinetics in mpuv paa process nor degradation by mpuv paa is a complex reaction process that possibly includes direct uv photolysis direct paa oxidation direct h2o2 photolysis and ros oxidation therefore to better understand the influence of ph on the efficiency of mpuv paa treatment the removal of nor via these different reaction processes was investigated at ph 5 7 and 9 the use of h2o2 resulted in only negligible nor oxidation after treatment for 50 min data not shown indicating that nor cannot be removed using h2o2 only 3 1 1 influence of ph on direct paa oxidation of nor nor degradation experiments were performed using paa under dark conditions to investigate the nor degradation performance of paa under different ph conditions in these paa only experiments sampling was performed at the same time interval as that employed in uv dose equivalent 0 500 mj cm2 experiments as shown in fig 1 a direct paa oxidation did not bring about nor degradation at ph 5 and 7 nor degradation efficiency 6 however at ph 9 the nor removal efficiency increased to 23 1 after a time interval equivalent to that considered in the uv dose 0 500 mj cm2 experiments additionally the degradation of nor by the paa only system could be fitted with a pseudo first order kinetics model fig 1 a until now information on the degradation of micropollutants via direct paa oxidation is very scarce according to the available literature most compounds do not react readily with paa kim and huang 2021 however some nucleophiles containing electron donating groups such as β lactam antibiotics show high reactivity with paa zhang et al 2017 nor and paa are both ionizable compounds and their speciation processes vary under different ph conditions based on their acid base dissociation reactions this possibly led to the different reaction behaviors between them under different ph conditions the pka of paa is 8 2 and it dissociates in aqueous solution as follows 1 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o according to its speciation fig s2 when the solution ph was 5 and 7 paa predominantly existed in the neutral form paa0 while the deprotonated species paa became dominant at ph 9 further paa0 has a stronger oxidizing ability than paa and reportedly the redox potentials of paa under acidic and alkaline conditions are 1 748 and 1 005 v respectively zhang et al 2018 furthermore du et al 2018 indicated that paa shows a much slower amino acid oxidation reaction at ph 9 than at ph 5 and 7 and this phenomenon was also observed when paa was used to degrade β lactam antibiotics zhang et al 2017 interestingly the results of this study were opposite these previously reported results in this study paa showed a poor nor degradation performance at both ph values of 5 and 7 but showed some reactivity at ph 9 this observation suggests that the dissociation of nor into different species under different ph conditions might be the main reason why ph affects nor oxidation by paa nor has two pka values pka1 6 34 and pka2 8 75 which are related to the carboxyl group and the n4 atoms in the piperazine moiety in its structure respectively wang et al 2018 its speciation as a function of ph was determined and is shown in fig s3 at ph values of 5 7 and 9 nor predominantly existed in its diprotonated nor 0 monoprotonated nor and deprotonated nor0 forms respectively and the distribution of these nor forms possibly influenced its vulnerability to oxidants significantly ling et al 2018 investigated the degradation of nor by ozone the results obtained showed that the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced in the ph range of 5 8 this observation could be ascribed to the increasing fractions of nor and nor0 with increasing ph specifically a higher ph improves the degree of deprotonation of the piperazine ring this might favor attack by oxidants such as ozone ling et al 2018 and chlorine wang et al 2019 thus it can be concluded that nor speciation is responsible for the variation in the nor degradation rates under different ph conditions 3 1 2 influence of ph on mpuv only nor degradation the effect of ph on mpuv only nor photodegradation is shown in fig 1 b the observed quantum yields φobs corresponding to the photodegradation of nor under mpuv irradiation only were calculated using eq 2 and the results are listed in table 1 shu et al 2013 2 φ 10 k ln 10 i 1 n n i λ ε i λ u i λ where k represents the uv dose based rate constant m2 j n i λ represents the relative photon flow emitted by uv with wavelength in the range 200 300 nm u i λ j e represents the molar photon energy at wavelength λ and ε i λ represents the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 at wavelength λ as shown in table 1 nor degradation using the mpuv only system exhibited strong ph dependence the apparent rate constant for the photodegradation process and the quantum yields increased significantly when the ph increased from 5 to 7 and decreased slightly at ph 9 the differences in the photodegradation efficiencies could be attributed to the ph dependent speciation of nor reportedly the photodegradation rate of fqs generally decreases in the order zwitterionic anionic cationic guo et al 2013 wei et al 2013 it was also observed that the uv vis absorption spectrum of nor varied under different ph conditions owing to the existence of different molecular structures under different ph conditions as shown in fig s4 from which it is evident that an absorption band that could be primarily attributed to aromatic ring absorption appeared between 250 and 300 nm zhang et al 2011 it was also observed that on increasing the ph from 5 to 9 a remarkable blue shift with intensity that increased at short wavelengths appeared this phenomenon was also reported by albini and monti 2003 who indicated that the speciation of nor could influence its physicochemical properties in light irradiated fq solutions the energy levels of the singlet and triplet fq states can induce photo induced oxidation leading to the generation of ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 ge et al 2010 salma et al 2016 thus nor could undergo both direct photolysis and self sensitized photo oxidation via attack by ros during the mpuv only process the contribution of ros to the photolysis of nor was further evaluated via quenching studies that were performed with the addition of tba l histidine and p benzoquinone p bq as quenchers for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively fig s5 shows the estimated contributions of oh o2 and 1o2 to the photodegradation of nor under different ph conditions from this figure it is evident that oh played a more important role in the self sensitized photolysis of nor compared with o2 and 1o2 similar results were reported by zhang et al 2019 3 1 3 influence of ph on mpuv paa nor degradation mpuv paa treatment experiments were conducted using 2 mg l 1 nor solutions at an initial paa dosage of 10 mg l 1 under different ph conditions as shown in fig 1 c the mpuv paa treatment was more effective than the mpuv only and paa only systems due to the coexisting h2o2 in the paa solution the mpuv h2o2 could also be initiated the degradation of nor by mpuv h2o2 is presented in fig s6 and shows that the removal of nor by mpuv h2o2 was also lower than that by mpuv paa further nor degradation using the mpuv paa system followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rates of nor degradation under different ph conditions varied in the order 97 2 ph 9 96 6 ph 7 85 8 ph 5 and the kobs value varied in the order 0 0071 cm2mj 1 ph 9 0 0068 cm2mj 1 ph 7 0 0041 cm2mj 1 ph 5 these results indicated that ph had a noticeable effect on nor degradation in this system i e the nor degradation rate was higher under neutral and alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions the much faster nor degradation rate observed owing to the application of the mpuv paa process suggested that some reactive species were formed as a result of the photolysis of paa under mpuv irradiation reportedly under uv irradiation the o o bond in the structure of paa is cleaved and oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o are generated caretti and lubello 2003 rokhina et al 2010 3 c h 3 c o ooh hv c h 3 c o o oh thereafter both oh and ch3c o o can further react with paa oh reacts rapidly to yield an acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo eq 4 while ch3c o o reacts to form ch3c o oo alongside acetic acid eq 5 4 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 5 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh the primary acetyloxyl radical can decompose to form the methyl radical ch3 and co2 6 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 afterwards a peroxyl radical ooch3 with low oxidative ability forms from the reaction between ch3 and o2 and undergoes bimolecular decay 7 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 generally all the radicals generated in the uv paa system can contribute to the degradation of the target compounds among these radicals it has been observed that oh and other organic peroxyl radicals such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo play more important roles in the degradation of the target compounds ao et al 2021 the effect of ph on nor degradation by the mpuv paa system could be explained taking into consideration the following aspects 1 ph influences the acid base equilibrium of paa hence the rate of paa photolysis and 2 ph influences the dissociation nor into different species hence its reactivity with respect to ros therefore in the following sections sections 3 2 and 3 3 the impact of ph on the mpuv paa process is discussed in detail it should be noted that the dissolved co2 in the solution may interfere with the degradation of nor by mpuv paa however the role of co2 dissolution from air was not considered in this work but is worthy of future study 3 2 influence of ph on paa photolysis under mpuv irradiation to fully understand the effect of ph on the degradation of nor using the mpuv paa process it was necessary to first investigate the photolysis of paa by mpuv under different ph conditions supplementary fig s7 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε of paa and h2o2 at 200 300 nm under different ph conditions the εh2o2 obtained in this study was similar to that reported by li et al 2019 and indicated that ph has a negligible effect on εh2o2 under uv irradiation in the range 200 300 nm further the absorbance of paa was much stronger than that of h2o2 following irradiation uv in the range 200 300 nm and unlike h2o2 εpaa was significantly ph dependent as the ph increased from 5 to 9 it increased dramatically especially at ph 9 considering the measured εpaa value at 240 nm as an example the εpaa at ph 9 was more than nine fold higher than that at ph 5 and more than 14 fold higher than εh2o2 cai et al 2017 indicated that paa shows much higher uv absorption than paa0 and a higher ph improves the paa ratio resulting in an increase in εpaa a higher molar absorption coefficient generally implies a higher photolysis rate in this study direct paa photolysis by mpuv was investigated at ph 5 7 and 9 and the results obtained are as shown in fig 2 from which it is evident that paa photolysis by mpuv irradiation followed pseudo first order kinetics when the ph increased from 5 to 9 the paa photolysis rate increased significantly in accordance with the higher molar absorption coefficients paa exhibits a higher photolysis rate than paa0 cai et al 2017 further cai et al 2017 reported the rate constants of paa photolysis under lpuv irradiation 254 nm at ph 5 09 and 9 65 as 0 0211 and 0 1556 min 1 respectively a higher paa photolysis rate indicates a higher rate of ros generation therefore at higher ph values more ros were possibly generated owing to paa photolysis this could be one of the reasons for the improved nor degradation efficiency at ph 7 and 9 during the mpuv paa process 3 3 influence of ph on the roles of radicals during nor degradation by mpuv paa 3 3 1 epr spectra in aops epr measurements using spin trap compounds are often applied to directly identify reactive radical intermediates in this regard 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping reagent to perform epr tests as shown in fig 3 a characteristic peaks corresponding to oh a four fold characteristic peak with intensities in the ratio 1 2 2 1 were observed in the mpuv paa system however no organic radical related signals were observed wang et al 2019 also applied dmpo in epr tests to identify ros in the co paa system thus they only observed the signal corresponding to the oxidized form of dmpo dmpox indicating that organic radical adducts may not be generated when dmpo is used further as shown in fig 3 a when the ph was increased from 5 to 7 the oh signal became remarkably stronger this can be explained by the enhanced ros generation at higher ph values arguably it was expected that the oh signal at ph 9 would be much stronger than that at ph 5 and 7 however it was interesting to note that it was rather significantly lower this observation could be attributed to the significant enhancement of the reaction between oh and paa when paa became dominant ph 8 2 leading to the lower oh concentrations cai et al 2017 reported that the second order rate constants for the reaction between oh and paa k oh paa were approximately 10 fold those of k oh paa0 therefore the ratio of oh to organic radicals changes under different ph conditions 3 3 2 probe method in some previous studies the radical scavenging method was applied to explore the contribution of ros to the degradation of target compounds in paa based aops cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 tba which can rapidly react with oh k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but cannot react with organic radicals is the most commonly used scavenger when studying paa based systems however given that the reaction between paa and oh to form ch3c o oo eq 4 is not considered when excess tba is added to completely scavenge oh chen et al 2019 this radical scavenging method does not reflect the actual situation in the mpuv paa system thus a probe method that does not interfere with the reaction between oh and paa was used in this study to evaluate the contributions of the ros previous studies have shown that pcba cannot be oxidized by organic radicals in paa based aops wang et al 2021 chen et al 2019 therefore in this probe method pcba was used as the oh probe compound according to the kinetic expression shown in eq 8 and 9 nor degradation using the mpuv paa process could be attributed to direct uv photolysis oxidation by paa and oxidation by ros oh and organic radicals while pcba degradation resulted from mpuv photolysis and oh oxidation 8 k obs nor k mpuv nor k paa nor k oh nor oh ss k or nor 9 k obs pcba k mpuv pcba k oh pcba oh ss using the experimentally determined k values supplementary fig s8 along with the literature reported second order rate constant of the reaction between oh and pcba 5 109 m 1s 1 the steady state concentration of oh could be calculated k oh nor was measured using the method described in section 2 3 thus k or nor and k oh nor were obtained the contributions of oh and organic radicals to nor degradation are shown in fig 3 b from which it is evident that oh played a major role 82 63 in nor degradation via the mpuv paa process at ph 5 however its contribution at ph 7 and 9 was in the range 17 59 22 00 conversely the contribution of the organic radicals was limited 12 21 at ph 5 but when the ph increased to 7 and 9 their contribution increased significantly 38 9 44 59 the varied roles of ros in nor degradation under different ph conditions could be explained in terms of two main factors first the reaction between paa and oh to form ch3c o oo was enhanced with increasing ph cai et al 2017 therefore more organic radicals contributed to nor degradation second unlike oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo showed more selectivity toward electron rich organic moieties ao et al 2021 further the deprotonation of the amine groups at the piperazine ring in the structure of nor could increase their electron donating ability and decrease their steric hindrance ao et al 2018 as the ph increased the degree of deprotonation of the piperazine ring increased this possibly favored electrophilic attack by ch3c o o and ch3c o oo thus the higher reactivity of deprotonated nor with respect to organic radicals made the roles of organic radicals more important under higher ph conditions 3 4 influence of ph on nor transformation products pathways by mpuv paa 3 4 1 nor transformation products and pathways in the mpuv paa system the tps generated during nor degradation using the mpuv paa system under different ph conditions were identified using the uplc qtof detection method the mass measurements corresponding to nor and the tps are shown in table 2 and the ms ms spectra as well as the proposed fragmentation patterns are shown fig s9 fig s24 the number of tps detected at ph 5 7 and 9 were 10 15 and 9 respectively further to clarify the different process that led to the generation of these tps the products of nor degradation during mpuv only mpuv tba mpuv h2o2 and mpuv paa tba processes were also determined it was also necessary to determine the tps generated owing to the direct oxidation of nor by paa however this was difficult to realize given the low concentrations of the products tables s1 s3 lists the nor tps that were generated during these different processes at ph 5 7 and 9 at ph 5 the nor tps resulting from the mpuv paa process were identical to those from the mpuv h2o2 process however at ph 9 they were identical to those resulting from the mpuv paa tba process this observation supported the results reported in section 3 3 i e oh played a predominant role in nor degradation under acidic conditions while the organic radicals played a more important role under higher ph conditions based on the intermediate products identified a possible set of transformation pathways at different ph values were graphically illustrated as shown in fig 4 pathway 1 decarboxylation during the decarboxylation process a co group in the carboxylic acid group was eliminated leading to the formation of tp291 which was not formed in the mpuv paa tba process indicating that it was possibly generated owing to oh attack according to previous studies gupta and garg 2018 yu et al 2019 decarboxylation is considered as one of the fq degradation pathways in oh based aops in this study the decarboxylation process occurred at ph 5 and 7 in the mpuv paa system at ph 9 it was not observed this phenomenon could be attributed to the insignificant role of oh in nor degradation at ph 9 pathway 2 oh f substitution and piperazine ring transformation the oh f substitution process was observed under all the ph conditions employed in this study i e ph 5 7 and 9 with the generation of tp317 oh f substitution or defluorination was identified as the photodegradation pathway of nor and according to eq 5 under uv irradiation the ground state of nor can absorb photons and form the lowest triplet state and the fluorine removal is possibly due to the reaction of the triplet state of nor salma et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 it has also been reported that ph can influence the efficiency of the fq defluorination process which is more significant when the fqs are in the zwitterionic form than when they are in cationic and anionic forms wei et al 2013 at ph 5 and 7 tp317 was subjected to hydroxylation to produce tp333 based on the results shown in tables s1 s3 it could be proposed that tp333 was generated owing to attack by oh additionally at ph 7 and 9 tp333 was oxidized to produce tp319 this led to the opening of the piperazine ring pathway 3 piperazine ring transformation at ph 5 and 7 this pathway was initiated by the hydroxylation of the piperazine ring owing to oh attack leading to the formation of tp335 thereafter stepwise piperazine ring cleavage occurred owing to attack by oh and or organic radicals reportedly it has been proven that the piperazine ring in nor is an active group that is vulnerable to attacked by ros in particular oh primarily reacts via a hydrogen atom abstraction mechanism with a minor electron transfer mechanism chen et al 2019 while peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo preferably react electron rich groups via electron transfer ao et al 2021 the two n atoms on the piperazine ring in the nor structure have lone pairs of electrons thus the peroxyl radicals may react with the nitrogen sites via an electron transfer mechanism a similar route for piperazine ring opening has also been proposed for nor degradation by sulfate radical oxidation li et al 2019 and the e ozonation process wang et al 2020 at ph 9 the product tp335 which was generated via oh oxidation was not observed this might be due to the less important role of oh under alkaline conditions tp321 and tp293 were also detected at ph 9 indicating the occurrence of piperazine ring opening at ph 9 pathway 4 direct fluoride loss and piperazine ring cleavage in this pathway nor degradation was initiated by another defluorination pathway i e the cleavage of the c f bond followed by direct fluoride loss thereafter the fluoride loss product possibly underwent a stepwise piperazine ring opening tp315 was oxidized to produce tp331 which has a dialdehyde derivative structure and further loss of one formaldehyde molecule in the opened piperazine ring led to the formation of tp303 which was then degraded to form tp275 via the loss of the second formaldehyde from the opened piperazine ring the above route occurred at ph 7 and 9 however at ph 5 only tp303 and tp275 were detected pathway 5 quinolone group transformation in this pathway the quinolone group of nor was destroyed to form the product tp277 in addition to the piperazine ring the quinolone system is also an electron rich region in nor serna galvis et al 2017 and the carbon carbon double bond which is adjacent to the carboxyl group shows high reactivity toward electrophilic attack by ros wang et al 2021 additionally the product tp277 could be further degraded to tp267 and tp251 leading to the opening of the quinolone ring in this pathway quinolone group transformation was observed at ph 5 7 and 9 3 4 2 comparison of mechanism and pathways as shown in fig 4 at ph 5 most of the tps were generated via oxidation by oh however at ph values of 7 and 9 there was an increase in the number of tps generated via oxidation by organic radicals in the mpuv paa system the most comprehensive intermediates could be detected at a ph of 7 possibly because at this ph the contributions of direct mpuv photolysis oxidation by oh and oxidation by organic radicals were relatively comparable fig 5 shows the relative peak areas corresponding to the detected tps with an up down trend at ph 5 the concentration of tp335 was obviously higher than those of the other tps demonstrating that piperazine ring transformation was the dominant reaction during nor degradation as previously discussed tp335 was supposedly generated by oh oxidation thus the above results once again confirmed that oh was the dominant nor degrading radical under acidic conditions at ph 7 tp317 which was produced via direct photolysis by mpuv had the highest relative peak area followed by tp335 tp303 and tp291 and as mentioned earlier nor photolysis exhibited the highest efficiency under neutral ph conditions this was confirmed by the results of the determination of the relative peak areas both tp335 and tp303 were identified as tps resulting from the opening of the piperazine ring on nor tp303 was also identified as a defluorination product additionally tp291 was produced via the demethylation of the piperazine ring thus it was also a piperazine ring transformation product therefore it can be concluded that the defluorination reaction and the piperazine ring transformation were the major nor degradation pathways at ph 7 furthermore at ph 9 tp321 showed the highest relative peak area followed by tp303 and tp331 specifically tp321 was produced during ros attack on the piperazine ring while tp303 and tp331 were identified as the products of the direct defluorination and piperazine ring cleavage respectively thus it could be inferred that direct fluoride loss and piperazine ring transformation are the major nor degradation pathways owing to mpuv photolysis and ros oxidation respectively overall piperazine ring transformation was always identified as the main nor degradation pathway by mpuv paa under different ph conditions and the defluorination reaction was enhanced under neutral and alkaline conditions as the ph increased the reactions initiated by organic radical attack improved therefore the piperazine ring was considered as the active site in the nor structure for attack by both oh and organic radicals 4 conclusion in this study we systematically provided mechanistic and kinetic insights into the ph dependent degradation of nor using a novel aop mpuv paa process the results obtained showed that mpuv paa treatment is an efficient nor degradation process and the degradation efficiency increased as the ph increased from 5 to 9 further ph influenced nor degradation via the mpuv paa process in two pronged aspects nor species dissociation and paa photolysis based ros generation furthermore paa photolysis under mpuv irradiation increased with increasing ph this was supported by the increase in εpaa with ph thus more ros were generated under higher ph conditions the epr spectra obtained also confirmed that the concentration of oh significantly increased at ph 7 compared with that at ph 5 however the oh signal dropped at ph 9 possibly owing to the consumption of oh to form organic radicals additionally oh was identified as the dominant radical for nor degradation in the mpuv paa process under acidic conditions while organic radicals played a more predominant role under neutral and alkaline conditions nor tps following the mpuv paa process were identified and different pathways for their formation under different ph conditions were also identified this work is helpful to assess the effect of the mpuv paa process on nor at various ph values thereby increasing our understanding of the use of ph values to improve the degradation performance of nor in order to advance our fundamental knowledge and the predictive capability of uv paa as a novel aop in environmental applications further research is

16690,given that fluoroquinolone antibiotics fqs are frequently detected in aquatic environments there is an urgent need for the development of efficient water treatment technologies for their removal peracetic acid paa based advanced oxidation processes aops have increasingly attracted attention as promising technologies for water decontamination in this regard in this study a novel paa based aop the medium pressure ultraviolet mpuv paa process was employed to degrade norfloxacin nor which is an extensively applied fq that is widely present in water mechanistic and kinetic aspects of the role of ph on this nor degradation process were investigated the results obtained showed that the mpuv paa process could effectively degrade nor ph 5 9 and the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced at ph 7 and 9 compared with that at ph 5 this observation could be attributed to the effect of ph on the ionic forms of nor and the generation of reactive oxygen species ros further the rate of paa photolysis which resulted in the formation of reactive radicals increased with ph as evidenced by the observed increase in the molar absorption coefficient of paa εpaa electron paramagnetic resonance epr tests also indicated that the generation of ros was significantly enhanced when the ph increased from 5 to 7 and at ph 9 a large amount of oh were possibly consumed by paa to form organic radicals leading to a decrease in the oh signal furthermore it was observed that oh is primarily responsible for nor degradation in the mpuv paa process at ph 5 whereas organic radicals were primarily responsible for the degradation at ph 7 and 9 the identification of the transformation products tps led to the observation of different nor transformation pathways owing to the mpuv paa process under different ph conditions overall this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of ph on the mpuv paa degradation behavior of fqs graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords fluoroquinolone degradation reactive oxygen species peracetic acid advanced oxidation processes medium pressure uv 1 introduction since the advent of penicillin in 1929 the use of antibiotics in medicine aquaculture and livestock husbandry has become widespread however their overuse and abuse has contributed to the rise in the number of drug resistant superbugs specifically fluoroquinolones fqs are an important class of synthetic antimicrobials for human livestock and aquaculture disease control owing to their partial metabolism in human beings and slow degradation in natural environments the majority of consumed fqs are excreted into the environment in unchanged and active forms van doorslaer et al 2014 fqs are ubiquitous in various aquatic environments including surface water hao et al 2015 groundwater and wastewater at concentrations ranging from ng l 1 to μg l 1 in addition to inducing antibiotic resistance at even low concentrations oliveira et al 2020 fqs can directly result in non negligible adverse effects on terrestrial and aquatic organisms li et al 2017 song et al 2017 wan et al 2020 furthermore mixtures of fqs with other antibiotics can exert growth inhibiting effects and genotoxicity in aquatic species gonzalez pleiter et al 2013 zounkova et al 2011 however due to the bioresistant properties and recalcitrant character of fqs adjei et al 2006 achieving a high fq removal efficiency via conventional water treatment processes e g biodegradation coagulation and sedimentation is difficult xu et al 2014 xu et al 2015 thus the immediate development of efficient treatment technologies for their removal from aquatic environments is a pressing priority advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied extensively and their application has been proposed for the degradation of emerging pollutants in water and wastewater these aops which include a large variety of technologies such as fenton like oxidation ozonation electrochemical oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation are based on the generation of highly reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl and sulfate radicals further peroxides including h2o2 ozone persulfate pds and peroxymonosulfate pms have also been widely employed in aops given that their activation using energy e g uv and heat or catalysts e g transition metals can lead to the generation of ros specifically peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh which is an organic peroxide that has been increasingly applied to realize water wastewater disinfection has also attracted increasing interest as an agent from which ros for the aops can be generated to ensure the enhanced disinfection or degradation of micropollutants paa is a strong oxidizing agent with a high standard reduction potential of 1 0 1 96 v with respect to the standard hydrogen electrode she which is close to that of h2o2 e0 1 8 v however its o o bond is longer than that of h2o2 resulting in the requirement of a lower amount of energy for cleavage and in disinfection processes some of its advantages include the generation of nontoxic disinfection by products and its exhibition of a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity similar to chlorine this makes it a promising chlorine alternative in aops owing to its weak o o bond paa can be activated to generate ros with high oxidation ability via various activation methods including uv solar light irradiation ultrasound or catalysis metal ions activated carbon activation among paa based aops the uv paa process has gained increasing attention owing to its field applications traditionally uv treatment has been employed to realize drinking water and wastewater effluent disinfection and uv driven aops are considered to be simple clean and cost effective technologies that often generate dual benefits decontamination and disinfection to end users possibly the uv paa process predominantly generates organic per oxyl radicals e g ch3c o o and ch3c o oo and hydroxyl radicals oh both of which can contribute to the degradation of organic compounds in water ao et al 2021 caretti and lubello 2003 constructed a pilot plant and conducted a five month long study to evaluate the synergy between paa and uv when disinfecting wastewater treatment plant secondary effluent their results indicated that the disinfection efficacy was enhanced during the uv paa process while a much higher degradation efficacy was obtained during the paa uv process denoted as uv paa this higher treatment efficiency could be attributed to the formation of reactive radicals therefore the uv paa process may provide a new strategy for the inactivation of pathogenic microorganisms during water treatment recently some researchers used uv to activate paa and achieved good efficiency in the degradation of some micro organic pollutants in water including phenols sharma et al 2014 and pharmaceuticals cai et al 2017 hollman et al 2020 rizzo et al 2018 these successful applications indicated that the uv paa process can also be a promising technology for the removal of contaminants of emerging concern from water as a novel aop a systematic investigation of the feasibility of the uv paa process for the degradation of contaminants in water especially emerging contaminants is urgently needed however studies on applications of the uv paa process to degrade micro organic pollutants are still rather scarce to comprehensively understand the uv paa technology it would be necessary to determine the degradation kinetics and mechanisms and also clarify the influence of operational conditions and the characteristics of the water matrix on the performance of the process zhang and huang 2020 developed a model to elucidate the associated reaction mechanisms and simulate the reaction kinetics of the uv paa process which can be applied under neutral and slightly acidic ph conditions ph 5 8 7 2 further chen et al 2019 investigated the effect of the contents of the water matrix such as carbonate and bicarbonate ions humic acid and chloride ions on the degradation of naproxen via the uv paa process however the impact of some key factors such as ph on the degradation of contaminants during the uv paa process is still unclear and before any practical application of this novel aop it would be necessary to determine its most appropriate design and clarify the effect of operational variables including ph on its performance in aops ph is one of the most important parameters and plays an essential role in determining the chemistry of radicals catalysts oxidants and target compounds however its effects on the degradation of target compounds during the uv paa process have received little attention zhang et al 2020 indicated that the degradation of diclofenac using the uv paa process is ph dependent and the best degradation efficiency was obtained at a ph of 8 5 further zhang et al 2021 observed that using the uv paa system ph has little effect on the degradation of chloroanisoles but had some effect on the degradation of bromoanisole therefore there is still much uncertainty regarding the role of ph in the uv paa process first the effect of ph on the degradation kinetics and the reactive radical species that are involved in the uv paa process is unknown moreover it is also unclear whether ph influences the degradation pathways of the target compounds therefore in this study the feasibility of using the uv paa process for the removal of fqs from water was investigated for the first time and nor which is one of the most frequently detected fq in aquatic environments was chosen as the target compound a medium pressure ultraviolet mpuv lamp was used as a light source for the uv paa system and compared with low pressure uv lamps emitting uv light with a wavelength of 254 nm mpuv lamps are often employed for full scale applications given that their higher output power leads to a relatively smaller photoreactor size moreover as a polychromatic lamp emitting uv light with wavelengths in the range 200 400 nm mpuv lamps are generally more effective than low pressure uv lpuv lamps with respect to the photodegradation of organic pollutants this is because its light output spectrum possibly correlates well with the absorption spectrum of the target pollutants to the best of our knowledge until now the mpuv lamp has not been previously applied to activate paa in the development of the aop therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of ph on the reaction kinetics and mechanisms corresponding to nor degradation during the mpuv paa process first under different ph conditions the performance of the mpuv paa process with respect to nor degradation was examined second the effect of ph on the contribution of the reactive radicals in the mpuv paa process was also examined and finally the transformation products tps and pathways of nor degradation under different ph conditions during the mpuv paa process were compared 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials nor 98 purity para chlorobenzoic acid pcba 99 purity tert butanol tba and sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 were obtained from sigma aldrich usa peracetic acid 15 w w h2o2 30 w w naoh and h2so4 were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china further hplc or lc ms grade acetonitrile methanol meoh and h3po4 were supplied by fisher scientific usa and formic acid lc ms grade was purchased from tokyo chemical industry co ltd tokyo japan the solutions used in this work were prepared using 18 2 mω cm milli q ultrapure water 2 2 preparation of paa solutions the paa stock solution including 18 1 wt paa and 17 8 wt h2o2 was regularly calibrated using a method that combines iodometry and potassium permanganate titration details regarding the procedures employed can be obtained from the national standard for the peracetic acid water solution gb t 19104 2008 china specifically paa working solutions at lower concentrations 1 g l were prepared weekly by diluting the standardized paa stock solution and were thereafter stored at 4 c further the concentrations of paa and h2o2 in the working solutions were analyzed using the modified spectrophotometric method described by wang et al 2019 2 3 collimated beam experiments the mpuv paa degradation experiments were conducted in a quasi collimated beam apparatus equipped with a 2 8 kw mp mercury vapor lamp philips eindhoven netherlands as shown in fig s1 before the experiments the uv lamp was warmed for at least 30 min to keep the light intensity stable the uv irradiance of the lamp was monitored using a radiometer international light inl 1700 with a calibrated uv detector international light sed 240w further the emission spectrum of the mpuv lamp was obtained using a uv spectrometer ocean optics usa and its uv dose was calculated using a bolton spreadsheet bolton and linden 2003 the distance between the uv lamp and the water surface was 60 cm the petri factor was in the range of 0 90 0 91 and the sample depth was 0 71 cm water samples 20 ml containing the target compounds and paa at predetermined concentrations were irradiated in a continuously stirred petri dish φ 60 mm during the collimated beam experiments furthermore at each uv dose interval 1 ml samples were drawn from the petri dish and injected into hplc vials containing excess sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 paa 0 5 the quenched samples were analyzed within 12 h of the process as described in section 2 4 owing to the presence of h2o2 in the paa solutions control experiments under mpuv irradiation only and mpuv h2o2 were also conducted and the concentration of h2o2 in the mpuv h2o2 system was equivalent to that in the paa mixed standard solution the initial ph of the water samples was adjusted using 0 1 m naoh or 0 1 m h2so4 initial and final ph values were monitored and the changes in ph after the reaction were less than 0 5 in all experiments all experiments were conducted at least in duplicates the second order rate constants of the reaction between nor and oh were determined via competition kinetics using pcba as the competitor the experiments were conducted in a lpuv h2o2 system details regarding the competition kinetics are shown in supplementary text s1 further to investigate the contributions of reactive radicals to nor degradation in the mpuv paa process the probe method was applied using pcba as the probe compound in this process it was necessary to choose a pcba concentration that would have as little influence on nor degradation as possible 2 4 analytical methods the concentrations of nor and pcba were determined using an hplc system ld 20at shimadzu japan equipped with a zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 4 6 mm 250 mm 5 μm agilent usa details regarding the hplc setup are provided in supplementary text s2 the tps of nor were measured using solid phase extraction ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry spe uplc qtof a detailed spe procedure for the enrichment of water samples has been provided in supplementary text s3 additionally the analytical details corresponding to both uplc and ms analyses are presented in supplementary text s4 the electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra of the reactive radicals trapped by 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo were recorded using a jes fa200 spectrometer jeol japan the settings for the epr spectrometer were as follows center field 322 4 mt sweep width 7 5 1 mt microwave frequency 9051 5 mhz modulation frequency 100 khz and power 0 998 mw the solution ph was measured using a ph meter pb 21 sartorius germany and the uv absorption spectra of the samples were determined using a uv visible spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on nor degradation kinetics in mpuv paa process nor degradation by mpuv paa is a complex reaction process that possibly includes direct uv photolysis direct paa oxidation direct h2o2 photolysis and ros oxidation therefore to better understand the influence of ph on the efficiency of mpuv paa treatment the removal of nor via these different reaction processes was investigated at ph 5 7 and 9 the use of h2o2 resulted in only negligible nor oxidation after treatment for 50 min data not shown indicating that nor cannot be removed using h2o2 only 3 1 1 influence of ph on direct paa oxidation of nor nor degradation experiments were performed using paa under dark conditions to investigate the nor degradation performance of paa under different ph conditions in these paa only experiments sampling was performed at the same time interval as that employed in uv dose equivalent 0 500 mj cm2 experiments as shown in fig 1 a direct paa oxidation did not bring about nor degradation at ph 5 and 7 nor degradation efficiency 6 however at ph 9 the nor removal efficiency increased to 23 1 after a time interval equivalent to that considered in the uv dose 0 500 mj cm2 experiments additionally the degradation of nor by the paa only system could be fitted with a pseudo first order kinetics model fig 1 a until now information on the degradation of micropollutants via direct paa oxidation is very scarce according to the available literature most compounds do not react readily with paa kim and huang 2021 however some nucleophiles containing electron donating groups such as β lactam antibiotics show high reactivity with paa zhang et al 2017 nor and paa are both ionizable compounds and their speciation processes vary under different ph conditions based on their acid base dissociation reactions this possibly led to the different reaction behaviors between them under different ph conditions the pka of paa is 8 2 and it dissociates in aqueous solution as follows 1 c h 3 c o ooh h 2 o c h 3 c o o o h 3 o according to its speciation fig s2 when the solution ph was 5 and 7 paa predominantly existed in the neutral form paa0 while the deprotonated species paa became dominant at ph 9 further paa0 has a stronger oxidizing ability than paa and reportedly the redox potentials of paa under acidic and alkaline conditions are 1 748 and 1 005 v respectively zhang et al 2018 furthermore du et al 2018 indicated that paa shows a much slower amino acid oxidation reaction at ph 9 than at ph 5 and 7 and this phenomenon was also observed when paa was used to degrade β lactam antibiotics zhang et al 2017 interestingly the results of this study were opposite these previously reported results in this study paa showed a poor nor degradation performance at both ph values of 5 and 7 but showed some reactivity at ph 9 this observation suggests that the dissociation of nor into different species under different ph conditions might be the main reason why ph affects nor oxidation by paa nor has two pka values pka1 6 34 and pka2 8 75 which are related to the carboxyl group and the n4 atoms in the piperazine moiety in its structure respectively wang et al 2018 its speciation as a function of ph was determined and is shown in fig s3 at ph values of 5 7 and 9 nor predominantly existed in its diprotonated nor 0 monoprotonated nor and deprotonated nor0 forms respectively and the distribution of these nor forms possibly influenced its vulnerability to oxidants significantly ling et al 2018 investigated the degradation of nor by ozone the results obtained showed that the degradation efficiency was significantly enhanced in the ph range of 5 8 this observation could be ascribed to the increasing fractions of nor and nor0 with increasing ph specifically a higher ph improves the degree of deprotonation of the piperazine ring this might favor attack by oxidants such as ozone ling et al 2018 and chlorine wang et al 2019 thus it can be concluded that nor speciation is responsible for the variation in the nor degradation rates under different ph conditions 3 1 2 influence of ph on mpuv only nor degradation the effect of ph on mpuv only nor photodegradation is shown in fig 1 b the observed quantum yields φobs corresponding to the photodegradation of nor under mpuv irradiation only were calculated using eq 2 and the results are listed in table 1 shu et al 2013 2 φ 10 k ln 10 i 1 n n i λ ε i λ u i λ where k represents the uv dose based rate constant m2 j n i λ represents the relative photon flow emitted by uv with wavelength in the range 200 300 nm u i λ j e represents the molar photon energy at wavelength λ and ε i λ represents the molar absorption coefficient m 1 cm 1 at wavelength λ as shown in table 1 nor degradation using the mpuv only system exhibited strong ph dependence the apparent rate constant for the photodegradation process and the quantum yields increased significantly when the ph increased from 5 to 7 and decreased slightly at ph 9 the differences in the photodegradation efficiencies could be attributed to the ph dependent speciation of nor reportedly the photodegradation rate of fqs generally decreases in the order zwitterionic anionic cationic guo et al 2013 wei et al 2013 it was also observed that the uv vis absorption spectrum of nor varied under different ph conditions owing to the existence of different molecular structures under different ph conditions as shown in fig s4 from which it is evident that an absorption band that could be primarily attributed to aromatic ring absorption appeared between 250 and 300 nm zhang et al 2011 it was also observed that on increasing the ph from 5 to 9 a remarkable blue shift with intensity that increased at short wavelengths appeared this phenomenon was also reported by albini and monti 2003 who indicated that the speciation of nor could influence its physicochemical properties in light irradiated fq solutions the energy levels of the singlet and triplet fq states can induce photo induced oxidation leading to the generation of ros such as oh o2 and 1o2 ge et al 2010 salma et al 2016 thus nor could undergo both direct photolysis and self sensitized photo oxidation via attack by ros during the mpuv only process the contribution of ros to the photolysis of nor was further evaluated via quenching studies that were performed with the addition of tba l histidine and p benzoquinone p bq as quenchers for oh 1o2 and o2 respectively fig s5 shows the estimated contributions of oh o2 and 1o2 to the photodegradation of nor under different ph conditions from this figure it is evident that oh played a more important role in the self sensitized photolysis of nor compared with o2 and 1o2 similar results were reported by zhang et al 2019 3 1 3 influence of ph on mpuv paa nor degradation mpuv paa treatment experiments were conducted using 2 mg l 1 nor solutions at an initial paa dosage of 10 mg l 1 under different ph conditions as shown in fig 1 c the mpuv paa treatment was more effective than the mpuv only and paa only systems due to the coexisting h2o2 in the paa solution the mpuv h2o2 could also be initiated the degradation of nor by mpuv h2o2 is presented in fig s6 and shows that the removal of nor by mpuv h2o2 was also lower than that by mpuv paa further nor degradation using the mpuv paa system followed pseudo first order kinetics and the rates of nor degradation under different ph conditions varied in the order 97 2 ph 9 96 6 ph 7 85 8 ph 5 and the kobs value varied in the order 0 0071 cm2mj 1 ph 9 0 0068 cm2mj 1 ph 7 0 0041 cm2mj 1 ph 5 these results indicated that ph had a noticeable effect on nor degradation in this system i e the nor degradation rate was higher under neutral and alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions the much faster nor degradation rate observed owing to the application of the mpuv paa process suggested that some reactive species were formed as a result of the photolysis of paa under mpuv irradiation reportedly under uv irradiation the o o bond in the structure of paa is cleaved and oh and acetyloxyl radicals ch3c o o are generated caretti and lubello 2003 rokhina et al 2010 3 c h 3 c o ooh hv c h 3 c o o oh thereafter both oh and ch3c o o can further react with paa oh reacts rapidly to yield an acetylperoxyl radical ch3c o oo eq 4 while ch3c o o reacts to form ch3c o oo alongside acetic acid eq 5 4 c h 3 c o ooh oh c h 3 c o oo h 2 o 5 c h 3 c o ooh c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o oo c h 3 c o oh the primary acetyloxyl radical can decompose to form the methyl radical ch3 and co2 6 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 afterwards a peroxyl radical ooch3 with low oxidative ability forms from the reaction between ch3 and o2 and undergoes bimolecular decay 7 c h 3 o 2 ooc h 3 generally all the radicals generated in the uv paa system can contribute to the degradation of the target compounds among these radicals it has been observed that oh and other organic peroxyl radicals such as ch3c o o and ch3c o oo play more important roles in the degradation of the target compounds ao et al 2021 the effect of ph on nor degradation by the mpuv paa system could be explained taking into consideration the following aspects 1 ph influences the acid base equilibrium of paa hence the rate of paa photolysis and 2 ph influences the dissociation nor into different species hence its reactivity with respect to ros therefore in the following sections sections 3 2 and 3 3 the impact of ph on the mpuv paa process is discussed in detail it should be noted that the dissolved co2 in the solution may interfere with the degradation of nor by mpuv paa however the role of co2 dissolution from air was not considered in this work but is worthy of future study 3 2 influence of ph on paa photolysis under mpuv irradiation to fully understand the effect of ph on the degradation of nor using the mpuv paa process it was necessary to first investigate the photolysis of paa by mpuv under different ph conditions supplementary fig s7 shows the molar absorption coefficients ε of paa and h2o2 at 200 300 nm under different ph conditions the εh2o2 obtained in this study was similar to that reported by li et al 2019 and indicated that ph has a negligible effect on εh2o2 under uv irradiation in the range 200 300 nm further the absorbance of paa was much stronger than that of h2o2 following irradiation uv in the range 200 300 nm and unlike h2o2 εpaa was significantly ph dependent as the ph increased from 5 to 9 it increased dramatically especially at ph 9 considering the measured εpaa value at 240 nm as an example the εpaa at ph 9 was more than nine fold higher than that at ph 5 and more than 14 fold higher than εh2o2 cai et al 2017 indicated that paa shows much higher uv absorption than paa0 and a higher ph improves the paa ratio resulting in an increase in εpaa a higher molar absorption coefficient generally implies a higher photolysis rate in this study direct paa photolysis by mpuv was investigated at ph 5 7 and 9 and the results obtained are as shown in fig 2 from which it is evident that paa photolysis by mpuv irradiation followed pseudo first order kinetics when the ph increased from 5 to 9 the paa photolysis rate increased significantly in accordance with the higher molar absorption coefficients paa exhibits a higher photolysis rate than paa0 cai et al 2017 further cai et al 2017 reported the rate constants of paa photolysis under lpuv irradiation 254 nm at ph 5 09 and 9 65 as 0 0211 and 0 1556 min 1 respectively a higher paa photolysis rate indicates a higher rate of ros generation therefore at higher ph values more ros were possibly generated owing to paa photolysis this could be one of the reasons for the improved nor degradation efficiency at ph 7 and 9 during the mpuv paa process 3 3 influence of ph on the roles of radicals during nor degradation by mpuv paa 3 3 1 epr spectra in aops epr measurements using spin trap compounds are often applied to directly identify reactive radical intermediates in this regard 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping reagent to perform epr tests as shown in fig 3 a characteristic peaks corresponding to oh a four fold characteristic peak with intensities in the ratio 1 2 2 1 were observed in the mpuv paa system however no organic radical related signals were observed wang et al 2019 also applied dmpo in epr tests to identify ros in the co paa system thus they only observed the signal corresponding to the oxidized form of dmpo dmpox indicating that organic radical adducts may not be generated when dmpo is used further as shown in fig 3 a when the ph was increased from 5 to 7 the oh signal became remarkably stronger this can be explained by the enhanced ros generation at higher ph values arguably it was expected that the oh signal at ph 9 would be much stronger than that at ph 5 and 7 however it was interesting to note that it was rather significantly lower this observation could be attributed to the significant enhancement of the reaction between oh and paa when paa became dominant ph 8 2 leading to the lower oh concentrations cai et al 2017 reported that the second order rate constants for the reaction between oh and paa k oh paa were approximately 10 fold those of k oh paa0 therefore the ratio of oh to organic radicals changes under different ph conditions 3 3 2 probe method in some previous studies the radical scavenging method was applied to explore the contribution of ros to the degradation of target compounds in paa based aops cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 tba which can rapidly react with oh k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 but cannot react with organic radicals is the most commonly used scavenger when studying paa based systems however given that the reaction between paa and oh to form ch3c o oo eq 4 is not considered when excess tba is added to completely scavenge oh chen et al 2019 this radical scavenging method does not reflect the actual situation in the mpuv paa system thus a probe method that does not interfere with the reaction between oh and paa was used in this study to evaluate the contributions of the ros previous studies have shown that pcba cannot be oxidized by organic radicals in paa based aops wang et al 2021 chen et al 2019 therefore in this probe method pcba was used as the oh probe compound according to the kinetic expression shown in eq 8 and 9 nor degradation using the mpuv paa process could be attributed to direct uv photolysis oxidation by paa and oxidation by ros oh and organic radicals while pcba degradation resulted from mpuv photolysis and oh oxidation 8 k obs nor k mpuv nor k paa nor k oh nor oh ss k or nor 9 k obs pcba k mpuv pcba k oh pcba oh ss using the experimentally determined k values supplementary fig s8 along with the literature reported second order rate constant of the reaction between oh and pcba 5 109 m 1s 1 the steady state concentration of oh could be calculated k oh nor was measured using the method described in section 2 3 thus k or nor and k oh nor were obtained the contributions of oh and organic radicals to nor degradation are shown in fig 3 b from which it is evident that oh played a major role 82 63 in nor degradation via the mpuv paa process at ph 5 however its contribution at ph 7 and 9 was in the range 17 59 22 00 conversely the contribution of the organic radicals was limited 12 21 at ph 5 but when the ph increased to 7 and 9 their contribution increased significantly 38 9 44 59 the varied roles of ros in nor degradation under different ph conditions could be explained in terms of two main factors first the reaction between paa and oh to form ch3c o oo was enhanced with increasing ph cai et al 2017 therefore more organic radicals contributed to nor degradation second unlike oh ch3c o o and ch3c o oo showed more selectivity toward electron rich organic moieties ao et al 2021 further the deprotonation of the amine groups at the piperazine ring in the structure of nor could increase their electron donating ability and decrease their steric hindrance ao et al 2018 as the ph increased the degree of deprotonation of the piperazine ring increased this possibly favored electrophilic attack by ch3c o o and ch3c o oo thus the higher reactivity of deprotonated nor with respect to organic radicals made the roles of organic radicals more important under higher ph conditions 3 4 influence of ph on nor transformation products pathways by mpuv paa 3 4 1 nor transformation products and pathways in the mpuv paa system the tps generated during nor degradation using the mpuv paa system under different ph conditions were identified using the uplc qtof detection method the mass measurements corresponding to nor and the tps are shown in table 2 and the ms ms spectra as well as the proposed fragmentation patterns are shown fig s9 fig s24 the number of tps detected at ph 5 7 and 9 were 10 15 and 9 respectively further to clarify the different process that led to the generation of these tps the products of nor degradation during mpuv only mpuv tba mpuv h2o2 and mpuv paa tba processes were also determined it was also necessary to determine the tps generated owing to the direct oxidation of nor by paa however this was difficult to realize given the low concentrations of the products tables s1 s3 lists the nor tps that were generated during these different processes at ph 5 7 and 9 at ph 5 the nor tps resulting from the mpuv paa process were identical to those from the mpuv h2o2 process however at ph 9 they were identical to those resulting from the mpuv paa tba process this observation supported the results reported in section 3 3 i e oh played a predominant role in nor degradation under acidic conditions while the organic radicals played a more important role under higher ph conditions based on the intermediate products identified a possible set of transformation pathways at different ph values were graphically illustrated as shown in fig 4 pathway 1 decarboxylation during the decarboxylation process a co group in the carboxylic acid group was eliminated leading to the formation of tp291 which was not formed in the mpuv paa tba process indicating that it was possibly generated owing to oh attack according to previous studies gupta and garg 2018 yu et al 2019 decarboxylation is considered as one of the fq degradation pathways in oh based aops in this study the decarboxylation process occurred at ph 5 and 7 in the mpuv paa system at ph 9 it was not observed this phenomenon could be attributed to the insignificant role of oh in nor degradation at ph 9 pathway 2 oh f substitution and piperazine ring transformation the oh f substitution process was observed under all the ph conditions employed in this study i e ph 5 7 and 9 with the generation of tp317 oh f substitution or defluorination was identified as the photodegradation pathway of nor and according to eq 5 under uv irradiation the ground state of nor can absorb photons and form the lowest triplet state and the fluorine removal is possibly due to the reaction of the triplet state of nor salma et al 2016 zhang et al 2019 it has also been reported that ph can influence the efficiency of the fq defluorination process which is more significant when the fqs are in the zwitterionic form than when they are in cationic and anionic forms wei et al 2013 at ph 5 and 7 tp317 was subjected to hydroxylation to produce tp333 based on the results shown in tables s1 s3 it could be proposed that tp333 was generated owing to attack by oh additionally at ph 7 and 9 tp333 was oxidized to produce tp319 this led to the opening of the piperazine ring pathway 3 piperazine ring transformation at ph 5 and 7 this pathway was initiated by the hydroxylation of the piperazine ring owing to oh attack leading to the formation of tp335 thereafter stepwise piperazine ring cleavage occurred owing to attack by oh and or organic radicals reportedly it has been proven that the piperazine ring in nor is an active group that is vulnerable to attacked by ros in particular oh primarily reacts via a hydrogen atom abstraction mechanism with a minor electron transfer mechanism chen et al 2019 while peroxyl radicals ch3c o o and ch3c o oo preferably react electron rich groups via electron transfer ao et al 2021 the two n atoms on the piperazine ring in the nor structure have lone pairs of electrons thus the peroxyl radicals may react with the nitrogen sites via an electron transfer mechanism a similar route for piperazine ring opening has also been proposed for nor degradation by sulfate radical oxidation li et al 2019 and the e ozonation process wang et al 2020 at ph 9 the product tp335 which was generated via oh oxidation was not observed this might be due to the less important role of oh under alkaline conditions tp321 and tp293 were also detected at ph 9 indicating the occurrence of piperazine ring opening at ph 9 pathway 4 direct fluoride loss and piperazine ring cleavage in this pathway nor degradation was initiated by another defluorination pathway i e the cleavage of the c f bond followed by direct fluoride loss thereafter the fluoride loss product possibly underwent a stepwise piperazine ring opening tp315 was oxidized to produce tp331 which has a dialdehyde derivative structure and further loss of one formaldehyde molecule in the opened piperazine ring led to the formation of tp303 which was then degraded to form tp275 via the loss of the second formaldehyde from the opened piperazine ring the above route occurred at ph 7 and 9 however at ph 5 only tp303 and tp275 were detected pathway 5 quinolone group transformation in this pathway the quinolone group of nor was destroyed to form the product tp277 in addition to the piperazine ring the quinolone system is also an electron rich region in nor serna galvis et al 2017 and the carbon carbon double bond which is adjacent to the carboxyl group shows high reactivity toward electrophilic attack by ros wang et al 2021 additionally the product tp277 could be further degraded to tp267 and tp251 leading to the opening of the quinolone ring in this pathway quinolone group transformation was observed at ph 5 7 and 9 3 4 2 comparison of mechanism and pathways as shown in fig 4 at ph 5 most of the tps were generated via oxidation by oh however at ph values of 7 and 9 there was an increase in the number of tps generated via oxidation by organic radicals in the mpuv paa system the most comprehensive intermediates could be detected at a ph of 7 possibly because at this ph the contributions of direct mpuv photolysis oxidation by oh and oxidation by organic radicals were relatively comparable fig 5 shows the relative peak areas corresponding to the detected tps with an up down trend at ph 5 the concentration of tp335 was obviously higher than those of the other tps demonstrating that piperazine ring transformation was the dominant reaction during nor degradation as previously discussed tp335 was supposedly generated by oh oxidation thus the above results once again confirmed that oh was the dominant nor degrading radical under acidic conditions at ph 7 tp317 which was produced via direct photolysis by mpuv had the highest relative peak area followed by tp335 tp303 and tp291 and as mentioned earlier nor photolysis exhibited the highest efficiency under neutral ph conditions this was confirmed by the results of the determination of the relative peak areas both tp335 and tp303 were identified as tps resulting from the opening of the piperazine ring on nor tp303 was also identified as a defluorination product additionally tp291 was produced via the demethylation of the piperazine ring thus it was also a piperazine ring transformation product therefore it can be concluded that the defluorination reaction and the piperazine ring transformation were the major nor degradation pathways at ph 7 furthermore at ph 9 tp321 showed the highest relative peak area followed by tp303 and tp331 specifically tp321 was produced during ros attack on the piperazine ring while tp303 and tp331 were identified as the products of the direct defluorination and piperazine ring cleavage respectively thus it could be inferred that direct fluoride loss and piperazine ring transformation are the major nor degradation pathways owing to mpuv photolysis and ros oxidation respectively overall piperazine ring transformation was always identified as the main nor degradation pathway by mpuv paa under different ph conditions and the defluorination reaction was enhanced under neutral and alkaline conditions as the ph increased the reactions initiated by organic radical attack improved therefore the piperazine ring was considered as the active site in the nor structure for attack by both oh and organic radicals 4 conclusion in this study we systematically provided mechanistic and kinetic insights into the ph dependent degradation of nor using a novel aop mpuv paa process the results obtained showed that mpuv paa treatment is an efficient nor degradation process and the degradation efficiency increased as the ph increased from 5 to 9 further ph influenced nor degradation via the mpuv paa process in two pronged aspects nor species dissociation and paa photolysis based ros generation furthermore paa photolysis under mpuv irradiation increased with increasing ph this was supported by the increase in εpaa with ph thus more ros were generated under higher ph conditions the epr spectra obtained also confirmed that the concentration of oh significantly increased at ph 7 compared with that at ph 5 however the oh signal dropped at ph 9 possibly owing to the consumption of oh to form organic radicals additionally oh was identified as the dominant radical for nor degradation in the mpuv paa process under acidic conditions while organic radicals played a more predominant role under neutral and alkaline conditions nor tps following the mpuv paa process were identified and different pathways for their formation under different ph conditions were also identified this work is helpful to assess the effect of the mpuv paa process on nor at various ph values thereby increasing our understanding of the use of ph values to improve the degradation performance of nor in order to advance our fundamental knowledge and the predictive capability of uv paa as a novel aop in environmental applications further research is needed including expanding this study to the effect of real water matrices and the evaluation of environmental risk declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

16691,enteric viruses are commonly present in water bodies in regions with poor sanitation although the occurrence of these viruses poses a health risk they are difficult to quantify due to their low concentration and they may remain undetected in the absence of adequate preconcentration the present study reports the synthesis and utilization of deae silica gel dsig as an adsorbent for virus concentration two coliphages ms2 and susp2 and an enteric virus rotavirus a rva were chosen for examining the preconcentration efficiency of dsig columns studies conducted at a low flow rate of 5 ml min yielded good removal of viruses through adsorption studies at a higher flow rate of 50 ml min followed by elution with optimized eluents yielded a high recovery of ms2 and rva even when they were present at low concentration 0 01 copy ml the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x glycine 3x broth 1 5 m nacl 2 tween ph 10 2 showed maximum elution of rva and ms2 optimal susp2 recovery was observed on employing an eluent composed of 1 5 m nacl 3 tween 0 05 m kh2po4 at ph 9 2 subsequently both the eluents were successively applied for elution of the adsorbed viruses this method was applied for virus preconcentration from lake water in the monsoon and winter seasons the dsig column could achieve adequate preconcentration for all the three viruses i e susp2 ms2 and rva even when they were present at very low concentration and the recovery achieved was comparable to that achieved with ultracentrifugation while the processing time required for handling large volumes of water was considerably lower graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords deae silica gel rotavirus a coliphages ms2 adsorption elution 1 introduction human activities are known to contaminate the environmental water bodies with various pathogens such as enteric viruses these viruses are known to cause a wide range of diseases majorly diarrhea and acute gastrointestinal problems fong and lipp 2005 ramírez castillo et al 2015 along with the ability of these viruses to be persistent in the environment for an extended period of time they are also known to be resistant to various disinfectants bosch 1998 moreover viruses are also reported to escape removal in the wastewater and water treatment processes they are known to be more resistant to various disinfection processes such as ozonation filtration chlorination and uv irradiation when compared to the other pathogenic and or enteric bacteria sano et al 2016 in the year 2015 1 3 million deaths were reported due to diarrhea by consumption of drinking water contaminated with bacteria and or viruses the disease burden is greatest in low income countries with poor access to safe water and sanitation tate et al 2016 troeger et al 2017 the typical concentration of enteric viruses in treated wastewater range between 1 0 10 3 to 1 0 102 per liter griffin et al 2003 thus the abundance of viruses in natural water bodies is expected to be low although present in low copy numbers they may cause infection at very low dosages the minimum infectious dose for an enteric virus such as rotavirus is 1 copy number ml graham et al 1987 shi et al 2017 thus it is essential to develop a method that efficiently concentrates these viruses for subsequent quantification with high sensitivity and reproducibility based on typical virus concentration in environmental water bodies international bodies such as european union eu bathing water directive have suggested the processing of 10 l sample of surface or marine water to a final volume of 20 30 ml for obtaining a detectable level of viruses gerba 2007 similar preconcentration is required for the detection of viruses in drinking water sources robertson et al 2003 various adsorption elution based concentration techniques have been developed over the years utilizing adsorbents with varying particle size and surface properties ikner et al 2011 these techniques referred to as viradel involve the use of electropositive or electronegative filters or cartridges cashdollar and wymer 2013 electropositive filters are known to show variable recovery rate and are also reported to clog easily whereas electronegative filters need preconditioning by acidification of the sample shi et al 2017 preconditioning is needed in case of electronegative filters as the viruses inherently carry a negative charge at neutral ph due to the presence of proteins on their surfaces jin et al 2014 pérez méndez et al 2014 among the various materials used as adsorbents for the concentration of viruses glass wool microporous membrane and nano alumina alooh fibers have been applied mostly for large volumes of experimentally spiked natural surface water samples apha 2012 karim et al 2009 filters such as microporous filter 1mds have also been recommended by the american public health association apha and american water works association awwa as a standard method for concentrating enteric viruses from large volumes of water however these methods have been known to result in variable recovery of viruses jin et al 2014 miao et al 2019 recently a study by miao et al 2019 employed an adsorbent based on silica coated with al oh 3 for the concentration of virus from coastal water samples the electropositive granular media egm developed by jin 2014 was successfully applied for concentrating viruses when high concentration of viruses was spiked into both coastal and freshwater samples however virus concentration in the environmental water samples can be as low as 1 copy l moreover the reusability of the adsorbent should also be investigated for prolonged usage thus the aim of the current study was to develop a novel adsorbent packed column based method for recovering viruses from natural water samples with improved efficiency and minimum preconditioning requirements deae silica gel dsig was synthesized and utilized as an adsorbent for the concentration of two indicator viruses coliphages and an enteric virus rotavirus a rva in the present study coliphages are bacteriophages that infect coliform bacteria that are widely used as indicator organisms denoting fecal contamination of water coliphages are typically categorized into two groups based on the receptor sites on the host as somatic coliphages and f specific coliphages somatic coliphages are lytic viruses that bind to the cell wall of the bacterial host while the f specific coliphages bind to the sex pili of the host gerba 2007 ms2 and susp2 used in this study belong to the group f specific coliphage and somatic coliphage respectively in addition to the coliphages that infect coliforms an enteric virus rotavirus a that infects humans via fecal oral route was also included in the study susp2 isolated from powai lake was found to be a superspreader virus implicated for increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria balcazar 2014 keen et al 2017 this further necessitates its concentration and detection in natural water bodies batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose and functionalized rice husk ash farha showed high adsorption as well as recovery of viruses from deae cellulose when optimized eluents were employed moreover the water matrix had little effect on the recovery of coliphages from deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 however since deae cellulose is a powdered adsorbent with gelatinous nature it cannot be employed in a packed bed column dsig can be used in a packed column due to its larger particle size compared to deae cellulose and its inert nature under ambient conditions initially a column packed with dsig was used for concentrating viruses from distilled water spiked with coliphages and rva prior eluent optimization studies conducted in batch mode helped in the choice of appropriate eluents for achieving effective preconcentration subsequently dsig packed columns were used for concentrating viruses from lake water samples collected from powai lake and masunda lake located in and around mumbai india control studies were also conducted to explore coliphage concentration using silanized silica gel the reusability of dsig was also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and viruses ms2 coliphage atcc 15 597 b1 and the bacterial host e coli c3000 were procured from american type culture collection manassas va usa and was cultured and maintained in 271b media susp2 a somatic coliphage was isolated from powai lake mumbai maharashtra pisharody et al 2021 susp2 and ms2 were propagated by allowing them to infect e coli c3000 in the exponential growth phase absorbance at 600 nm of 0 4 0 8 for 6 h at 37 c under shaking conditions 100 rpm this was followed by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 μm filter the filtrate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 25 000 rpm for 2 h at 4 c the pellet was thereafter re suspended in a buffer solution the virus stock was stored at 4 c and was periodically enumerated using double layer agar method the coliphages were detected and enumerated by double layer agar method kropinski et al 2009 briefly 100 µl of various dilutions of the coliphage along with 300 µl of the host e coli c3000 were mixed with 271b media soft agar 0 5 agar maintained at 45 c and was subsequently poured on a plate containing 271b media hard agar 1 5 agar the plates were then incubated at 37 c for 24 h to observe the zone of lysis which are referred to as plaques a plate with a plaque count ranging from 25 to 300 can be used for phage quantification coliphage concentration is expressed in terms of pfu ml 2 2 preparation of dsig adsorbent the method used was adapted from kundu and roy 1989 briefly 10 g of silica gel mesh size 100 200 was dried under vacuum for 30 min the dried silica gel was added to a mixture containing 100 ml of 10 λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane in toluene and 10 ml of n n diethyl ethanolamine deae and incubated for 20 h at 45 c hydrolysis and condensation of the coupling agent λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane facilitated the functionalization of silica gel with deae the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature the unbound silane was removed by washing with methanol followed by water and thereafter conversion to chloride form was achieved using dilute hydrochloric acid after drying under a vacuum the dsig was stored at room temperature silanized silica gel was prepared similarly by contacting 10 g of dried silica gel with 100 ml of 10 λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane in toluene for 20 h at 45 c and subsequently subjecting the adsorbent to similar post treatment steps 2 3 characterization of the dsig adsorbent the total mass of deae immobilized on the silica surface was determined by thermogravimetric analysis the samples were washed with methanol multiple times 3 5 times to remove the weakly bound deae molecules and were subsequently washed with 0 1 n hcl and distilled water dsig 10 15 mg was used for tga analysis dtg 60 shimadzu japan adsorbed water was removed at 110 c for about 60 min until a constant mass was obtained the temperature was then increased at the rate of 10 c min up to 900 c and was held constant for 90 min to reach a constant mass compressed air was used as purge gas to provide complete oxidation and combustion of the surface coating deae immobilized on silica gel was expressed as mg deae g of silica gel the effect of varying the ratio of deae and silica gel was also evaluated over the range 0 5 1 to 2 1 deae silica gel where 1 1 refers to 10 ml deae in 10 g silica gel as described in section 2 2 this was done to determine if variation in the deae silica gel ratio significantly affected the amount of deae immobilized on silica gel ftir analysis of the silica gel before and after functionalization with deae was performed using a 3000 hyperion microscope with vertex 80 ftir system bruker germany the spectra of dsig was compared with that of activated silanized silica gel for identifying the unique functional groups on the adsorbent and their role on virus adsorption 2 3 1 low flow rate column studies analysis of breakthrough profile slow flow rate q 5 ml min studies were initially conducted in columns of diameter 1 2 cm and packing depth of 3 cm and 5 cm on exhaustion the adsorbed coliphage susp2 and ms2 was eluted the eluents showing maximum desorption of the selected viruses were previously identified through batch sorption desorption studies using deae cellulose and farha as adsorbents pisharody et al 2021 the eluent used for recovery of susp2 was 3 tween 80 1 5 m nacl and 0 05 m kh2po4 at ph 9 2 na 1 5 m tw 3 this eluent was the best eluent for desorption of susp2 from deae cellulose for ms2 desorption from farha the optimized eluent contained 1 5 m nacl 3 tryptone 1 5 beef extract 3 75 glycine 0 05 m kh2po4 and 2 tween 80 at ph 10 2 na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x the breakthrough profiles for each column study were obtained by plotting ct co vs t where the bacteriophage concentration in the effluent at any time ct and virus concentration in influent co were quantified by performing plaque assay since even one copy of the virus can pose a threat ct 1 pfu ml was chosen as the breakthrough concentration and the time at which breakthrough occurred was the breakthrough time the time at which ct c0 just reached a fixed value and remained unchanged is referred to as the saturation time various parameters such as the empty bed contact time ebct and length of the mass transfer zone δ were determined using mathematical equations as discussed by weber 1972 equations s1 s6 in electronic supplementary material esm thomas model and yoon nelson model were fitted to the breakthrough curve for bacteriophages obtained from the lab scale column studies xu et al 2013 the breakthrough profiles obtained experimentally were fitted to the models by plotting a graph of ln c t c o 1 v s t the maximum adsorption capacity qꝏ of an adsorbent is critical for the design of an adsorbent column the thomas model eq 1 is commonly applied to determine qꝏ the thomas model assumes that adsorption equilibrium can be described by the langmuir model and the driving force for adsorption follows second order reversible sorption kinetics and axial dispersion is negligible the inherent assumption of the yoon nelson model eq 2 is that the decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the

with varying concentration of each virus susp2 ms2 and rva was passed through a dsig column 2 2 cm internal diameter id of 10 cm packing depth at a flow rate of 50 ml min using a peristaltic pump samples were collected from the column outlet at periodic intervals and the virus concentration was determined the bacteriophages were analyzed by plaque assay after the entire water sample was passed through the column the adsorbed viruses were eluted with na 1 5 m tw 3 for water samples spiked with susp2 for water samples spiked with rva and ms2 two eluents were tested i e na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x and na 1 5 m tw 2 coliphage adsorption on columns packed with silanized silica gel was also estimated to understand its role in virus sorption the efficacy of the regenerated dsig was tested for 4 cycles of adsorption desorption and regeneration 2 3 3 high flow rate column studies for simultaneous concentration of coliphages and rva lake water samples collected from masunda lake thane and powai lake mumbai were passed through dsig column 10 cm q 50 ml min to determine the recovery efficiency of the column for environmental water samples with low virus concentration after 3 5 l of the lake water was pumped through the column with the aid of a peristaltic pump the column was eluted using 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 3 followed by 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x eluent subsequently secondary concentration by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation ultracentrifugation was performed as discussed by farkas et al 2018 briefly 15 peg 6000 and 2 nacl were added to the primary concentrate and incubated at 4 c for 20 h thereafter the suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4 c and the pellet was re suspended in 1 ml of sm buffer similarly studies were also conducted with distilled water spiked with a mixture of viruses ms2 susp2 and rva and thereafter eluted with 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 3 followed by 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x eluent the 100 ml concentrate was further subjected to two different concentration methods peg precipitation and ultracentrifugation this was done to compare the efficiency of virus recovery achieved through different secondary concentration methods at viral load as low as 10 copy l 0 01 copy ml in distilled water the genomic material of the virus concentrated in the eluent was extracted using the geneall kit geneall korea this was followed by reverse transcription as both ms2 and rva contain rna as their genomic material the extracted dna cdna was then subjected to qpcr with primers o connell et al 2006 ye et al 2012 specific to each of the virus pisharody et al 2021 and the copy number of the viruses susp2 ms2 and rva were quantified using the standard curve figure s1 in esm a non template control containing primers reagents enzyme and nuclease free water and positive control were included in each reaction the qpcr reaction conditions were maintained as suggested by the manufacturer brilliant iii ultra fast sybr green qpcr master mix agilent usa each qpcr reaction mix used for quantifying the coliphages and rva contained 2 μl template dna cdna or standard 10 μl of 2x sybr green qpcr master mix 1 μl 500 nm of forward primer 1 μl 500 nm of reverse primer and 6 μl of nuclease free water for a 20 μl qpcr reaction the thermal cycling protocol for qpcr was as follows initial incubation at 95 c for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 c denaturation for 5 s and 60 c annealing and extension for 10 s all the qpcr reactions were performed by using a real time pcr detection system cfx 96 biorad usa the limit of detection for qpcr assay is 10 gene copies reaction the same volume of lake water was concentrated using only ultracentrifuge for primary concentration and its recovery was compared to that obtained for the dsig column all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the error bars depict standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization immobilization of deae on silanized silica gel is expected to increase the amide and si o si groups on the surface of the adsorbent the ftir spectra for silica gel before and after treatment was analyzed and a significant increase in peaks corresponding to si o si and nh group was observed the ftir spectra and the wavelength corresponding to the peaks are shown in fig 1 deae loading on silica gel was 328 13 5 mg g based on duplicate analysis the amount of deae immobilized on silica gel varied over the range 307 6 9 mg g to 385 15 5 mg g when the deae silica gel ratio was increased from 0 25 1 to 2 1 however at constant mass of silica gel the volume of deae used during dsig synthesis had no significant effect on deae loaded on silica gel p 0 05 3 2 analysis of coliphage breakthrough profiles for low flow rate column studies the breakthrough profiles for adsorption of coliphages on dsig packed columns were significantly affected by the bed depth and also by the influent virus concentration the total amount of coliphages adsorbed on the column was found to reduce as the depth of the column was reduced from 5 cm to 3 cm an increase in the influent virus concentration resulted in earlier breakthrough and exhaustion of the column breakthrough profile for each column was separately analyzed and the column parameters such as length of the mass transfer zone mtz empty bed contact time ebct and time required for establishing a stable mtz for the coliphages susp2 and ms2 are summarized in esm table s2 and table s3 respectively the length of the mass transfer zone δ increased with an increase in influent coliphage concentration this may be attributed to the relative reduction in the number of active sites on the adsorbent for the adsorption of coliphages the breakthrough profiles obtained experimentally were fitted with the thomas model eq 1 and yoon nelson model eq 2 by non linear regression fig 2 the model parameters are shown in table 1 the thomas model rate constant kth decreased as the concentration of the coliphage in the influent increased as expected qꝏ was found to increase as the initial virus concentration increased the yoon nelson parameter τ was found to decrease with an increase in inlet virus concentration and decrease in the column length table 1 the experimental values and model fitted values matched very well for all the flow rates and the breakthrough curves exhibited a good fit to both the models fig 2a d on exhaustion of the column the virus was recovered by elution however the recovery of viruses on elution was found to be poor possibly due to loss of infectivity over the long run time 10 days 3 3 high flowrate column studies for preconcentration of virus present individually separate studies were conducted for each coliphage and rva spiked in distilled water breakthrough profiles for the column studies during loading of ms2 and susp2 at initial concentration of 104 and 105 pfu l are shown in fig 3 a column loaded with 105 pfu l of susp2 was found to reach saturation within 100 min of operation in contrast the column loaded with 105 pfu l ms2 did not reach exhaustion even after 200 min ct co 0 033 for a column loaded with 104 pfu l of ms2 no virus was detected in the effluent over the entire 240 min duration of the study while under similar experimental conditions susp2 was detected in the effluent within 20 min for the study with ms2 the column was not found to be exhausted even after 240 min elution of ms2 from the column employing the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x showed good recovery however the recovery of susp2 from the column with the eluent na 1 5 m tw 3 was lower since adsorption of the virus was lower at higher flowrate q 50 ml min the eluents were selected based on batch studies previously conducted using deae cellulose and farha pisharody et al 2021 the elution of the coliphages from the column was instantaneous such that the coliphage count recovered remained constant beyond 2 min cumulative elution profile for susp2 and ms2 elution using eluents na 1 5 m tw 3 na 1 5 m tw 2 and na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x are shown in figure s2 esm percentage of coliphage desorbed with respect to total virus adsorbed on the column and of coliphage recovered with respect to total virus passed through the column were computed based on mass balance these results were consistent with the results obtained from batch studies using deae cellulose where na 1 5 m tw 3 and na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x were found to show efficient desorption of susp2 from deae cellulose and desorption of ms2 from farha respectively however the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 that showed good ms2 desorption from deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 showed poor recovery of ms2 from dsig rva desorption was also poor with na 1 5 m tw 2 possibly ms2 and rva interacted with silica thus their elution with na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x was better than with na 1 5 m tw 2 in batch studies na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x could efficiently desorb ms2 and rva from a silica rich sorbent derived from rice husk ash and moringa oleifera seed protein control studies with silanized silica gel revealed some adsorption of susp2 and ms2 although adsorption was lower than that for dsig fig 3 the dsig column could be readily regenerated by methanol wash followed by acid wash and a subsequent water washing step to achieve neutral ph kundu and roy 1989 the adsorbent did not lose its efficiency even after four rounds of adsorption and elution figure s3 in esm table 2 summarizes the desorption and recovery of viruses from the dsig packed column desorption of viruses was essentially unaffected by the initial virus concentration p 0 05 however the recovery of ms2 and rva was found to be higher compared to that of susp2 similar observations were made in batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 rva recovery ranged between 97 and 99 however in some of the studies the initial virus concentration could not be measured through qpcr since the initial virus concentration chosen was below the detection limit 10 copies reaction in such cases the number of viral genome copies were only quantified after elution 3 4 high flow rate column studies for simultaneous preconcentration of coliphages and rva synthetic water sw samples were synthesized by simultaneously spiking viruses ms2 susp2 and rva in distilled water 10 l at various concentrations the sw samples were concentrated using the dsig column and thereafter the two secondary concentration methods were applied and the results were compared virus concentration for each of the virus was kept as low as 10 copies l 0 01 copy ml to check the efficiency of the column at low viral concentration fig 4 compares the recovery of viruses employing the dsig packed column as the primary pre concentration method and ultracentrifugation peg precipitation as the secondary concentration method the concentration of susp2 ms2 and rotavirus a rva in the concentrated sample was quantified through qpcr the standard curve correlating ct value and log copy number for coliphages is shown in esm figure s1 and an external standard for rva was constructed as discussed by pisharody et al 2021 it can be observed from fig 4 that rva and ms2 could be detected even when very low concentration 10 copies l of the virus was present in the influent in contrast susp2 could only be detected at co of 1000 copies l and above thus susp2 recovery from dsig was relatively lower compared to that of rva and ms2 it was also observed that ultracentrifugation uc was a better secondary concentration method compared to peg precipitation peg precipitation possibly concentrated the qpcr inhibitors which subsequently reduced the recovery ahmed et al 2020 the recovery obtained on concentration with the dsig column showed high error this may be attributed to the low influent concentration of virus up to 10 copy l which was below the qpcr detection limit moreover for qpcr analysis it was not practically possible to generate the qpcr standard curve for each analysis only positive controls were analysed each time during qpcr analysis in deae cellulose it has been shown that the fixed cationic functional groups on deae facilitated adsorption of coliphage and rva while cellulose was relatively inert pisharody et al 2021 in addition to similar electrostatic interactions additional hydrophobic interactions are also expected due to presence of silica gel in dsig together with deae ms2 susp2 and rva had ph at point of zero charge phpzc of 2 8 3 7 and 5 8 respectively pisharody et al 2021 gerba et al 2008 thus they are all negatively charged over the ph range expected in environmental water samples while ms2 and rva are icosahedral and circular of size 23 nm and 70 nm respectively susp2 has a hexagonal head with a long tail with a size of 190 nm pisharody et al 2021 gerba et al 2008 also susp2 having a higher negative zeta potential compared to ms2 9 21 and 7 28 mv respectively showed poor recovery since it interacted more strongly with the adsorbent as also reported for batch studies with deae cellulose damage to the virus after elution from the adsorbent may have also contributed to its lower recovery compared to ms2 and rva eluents employed in the current study contained high concentration of salt that facilitated double layer compression and thus reduced electrostatic interaction between viruses and dsig while presence of a non ionic surfactant ensured reduction of hydrophobic interactions between viruses and dsig ikner et al 2011 pisharody et al 2021 thus a combination of salt and surfactant at high ph facilitated recovery of viruses adsorbed on dsig thereafter lake samples were collected from powai and masunda lake and the samples were concentrated using two different primary concentration methods dsig column and ultracentrifugation primary concentration using dsig column was followed by secondary concentration using ultracentrifugation table 3 summarizes the virus recovered by dsig column and ultracentrifugation over the monsoon and winter months for samples collected from the two lakes in and around mumbai india it can be observed that the performance of both the methods were comparable for concentration of virus from lake water monsoon was chosen as the season for checking the efficiency of the dsig column since water samples collected in this season were expected to have the lowest viral load some samples were also collected in winter november 2019 january 2020 as rva concentration was found to be highest in winter in the indian lakes thus if the dsig column is capable of capturing the virus at both high and low concentration it would be effective for virus concentration in all the seasons it was observed that even when the viruses were not detectable based on concentration using ultracentrifugation as the primary concentration method the use of dsig column as primary concentration method followed by ultracentrifugation was capable of concentrating the viruses this observation may be linked with the long time required for concentration of viruses from large volume of water samples in the ultracentrifugation method thus dsig packed cartridges or columns could be further explored at even higher flowrates 300 500 ml min for concentrating viruses from large volume of water samples similar to the existing viradel cartridges filters atabakhsh et al 2019 ikner et al 2011 miao et al 2019 moreover the dsig columns can also be reused multiple times without loss of concentration efficiency and can easily be stored at room temperature for extended durations unlike deae cellulose after the 4th cycle of regeneration and reuse ms2 adsorption on the dsig columns was the same as that for unused dsig 100 and recovery was in the range of 80 90 batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose also showed similar regeneration capacity the existing adsorbents employed for virus concentration by the viradel method have shown variable recovery also as most research studies have not reported desorption and recovery separately it was not possible to identify the limiting factor i e whether the recovery is affected by the choice of adsorbent or by the choice of the eluent borrego et al 1991 ikner et al 2011 shi et al 2017 recently miao et al 2019 developed a method for the concentration of enteric viruses from freshwater samples and coastal water samples the researchers prepared cartridges filled with 800 g of electropositive granular media for virus concentration the time required for virus concentration was significantly lowered as the flow rate was optimized to 300 ml min the recovery reported by miao et al 2019 was better than the existing methods however they conducted the preconcentration studies with relatively high copy number of viruses 105 1010 copies 4 conclusions a number of virus concentration techniques have been developed over the years and adsorption elution is one of the preferred methods however the major challenges associated with these methods are poor reproducibility and low recovery during elution in the current study a column packed with dsig was evaluated for both removal and concentration of viruses from water samples the ability of dsig packed bed column to concentrate viruses was evaluated over a range of virus concentration 107 10 pfu l the study revealed good recovery of indicator coliphage ms2 and enteric virus rotavirus a rva even at very low virus concentrations of 10 copy l with the optimized eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x however coliphage susp2 recovery was not found to be as high as that for the other two viruses rva and ms2 while dsig yielded good coliphage sorption silanized silica gel alone was not as good a sorbent for the sorption of coliphages concentration of viruses from lake water collected in monsoon and winter months showed recovery comparable to that achieved using an ultracentrifuge recovery of the viruses from lake water during monsoon months when the virus concentration is the lowest also revealed the applicability of this method for virus concentration from drinking water sources as well moreover the method required low

16691,enteric viruses are commonly present in water bodies in regions with poor sanitation although the occurrence of these viruses poses a health risk they are difficult to quantify due to their low concentration and they may remain undetected in the absence of adequate preconcentration the present study reports the synthesis and utilization of deae silica gel dsig as an adsorbent for virus concentration two coliphages ms2 and susp2 and an enteric virus rotavirus a rva were chosen for examining the preconcentration efficiency of dsig columns studies conducted at a low flow rate of 5 ml min yielded good removal of viruses through adsorption studies at a higher flow rate of 50 ml min followed by elution with optimized eluents yielded a high recovery of ms2 and rva even when they were present at low concentration 0 01 copy ml the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x glycine 3x broth 1 5 m nacl 2 tween ph 10 2 showed maximum elution of rva and ms2 optimal susp2 recovery was observed on employing an eluent composed of 1 5 m nacl 3 tween 0 05 m kh2po4 at ph 9 2 subsequently both the eluents were successively applied for elution of the adsorbed viruses this method was applied for virus preconcentration from lake water in the monsoon and winter seasons the dsig column could achieve adequate preconcentration for all the three viruses i e susp2 ms2 and rva even when they were present at very low concentration and the recovery achieved was comparable to that achieved with ultracentrifugation while the processing time required for handling large volumes of water was considerably lower graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords deae silica gel rotavirus a coliphages ms2 adsorption elution 1 introduction human activities are known to contaminate the environmental water bodies with various pathogens such as enteric viruses these viruses are known to cause a wide range of diseases majorly diarrhea and acute gastrointestinal problems fong and lipp 2005 ramírez castillo et al 2015 along with the ability of these viruses to be persistent in the environment for an extended period of time they are also known to be resistant to various disinfectants bosch 1998 moreover viruses are also reported to escape removal in the wastewater and water treatment processes they are known to be more resistant to various disinfection processes such as ozonation filtration chlorination and uv irradiation when compared to the other pathogenic and or enteric bacteria sano et al 2016 in the year 2015 1 3 million deaths were reported due to diarrhea by consumption of drinking water contaminated with bacteria and or viruses the disease burden is greatest in low income countries with poor access to safe water and sanitation tate et al 2016 troeger et al 2017 the typical concentration of enteric viruses in treated wastewater range between 1 0 10 3 to 1 0 102 per liter griffin et al 2003 thus the abundance of viruses in natural water bodies is expected to be low although present in low copy numbers they may cause infection at very low dosages the minimum infectious dose for an enteric virus such as rotavirus is 1 copy number ml graham et al 1987 shi et al 2017 thus it is essential to develop a method that efficiently concentrates these viruses for subsequent quantification with high sensitivity and reproducibility based on typical virus concentration in environmental water bodies international bodies such as european union eu bathing water directive have suggested the processing of 10 l sample of surface or marine water to a final volume of 20 30 ml for obtaining a detectable level of viruses gerba 2007 similar preconcentration is required for the detection of viruses in drinking water sources robertson et al 2003 various adsorption elution based concentration techniques have been developed over the years utilizing adsorbents with varying particle size and surface properties ikner et al 2011 these techniques referred to as viradel involve the use of electropositive or electronegative filters or cartridges cashdollar and wymer 2013 electropositive filters are known to show variable recovery rate and are also reported to clog easily whereas electronegative filters need preconditioning by acidification of the sample shi et al 2017 preconditioning is needed in case of electronegative filters as the viruses inherently carry a negative charge at neutral ph due to the presence of proteins on their surfaces jin et al 2014 pérez méndez et al 2014 among the various materials used as adsorbents for the concentration of viruses glass wool microporous membrane and nano alumina alooh fibers have been applied mostly for large volumes of experimentally spiked natural surface water samples apha 2012 karim et al 2009 filters such as microporous filter 1mds have also been recommended by the american public health association apha and american water works association awwa as a standard method for concentrating enteric viruses from large volumes of water however these methods have been known to result in variable recovery of viruses jin et al 2014 miao et al 2019 recently a study by miao et al 2019 employed an adsorbent based on silica coated with al oh 3 for the concentration of virus from coastal water samples the electropositive granular media egm developed by jin 2014 was successfully applied for concentrating viruses when high concentration of viruses was spiked into both coastal and freshwater samples however virus concentration in the environmental water samples can be as low as 1 copy l moreover the reusability of the adsorbent should also be investigated for prolonged usage thus the aim of the current study was to develop a novel adsorbent packed column based method for recovering viruses from natural water samples with improved efficiency and minimum preconditioning requirements deae silica gel dsig was synthesized and utilized as an adsorbent for the concentration of two indicator viruses coliphages and an enteric virus rotavirus a rva in the present study coliphages are bacteriophages that infect coliform bacteria that are widely used as indicator organisms denoting fecal contamination of water coliphages are typically categorized into two groups based on the receptor sites on the host as somatic coliphages and f specific coliphages somatic coliphages are lytic viruses that bind to the cell wall of the bacterial host while the f specific coliphages bind to the sex pili of the host gerba 2007 ms2 and susp2 used in this study belong to the group f specific coliphage and somatic coliphage respectively in addition to the coliphages that infect coliforms an enteric virus rotavirus a that infects humans via fecal oral route was also included in the study susp2 isolated from powai lake was found to be a superspreader virus implicated for increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria balcazar 2014 keen et al 2017 this further necessitates its concentration and detection in natural water bodies batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose and functionalized rice husk ash farha showed high adsorption as well as recovery of viruses from deae cellulose when optimized eluents were employed moreover the water matrix had little effect on the recovery of coliphages from deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 however since deae cellulose is a powdered adsorbent with gelatinous nature it cannot be employed in a packed bed column dsig can be used in a packed column due to its larger particle size compared to deae cellulose and its inert nature under ambient conditions initially a column packed with dsig was used for concentrating viruses from distilled water spiked with coliphages and rva prior eluent optimization studies conducted in batch mode helped in the choice of appropriate eluents for achieving effective preconcentration subsequently dsig packed columns were used for concentrating viruses from lake water samples collected from powai lake and masunda lake located in and around mumbai india control studies were also conducted to explore coliphage concentration using silanized silica gel the reusability of dsig was also examined 2 materials and methods 2 1 bacterial strains and viruses ms2 coliphage atcc 15 597 b1 and the bacterial host e coli c3000 were procured from american type culture collection manassas va usa and was cultured and maintained in 271b media susp2 a somatic coliphage was isolated from powai lake mumbai maharashtra pisharody et al 2021 susp2 and ms2 were propagated by allowing them to infect e coli c3000 in the exponential growth phase absorbance at 600 nm of 0 4 0 8 for 6 h at 37 c under shaking conditions 100 rpm this was followed by centrifugation at 6000 g for 10 min at 4 c and the supernatant was filtered through 0 22 μm filter the filtrate was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 25 000 rpm for 2 h at 4 c the pellet was thereafter re suspended in a buffer solution the virus stock was stored at 4 c and was periodically enumerated using double layer agar method the coliphages were detected and enumerated by double layer agar method kropinski et al 2009 briefly 100 µl of various dilutions of the coliphage along with 300 µl of the host e coli c3000 were mixed with 271b media soft agar 0 5 agar maintained at 45 c and was subsequently poured on a plate containing 271b media hard agar 1 5 agar the plates were then incubated at 37 c for 24 h to observe the zone of lysis which are referred to as plaques a plate with a plaque count ranging from 25 to 300 can be used for phage quantification coliphage concentration is expressed in terms of pfu ml 2 2 preparation of dsig adsorbent the method used was adapted from kundu and roy 1989 briefly 10 g of silica gel mesh size 100 200 was dried under vacuum for 30 min the dried silica gel was added to a mixture containing 100 ml of 10 λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane in toluene and 10 ml of n n diethyl ethanolamine deae and incubated for 20 h at 45 c hydrolysis and condensation of the coupling agent λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane facilitated the functionalization of silica gel with deae the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature the unbound silane was removed by washing with methanol followed by water and thereafter conversion to chloride form was achieved using dilute hydrochloric acid after drying under a vacuum the dsig was stored at room temperature silanized silica gel was prepared similarly by contacting 10 g of dried silica gel with 100 ml of 10 λ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane in toluene for 20 h at 45 c and subsequently subjecting the adsorbent to similar post treatment steps 2 3 characterization of the dsig adsorbent the total mass of deae immobilized on the silica surface was determined by thermogravimetric analysis the samples were washed with methanol multiple times 3 5 times to remove the weakly bound deae molecules and were subsequently washed with 0 1 n hcl and distilled water dsig 10 15 mg was used for tga analysis dtg 60 shimadzu japan adsorbed water was removed at 110 c for about 60 min until a constant mass was obtained the temperature was then increased at the rate of 10 c min up to 900 c and was held constant for 90 min to reach a constant mass compressed air was used as purge gas to provide complete oxidation and combustion of the surface coating deae immobilized on silica gel was expressed as mg deae g of silica gel the effect of varying the ratio of deae and silica gel was also evaluated over the range 0 5 1 to 2 1 deae silica gel where 1 1 refers to 10 ml deae in 10 g silica gel as described in section 2 2 this was done to determine if variation in the deae silica gel ratio significantly affected the amount of deae immobilized on silica gel ftir analysis of the silica gel before and after functionalization with deae was performed using a 3000 hyperion microscope with vertex 80 ftir system bruker germany the spectra of dsig was compared with that of activated silanized silica gel for identifying the unique functional groups on the adsorbent and their role on virus adsorption 2 3 1 low flow rate column studies analysis of breakthrough profile slow flow rate q 5 ml min studies were initially conducted in columns of diameter 1 2 cm and packing depth of 3 cm and 5 cm on exhaustion the adsorbed coliphage susp2 and ms2 was eluted the eluents showing maximum desorption of the selected viruses were previously identified through batch sorption desorption studies using deae cellulose and farha as adsorbents pisharody et al 2021 the eluent used for recovery of susp2 was 3 tween 80 1 5 m nacl and 0 05 m kh2po4 at ph 9 2 na 1 5 m tw 3 this eluent was the best eluent for desorption of susp2 from deae cellulose for ms2 desorption from farha the optimized eluent contained 1 5 m nacl 3 tryptone 1 5 beef extract 3 75 glycine 0 05 m kh2po4 and 2 tween 80 at ph 10 2 na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x the breakthrough profiles for each column study were obtained by plotting ct co vs t where the bacteriophage concentration in the effluent at any time ct and virus concentration in influent co were quantified by performing plaque assay since even one copy of the virus can pose a threat ct 1 pfu ml was chosen as the breakthrough concentration and the time at which breakthrough occurred was the breakthrough time the time at which ct c0 just reached a fixed value and remained unchanged is referred to as the saturation time various parameters such as the empty bed contact time ebct and length of the mass transfer zone δ were determined using mathematical equations as discussed by weber 1972 equations s1 s6 in electronic supplementary material esm thomas model and yoon nelson model were fitted to the breakthrough curve for bacteriophages obtained from the lab scale column studies xu et al 2013 the breakthrough profiles obtained experimentally were fitted to the models by plotting a graph of ln c t c o 1 v s t the maximum adsorption capacity qꝏ of an adsorbent is critical for the design of an adsorbent column the thomas model eq 1 is commonly applied to determine qꝏ the thomas model assumes that adsorption equilibrium can be described by the langmuir model and the driving force for adsorption follows second order reversible sorption kinetics and axial dispersion is negligible the inherent assumption of the yoon nelson model eq 2 is that the decrease in the probability of adsorption for each adsorbate molecule is proportional to the probability of adsorption and the probability of sorbate breakthrough on the sorbent soetaredjo et al 2014 1 c t c o 1 1 exp k t h q x q k t h t c o where kth is the thomas model rate constant ml min

with varying concentration of each virus susp2 ms2 and rva was passed through a dsig column 2 2 cm internal diameter id of 10 cm packing depth at a flow rate of 50 ml min using a peristaltic pump samples were collected from the column outlet at periodic intervals and the virus concentration was determined the bacteriophages were analyzed by plaque assay after the entire water sample was passed through the column the adsorbed viruses were eluted with na 1 5 m tw 3 for water samples spiked with susp2 for water samples spiked with rva and ms2 two eluents were tested i e na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x and na 1 5 m tw 2 coliphage adsorption on columns packed with silanized silica gel was also estimated to understand its role in virus sorption the efficacy of the regenerated dsig was tested for 4 cycles of adsorption desorption and regeneration 2 3 3 high flow rate column studies for simultaneous concentration of coliphages and rva lake water samples collected from masunda lake thane and powai lake mumbai were passed through dsig column 10 cm q 50 ml min to determine the recovery efficiency of the column for environmental water samples with low virus concentration after 3 5 l of the lake water was pumped through the column with the aid of a peristaltic pump the column was eluted using 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 3 followed by 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x eluent subsequently secondary concentration by polyethylene glycol peg precipitation ultracentrifugation was performed as discussed by farkas et al 2018 briefly 15 peg 6000 and 2 nacl were added to the primary concentrate and incubated at 4 c for 20 h thereafter the suspension was centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4 c and the pellet was re suspended in 1 ml of sm buffer similarly studies were also conducted with distilled water spiked with a mixture of viruses ms2 susp2 and rva and thereafter eluted with 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 3 followed by 50 ml of na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x eluent the 100 ml concentrate was further subjected to two different concentration methods peg precipitation and ultracentrifugation this was done to compare the efficiency of virus recovery achieved through different secondary concentration methods at viral load as low as 10 copy l 0 01 copy ml in distilled water the genomic material of the virus concentrated in the eluent was extracted using the geneall kit geneall korea this was followed by reverse transcription as both ms2 and rva contain rna as their genomic material the extracted dna cdna was then subjected to qpcr with primers o connell et al 2006 ye et al 2012 specific to each of the virus pisharody et al 2021 and the copy number of the viruses susp2 ms2 and rva were quantified using the standard curve figure s1 in esm a non template control containing primers reagents enzyme and nuclease free water and positive control were included in each reaction the qpcr reaction conditions were maintained as suggested by the manufacturer brilliant iii ultra fast sybr green qpcr master mix agilent usa each qpcr reaction mix used for quantifying the coliphages and rva contained 2 μl template dna cdna or standard 10 μl of 2x sybr green qpcr master mix 1 μl 500 nm of forward primer 1 μl 500 nm of reverse primer and 6 μl of nuclease free water for a 20 μl qpcr reaction the thermal cycling protocol for qpcr was as follows initial incubation at 95 c for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 c denaturation for 5 s and 60 c annealing and extension for 10 s all the qpcr reactions were performed by using a real time pcr detection system cfx 96 biorad usa the limit of detection for qpcr assay is 10 gene copies reaction the same volume of lake water was concentrated using only ultracentrifuge for primary concentration and its recovery was compared to that obtained for the dsig column all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and the error bars depict standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorbent characterization immobilization of deae on silanized silica gel is expected to increase the amide and si o si groups on the surface of the adsorbent the ftir spectra for silica gel before and after treatment was analyzed and a significant increase in peaks corresponding to si o si and nh group was observed the ftir spectra and the wavelength corresponding to the peaks are shown in fig 1 deae loading on silica gel was 328 13 5 mg g based on duplicate analysis the amount of deae immobilized on silica gel varied over the range 307 6 9 mg g to 385 15 5 mg g when the deae silica gel ratio was increased from 0 25 1 to 2 1 however at constant mass of silica gel the volume of deae used during dsig synthesis had no significant effect on deae loaded on silica gel p 0 05 3 2 analysis of coliphage breakthrough profiles for low flow rate column studies the breakthrough profiles for adsorption of coliphages on dsig packed columns were significantly affected by the bed depth and also by the influent virus concentration the total amount of coliphages adsorbed on the column was found to reduce as the depth of the column was reduced from 5 cm to 3 cm an increase in the influent virus concentration resulted in earlier breakthrough and exhaustion of the column breakthrough profile for each column was separately analyzed and the column parameters such as length of the mass transfer zone mtz empty bed contact time ebct and time required for establishing a stable mtz for the coliphages susp2 and ms2 are summarized in esm table s2 and table s3 respectively the length of the mass transfer zone δ increased with an increase in influent coliphage concentration this may be attributed to the relative reduction in the number of active sites on the adsorbent for the adsorption of coliphages the breakthrough profiles obtained experimentally were fitted with the thomas model eq 1 and yoon nelson model eq 2 by non linear regression fig 2 the model parameters are shown in table 1 the thomas model rate constant kth decreased as the concentration of the coliphage in the influent increased as expected qꝏ was found to increase as the initial virus concentration increased the yoon nelson parameter τ was found to decrease with an increase in inlet virus concentration and decrease in the column length table 1 the experimental values and model fitted values matched very well for all the flow rates and the breakthrough curves exhibited a good fit to both the models fig 2a d on exhaustion of the column the virus was recovered by elution however the recovery of viruses on elution was found to be poor possibly due to loss of infectivity over the long run time 10 days 3 3 high flowrate column studies for preconcentration of virus present individually separate studies were conducted for each coliphage and rva spiked in distilled water breakthrough profiles for the column studies during loading of ms2 and susp2 at initial concentration of 104 and 105 pfu l are shown in fig 3 a column loaded with 105 pfu l of susp2 was found to reach saturation within 100 min of operation in contrast the column loaded with 105 pfu l ms2 did not reach exhaustion even after 200 min ct co 0 033 for a column loaded with 104 pfu l of ms2 no virus was detected in the effluent over the entire 240 min duration of the study while under similar experimental conditions susp2 was detected in the effluent within 20 min for the study with ms2 the column was not found to be exhausted even after 240 min elution of ms2 from the column employing the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x showed good recovery however the recovery of susp2 from the column with the eluent na 1 5 m tw 3 was lower since adsorption of the virus was lower at higher flowrate q 50 ml min the eluents were selected based on batch studies previously conducted using deae cellulose and farha pisharody et al 2021 the elution of the coliphages from the column was instantaneous such that the coliphage count recovered remained constant beyond 2 min cumulative elution profile for susp2 and ms2 elution using eluents na 1 5 m tw 3 na 1 5 m tw 2 and na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x are shown in figure s2 esm percentage of coliphage desorbed with respect to total virus adsorbed on the column and of coliphage recovered with respect to total virus passed through the column were computed based on mass balance these results were consistent with the results obtained from batch studies using deae cellulose where na 1 5 m tw 3 and na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x were found to show efficient desorption of susp2 from deae cellulose and desorption of ms2 from farha respectively however the eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 that showed good ms2 desorption from deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 showed poor recovery of ms2 from dsig rva desorption was also poor with na 1 5 m tw 2 possibly ms2 and rva interacted with silica thus their elution with na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x was better than with na 1 5 m tw 2 in batch studies na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x could efficiently desorb ms2 and rva from a silica rich sorbent derived from rice husk ash and moringa oleifera seed protein control studies with silanized silica gel revealed some adsorption of susp2 and ms2 although adsorption was lower than that for dsig fig 3 the dsig column could be readily regenerated by methanol wash followed by acid wash and a subsequent water washing step to achieve neutral ph kundu and roy 1989 the adsorbent did not lose its efficiency even after four rounds of adsorption and elution figure s3 in esm table 2 summarizes the desorption and recovery of viruses from the dsig packed column desorption of viruses was essentially unaffected by the initial virus concentration p 0 05 however the recovery of ms2 and rva was found to be higher compared to that of susp2 similar observations were made in batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose pisharody et al 2021 rva recovery ranged between 97 and 99 however in some of the studies the initial virus concentration could not be measured through qpcr since the initial virus concentration chosen was below the detection limit 10 copies reaction in such cases the number of viral genome copies were only quantified after elution 3 4 high flow rate column studies for simultaneous preconcentration of coliphages and rva synthetic water sw samples were synthesized by simultaneously spiking viruses ms2 susp2 and rva in distilled water 10 l at various concentrations the sw samples were concentrated using the dsig column and thereafter the two secondary concentration methods were applied and the results were compared virus concentration for each of the virus was kept as low as 10 copies l 0 01 copy ml to check the efficiency of the column at low viral concentration fig 4 compares the recovery of viruses employing the dsig packed column as the primary pre concentration method and ultracentrifugation peg precipitation as the secondary concentration method the concentration of susp2 ms2 and rotavirus a rva in the concentrated sample was quantified through qpcr the standard curve correlating ct value and log copy number for coliphages is shown in esm figure s1 and an external standard for rva was constructed as discussed by pisharody et al 2021 it can be observed from fig 4 that rva and ms2 could be detected even when very low concentration 10 copies l of the virus was present in the influent in contrast susp2 could only be detected at co of 1000 copies l and above thus susp2 recovery from dsig was relatively lower compared to that of rva and ms2 it was also observed that ultracentrifugation uc was a better secondary concentration method compared to peg precipitation peg precipitation possibly concentrated the qpcr inhibitors which subsequently reduced the recovery ahmed et al 2020 the recovery obtained on concentration with the dsig column showed high error this may be attributed to the low influent concentration of virus up to 10 copy l which was below the qpcr detection limit moreover for qpcr analysis it was not practically possible to generate the qpcr standard curve for each analysis only positive controls were analysed each time during qpcr analysis in deae cellulose it has been shown that the fixed cationic functional groups on deae facilitated adsorption of coliphage and rva while cellulose was relatively inert pisharody et al 2021 in addition to similar electrostatic interactions additional hydrophobic interactions are also expected due to presence of silica gel in dsig together with deae ms2 susp2 and rva had ph at point of zero charge phpzc of 2 8 3 7 and 5 8 respectively pisharody et al 2021 gerba et al 2008 thus they are all negatively charged over the ph range expected in environmental water samples while ms2 and rva are icosahedral and circular of size 23 nm and 70 nm respectively susp2 has a hexagonal head with a long tail with a size of 190 nm pisharody et al 2021 gerba et al 2008 also susp2 having a higher negative zeta potential compared to ms2 9 21 and 7 28 mv respectively showed poor recovery since it interacted more strongly with the adsorbent as also reported for batch studies with deae cellulose damage to the virus after elution from the adsorbent may have also contributed to its lower recovery compared to ms2 and rva eluents employed in the current study contained high concentration of salt that facilitated double layer compression and thus reduced electrostatic interaction between viruses and dsig while presence of a non ionic surfactant ensured reduction of hydrophobic interactions between viruses and dsig ikner et al 2011 pisharody et al 2021 thus a combination of salt and surfactant at high ph facilitated recovery of viruses adsorbed on dsig thereafter lake samples were collected from powai and masunda lake and the samples were concentrated using two different primary concentration methods dsig column and ultracentrifugation primary concentration using dsig column was followed by secondary concentration using ultracentrifugation table 3 summarizes the virus recovered by dsig column and ultracentrifugation over the monsoon and winter months for samples collected from the two lakes in and around mumbai india it can be observed that the performance of both the methods were comparable for concentration of virus from lake water monsoon was chosen as the season for checking the efficiency of the dsig column since water samples collected in this season were expected to have the lowest viral load some samples were also collected in winter november 2019 january 2020 as rva concentration was found to be highest in winter in the indian lakes thus if the dsig column is capable of capturing the virus at both high and low concentration it would be effective for virus concentration in all the seasons it was observed that even when the viruses were not detectable based on concentration using ultracentrifugation as the primary concentration method the use of dsig column as primary concentration method followed by ultracentrifugation was capable of concentrating the viruses this observation may be linked with the long time required for concentration of viruses from large volume of water samples in the ultracentrifugation method thus dsig packed cartridges or columns could be further explored at even higher flowrates 300 500 ml min for concentrating viruses from large volume of water samples similar to the existing viradel cartridges filters atabakhsh et al 2019 ikner et al 2011 miao et al 2019 moreover the dsig columns can also be reused multiple times without loss of concentration efficiency and can easily be stored at room temperature for extended durations unlike deae cellulose after the 4th cycle of regeneration and reuse ms2 adsorption on the dsig columns was the same as that for unused dsig 100 and recovery was in the range of 80 90 batch adsorption desorption studies with deae cellulose also showed similar regeneration capacity the existing adsorbents employed for virus concentration by the viradel method have shown variable recovery also as most research studies have not reported desorption and recovery separately it was not possible to identify the limiting factor i e whether the recovery is affected by the choice of adsorbent or by the choice of the eluent borrego et al 1991 ikner et al 2011 shi et al 2017 recently miao et al 2019 developed a method for the concentration of enteric viruses from freshwater samples and coastal water samples the researchers prepared cartridges filled with 800 g of electropositive granular media for virus concentration the time required for virus concentration was significantly lowered as the flow rate was optimized to 300 ml min the recovery reported by miao et al 2019 was better than the existing methods however they conducted the preconcentration studies with relatively high copy number of viruses 105 1010 copies 4 conclusions a number of virus concentration techniques have been developed over the years and adsorption elution is one of the preferred methods however the major challenges associated with these methods are poor reproducibility and low recovery during elution in the current study a column packed with dsig was evaluated for both removal and concentration of viruses from water samples the ability of dsig packed bed column to concentrate viruses was evaluated over a range of virus concentration 107 10 pfu l the study revealed good recovery of indicator coliphage ms2 and enteric virus rotavirus a rva even at very low virus concentrations of 10 copy l with the optimized eluent na 1 5 m tw 2 g3x however coliphage susp2 recovery was not found to be as high as that for the other two viruses rva and ms2 while dsig yielded good coliphage sorption silanized silica gel alone was not as good a sorbent for the sorption of coliphages concentration of viruses from lake water collected in monsoon and winter months showed recovery comparable to that achieved using an ultracentrifuge recovery of the viruses from lake water during monsoon months when the virus concentration is the lowest also revealed the applicability of this method for virus concentration from drinking water sources as well moreover the method required low processing time and could handle large volumes of water unlike concentration through ultracentrifugation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

16692,electrocoagulation ec is a promising electrochemical water treatment technology however a major challenge to sustaining effective long term ec operation is controlling the precipitation of materials on the electrodes commonly referred to as fouling periodically reversing electrode polarity has been suggested as an in situ fouling mitigation strategy and is often implemented in ec field applications however the utility of this approach has not been investigated in detail in this study the effect of polarity reversal pr on the performance of ec using iron electrodes was examined under different water chemistry conditions and at a range of reversal frequencies it was observed that the faradaic efficiency in pr ec was always lower than that in the ec systems operated with a direct current i e dc ec it was also observed that the faradaic efficiency progressively decreased as the current reversal frequency increased with the faradaic efficiency dropping as low as 10 when the pr interval was 0 5 min results from fouling layer chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltammetric investigations indicated that the decrease in the faradaic efficiency was caused by i increased electrode fouling by iron precipitates and ii electrochemical side reactions at the electrode electrolyte interface the extent of these effects was dependent on the solution chemistry oxyanions and sulfide were found to be particularly detrimental to the performance of pr ec causing severe electrode fouling while decreasing the faradaic efficiency fouling could be mitigated by increasing the solution convection rate resulting in a shear on the electrode surface that removed iron and other electrochemically reactive species from the electrodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation electrode fouling faradaic efficiency polarity reversal 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical water treatment technology that has become increasingly popular owing to its ability to efficiently remove various types of contaminants m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 ec involves the application of electric current to corrode metal electrodes to produce coagulant yasri et al 2020 steel electrodes are commonly used in ec fe ec due to their low cost bandaru et al 2020 the corrosion of a steel anode generates fe2 via the following reaction van genuchten et al 2017 1 f e s f e 2 aq 2 e e o 0 44 v vs she subsequently some fe2 may be oxidized to fe3 by dissolved oxygen while the direct electrochemical production of fe3 is possible previous studies have reported that almost all fe ions produced in ec are fe2 dubrawski et al 2015 lakshmanan et al 2009 moreno c et al 2009 both ionic forms of iron further react with water to form oxyhydr oxides which function as coagulants for contaminant removal dubrawski et al 2015 compared to chemical coagulation cc i e the addition of iron or aluminum salts ec offers several advantages including reduced chemical usage due to the elimination of counter ions garcia segura et al 2017 ingelsson et al 2020 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 improved coagulant mixing due to corrosion over the entire electrode surface as opposed to point addition in cc controllable coagulant production via the electrical current which permits a high degree of automation and reduced coagulant dosing and sludge production owing to increased coagulation efficiency garcia segura et al 2017 ingelsson et al 2020 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 additionally ec does not require supplemental neutralizing chemicals due to the production of oh ions at the cathode 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h aq h 2 g e o 0 83 v vs she it is also worth mentioning that because of reaction 2 an alkaline boundary layer is developed at the cathode electrolyte interface fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 simultaneously the hydrolysis of fe2 and fe3 ions generates h creating an acidic boundary layer at the anode yasri and gunasekaran 2017 3 f e 2 0 5 o 2 2 h 2 o e fe oh 3 s h therefore the ph profile within an ec reactor is distinct from that of cc a significant operational challenge for the long term operation of ec is the build up of electrode surface layers referred to as fouling bandaru et al 2020 chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 which leads to diminished treatment performance specifically it has been shown that the accumulation of a non porous insulating surface layer increases the resistance of the electron transfer processes at the electrode electrolyte interfaces thereby inducing a passivating effect increasing the cell voltage and consequently increasing operating costs amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 furthermore at sufficiently high overpotentials it is possible to trigger side reactions such as the electrochemical oxidation of water and cl 4 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e o 1 23 v vs she 5 2 c l c l 2 2 e e o 1 36 v vs she these side reactions will divert the current away from reaction 1 reducing the coagulant production efficiency dubrawski et al 2015 while it has been shown that electrode surface layers can also be porous and conductive and therefore will have a negligible effect on the cell voltage bandaru et al 2020 schmuki 2002 a thick fouling layer may inhibit the transfer of coagulant from the anode to the bulk solution hence reducing ec performance van genuchten et al 2016 additionally the accumulation of materials on the surface of the electrodes may increase the pressure drop through the ec cell or plug the cell after prolonged operation to overcome the operational issues described above electrode fouling layers must be removed or avoided altogether methods such as mechanical cleaning brushing scraping or washing the electrodes with acid have been proposed amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 it is also possible to avoid calcium and magnesium containing scales by installing pretreatment units such as ion exchange to remove ca2 and mg2 upstream of the ec reactor while effective these approaches require either reactor shutdown or additional infrastructure which significantly increases the system s cost and complexity another method that has been proposed for the mitigation of electrode fouling is polarity reversal pr eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 yang et al 2015 this technique involves intermittently reversing the current direction such that the anode becomes the cathode and vice versa each time the current direction is switched the evolution of h2 g reaction 2 at the cathode can dislodge fouling layers that accumulated on the electrode in the previous current cycle bian et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 on the anode which served as the cathode prior to current switching fouling layers can be dislodged due to the corrosion of the underlying electrode bian et al 2019 additionally the inversion of the boundary layer ph at each electrode may dissolve fouling layers for example ca and mg containing minerals precipitated in the cathode s alkaline ph environment may dissolve when the boundary layer becomes acidic following pr although pr can potentially prevent electrode fouling its effect on the overall performance of ec remains poorly understood and conflicting results have been reported in the literature fekete et al 2016 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 for example a recent study reported the build up of thick electrode fouling layers in an fe ec system in which the electrode polarity was periodically reversed müller et al 2019 this result raises questions about the ability of pr to mitigate electrode fouling as another example while high coagulant production efficiencies were reported in some pr ec studies ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 yang et al 2015 several other studies including ours have demonstrated that coagulant production efficiency in pr ec decreased with increasing pr frequency and can be significantly lower than the efficiency in ec systems operated with a direct current i e dc ec fekete et al 2016 müller et al 2019 yang et al 2015 chow and pham 2021 while efficient anodic dissolution does not guarantee successful contaminant removal it is a pre requisite for effective ec operation therefore the optimum pr frequency should ensure high coagulant production while avoiding electrode fouling however a wide range of optimum pr intervals 0 5 15 min have been reported presumably due to differences in the electrode material and water composition employed in past studies grøterud and smoczyński 1986 heidmann and calmano 2008 maher et al 2019 shao qin et al 2014 timmes et al 2010 the purpose of this study was to investigate if pr is an effective method to mitigate fouling and sustain effective anodic metal dissolution in ec building upon our previous study chow and pham 2021 which investigated the effects of current density and polarity reversal time on the coagulant production in pr ec this current study focused specifically on the effects of water chemistry and flow dynamics in pr ec that employs fe electrodes we hypothesize that water chemistry plays a significant role in fe pr ec since the corrosion and fouling of fe electrodes are strongly influenced by various ions such as cl which can induce pitting corrosion and prevent passivation lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 so4 2 and po4 3 which have been shown to inhibit fe corrosion and increase overpotentials lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 ca2 mg2 and dissolved silica which can accelerate electrode fouling bandaru et al 2020 to test this hypothesis a series of batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted to quantify the faradaic efficiency and the amount of fouling on the electrodes in addition chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry were employed to identify the electrochemical processes occurring during pr ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification the electrodes were fe rods 4 8 mm diameter 98 purity obtained from metal supermarkets or steel plates 1 cm 1 cm 99 purity astm a109 steel obtained from mcmaster carr although these materials were of different grade small impurities have been shown to have a negligible effect on faradaic efficiency in fe ec müller et al 2019 four types of synthetic water samples were used to study the effect of solution chemistry on faradaic efficiency and fouling nacl in deionized water na2so4 in deionized water synthetic groundwater sgw synthetic produced water spw emulating the chemical profile of produced water associated with in situ bitumen extraction these solutions were chosen for their increasing complexity and varying effects on ec performance for example the sgw and spw solutions contained buffers e g hco3 which have previously been reported to affect ec performance by creating a passive layer at the electrode surfaces which prevents the release of fe ii iii van genuchten et al 2017 in the nacl solution the faradaic efficiency can be expected to be high because cl can help dissolve the electrode surface layers and facilitate pitting arroyo et al 2009 in contrast so4 2 has been shown to promote fe passivation van genuchten et al 2017 in the sgw solution ca2 and mg2 are expected to contribute to the fouling of the cathode in dc ec doggaz et al 2019 and on both electrodes in pr ec chow and pham 2021 lastly the spw contains hs which can be electrochemically oxidized into elemental sulfur s0 and or can react with fe2 to generate sparingly soluble iron sulfide minerals fes chow and pham 2019 the ionic compositions of the tested solutions are presented in table 1 the chemicals used to prepare the solutions were na2sio3 or na2sio3 9h2o nahs h2o mgcl2 or mgcl2 6h2o cacl2 na2so4 nahco3 nano3 na3po4 h2o or na3po4 12h2o and nacl the ph of the solutions was adjusted to their initial ph using 1 m hcl all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm water 2 2 coagulant production experiments the effects of polarity reversal time prt and water chemistry on faradaic efficiency and electrode fouling were examined using a single pass continuous flow reactor v 200 ml that was operated for 6 h fig 1 a the reaction solution was supplied to the reactor by a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 resulting in a retention time of 20 min within the reactor the solution was continuously mixed by a magnetic stir bar the reactor was covered with a lid with openings that held the fe rods and for solution sampling the fe rods were spaced 2 cm apart and were submerged to a depth of 6 cm resulting in an active surface area of 7 6 cm2 0 1 cm in addition a reference electrode 3 m nacl ag agcl 0 209 v versus she was placed 0 25 cm from one of the other two electrodes before each experiment the electrodes were sonicated in 1 m hcl for approximately 1 min polished with 1500 grit sandpaper and rinsed with deionized water the reactor was controlled by a potentiostat vsp bio logic science instruments which applied a constant current of i 0 1 a i 13 ma cm 2 experiments were conducted either in the dc mode or in the pr mode with prts of 0 5 1 or 2 min at t 3 and 6 h 5 ml liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor and were digested in a solution consisting of 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl subsequently the digested solution was subjected to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis to examine the electrode surface morphology and elemental composition the electrodes were removed from the reactor at the end of the experiments air dried and analyzed using an fei quanta feg 250 environmental scanning microscope esem that was coupled with an inca energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer the icp oes analysis described above provides the total amount of fe released into the bulk solution to measure the amount of fe accumulated in the fouling layer on the electrodes a separate set of experiments were conducted in which the reactor was operated in the batch mode for 1 h subsequently the rods were removed their surface layers were digested by submerging the rods into acid and the amount of fe in the digestate was quantified by icp oes it is acknowledged that this approach only provided a semi quantitative estimate of the amount of fe in the fouling layer since the underlying rod could also have been dissolved to account for the fe that was released from the underlying rod a control experiment was performed wherein a new rod i e foul free rod was submerged in the acid for the same duration and the amount fe dissolved in this experiment was subtracted from that released in the digestion of the rod and the associated fouling layer 2 3 chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry a series of chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltammetric experiments were conducted to gain further insights into the electrochemical processes occurring in dc ec and pr ec these experiments employed a 1 cm 1 cm steel plate i e the working electrode housed in a 3d printed polycarbonate reactor v 100 ml such that only one side of the electrode was exposed to the solution fig 1b before each experiment the working electrode was polished with 800 and 1500 grit sandpaper t214 black ice norton until the surface was smooth and reflective the reactor also housed a platinum counter electrode and a double junction ag agcl sat kcl reference electrode pine research the reference electrode was placed in a separate compartment that was connected to the reactor by a capillary inner diameter 1 mm the capillary tip was positioned 1 mm from the steel electrode a potentiostat autolab metrohm was used to control the potential or current of the working electrode the reactor was also designed to allow control of the convection rate by recirculating the solution using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex the flow inlet was strategically placed adjacent to the working electrode allowing recycled water to enter the reactor parallel to the electrode surface consequently this setup permitted the hydrodynamic shear on the electrode to be increased by increasing the flow rate this feature was incorporated to study the effect of forced convection on faradaic efficiency and electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode electrolyte interface in the absence of flow recirculation convection still occurred due to fluid density differences which is referred to as natural convection conditions in this study chronopotentiometry was conducted employing i 13 ma cm 2 with the current direction switching every prt 0 5 and 2 min the duration of all experiments was 40 min corresponding to 40 and 10 complete cycles of pr for each prt respectively the short experimental time was deemed sufficient to observe the electrochemical phenomena occurring during pr ec operation and the trends observed were assumed to continue under longer experimental durations in addition dc ec experiments were conducted for 20 min corresponding to anodic operation duration in the pr ec experiments in each experiment the solution nacl na2so4 sgw or spw was circulated through the reactor at a flow rate of 0 ml min 1 175 ml min 1 and 770 ml min 1 and the potential of the working electrode was monitored over time in addition the amounts of fe released into the bulk solution and fe accumulated in the fouling layer of the working electrode were measured by digesting the entire working solution and the fouling layers in 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl following digestion the samples were quantified on icp oes cyclic voltammetry was conducted using a voltage window of 3 25 v to 1 75 v vs she at 20 mv s 1 for 10 scans this procedure was similar to pr but with gradually changing the potential and measuring the current response as opposed to reversing the polarity instantaneously while operating galvanostatically consequently this method facilitated the observation of the corrosion pitting potentials the passivation characteristics and the occurrence of side reactions performing 10 consecutive scans permitted the observation of how the occurrence of electrochemical reactions changed with increasing scan number analogous to increasing the operating time in pr ec 2 4 faradaic efficiency the applied current governs the electrochemical reaction rates at the electrodes therefore the amount of anodic metal dissolution can be predicted by faraday s law eq 1 6 theoretical mass of coagulant metal dissolved i t m z f where i a is current t s is electrolysis time m is the atomic mass of the metal m 55 485 g mol 1 for fe z is electron transfer number z 2 for fe and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol 1 in this study the faradaic efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted electrochemical produced by faraday s law from eq 6 mass of fe dissolved 7 faradaic efficiency observed coagulant theoretical coagulant z f m i t m 100 where m g is the experimentally measured mass of fe released into the bulk solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of pr on coagulant production in the continuous flow system fig 1a the faradaic efficiencies in pr ec were always lower than those in dc ec fig 2 notably the faradaic efficiency progressively decreased as prt decreased from 2 min to 0 5 min the extent to which prt influenced faradaic efficiency was dependent on the solution chemistry for example the lowest faradaic efficiency observed with the nacl solution was 80 while the lowest faradaic efficiency in other solutions ranged between 5 and 50 in the pr ec experiments with spw the faradaic efficiency was 20 at all prts possible explanations for the diminished faradaic efficiency in pr ec include i fe ions precipitated on the electrode surfaces instead of migrating into the bulk solution it was visually observed that more materials accumulated on the electrodes in pr ec than in dc ec especially in experiments with a prt of 0 5 min ii there are electrochemical side reactions that diverted the current away from reaction 1 to determine the contribution of the first mechanism to the reduction in the faradaic efficiency additional experiments were conducted to quantify the amount of fe accumulated in the electrode fouling layers these experiments also employed the reactor presented in fig 1a except that the reactor was operated in a batch mode to enable the closing of fe mass balance which will be discussed further in section 3 2 as shown in fig 3 the amount of fe in the fouling layer increased as prt decreased consistent with the decreasing faradaic efficiency trend described above the amounts of fe in the fouling layer in the spw experiments were 2 5 times greater than those in the other experiments this is attributable to the reaction between fe ii and hs which is known to be much faster than the hydrolysis and oxidation of fe ii gao et al 2018 8 f e 2 h s fes h this reaction produced sparingly soluble fes minerals whose presence on the electrode surface is corroborated by a clear signal of s in the eds spectrum figure s1 in the supporting information and by the observation that the electrodes turned black i e the typical color of fes minerals the build up of fe in the fouling layer in the spw and sgw experiments could also have been caused by ca and mg containing minerals which covered the surface of the electrodes figure s1 and trapped more fe in the fouling layer müller et al 2019 ca and mg containing minerals such as caco3 mg oh 2 and camg co3 2 can precipitate under alkaline conditions developed in the boundary layer of the cathode lei et al 2019 wang et al 2013 because both electrodes in pr ec intermittently served as the cathode as the polarity alternated ca and mg containing minerals were seen to be present on both electrodes figure s1 on the contrary the higher faradaic efficiency and lower fe amount in the electrode fouling layers observed in the experiments with the nacl solution is attributable to the ability of cl to inhibit electrode passivation via pitting corrosion arroyo et al 2009 although sgw and spw also contained cl the depassivation effect of cl must have been outcompeted by ions that can inhibit corrosion i e so4 2 no3 silicate and phosphate sgw and spw also contained ca2 and mg2 which can further foul the electrode surfaces via the mechanism discussed above 3 2 electrochemical phenomena at the electrode electrolyte interface the faradaic efficiencies in pr ec experiments were still lower than 100 even after accounting for the fe in the fouling layer figure s2 suggesting that there must have been side reactions i e hypothesis ii presented above possible side reactions include the oxidation of water and cl i e reactions 4 and 5 the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii reverse reactions 9 and 10 and the oxidation of h2 g to h2o reverse reaction 2 h2 g is produced from reaction 2 in the prior current cycle when the electrode served as the cathode since the measured anodic potential was always 0 1 v vs she data not presented the oxidation of water and cl can be ruled out in contrast the oxidation of fe ii and h2 g are thermodynamically possible because e0 h w h2o h2 0 41 v e0 h green rust fe oh 2 0 5 to 0 6 v when ph 7 10 e0

ec a series of chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltametric experiments were conducted as mentioned in section 2 3 these experiments were performed using the small reactor fig 1b to enable the investigation of the effect of hydrodynamic shear on the faradaic efficiency and the processes occurring at the electrode electrolyte interface the results from the pr ec chronopotentiometric experiments with natural convection i e a flow rate of 0 ml min 1 through the reactor revealed that following each pr event the fe working electrode underwent a period of repolarization before its potential reached a steady state value fig 4 s3 s4 and s5 the repolarization duration was dependent on the prt and the solution chemistry for example in the nacl experiments the average anodic repolarization times with prts of 0 5 min and 2 min were around 6 s and 10 s respectively whereas the cathodic repolarization times were 7 s and 20 s the areas highlighted in yellow in fig 4a and 4c similarly the repolarization duration in the na2so4 and sgw electrolytes also decreased as prt increased figures s3a s3c s4a and s4c in contrast the potential of the fe working electrode in the spw experiments never reached steady state figures s5a and s5b this indicates that the repolarization processes in this case were slow with a longer timescale than the prts in each case further study is needed to investigate this behavior however the dynamics may be associated with the competing effects of the passivating sulfate ions and the depassivating chloride ions present in this system the repolarization times of the fe working electrode were shortened upon the introduction of forced convection by means of recirculating the solution through the reactor a flow rate of 175 ml min 1 fig 4b 4d s3b s3d s4b s4d s5b and s5d for example the anodic and cathodic repolarization times were reduced to 1 s and 2 5 s respectively upon the introduction of flow notably the anodic overpotentials in the nacl na2so4 and sgw experiments decreased by 0 5 1 v in the absence of flow the anodic potentials in the na2so4 electrolyte were above 2 v vs she figures s3a and s3c these potential values were sufficiently high to trigger the oxidation of h2o van genuchten et al 2017 resulting in the formation of gas bubbles on the working electrode under forced convection the anodic potential in the na2so4 electrolyte dropped to below 1 v vs she and the production of gas bubbles was no longer observable there are several possible reasons for the presence of an electrode repolarization period following each current switching event first electrode repolarization can be the result of the recharging of the electrode double layer however this is unlikely the main reason since the time required to charge the electrochemical double layer in ec is typically 1 20 ms ingelsson et al 2020 whereas the repolarization times observed herein were greater than 2 s furthermore there was no evidence of significant electrochemical double layer capacitance in the polarization cyclic voltammetry curve figure s6 second electrode repolarization could be due to the inversion of the boundary layer ph leading to a shift in the equilibrium potential of electrochemical reactions for example a higher potential at the beginning of each cathodic polarization could be due to the reduction of water i e reaction 2 being thermodynamically more favorable in an acidic boundary layer this acidic boundary layer was established in the preceding current cycle when the electrode functioned as an anode note that the anodic repolarization is unlikely due to the electrochemical dissolution of fe0 since reaction 1 does not involve h and therefore is not influenced by the ph change in the boundary layer as such anodic repolarization could have been caused by reactions involving electrochemically reactive species in the electrode boundary layer it is hypothesized that only after these species were consumed did reaction 1 start this hypothesis is in agreement with the observation that proportionally longer anodic repolarization times were associated with lower faradaic efficiencies for example the anodic polarization time in the nacl solution constituted approximately 8 and 20 of the total polarity cycle for the 2 min and 0 5 min prts respectively fig 4a and 4c under these prts the faradaic efficiencies were 80 and 55 fig 5 note that the fe in the fouling layers were included in the calculations of these faradaic efficiencies so any efficiencies 100 could not have been caused by fouling in these experiments the inactivation of faradaic fe0 fe2 dissolution during electrode repolarization has been hypothesized previously grøterud and smoczyński 1986 but has not been investigated in detail the hypothesis that side reactions redirecting the faradaic current during the electrode repolarization is further corroborated by the increasing faradaic efficiency under forced convection fig 5 specifically under a flow rate of 175 ml min 1 the faradaic efficiencies in the nacl experiments were 98 prt 2 min and 95 prt 0 5 min compared to the efficiencies of 80 and 50 when the flow rate was 0 ml min 1 in the na2so4 experiments the faradaic efficiencies increased from 10 20 0 ml min 1 to ca 90 175 ml min 1 whereas in the sgw experiments the faradaic efficiencies increased from 60 80 0 ml min 1 to 80 90 175 ml min 1 in the spw experiment with a prt of 2 min the faradaic efficiency increased from 40 0 ml min 1 to 65 175 ml min 1 these faradaic efficiency increases are attributable to the hydrodynamic shear from the forced convection which would remove electrochemically reactive species from the electrode s boundary layer and thus shorten the time required for electrode repolarization unlike in all other experiments the observed faradaic efficiency in the spw experiment that was operated with a prt of 0 5 min decreased from 50 to 35 when the flow rate increased from 0 ml min 1 to 175 ml min 1 fig 5 this negative effect of hydrodynamic shear is thought to be due to the continual replenishment of hs since hs ions can be electrochemically oxidized into s0 during ec chow and pham 2019 the presence of hs in the electrode boundary layer will divert the faradaic current away from reaction 1 interestingly when the flow rate was further increased to 770 ml min 1 the faradaic efficiency increased to 80 it is proposed that in the presence of hs flow leads to two competing effects decreased side reactions due to removal of reactive species formed at the electrode and increased side reactions due to increased transport of hs to the electrode surface at higher convection rates the former effect was more dominant while lower convection rates appear to enhance the latter effect the higher mass transport rates expected with shorter prts since the concentration boundary layer takes time to develop after polarity reversal may explain why the effect of hs decreased with increasing prt in addition the non steady state behavior of the electrode potential in spw figures s5a and s5b is indicative of a higher incidence of competitive reactions taking place in this solution to gain further insights into the nature of the reactive species that caused the repolarization of the fe working electrode 10 consecutive potential scan cycles were performed in each type of solution the results from these experiments are presented in fig 6 and s7 with the forward and backward scans being plotted separately to aid visual interpretation scan sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 the regions of high current at both ends of the potential window correspond to accelerated fe corrosion i e pitting corrosion reaction 1 at high positive potentials and h2 g evolution reaction 2 at low negative potentials the potential where the anodic current increases exponentially with potential is referred to as the pitting potential mansouri et al 2011 at this point the passivating surface layer is dissolved which permits uninhibited fe corrosion the region in between the corrosion and pitting potentials is referred to as the passivation region which is characterized by a slow current response as the applied potential increased ingelsson et al 2020 increasingly pronounced current peaks at around 0 70 v vs she were observed in the nacl solution fig 6a these peaks represent electrochemically active species reacting and being depleted at the electrode electrolyte interface following the shift from cathodic to anodic potentials i e after pr the peaks appear at the potential value prior to the pitting potential indicating that the reactions involving these electrochemical active species are thermodynamically favored over the anodic metal dissolution therefore it is proposed that these peaks correspond to side reactions that redirect the faradaic current away from the desired dissolution of fe0 e g reaction 9 e0 h fe2o3 fe oh 2 0 5 to 1 0 v beverskog and puigdomenech 1996b it is probable that these reactions caused the long polarization times in the chronopotentiometry experiments in addition the growth in peak size also indicates increasing concentrations of these active species with increasing scan numbers as it is known that a fouling layer is likely forming during pr fig 3 more reactive species may be trapped in the electrode surface layer as the number of cycles increases notably when forced convection was applied these peaks disappeared fig 6b and the anodic dissolution of fe was initiated at a lower potential this is consistent with reactive species being removed from the electrode surface under the forced convection conditions reducing the amount of side reactions occurring during anodic polarization current peaks i e side reactions were also observed in the experiments with na2so4 between 1 3 and 0 3 v vs she fig 6c and sgw between 1 3 and 0 25 v vs she fig 6e as in the nacl experiment these peaks also disappeared upon the introduction of forced convection fig 6d and 6f on the contrary the results from the spw experiments demonstrated high currents and hence high electrochemical reactivity at all potentials on both sides of the equilibrium potential this observation is attributable to the corrosive nature of hs which can remove the passive layer and lead to an increase in current on the tafel plot ma et al 2000 the high currents would mask current peaks making it impossible to clearly discern side reactions taking place in this system current peaks were also present in the reverse scans figure s7 suggesting that electrochemical side reactions i e other than reaction 2 were also occurring following the shift from anodic to cathodic currents the current peaks were observed between 1 and 1 4 v 1 2 and 1 8 v and 0 6 and 2 v in the nacl na2so4 and sgw solutions respectively figures s7a s7c and s7e as in the forward scans these current peaks were suppressed upon the introduction of flow figures s7b s7d s7f based on the results presented above it is hypothesized that the reactive species responsible for the electrode repolarization in the chronopotentiometric experiments are dissolved fe ii dissolved fe iii and fe oxyhydr oxides the involvement of these species in the side reactions can be illustrated using the pourbaix diagram for fe in water figure s8 which shows that fe can undergo solid phase oxidation in an alkaline environment at the anode following polarity reversal to form fe oh 2 s subsequently the oxidation of fe oh 2 s into fe3o4 s reverse reaction 9 and possibly fe3o4 s into fe2o3 s reverse rection 10 can occur instead of fe0 fe2 dissolution resulting in the redirection of the faradaic current during the cathodic polarization fe3 fe2 reduction may occur and possibly fe2 fe0 electrodeposition at moderate cathodic overpotentials which could explain the current peaks at potentials 0 5 v vs she in the reverse cyclic voltammetric scans figure s7 by further inspection of the pourbaix diagram it is possible that once the ph increases at the cathode following polarity reversal solid transformations of material precipitated on the electrode including the reduction of fe2o3 s into fe3o4 s as well as fe3o4 s into fe oh 2 s can occur as a result of the constant cycling between dissolved and solid fe ii and fe iii species together with the electrodeposition fe2 fe0 the anodic corrosion of fe0 is suppressed in pr ec leading to diminished faradaic efficiency in addition to the side reactions involving fe species the oxidation of adsorbed h2 produced from reaction 2 in the preceding current cycle when the electrode served as a cathode could also be a side reaction that causes a diminished faradaic efficiency yang et al 2017 lastly the oxidation of h2o in the experiments with na2so4 discussed above resulted in the very low faradaic efficiencies 20 under natural convection fig 5 4 conclusion it is commonly believed that pr can enhance ec performance because it can remove electrode fouling layers and reduce energy consumption in addition to providing other benefits such as uniform corrosion of all electrodes and enhanced mass transport of coagulant to the bulk solution however the evidence presented in this study indicates that pr can negatively impact the performance of ec depending on the solution chemistry flow rate and reversal time for example we found that operating ec with short prts i e 0 5 min in this study worsened the overall performance by accelerating the formation of electrode surface layers and decreasing faradaic efficiency measured in the bulk solution the lower faradaic efficiency was attributed to 1 the precipitation of iron species onto the surface of the electrodes and 2 the electrochemical side reactions which syphoned energy away from fe2 production in fact a faradaic efficiency as low as 10 was observed in spw owing to the high rate of fouling and the presence of side reactions involving iron and sulfide containing species this result suggests that long prts should be used and the electrode surfaces should be kept clean by other means a strategy to mitigate the negative effects of pr could be increasing the forced convection rate however increasing the flow rate may have a detrimental effect on the coagulation flocculation process and consequently the contaminant removal performance to overcome this a high shear ec reactor could be used upstream from the flocculation separation stage as has previously been proposed ingelsson et al 2020 timmes et al 2010 depending on the contaminated water characteristics there is likely an optimal range of flow rate and prts at which pr ec is effective future studies are needed to further explore the relationship between flow rate and the performance of pr ec especially in larger scale systems additionally as faradaic efficiency and electrode fouling in pr ec appear to be strongly dependent on the chemistry of the solution we suggest that future studies should examine the effect of other solutes beyond those investigated in our study such as natural organic matter chromate and arsenate which are the contaminants frequently treated by ec the characteristics of the precipitates formed with pr operation and their ability to remove contaminants of interest should also be investigated lastly pr ec should be investigated for other electrode materials that do not exhibit the same sensitivity to reversible electrochemical reactions as fe for example aluminum al electrodes have previously been recommended as a more suitable material than iron for pr ec operation ingelsson et al 2020 the effects of water chemistry and prt on the performance of al ec are currently being investigated in our laboratories funding the authors are grateful

16692,electrocoagulation ec is a promising electrochemical water treatment technology however a major challenge to sustaining effective long term ec operation is controlling the precipitation of materials on the electrodes commonly referred to as fouling periodically reversing electrode polarity has been suggested as an in situ fouling mitigation strategy and is often implemented in ec field applications however the utility of this approach has not been investigated in detail in this study the effect of polarity reversal pr on the performance of ec using iron electrodes was examined under different water chemistry conditions and at a range of reversal frequencies it was observed that the faradaic efficiency in pr ec was always lower than that in the ec systems operated with a direct current i e dc ec it was also observed that the faradaic efficiency progressively decreased as the current reversal frequency increased with the faradaic efficiency dropping as low as 10 when the pr interval was 0 5 min results from fouling layer chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltammetric investigations indicated that the decrease in the faradaic efficiency was caused by i increased electrode fouling by iron precipitates and ii electrochemical side reactions at the electrode electrolyte interface the extent of these effects was dependent on the solution chemistry oxyanions and sulfide were found to be particularly detrimental to the performance of pr ec causing severe electrode fouling while decreasing the faradaic efficiency fouling could be mitigated by increasing the solution convection rate resulting in a shear on the electrode surface that removed iron and other electrochemically reactive species from the electrodes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrocoagulation electrode fouling faradaic efficiency polarity reversal 1 introduction electrocoagulation ec is an electrochemical water treatment technology that has become increasingly popular owing to its ability to efficiently remove various types of contaminants m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 ec involves the application of electric current to corrode metal electrodes to produce coagulant yasri et al 2020 steel electrodes are commonly used in ec fe ec due to their low cost bandaru et al 2020 the corrosion of a steel anode generates fe2 via the following reaction van genuchten et al 2017 1 f e s f e 2 aq 2 e e o 0 44 v vs she subsequently some fe2 may be oxidized to fe3 by dissolved oxygen while the direct electrochemical production of fe3 is possible previous studies have reported that almost all fe ions produced in ec are fe2 dubrawski et al 2015 lakshmanan et al 2009 moreno c et al 2009 both ionic forms of iron further react with water to form oxyhydr oxides which function as coagulants for contaminant removal dubrawski et al 2015 compared to chemical coagulation cc i e the addition of iron or aluminum salts ec offers several advantages including reduced chemical usage due to the elimination of counter ions garcia segura et al 2017 ingelsson et al 2020 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 improved coagulant mixing due to corrosion over the entire electrode surface as opposed to point addition in cc controllable coagulant production via the electrical current which permits a high degree of automation and reduced coagulant dosing and sludge production owing to increased coagulation efficiency garcia segura et al 2017 ingelsson et al 2020 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 m yousuf a mollah et al 2001 additionally ec does not require supplemental neutralizing chemicals due to the production of oh ions at the cathode 2 2 h 2 o 2 e 2 o h aq h 2 g e o 0 83 v vs she it is also worth mentioning that because of reaction 2 an alkaline boundary layer is developed at the cathode electrolyte interface fuladpanjeh hojaghan et al 2019 simultaneously the hydrolysis of fe2 and fe3 ions generates h creating an acidic boundary layer at the anode yasri and gunasekaran 2017 3 f e 2 0 5 o 2 2 h 2 o e fe oh 3 s h therefore the ph profile within an ec reactor is distinct from that of cc a significant operational challenge for the long term operation of ec is the build up of electrode surface layers referred to as fouling bandaru et al 2020 chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 van genuchten et al 2016 which leads to diminished treatment performance specifically it has been shown that the accumulation of a non porous insulating surface layer increases the resistance of the electron transfer processes at the electrode electrolyte interfaces thereby inducing a passivating effect increasing the cell voltage and consequently increasing operating costs amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 chow and pham 2021 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 furthermore at sufficiently high overpotentials it is possible to trigger side reactions such as the electrochemical oxidation of water and cl 4 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e e o 1 23 v vs she 5 2 c l c l 2 2 e e o 1 36 v vs she these side reactions will divert the current away from reaction 1 reducing the coagulant production efficiency dubrawski et al 2015 while it has been shown that electrode surface layers can also be porous and conductive and therefore will have a negligible effect on the cell voltage bandaru et al 2020 schmuki 2002 a thick fouling layer may inhibit the transfer of coagulant from the anode to the bulk solution hence reducing ec performance van genuchten et al 2016 additionally the accumulation of materials on the surface of the electrodes may increase the pressure drop through the ec cell or plug the cell after prolonged operation to overcome the operational issues described above electrode fouling layers must be removed or avoided altogether methods such as mechanical cleaning brushing scraping or washing the electrodes with acid have been proposed amrose et al 2014 bandaru et al 2020 lakshmanan et al 2009 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 it is also possible to avoid calcium and magnesium containing scales by installing pretreatment units such as ion exchange to remove ca2 and mg2 upstream of the ec reactor while effective these approaches require either reactor shutdown or additional infrastructure which significantly increases the system s cost and complexity another method that has been proposed for the mitigation of electrode fouling is polarity reversal pr eyvaz et al 2009 keshmirizadeh et al 2011 mao et al 2008 yang et al 2015 this technique involves intermittently reversing the current direction such that the anode becomes the cathode and vice versa each time the current direction is switched the evolution of h2 g reaction 2 at the cathode can dislodge fouling layers that accumulated on the electrode in the previous current cycle bian et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 on the anode which served as the cathode prior to current switching fouling layers can be dislodged due to the corrosion of the underlying electrode bian et al 2019 additionally the inversion of the boundary layer ph at each electrode may dissolve fouling layers for example ca and mg containing minerals precipitated in the cathode s alkaline ph environment may dissolve when the boundary layer becomes acidic following pr although pr can potentially prevent electrode fouling its effect on the overall performance of ec remains poorly understood and conflicting results have been reported in the literature fekete et al 2016 ingelsson et al 2020 müller et al 2019 timmes et al 2010 yang et al 2015 for example a recent study reported the build up of thick electrode fouling layers in an fe ec system in which the electrode polarity was periodically reversed müller et al 2019 this result raises questions about the ability of pr to mitigate electrode fouling as another example while high coagulant production efficiencies were reported in some pr ec studies ozyonar and karagozoglu 2015 yang et al 2015 several other studies including ours have demonstrated that coagulant production efficiency in pr ec decreased with increasing pr frequency and can be significantly lower than the efficiency in ec systems operated with a direct current i e dc ec fekete et al 2016 müller et al 2019 yang et al 2015 chow and pham 2021 while efficient anodic dissolution does not guarantee successful contaminant removal it is a pre requisite for effective ec operation therefore the optimum pr frequency should ensure high coagulant production while avoiding electrode fouling however a wide range of optimum pr intervals 0 5 15 min have been reported presumably due to differences in the electrode material and water composition employed in past studies grøterud and smoczyński 1986 heidmann and calmano 2008 maher et al 2019 shao qin et al 2014 timmes et al 2010 the purpose of this study was to investigate if pr is an effective method to mitigate fouling and sustain effective anodic metal dissolution in ec building upon our previous study chow and pham 2021 which investigated the effects of current density and polarity reversal time on the coagulant production in pr ec this current study focused specifically on the effects of water chemistry and flow dynamics in pr ec that employs fe electrodes we hypothesize that water chemistry plays a significant role in fe pr ec since the corrosion and fouling of fe electrodes are strongly influenced by various ions such as cl which can induce pitting corrosion and prevent passivation lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 van genuchten et al 2017 xu et al 2015 so4 2 and po4 3 which have been shown to inhibit fe corrosion and increase overpotentials lakshmipathiraj et al 2008 refaey 2005 van genuchten et al 2017 ca2 mg2 and dissolved silica which can accelerate electrode fouling bandaru et al 2020 to test this hypothesis a series of batch and continuous flow experiments were conducted to quantify the faradaic efficiency and the amount of fouling on the electrodes in addition chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry were employed to identify the electrochemical processes occurring during pr ec 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were of reagent grade and were used without further purification the electrodes were fe rods 4 8 mm diameter 98 purity obtained from metal supermarkets or steel plates 1 cm 1 cm 99 purity astm a109 steel obtained from mcmaster carr although these materials were of different grade small impurities have been shown to have a negligible effect on faradaic efficiency in fe ec müller et al 2019 four types of synthetic water samples were used to study the effect of solution chemistry on faradaic efficiency and fouling nacl in deionized water na2so4 in deionized water synthetic groundwater sgw synthetic produced water spw emulating the chemical profile of produced water associated with in situ bitumen extraction these solutions were chosen for their increasing complexity and varying effects on ec performance for example the sgw and spw solutions contained buffers e g hco3 which have previously been reported to affect ec performance by creating a passive layer at the electrode surfaces which prevents the release of fe ii iii van genuchten et al 2017 in the nacl solution the faradaic efficiency can be expected to be high because cl can help dissolve the electrode surface layers and facilitate pitting arroyo et al 2009 in contrast so4 2 has been shown to promote fe passivation van genuchten et al 2017 in the sgw solution ca2 and mg2 are expected to contribute to the fouling of the cathode in dc ec doggaz et al 2019 and on both electrodes in pr ec chow and pham 2021 lastly the spw contains hs which can be electrochemically oxidized into elemental sulfur s0 and or can react with fe2 to generate sparingly soluble iron sulfide minerals fes chow and pham 2019 the ionic compositions of the tested solutions are presented in table 1 the chemicals used to prepare the solutions were na2sio3 or na2sio3 9h2o nahs h2o mgcl2 or mgcl2 6h2o cacl2 na2so4 nahco3 nano3 na3po4 h2o or na3po4 12h2o and nacl the ph of the solutions was adjusted to their initial ph using 1 m hcl all solutions were prepared using 18 2 mω cm water 2 2 coagulant production experiments the effects of polarity reversal time prt and water chemistry on faradaic efficiency and electrode fouling were examined using a single pass continuous flow reactor v 200 ml that was operated for 6 h fig 1 a the reaction solution was supplied to the reactor by a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 resulting in a retention time of 20 min within the reactor the solution was continuously mixed by a magnetic stir bar the reactor was covered with a lid with openings that held the fe rods and for solution sampling the fe rods were spaced 2 cm apart and were submerged to a depth of 6 cm resulting in an active surface area of 7 6 cm2 0 1 cm in addition a reference electrode 3 m nacl ag agcl 0 209 v versus she was placed 0 25 cm from one of the other two electrodes before each experiment the electrodes were sonicated in 1 m hcl for approximately 1 min polished with 1500 grit sandpaper and rinsed with deionized water the reactor was controlled by a potentiostat vsp bio logic science instruments which applied a constant current of i 0 1 a i 13 ma cm 2 experiments were conducted either in the dc mode or in the pr mode with prts of 0 5 1 or 2 min at t 3 and 6 h 5 ml liquid samples were withdrawn from the reactor and were digested in a solution consisting of 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl subsequently the digested solution was subjected to inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes analysis to examine the electrode surface morphology and elemental composition the electrodes were removed from the reactor at the end of the experiments air dried and analyzed using an fei quanta feg 250 environmental scanning microscope esem that was coupled with an inca energy dispersive x ray edx spectrometer the icp oes analysis described above provides the total amount of fe released into the bulk solution to measure the amount of fe accumulated in the fouling layer on the electrodes a separate set of experiments were conducted in which the reactor was operated in the batch mode for 1 h subsequently the rods were removed their surface layers were digested by submerging the rods into acid and the amount of fe in the digestate was quantified by icp oes it is acknowledged that this approach only provided a semi quantitative estimate of the amount of fe in the fouling layer since the underlying rod could also have been dissolved to account for the fe that was released from the underlying rod a control experiment was performed wherein a new rod i e foul free rod was submerged in the acid for the same duration and the amount fe dissolved in this experiment was subtracted from that released in the digestion of the rod and the associated fouling layer 2 3 chronopotentiometry and cyclic voltammetry a series of chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltammetric experiments were conducted to gain further insights into the electrochemical processes occurring in dc ec and pr ec these experiments employed a 1 cm 1 cm steel plate i e the working electrode housed in a 3d printed polycarbonate reactor v 100 ml such that only one side of the electrode was exposed to the solution fig 1b before each experiment the working electrode was polished with 800 and 1500 grit sandpaper t214 black ice norton until the surface was smooth and reflective the reactor also housed a platinum counter electrode and a double junction ag agcl sat kcl reference electrode pine research the reference electrode was placed in a separate compartment that was connected to the reactor by a capillary inner diameter 1 mm the capillary tip was positioned 1 mm from the steel electrode a potentiostat autolab metrohm was used to control the potential or current of the working electrode the reactor was also designed to allow control of the convection rate by recirculating the solution using a peristaltic pump cole parmer masterflex the flow inlet was strategically placed adjacent to the working electrode allowing recycled water to enter the reactor parallel to the electrode surface consequently this setup permitted the hydrodynamic shear on the electrode to be increased by increasing the flow rate this feature was incorporated to study the effect of forced convection on faradaic efficiency and electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode electrolyte interface in the absence of flow recirculation convection still occurred due to fluid density differences which is referred to as natural convection conditions in this study chronopotentiometry was conducted employing i 13 ma cm 2 with the current direction switching every prt 0 5 and 2 min the duration of all experiments was 40 min corresponding to 40 and 10 complete cycles of pr for each prt respectively the short experimental time was deemed sufficient to observe the electrochemical phenomena occurring during pr ec operation and the trends observed were assumed to continue under longer experimental durations in addition dc ec experiments were conducted for 20 min corresponding to anodic operation duration in the pr ec experiments in each experiment the solution nacl na2so4 sgw or spw was circulated through the reactor at a flow rate of 0 ml min 1 175 ml min 1 and 770 ml min 1 and the potential of the working electrode was monitored over time in addition the amounts of fe released into the bulk solution and fe accumulated in the fouling layer of the working electrode were measured by digesting the entire working solution and the fouling layers in 3 wt hno3 and 3 wt hcl following digestion the samples were quantified on icp oes cyclic voltammetry was conducted using a voltage window of 3 25 v to 1 75 v vs she at 20 mv s 1 for 10 scans this procedure was similar to pr but with gradually changing the potential and measuring the current response as opposed to reversing the polarity instantaneously while operating galvanostatically consequently this method facilitated the observation of the corrosion pitting potentials the passivation characteristics and the occurrence of side reactions performing 10 consecutive scans permitted the observation of how the occurrence of electrochemical reactions changed with increasing scan number analogous to increasing the operating time in pr ec 2 4 faradaic efficiency the applied current governs the electrochemical reaction rates at the electrodes therefore the amount of anodic metal dissolution can be predicted by faraday s law eq 1 6 theoretical mass of coagulant metal dissolved i t m z f where i a is current t s is electrolysis time m is the atomic mass of the metal m 55 485 g mol 1 for fe z is electron transfer number z 2 for fe and f is faraday s constant 96 485 c mol 1 in this study the faradaic efficiency was calculated as the ratio of the measured to the theoretically predicted electrochemical produced by faraday s law from eq 6 mass of fe dissolved 7 faradaic efficiency observed coagulant theoretical coagulant z f m i t m 100 where m g is the experimentally measured mass of fe released into the bulk solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of pr on coagulant production in the continuous flow system fig 1a the faradaic efficiencies in pr ec were always lower than those in dc ec fig 2 notably the faradaic efficiency progressively decreased as prt decreased from 2 min to 0 5 min the extent to which prt influenced faradaic efficiency was dependent on the solution chemistry for example the lowest faradaic efficiency observed with the nacl solution was 80 while the lowest faradaic efficiency in other solutions ranged between 5 and 50 in the pr ec experiments with spw the faradaic efficiency was 20 at all prts possible explanations for the diminished faradaic efficiency in pr ec include i fe ions precipitated on the electrode surfaces instead of migrating into the bulk solution it was visually observed that more materials accumulated on the electrodes in pr ec than in dc ec especially in experiments with a prt of 0 5 min ii there are electrochemical side reactions that diverted the current away from reaction 1 to determine the contribution of the first mechanism to the reduction in the faradaic efficiency additional experiments were conducted to quantify the amount of fe accumulated in the electrode fouling layers these experiments also employed the reactor presented in fig 1a except that the reactor was operated in a batch mode to enable the closing of fe mass balance which will be discussed further in section 3 2 as shown in fig 3 the amount of fe in the fouling layer increased as prt decreased consistent with the decreasing faradaic efficiency trend described above the amounts of fe in the fouling layer in the spw experiments were 2 5 times greater than those in the other experiments this is attributable to the reaction between fe ii and hs which is known to be much faster than the hydrolysis and oxidation of fe ii gao et al 2018 8 f e 2 h s fes h this reaction produced sparingly soluble fes minerals whose presence on the electrode surface is corroborated by a clear signal of s in the eds spectrum figure s1 in the supporting information and by the observation that the electrodes turned black i e the typical color of fes minerals the build up of fe in the fouling layer in the spw and sgw experiments could also have been caused by ca and mg containing minerals which covered the surface of the electrodes figure s1 and trapped more fe in the fouling layer müller et al 2019 ca and mg containing minerals such as caco3 mg oh 2 and camg co3 2 can precipitate under alkaline conditions developed in the boundary layer of the cathode lei et al 2019 wang et al 2013 because both electrodes in pr ec intermittently served as the cathode as the polarity alternated ca and mg containing minerals were seen to be present on both electrodes figure s1 on the contrary the higher faradaic efficiency and lower fe amount in the electrode fouling layers observed in the experiments with the nacl solution is attributable to the ability of cl to inhibit electrode passivation via pitting corrosion arroyo et al 2009 although sgw and spw also contained cl the depassivation effect of cl must have been outcompeted by ions that can inhibit corrosion i e so4 2 no3 silicate and phosphate sgw and spw also contained ca2 and mg2 which can further foul the electrode surfaces via the mechanism discussed above 3 2 electrochemical phenomena at the electrode electrolyte interface the faradaic efficiencies in pr ec experiments were still lower than 100 even after accounting for the fe in the fouling layer figure s2 suggesting that there must have been side reactions i e hypothesis ii presented above possible side reactions include the oxidation of water and cl i e reactions 4 and 5 the oxidation of fe ii to fe iii reverse reactions 9 and 10 and the oxidation of h2 g to h2o reverse reaction 2 h2 g is produced from reaction 2 in the prior current cycle when the electrode served as the cathode since the measured anodic potential was always 0 1 v vs she data not presented the oxidation of water and cl can be ruled out in contrast the oxidation of fe ii and h2 g are thermodynamically possible because e0 h w h2o h2 0 41 v e0 h green rust fe oh 2 0 5 to 0 6 v when ph 7 10 e0

3 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 fe oh 2 10 3 f e 2 o 3 2 e 2 h 2 f e 3 o 4 h 2 o to gain further insights into the electrochemical phenomena that were responsible for the redirection of the faradaic current in pr ec a series of chronopotentiometric and cyclic voltametric experiments were conducted as mentioned in section 2 3 these experiments were performed using the small reactor fig 1b to enable the investigation of the effect of hydrodynamic shear on the faradaic efficiency and the processes occurring at the electrode electrolyte interface the results from the pr ec chronopotentiometric experiments with natural convection i e a flow rate of 0 ml min 1 through the reactor revealed that following each pr event the fe working electrode underwent a period of repolarization before its potential reached a steady state value fig 4 s3 s4 and s5 the repolarization duration was dependent on the prt and the solution chemistry for example in the nacl experiments the average anodic repolarization times with prts of 0 5 min and 2 min were around 6 s and 10 s respectively whereas the cathodic repolarization times were 7 s and 20 s the areas highlighted in yellow in fig 4a and 4c similarly the repolarization duration in the na2so4 and sgw electrolytes also decreased as prt increased figures s3a s3c s4a and s4c in contrast the potential of the fe working electrode in the spw experiments never reached steady state figures s5a and s5b this indicates that the repolarization processes in this case were slow with a longer timescale than the prts in each case further study is needed to investigate this behavior however the dynamics may be associated with the competing effects of the passivating sulfate ions and the depassivating chloride ions present in this system the repolarization times of the fe working electrode were shortened upon the introduction of forced convection by means of recirculating the solution through the reactor a flow rate of 175 ml min 1 fig 4b 4d s3b s3d s4b s4d s5b and s5d for example the anodic and cathodic repolarization times were reduced to 1 s and 2 5 s respectively upon the introduction of flow notably the anodic overpotentials in the nacl na2so4 and sgw experiments decreased by 0 5 1 v in the absence of flow the anodic potentials in the na2so4 electrolyte were above 2 v vs she figures s3a and s3c these potential values were sufficiently high to trigger the oxidation of h2o van genuchten et al 2017 resulting in the formation of gas bubbles on the working electrode under forced convection the anodic potential in the na2so4 electrolyte dropped to below 1 v vs she and the production of gas bubbles was no longer observable there are several possible reasons for the presence of an electrode repolarization period following each current switching event first electrode repolarization can be the result of the recharging of the electrode double layer however this is unlikely the main reason since the time required to charge the electrochemical double layer in ec is typically 1 20 ms ingelsson et al 2020 whereas the repolarization times observed herein were greater than 2 s furthermore there was no evidence of significant electrochemical double layer capacitance in the polarization cyclic voltammetry curve figure s6 second electrode repolarization could be due to the inversion of the boundary layer ph leading to a shift in the equilibrium potential of electrochemical reactions for example a higher potential at the beginning of each cathodic polarization could be due to the reduction of water i e reaction 2 being thermodynamically more favorable in an acidic boundary layer this acidic boundary layer was established in the preceding current cycle when the electrode functioned as an anode note that the anodic repolarization is unlikely due to the electrochemical dissolution of fe0 since reaction 1 does not involve h and therefore is not influenced by the ph change in the boundary layer as such anodic repolarization could have been caused by reactions involving electrochemically reactive species in the electrode boundary layer it is hypothesized that only after these species were consumed did reaction 1 start this hypothesis is in agreement with the observation that proportionally longer anodic repolarization times were associated with lower faradaic efficiencies for example the anodic polarization time in the nacl solution constituted approximately 8 and 20 of the total polarity cycle for the 2 min and 0 5 min prts respectively fig 4a and 4c under these prts the faradaic efficiencies were 80 and 55 fig 5 note that the fe in the fouling layers were included in the calculations of these faradaic efficiencies so any efficiencies 100 could not have been caused by fouling in these experiments the inactivation of faradaic fe0 fe2 dissolution during electrode repolarization has been hypothesized previously grøterud and smoczyński 1986 but has not been investigated in detail the hypothesis that side reactions redirecting the faradaic current during the electrode repolarization is further corroborated by the increasing faradaic efficiency under forced convection fig 5 specifically under a flow rate of 175 ml min 1 the faradaic efficiencies in the nacl experiments were 98 prt 2 min and 95 prt 0 5 min compared to the efficiencies of 80 and 50 when the flow rate was 0 ml min 1 in the na2so4 experiments the faradaic efficiencies increased from 10 20 0 ml min 1 to ca 90 175 ml min 1 whereas in the sgw experiments the faradaic efficiencies increased from 60 80 0 ml min 1 to 80 90 175 ml min 1 in the spw experiment with a prt of 2 min the faradaic efficiency increased from 40 0 ml min 1 to 65 175 ml min 1 these faradaic efficiency increases are attributable to the hydrodynamic shear from the forced convection which would remove electrochemically reactive species from the electrode s boundary layer and thus shorten the time required for electrode repolarization unlike in all other experiments the observed faradaic efficiency in the spw experiment that was operated with a prt of 0 5 min decreased from 50 to 35 when the flow rate increased from 0 ml min 1 to 175 ml min 1 fig 5 this negative effect of hydrodynamic shear is thought to be due to the continual replenishment of hs since hs ions can be electrochemically oxidized into s0 during ec chow and pham 2019 the presence of hs in the electrode boundary layer will divert the faradaic current away from reaction 1 interestingly when the flow rate was further increased to 770 ml min 1 the faradaic efficiency increased to 80 it is proposed that in the presence of hs flow leads to two competing effects decreased side reactions due to removal of reactive species formed at the electrode and increased side reactions due to increased transport of hs to the electrode surface at higher convection rates the former effect was more dominant while lower convection rates appear to enhance the latter effect the higher mass transport rates expected with shorter prts since the concentration boundary layer takes time to develop after polarity reversal may explain why the effect of hs decreased with increasing prt in addition the non steady state behavior of the electrode potential in spw figures s5a and s5b is indicative of a higher incidence of competitive reactions taking place in this solution to gain further insights into the nature of the reactive species that caused the repolarization of the fe working electrode 10 consecutive potential scan cycles were performed in each type of solution the results from these experiments are presented in fig 6 and s7 with the forward and backward scans being plotted separately to aid visual interpretation scan sequence 1 2 3 4 5 6 the regions of high current at both ends of the potential window correspond to accelerated fe corrosion i e pitting corrosion reaction 1 at high positive potentials and h2 g evolution reaction 2 at low negative potentials the potential where the anodic current increases exponentially with potential is referred to as the pitting potential mansouri et al 2011 at this point the passivating surface layer is dissolved which permits uninhibited fe corrosion the region in between the corrosion and pitting potentials is referred to as the passivation region which is characterized by a slow current response as the applied potential increased ingelsson et al 2020 increasingly pronounced current peaks at around 0 70 v vs she were observed in the nacl solution fig 6a these peaks represent electrochemically active species reacting and being depleted at the electrode electrolyte interface following the shift from cathodic to anodic potentials i e after pr the peaks appear at the potential value prior to the pitting potential indicating that the reactions involving these electrochemical active species are thermodynamically favored over the anodic metal dissolution therefore it is proposed that these peaks correspond to side reactions that redirect the faradaic current away from the desired dissolution of fe0 e g reaction 9 e0 h fe2o3 fe oh 2 0 5 to 1 0 v beverskog and puigdomenech 1996b it is probable that these reactions caused the long polarization times in the chronopotentiometry experiments in addition the growth in peak size also indicates increasing concentrations of these active species with increasing scan numbers as it is known that a fouling layer is likely forming during pr fig 3 more reactive species may be trapped in the electrode surface layer as the number of cycles increases notably when forced convection was applied these peaks disappeared fig 6b and the anodic dissolution of fe was initiated at a lower potential this is consistent with reactive species being removed from the electrode surface under the forced convection conditions reducing the amount of side reactions occurring during anodic polarization current peaks i e side reactions were also observed in the experiments with na2so4 between 1 3 and 0 3 v vs she fig 6c and sgw between 1 3 and 0 25 v vs she fig 6e as in the nacl experiment these peaks also disappeared upon the introduction of forced convection fig 6d and 6f on the contrary the results from the spw experiments demonstrated high currents and hence high electrochemical reactivity at all potentials on both sides of the equilibrium potential this observation is attributable to the corrosive nature of hs which can remove the passive layer and lead to an increase in current on the tafel plot ma et al 2000 the high currents would mask current peaks making it impossible to clearly discern side reactions taking place in this system current peaks were also present in the reverse scans figure s7 suggesting that electrochemical side reactions i e other than reaction 2 were also occurring following the shift from anodic to cathodic currents the current peaks were observed between 1 and 1 4 v 1 2 and 1 8 v and 0 6 and 2 v in the nacl na2so4 and sgw solutions respectively figures s7a s7c and s7e as in the forward scans these current peaks were suppressed upon the introduction of flow figures s7b s7d s7f based on the results presented above it is hypothesized that the reactive species responsible for the electrode repolarization in the chronopotentiometric experiments are dissolved fe ii dissolved fe iii and fe oxyhydr oxides the involvement of these species in the side reactions can be illustrated using the pourbaix diagram for fe in water figure s8 which shows that fe can undergo solid phase oxidation in an alkaline environment at the anode following polarity reversal to form fe oh 2 s subsequently the oxidation of fe oh 2 s into fe3o4 s reverse reaction 9 and possibly fe3o4 s into fe2o3 s reverse rection 10 can occur instead of fe0 fe2 dissolution resulting in the redirection of the faradaic current during the cathodic polarization fe3 fe2 reduction may occur and possibly fe2 fe0 electrodeposition at moderate cathodic overpotentials which could explain the current peaks at potentials 0 5 v vs she in the reverse cyclic voltammetric scans figure s7 by further inspection of the pourbaix diagram it is possible that once the ph increases at the cathode following polarity reversal solid transformations of material precipitated on the electrode including the reduction of fe2o3 s into fe3o4 s as well as fe3o4 s into fe oh 2 s can occur as a result of the constant cycling between dissolved and solid fe ii and fe iii species together with the electrodeposition fe2 fe0 the anodic corrosion of fe0 is suppressed in pr ec leading to diminished faradaic efficiency in addition to the side reactions involving fe species the oxidation of adsorbed h2 produced from reaction 2 in the preceding current cycle when the electrode served as a cathode could also be a side reaction that causes a diminished faradaic efficiency yang et al 2017 lastly the oxidation of h2o in the experiments with na2so4 discussed above resulted in the very low faradaic efficiencies 20 under natural convection fig 5 4 conclusion it is commonly believed that pr can enhance ec performance because it can remove electrode fouling layers and reduce energy consumption in addition to providing other benefits such as uniform corrosion of all electrodes and enhanced mass transport of coagulant to the bulk solution however the evidence presented in this study indicates that pr can negatively impact the performance of ec depending on the solution chemistry flow rate and reversal time for example we found that operating ec with short prts i e 0 5 min in this study worsened the overall performance by accelerating the formation of electrode surface layers and decreasing faradaic efficiency measured in the bulk solution the lower faradaic efficiency was attributed to 1 the precipitation of iron species onto the surface of the electrodes and 2 the electrochemical side reactions which syphoned energy away from fe2 production in fact a faradaic efficiency as low as 10 was observed in spw owing to the high rate of fouling and the presence of side reactions involving iron and sulfide containing species this result suggests that long prts should be used and the electrode surfaces should be kept clean by other means a strategy to mitigate the negative effects of pr could be increasing the forced convection rate however increasing the flow rate may have a detrimental effect on the coagulation flocculation process and consequently the contaminant removal performance to overcome this a high shear ec reactor could be used upstream from the flocculation separation stage as has previously been proposed ingelsson et al 2020 timmes et al 2010 depending on the contaminated water characteristics there is likely an optimal range of flow rate and prts at which pr ec is effective future studies are needed to further explore the relationship between flow rate and the performance of pr ec especially in larger scale systems additionally as faradaic efficiency and electrode fouling in pr ec appear to be strongly dependent on the chemistry of the solution we suggest that future studies should examine the effect of other solutes beyond those investigated in our study such as natural organic matter chromate and arsenate which are the contaminants frequently treated by ec the characteristics of the precipitates formed with pr operation and their ability to remove contaminants of interest should also be investigated lastly pr ec should be investigated for other electrode materials that do not exhibit the same sensitivity to reversible electrochemical reactions as fe for example aluminum al electrodes have previously been recommended as a more suitable material than iron for pr ec operation ingelsson et al 2020 the effects of water chemistry and prt on the performance of al ec are currently being investigated in our laboratories funding the authors are grateful

16693,the denitrification desulfurization process is a promising technology for elemental sulfur s0 production from sulfide containing wastewater however the microbial community associated with high s0 production still is not well studied this study describes an efficient denitrification s0 production bioreactor based on inoculation with anaerobic granular sludge at an optimal s n molar ratio of 7 2 80 of the influent sulfide was transformed to high quality elemental sulfur with a purity of 92 5 while the total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency was stable at 80 metatranscriptomic analysis found that community expression of the gene encoding the sulfide quinone reductase sqr was 10 fold greater than that of the flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase subunit b fccb moreover the expression level of sqr was also significantly higher than the dsr gene encoding for dissimilatory sulfate reductase which encodes a critical s0 oxidation enzyme metagenomic binning analysis confirmed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob utilizing sqr were common in the community and most likely accounted for high s0 production an unexpected enrichment in methanogens and high expression activity of bacteria carrying out stickland fermentation as well as in other bacteria with reduced genomes indicated a complex community supporting stable sulfide oxidation to s0 likely aiding in performance stability this study establishes this treatment approach as an alternative biotechnology for sulfide containing wastewater treatment and sheds light on the microbial interactions associated with high s0 production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrifying sulfide oxidation s0 production microflora meta omics 1 introduction discharge of significant quantities of sulfide laden wastewater can occur in industrial processes including petroleum refining food processing livestock ranching and anaerobic digestion for biogas production janssen et al 2009 vera et al 2013 pikaar et al 2014 due to sulfide s toxicity corrosivity malodor and other hazards it can contaminate receiving waters and endanger life resulting in an increased environmental health risk if levels are not mitigated before discharge okabe et al 2007 cai et al 2017 compared to physical and chemical methods of sulfide mitigation biological methods have the advantage of requiring no addition of catalysts low sludge yield and the potential recovery of elemental sulfur henshaw and zhu 2001 rabbani et al 2015 in this context the denitrification desulfurization process is a promising biological sulfur recovery process since it can simultaneously convert sulfide and the pollutant nitrate into elemental sulfur and dinitrogen gas respectively lin et al 2018 an additional advantage of the denitrification desulfurization process is that the elemental sulfur s0 produced can be used as a raw material for sulfuric acid fertilizer and pesticide production lin et al 2018 the production and separation of s0 are the two key factors influencing the recovery of s0 cai et al 2017 it has been reported that tight control of the s n ratio in the denitrification desulfurization process can increase the s0 transformation ratio to as high as 80 dolejs et al 2015 bayrakdar et al 2016 for s0 separation granular sludge can be more efficient than activated sludge since the s can be added to the surface of granular sludge through accretion aiding its separation and recovery lin et al 2018 this approach is not unreasonable since sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob have been detected in anaerobic granular sludge anags and successfully acclimated for denitrification desulfurization applications this is an additional benefit of this approach since anags has a low acquisition cost and is common in wastewater treatment systems xu et al 2011 nanda et al 2013 consequently anags seems an appropriate source of biomass to be utilized for s0 recovery in a denitrification desulfurization reactor gaining an improved understanding of the microbial ecology associated with the denitrification desulfurization process is critical for improving its efficiency and robustness however the bacterial community connected with this process is ill defined and lacks detailed investigation into its underlying physiology especially relating to early steps occurring after inoculating with the anags thus investigation into the metabolic functions and contributions of functional microorganisms to the denitrification desulfurization process performance are needed in addition the increase of s n ratio via increasing sulfide concertation has previously been used to increase the s0 transformation ratio dolejs al 2015 however increases in sulfide can be stressful due to it toxicity but the response of communities to perturbations in influent sulfide concentrations is not well established lu et al 2018 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic based analyses of microbial communities can provide both community and functional insight without introducing amplification bias these approaches have been used in the comparison of taxonomic and functional profiles of the microbial communities associated with n2o production in denitrification reactors with differing ph zhuge et al 2020 to successfully build an ecological model of the microbial community in lab scale and full scale anammox

anaerobic granular sludge s0 was initially generated in the reactor and then separated into the effluent by backwash the aims of this work were to i explore the feasibility of the denitrifying s0 recovery granular sludge reactor to efficiently recover elemental sulfur ii identify the composition and contributions of the microbial community that developed during the operation of the reactor iii determine the microbial relationships between functional microorganisms and reveal the key roles that the functional groups play in the stability and performance of reactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale bioreactor setup and operation the continuously operated upflow bioreactor was a 1 25 l plexiglass reactor which had an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively zhuang et al 2020 the seed sludge was collected from the anaerobic granular sludge at a paper manufacturing wastewater treatment plant zhejiang china during its operational period 150 days the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater which contained the following per liter 22 mg of znso4 55 mg of cacl2 50 6 mg of mncl2 4h2o 11 mg of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 15 7 mg of cuso4 5h2o and 16 1 mg

retention time control the hydraulic retention time hrt ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were set as 6 h 8 0 0 4 30 c 0 1 mg l 1 respectively the s n molar ratio is recognized as a key parameter for increasing the s0 transformation ratio pokorna and zabranska 2015 in this study the reactor had 5 phases of operation defined by their s n ratios s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 changes in the ratio were achieved through a stepwise increase in sulfide concentration while the influent nitrate concentration remained at 40 mgn l 1 as shown in table 1 the steady state of each bioreactor was regarded as the point at which the fluctuations in the removal of sulfide nitrate and were within 5 for 5 days 2 2 chemical analysis during bioreactor operation both the influent and effluent were sampled daily to determine sulfide nitrite sulfate nitrate and thiosulfate concentrations apha 2005 the total concentration of sulfide h2s aq s2 and hs was determined by the methylene blue method

meter hach hq40d nitrous oxide was determined using gas chromatograph gc2014c shimadzu as described in zhuge et al 2020 since the internal environment of the reactor was alkaline the main sulfur based

machado et al 2021 3 results 3 1 bioreactor performance the denitrifying desulfurization granular sludge reactor was operated for 150 days during which there were five phases demarcated by changes in s n ratios s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 7 2 and 8 2 fig 1 in phases i iv s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 and 7 2 the tn removal efficiency was stable at 80 fig 1a and b during phase v s n 8 2 the tn efficiency declined to 40 during both phase iv and phase v the sulfide removal efficiency remained at a high level of 90 fig 1c interestingly the amount of elemental sulfur produced increased from 20 3 to 279 7 mgs l 1 over the entire operation period fig 1d neither thiosulfate or sulfite or the nitrogen end products nitrous oxide or ammonia were detected in the effluent during the whole experiment to gain insight into the flux of electrons into respiration or biomass the electron balance analysis was conducted the f s 0 the portion of electron into cell synthesis showed significant changes in phase v suggesting that the high sulfide concentration would potentially enhance carbon fixation table s3 these results indicate that the optimal s n molar ratio for s0 production was 7 2 raman spectra analysis showed that as the s n ratio increased the surface of the granular sludge became increasingly encrusted with s0 fig 2a by using the backwash approach it was clearly observed that the reactor effluent turned milky white and exhibited the dundal phenomenon chen et al 2016 fig 2b which is consistent with the characteristics of bio sulfur colloids as described previously marnocha et al 2019 xrd analysis of the residual solids obtained from dried effluent found an intensive peak having a diffraction angle of between 23 and 28 similar to the angle for a sulfur standard no 08 0247 suggesting the collected bio sulfur was high purity sulfur fig 2c xps analysis showed one peak at 163 6 164 0 ev consistent with a sulfur valence of 0 which suggested that the purity of collected bio sulfur was 92 5 huang et al 2017 fig 2d these results indicate that the anaerobic granular based techniques could easily recover high purity elemental sulfur from the bioreactor during operation at an optimal s n molar ratio 3 2 analysis of key genes for denitrification and sulfur cycle to gain insight into the physiological shifts occurring during reactor operation total rna was extracted from the sludge samples during phase iii iv and v expression of the key genes for denitrification and the sulfur cycle were measured using normalized read expression as a proxy for expression fig 3 the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene nap and membrane associated nitrate reductase gene nar are the key functional genes for dissimilatory nitrate reduction shapleigh 2013 and their expression pattern was phase iii phase iv phase v fig 3a this was somewhat surprising since the rate of nitrate reduction showed the opposite trend and was 60 lower in phase v than phase iv fig 1a the expression of cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase gene nirs decreased by about 30 in phase v versus phase iv while the levels of the copper containing nitrite reductase gene nirk remained at low levels nitric oxide reduction genes cnorb and qnorz and nitrous oxide reduction genes noszii were in high expression levels in both phase iv and phase v indicating the potential for rapid reduction of no and n2o these results suggest that the expression of nitrogen related genes with perhaps the exception of nirs was not inhibited by increasing levels of sulfide enzymes associated with sulfide oxidation can be divided into two types the sox dependent enzyme complex which includes soxa soxb and soxc and the sox independent enzyme system which includes sqr fccb dsrb apra sat and sora the sox dependent system is responsible for direct one step sulfide oxidation s2 so4 2 while the sox independent enzyme carries out an indirect two step sulfide oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 poser et al 2014 results presented in fig 3b show that the expression of soxa soxb and soxc remained at relatively low values of 5 70 rpm during all phases which suggest the direct one step sulfide oxidation pathway was not preferred for the sox independent enzyme system flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase subunit b fccb and sulfide quinone reductase sqr are reported to be the key functional genes for oxidating sulfide to s0 sousa et al 2018 expression of fccb and sqr increased from 6 6 and 21 16 rpm respectively during phase iii to 26 5 and 646 84 rpm in phase v fig 3b these results demonstrate that the indirect two step sulfur oxidation was the dominant physiology associated with sulfide oxidation in all phases genes associated with s0 oxidation include the dissimilatory sulfate reductase gene dsr it is notable that while the expression of dsr increased gradually during reactor operation its average expression was still approximately 20 fold lower than that of sqr in both phase iv and v these results are consistent with the increase of detected s0 concentration in the effluent another notable trend in reactor performance was the decrease in sulfate in the effluent in the latter phases of operation sulfate adenylyltransferase gene sat and adenylylsulfate reductase gene apra are critical genes for sulfate reduction as can be seen in fig 3b the expression of apra and sat in phase v was 10 fold higher than in phase iv this result suggests that the reason for the effluent sulfate decrease is likely a result of sulfate reduction 3 3 microbial community analysis assembly of the reads from the phases iii iv and v generating a number of high quality completeness 70 contamination 10 draft metagenome assembled genomes mags from each sample fig 4 taxonomy of each of the mags was determined to assess their relatedness and their contribution to the community was assessed through mapping of dna reads and their transcriptional activity assessed through mapping of rna reads and these results are shown in fig 4 unexpectedly in phases iii and iv the most prevalent mag with the abundance 14 8 20 11 was a member of the archaea that gtdbtk assigned to the species level as methanothrix soehngenii by both ani and pplacer the phylogenetic tree shown in fig 5 also includes methanothrix soehngenii showing the high level of identity between it and the mag from the reactor this organism has been shown to be an acetoclastic methanogen huser et al 1982 the occurrence of this type of methanogenesis is unexpected since no fixed carbon is present in the influent the prevalence of this bacterium decreased markedly in phase v likely because of high sulfide zhang et al 2018 reads from this organism were also scarce in the rna reads but it seems unlikely it would be maintained at such a high proportion of the community if it were metabolically inactive the next most commonly occurring mags were sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob sob were gradually enriched and eventually become the dominant bacteria in phase v increasing from 1 74 to 38 89 of the community as indicated by read mapping fig 4 the majority of sob identified here encode the incomplete sox dependent enzyme complex genes indicating they cannot produce sulfate via the sox pathway however s0 producing functional genes fccb or sqr were distributed into all sob genomes these results were consistent with an 80 0 s0 transformation ratio during phases iv and v sulfate reducing bacteria srb were found in the reactor although they remained at a low abundance 0 2 2 1 the sob which were either complete or near complete denitrifiers were transcriptionally active suggesting electrons from sulfide oxidation were passed to nitrogen oxides to generate atp fig 5 most of this group also contained the gene encoding the co2 fixation protein ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco rubisco was not found in any of the other mags that were predominant in the community suggesting this group was also responsible for a significant portion of the co2 fixation this distribution likely reflects the energetic advantages associated with sulfide dependent respiration since the calvin cycle requires substantial atp and nadph input organisms using the wood ljungdahl pathway of fixation typically operate near the thermodynamic limit for growth and so would not be expected to be a major source of co2 fixation in this system a few mags had the gene needed to make proteins allowing co2 fixation via the wood ljungdahl pathway but they were not prominent in the community of any phase the acetate used to support acetoclastic methanogenesis typically arises via fermentation since its production during fermentation increases atp yield wolfe 2005 within the mags were two groups that are the likely source of acetate one group were predicted to be members of the family tissierellaceae and their genomes contained glycine reductase which is used in the stickland fermentation and produces acetate as an end product neumann et al 2019 these organisms were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active suggesting they were a critical source of acetate the other group were taxonomically assigned as members of the acholeplasmatales the mags of this group have relatively small genomes and are incapable of respiration like other members of this family siewert et al 2014 they do contain a complete glycolytic pathway as well as the genes required for acetate production from pyruvate indicating these reactions are likely sources of acetate since other pathways of atp production were not obvious as with the stickland mags this group of mags were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active fig 4 a number of mags were taxonomically assigned as members of the anaerolineales but their metabolism was difficult to determine based on the available information this group also included a number of transcriptionally active organisms all the mags that were assigned here as acholeplasmatales and tissierellaceae mags had small genomes the average size of the genomes of the members of the acholeplasmatales was 1 4 106 bases pairs and the tissierellaceae was 2 0 106 by comparison the average sob genome was 3 0 106 base pairs given the influent contains no fixed carbon it is unexpected to find so many mags with reduced genomes as expected uncurated genome scale metabolic models gems found that on average 79 gap fill reactions were required to allow growth of the acholeplasmatales mags on minimal media with glucose by comparison only 2 gap fill reactions were required to allow growth of the sob mags this common occurrence of organisms with small genomes and numerous auxotrophies indicates the microbial community in this reactor has an overall cooperative metabolism machado et al 2021 this conclusion was supported by a flux simulation of mags from major members of the community which gave a small metabolic resource overlap mro score of 0 56 indicative of organisms not competing for common resources as well as a relatively high metabolic interaction potential mip of 10 by comparison modeling of a community with just unique mags in the srb and sob gave an mro of 0 76 and no indication of metabolic exchange 4 discussion in this study an efficient denitrifying desulfurization granular sludge reactor was built and the s0 transformation ratio and loading rate of this system reached 94 5 and 1 06 kg s m 3 d 1 respectively the s0 generated was easily separated from the reactor through backwashing fig 2b providing an alternative approach for solving issues related to the difficulties of efficient recovery of elemental sulfur in a biotreatment system cai et al 2017 in addition the recovered elemental sulfur was 92 pure giving it a high utilization value in previous studies the optimal s n ratios for higher elemental sulfur transformation ratio were generally controlled within the range of 5 3 5 2 which is not suitable for removal of sulfide and recovery of elemental sulfur in wastewater with high sulfide concentrations dolejs et al 2015 lin et al 2018 however in this reactor the sulfide removal rate and s0 recovery ratio could be maintained at s n ratios as high as 7 2 this research could extend the application of the technology of denitrification dependent elemental sulfur recovery based on inoculating with anaerobic granular sludge the removal of tn was also efficient during most phases with the majority being removed during the first three phases phase i iv however when influent s2 was increased from 314 6 to 352 1 mgs l 1 in phase v the tn removal rate decreased by 70 fig 1 the concentration of influent s2 in phase v was higher than reported inhibitory threshold levels for denitrification which were in the range of 200 300 mgs l 1 cardoso et al 2010 which may account for the relatively lower nitrogen removal efficiency in phase v however the expression levels of functional genes for nitrate reduction did not decrease fig 3 one possibility is that sulfide inhibited microbial activity through directly reacting with metals cofactor of denitrification enzymes lu et al 2018 the sulfide oxidation rate showed no obvious suppression as a result of high sulfide concentrations even in phase v fig 1 in recent work kinetic analyses found that the sulfide oxidation followed monod type kinetics which indicated higher sulfide concentrations would not significantly inhibit sulfide oxidation as long as the sulfide concentration range was below 1800 mgs l 1 lu et al 2018 in addition the conversion rate of s0 linearly increased and approximately conformed to first order kinetics equation in this study which suggested that activity of the s0 producing enzymes were not a limiting factor this deduction was supported by the high expression levels of sqr encoded s0 producing enzyme sqr fig 3 which is less susceptible for high levels of sulfide klok et al 2013 hence sqr was mainly responsible for the high sulfide removal and s0 producing rate in this reactor sulfate the other main sulfide oxidative product remained at a constant concentration in the effluent during the first three phases but its concentration significantly decreased by 83 1 in phase v however the expression levels of the genes encoded sox dependent enzyme complex were not significantly decreased in phase v fig 3 it is uncertain if this occurred due to the inhibition of sulfide on the sox dependent pathway however another possibility is that for the observed decreased was that sulfate reduction increased since the key genes for sulfate reduction have a significant increase in expression at high sulfide concentrations metagenome assembly yielded a number of high quality mags that were unexpectedly phylogenetically and physiologically diverse fig 4 as expected there were sulfide oxidizing denitrifiers but there were also methanogens sulfur oxidizers and a wide array of mags from organisms that appear to be fermenters this diversity is somewhat unexpected given there is no fixed carbon in the influent methanogens unexpectedly dominated in phase iii and iv but their abundance decreased dramatically in phase v likely due to sulfide inhibition fig 4 at the same time the sob which encoded rubisco and sqr were gradually enriched and eventually dominant in phase v organisms that appear to ferment the fixed carbon to acetate for methanogens were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active especially in phase iii and iv metagenomic and transcriptomics analyses suggest a potential role for the dominant members of the microbial community which were integrated in a genome based model of the reactor fig 6 in this model the sulfide oxidizers play two critical roles i oxidizing sulfide and ii fixing carbon the energetics associated with denitrification dependent sulfide oxidation is sufficient to fix significant amounts of carbon via the calvin cycle this fixed carbon is then used by other bacteria as both a carbon and energy source a good example of the latter is the occurrence of bacteria who apparently are generating atp via the stickland fermentation using glycine reductase the acetate generated from this reaction as well as from other fermentative bacteria is likely what accounts for the high level of methanogens in the reactor in phases iii and iv one of the archaeal mags is nearly identical to the previously characterized methanothrix soehngenii which is an acetoclastic methanogen huser et al 1982 prevalence of methanogens decreased dramatically in phase v it is uncertain what happens to the acetate during phase v since the apb remained active in this phase recent work has shown that complex microbial ecosystems can be approximated as being cooperative and competitive with the former having non overlapping resource requirements and the latter being highly competitive for common resources machado et al 2021 ecological theory suggests that the cooperative systems better tolerate resource shifts it seems likely the complex community in the bioreactor described here is cooperative which is important for making this system robust to changes in influent as shown by its overall performance stability during each phase except during the latter stages of phase v 5 conclusion this study establishes an efficient denitrification s0 production bioreactor based on inoculating with anaerobic granular sludge in the reactor 80 of the influent sulfide was converted to high quality element sulfur with a purity of 92 5 and 80 of the total nitrogen was removed at an optimal s n molar ratio of 7 2 the expression level of sulfide quinone reductase gene sqr was significantly higher than that of dsr which is consistent with the high sulfide removal rate and s0 transformation ratio tn removal efficiency significantly decreased in phase v but unexpectedly this was not a result of the inhibition of the expression of denitrification related genes by excess sulfide metagenomics binning analysis confirmed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob utilizing sulfide quinone reductase sqr were the principal members of the community driving sulfide oxidation these bacteria were part of a large metabolically complex community that likely was critical for the overall performance stability of the reactor under changing conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgment this work was supported by

16693,the denitrification desulfurization process is a promising technology for elemental sulfur s0 production from sulfide containing wastewater however the microbial community associated with high s0 production still is not well studied this study describes an efficient denitrification s0 production bioreactor based on inoculation with anaerobic granular sludge at an optimal s n molar ratio of 7 2 80 of the influent sulfide was transformed to high quality elemental sulfur with a purity of 92 5 while the total inorganic nitrogen removal efficiency was stable at 80 metatranscriptomic analysis found that community expression of the gene encoding the sulfide quinone reductase sqr was 10 fold greater than that of the flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase subunit b fccb moreover the expression level of sqr was also significantly higher than the dsr gene encoding for dissimilatory sulfate reductase which encodes a critical s0 oxidation enzyme metagenomic binning analysis confirmed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob utilizing sqr were common in the community and most likely accounted for high s0 production an unexpected enrichment in methanogens and high expression activity of bacteria carrying out stickland fermentation as well as in other bacteria with reduced genomes indicated a complex community supporting stable sulfide oxidation to s0 likely aiding in performance stability this study establishes this treatment approach as an alternative biotechnology for sulfide containing wastewater treatment and sheds light on the microbial interactions associated with high s0 production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords denitrifying sulfide oxidation s0 production microflora meta omics 1 introduction discharge of significant quantities of sulfide laden wastewater can occur in industrial processes including petroleum refining food processing livestock ranching and anaerobic digestion for biogas production janssen et al 2009 vera et al 2013 pikaar et al 2014 due to sulfide s toxicity corrosivity malodor and other hazards it can contaminate receiving waters and endanger life resulting in an increased environmental health risk if levels are not mitigated before discharge okabe et al 2007 cai et al 2017 compared to physical and chemical methods of sulfide mitigation biological methods have the advantage of requiring no addition of catalysts low sludge yield and the potential recovery of elemental sulfur henshaw and zhu 2001 rabbani et al 2015 in this context the denitrification desulfurization process is a promising biological sulfur recovery process since it can simultaneously convert sulfide and the pollutant nitrate into elemental sulfur and dinitrogen gas respectively lin et al 2018 an additional advantage of the denitrification desulfurization process is that the elemental sulfur s0 produced can be used as a raw material for sulfuric acid fertilizer and pesticide production lin et al 2018 the production and separation of s0 are the two key factors influencing the recovery of s0 cai et al 2017 it has been reported that tight control of the s n ratio in the denitrification desulfurization process can increase the s0 transformation ratio to as high as 80 dolejs et al 2015 bayrakdar et al 2016 for s0 separation granular sludge can be more efficient than activated sludge since the s can be added to the surface of granular sludge through accretion aiding its separation and recovery lin et al 2018 this approach is not unreasonable since sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob have been detected in anaerobic granular sludge anags and successfully acclimated for denitrification desulfurization applications this is an additional benefit of this approach since anags has a low acquisition cost and is common in wastewater treatment systems xu et al 2011 nanda et al 2013 consequently anags seems an appropriate source of biomass to be utilized for s0 recovery in a denitrification desulfurization reactor gaining an improved understanding of the microbial ecology associated with the denitrification desulfurization process is critical for improving its efficiency and robustness however the bacterial community connected with this process is ill defined and lacks detailed investigation into its underlying physiology especially relating to early steps occurring after inoculating with the anags thus investigation into the metabolic functions and contributions of functional microorganisms to the denitrification desulfurization process performance are needed in addition the increase of s n ratio via increasing sulfide concertation has previously been used to increase the s0 transformation ratio dolejs al 2015 however increases in sulfide can be stressful due to it toxicity but the response of communities to perturbations in influent sulfide concentrations is not well established lu et al 2018 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic based analyses of microbial communities can provide both community and functional insight without introducing amplification bias these approaches have been used in the comparison of taxonomic and functional profiles of the microbial communities associated with n2o production in denitrification reactors with differing ph zhuge et al 2020 to successfully build an ecological model of the microbial community in lab scale and full scale anammox based reactor speth et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 the study described here uses a similar approach to better understand the operation of a denitrifying s0 recovery granular sludge reactor inoculated with anaerobic granular sludge s0 was initially generated in the reactor and then separated into the effluent by backwash the aims of this work were to i explore the feasibility of the denitrifying s0 recovery granular sludge reactor to efficiently recover elemental sulfur ii identify the composition and contributions of the microbial community that developed during the operation of the reactor iii determine the microbial relationships between functional microorganisms and reveal the key roles that the functional groups play in the stability and performance of reactors 2 materials and methods 2 1 lab scale bioreactor setup and operation the continuously operated upflow bioreactor was a 1 25 l plexiglass reactor which had an effective height and inner diameter of 45 cm and 6 cm respectively zhuang et al 2020 the seed sludge was collected from the anaerobic granular sludge at a paper manufacturing wastewater treatment plant zhejiang china during its operational period 150 days the reactor was continuously fed with synthetic wastewater which contained the following per liter 22 mg of znso4 55 mg of cacl2 50 6 mg of mncl2 4h2o 11 mg of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 15 7 mg of cuso4 5h2o and 16 1 mg of cocl2 6h2o the only nitrogen source in the influent was kno3 at 40 mgn l 1 while sulfide was introduced by na2s the volatile suspended solids vss concentration was kept at 26 7 g l 1 through sludge retention time control the hydraulic retention time hrt ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentration were set as 6 h 8 0 0 4 30 c 0 1 mg l 1 respectively the s n molar ratio is recognized as a key parameter for increasing the s0 transformation ratio pokorna and zabranska 2015 in this study the reactor had 5 phases of operation defined by their s n ratios s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 7 2 8 2 changes in the ratio were achieved through a stepwise increase in sulfide concentration while the influent nitrate concentration remained at 40 mgn l 1 as shown in table 1 the steady state of each bioreactor was regarded as the point at which the fluctuations in the removal of sulfide nitrate and were within 5 for 5 days 2 2 chemical analysis during bioreactor operation both the influent and effluent were sampled daily to determine sulfide nitrite sulfate nitrate and thiosulfate concentrations apha 2005 the total concentration of sulfide h2s aq s2 and hs was determined by the methylene blue method trueper and schlegel 1964 immediately after sampling all samples were centrifuged at 10 000 r min 1 for 3 min tg16 yingtai china and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane pes pall china to obtain the su1pernatant for subsequent measurement the concentrations of nitrite sulfate nitrate and thiosulfate were determined using an ion chromatograph ics 1100 dionex usa the ph was measured using a ph meter hach hq40d nitrous oxide was determined using gas chromatograph gc2014c shimadzu as described in zhuge et al 2020 since the internal environment of the reactor was alkaline the main sulfur based compounds are sulfide elemental sulfur thiosulfate and sulfate so the mass balance to calculate produced elemental sulfur used was s0 influent s2 influent so4 2 influent s2o3 2 effluent s2 effluent so4 2 effluent s2o3 2 since the content of any other sulfur compound can be ignored the elemental sulfur transformation ratio was the proportion the generated s0 made up of the sulfide that was converted using the following formula elemental sulfur transformation ratio estr s0 influent s2 effluent s2 the effluent from the bioreactor was collected and then dried using a heating dryer to get

at the personalbio shanghai china to generate 150 nt paired end reads and the size of each sequencing data was larger than 12 gbp raw dna and rna sequences can be found the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under prjna692569 2 4 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample dna reads against a custom manually curated database of nitrogen cycle relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains 8 denitrifications key enzymes and 9 sulfur cycle key enzymes created as referred to li et al 2020 from all samples high quality metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance was determined as described in li et al 2018 the genomes were further dereplicated across the 3 time points into clusters at 95 average nucleotide identity ani taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using gtdb tk v1 1 0 chaumeil et al 2019 open reading frames orfs were predicted from bins using prodigal version 2 6 3 with default parameters hyatt et al 2010 annotation of the scaffolded genome bins was performed using ghostkoala version 2 2 against the kegg database kanehisa et al 2016 bbduk with default settings was used to predict relative abundance and expression of each mags based on the number of dna and rna reads mapping to the genome respectively li et al 2018 the phylogenetic tree was constructed using speciestreebuilder 0 1 0 at kbase the tree was modified using itol letunic and bork 2019 uncurated genome scale metabolic models were constructed by carveme with default m9 minimal medium with glucose machado et al 2018 metabolic resource overlap and metabolic interaction potential mip were determined using the approach described in machado et al 2021 3 results 3 1 bioreactor performance the denitrifying desulfurization granular sludge reactor was operated for 150 days during which there were five phases demarcated by changes in s n ratios s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 7 2 and 8 2 fig 1 in phases i iv s n 5 5 5 2 6 2 and 7 2 the tn removal efficiency was stable at 80 fig 1a and b during phase v s n 8 2 the tn efficiency declined to 40 during both phase iv and phase v the sulfide removal efficiency remained at a high level of 90 fig 1c interestingly the amount of elemental sulfur produced increased from 20 3 to 279 7 mgs l 1 over the entire operation period fig 1d neither thiosulfate or sulfite or the nitrogen end products nitrous oxide or ammonia were detected in the effluent during the whole experiment to gain insight into the flux of electrons into respiration or biomass the electron balance analysis was conducted the f s 0 the portion of electron into cell synthesis showed significant changes in phase v suggesting that the high sulfide concentration would potentially enhance carbon fixation table s3 these results indicate that the optimal s n molar ratio for s0 production was 7 2 raman spectra analysis showed that as the s n ratio increased the surface of the granular sludge became increasingly encrusted with s0 fig 2a by using the backwash approach it was clearly observed that the reactor effluent turned milky white and exhibited the dundal phenomenon chen et al 2016 fig 2b which is consistent with the characteristics of bio sulfur colloids as described previously marnocha et al 2019 xrd analysis of the residual solids obtained from dried effluent found an intensive peak having a diffraction angle of between 23 and 28 similar to the angle for a sulfur standard no 08 0247 suggesting the collected bio sulfur was high purity sulfur fig 2c xps analysis showed one peak at 163 6 164 0 ev consistent with a sulfur valence of 0 which suggested that the purity of collected bio sulfur was 92 5 huang et al 2017 fig 2d these results indicate that the anaerobic granular based techniques could easily recover high purity elemental sulfur from the bioreactor during operation at an optimal s n molar ratio 3 2 analysis of key genes for denitrification and sulfur cycle to gain insight into the physiological shifts occurring during reactor operation total rna was extracted from the sludge samples during phase iii iv and v expression of the key genes for denitrification and the sulfur cycle were measured using normalized read expression as a proxy for expression fig 3 the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene nap and membrane associated nitrate reductase gene nar are the key functional genes for dissimilatory nitrate reduction shapleigh 2013 and their expression pattern was phase iii phase iv phase v fig 3a this was somewhat surprising since the rate of nitrate reduction showed the opposite trend and was 60 lower in phase v than phase iv fig 1a the expression of cytochrome cd1 nitrite reductase gene nirs decreased by about 30 in phase v versus phase iv while the levels of the copper containing nitrite reductase gene nirk remained at low levels nitric oxide reduction genes cnorb and qnorz and nitrous oxide reduction genes noszii were in high expression levels in both phase iv and phase v indicating the potential for rapid reduction of no and n2o these results suggest that the expression of nitrogen related genes with perhaps the exception of nirs was not inhibited by increasing levels of sulfide enzymes associated with sulfide oxidation can be divided into two types the sox dependent enzyme complex which includes soxa soxb and soxc and the sox independent enzyme system which includes sqr fccb dsrb apra sat and sora the sox dependent system is responsible for direct one step sulfide oxidation s2 so4 2 while the sox independent enzyme carries out an indirect two step sulfide oxidation s2 s0 so4 2 poser et al 2014 results presented in fig 3b show that the expression of soxa soxb and soxc remained at relatively low values of 5 70 rpm during all phases which suggest the direct one step sulfide oxidation pathway was not preferred for the sox independent enzyme system flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase subunit b fccb and sulfide quinone reductase sqr are reported to be the key functional genes for oxidating sulfide to s0 sousa et al 2018 expression of fccb and sqr increased from 6 6 and 21 16 rpm respectively during phase iii to 26 5 and 646 84 rpm in phase v fig 3b these results demonstrate that the indirect two step sulfur oxidation was the dominant physiology associated with sulfide oxidation in all phases genes associated with s0 oxidation include the dissimilatory sulfate reductase gene dsr it is notable that while the expression of dsr increased gradually during reactor operation its average expression was still approximately 20 fold lower than that of sqr in both phase iv and v these results are consistent with the increase of detected s0 concentration in the effluent another notable trend in reactor performance was the decrease in sulfate in the effluent in the latter phases of operation sulfate adenylyltransferase gene sat and adenylylsulfate reductase gene apra are critical genes for sulfate reduction as can be seen in fig 3b the expression of apra and sat in phase v was 10 fold higher than in phase iv this result suggests that the reason for the effluent sulfate decrease is likely a result of sulfate reduction 3 3 microbial community analysis assembly of the reads from the phases iii iv and v generating a number of high quality completeness 70 contamination 10 draft metagenome assembled genomes mags from each sample fig 4 taxonomy of each of the mags was determined to assess their relatedness and their contribution to the community was assessed through mapping of dna reads and their transcriptional activity assessed through mapping of rna reads and these results are shown in fig 4 unexpectedly in phases iii and iv the most prevalent mag with the abundance 14 8 20 11 was a member of the archaea that gtdbtk assigned to the species level as methanothrix soehngenii by both ani and pplacer the phylogenetic tree shown in fig 5 also includes methanothrix soehngenii showing the high level of identity between it and the mag from the reactor this organism has been shown to be an acetoclastic methanogen huser et al 1982 the occurrence of this type of methanogenesis is unexpected since no fixed carbon is present in the influent the prevalence of this bacterium decreased markedly in phase v likely because of high sulfide zhang et al 2018 reads from this organism were also scarce in the rna reads but it seems unlikely it would be maintained at such a high proportion of the community if it were metabolically inactive the next most commonly occurring mags were sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob sob were gradually enriched and eventually become the dominant bacteria in phase v increasing from 1 74 to 38 89 of the community as indicated by read mapping fig 4 the majority of sob identified here encode the incomplete sox dependent enzyme complex genes indicating they cannot produce sulfate via the sox pathway however s0 producing functional genes fccb or sqr were distributed into all sob genomes these results were consistent with an 80 0 s0 transformation ratio during phases iv and v sulfate reducing bacteria srb were found in the reactor although they remained at a low abundance 0 2 2 1 the sob which were either complete or near complete denitrifiers were transcriptionally active suggesting electrons from sulfide oxidation were passed to nitrogen oxides to generate atp fig 5 most of this group also contained the gene encoding the co2 fixation protein ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco rubisco was not found in any of the other mags that were predominant in the community suggesting this group was also responsible for a significant portion of the co2 fixation this distribution likely reflects the energetic advantages associated with sulfide dependent respiration since the calvin cycle requires substantial atp and nadph input organisms using the wood ljungdahl pathway of fixation typically operate near the thermodynamic limit for growth and so would not be expected to be a major source of co2 fixation in this system a few mags had the gene needed to make proteins allowing co2 fixation via the wood ljungdahl pathway but they were not prominent in the community of any phase the acetate used to support acetoclastic methanogenesis typically arises via fermentation since its production during fermentation increases atp yield wolfe 2005 within the mags were two groups that are the likely source of acetate one group were predicted to be members of the family tissierellaceae and their genomes contained glycine reductase which is used in the stickland fermentation and produces acetate as an end product neumann et al 2019 these organisms were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active suggesting they were a critical source of acetate the other group were taxonomically assigned as members of the acholeplasmatales the mags of this group have relatively small genomes and are incapable of respiration like other members of this family siewert et al 2014 they do contain a complete glycolytic pathway as well as the genes required for acetate production from pyruvate indicating these reactions are likely sources of acetate since other pathways of atp production were not obvious as with the stickland mags this group of mags were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active fig 4 a number of mags were taxonomically assigned as members of the anaerolineales but their metabolism was difficult to determine based on the available information this group also included a number of transcriptionally active organisms all the mags that were assigned here as acholeplasmatales and tissierellaceae mags had small genomes the average size of the genomes of the members of the acholeplasmatales was 1 4 106 bases pairs and the tissierellaceae was 2 0 106 by comparison the average sob genome was 3 0 106 base pairs given the influent contains no fixed carbon it is unexpected to find so many mags with reduced genomes as expected uncurated genome scale metabolic models gems found that on average 79 gap fill reactions were required to allow growth of the acholeplasmatales mags on minimal media with glucose by comparison only 2 gap fill reactions were required to allow growth of the sob mags this common occurrence of organisms with small genomes and numerous auxotrophies indicates the microbial community in this reactor has an overall cooperative metabolism machado et al 2021 this conclusion was supported by a flux simulation of mags from major members of the community which gave a small metabolic resource overlap mro score of 0 56 indicative of organisms not competing for common resources as well as a relatively high metabolic interaction potential mip of 10 by comparison modeling of a community with just unique mags in the srb and sob gave an mro of 0 76 and no indication of metabolic exchange 4 discussion in this study an efficient denitrifying desulfurization granular sludge reactor was built and the s0 transformation ratio and loading rate of this system reached 94 5 and 1 06 kg s m 3 d 1 respectively the s0 generated was easily separated from the reactor through backwashing fig 2b providing an alternative approach for solving issues related to the difficulties of efficient recovery of elemental sulfur in a biotreatment system cai et al 2017 in addition the recovered elemental sulfur was 92 pure giving it a high utilization value in previous studies the optimal s n ratios for higher elemental sulfur transformation ratio were generally controlled within the range of 5 3 5 2 which is not suitable for removal of sulfide and recovery of elemental sulfur in wastewater with high sulfide concentrations dolejs et al 2015 lin et al 2018 however in this reactor the sulfide removal rate and s0 recovery ratio could be maintained at s n ratios as high as 7 2 this research could extend the application of the technology of denitrification dependent elemental sulfur recovery based on inoculating with anaerobic granular sludge the removal of tn was also efficient during most phases with the majority being removed during the first three phases phase i iv however when influent s2 was increased from 314 6 to 352 1 mgs l 1 in phase v the tn removal rate decreased by 70 fig 1 the concentration of influent s2 in phase v was higher than reported inhibitory threshold levels for denitrification which were in the range of 200 300 mgs l 1 cardoso et al 2010 which may account for the relatively lower nitrogen removal efficiency in phase v however the expression levels of functional genes for nitrate reduction did not decrease fig 3 one possibility is that sulfide inhibited microbial activity through directly reacting with metals cofactor of denitrification enzymes lu et al 2018 the sulfide oxidation rate showed no obvious suppression as a result of high sulfide concentrations even in phase v fig 1 in recent work kinetic analyses found that the sulfide oxidation followed monod type kinetics which indicated higher sulfide concentrations would not significantly inhibit sulfide oxidation as long as the sulfide concentration range was below 1800 mgs l 1 lu et al 2018 in addition the conversion rate of s0 linearly increased and approximately conformed to first order kinetics equation in this study which suggested that activity of the s0 producing enzymes were not a limiting factor this deduction was supported by the high expression levels of sqr encoded s0 producing enzyme sqr fig 3 which is less susceptible for high levels of sulfide klok et al 2013 hence sqr was mainly responsible for the high sulfide removal and s0 producing rate in this reactor sulfate the other main sulfide oxidative product remained at a constant concentration in the effluent during the first three phases but its concentration significantly decreased by 83 1 in phase v however the expression levels of the genes encoded sox dependent enzyme complex were not significantly decreased in phase v fig 3 it is uncertain if this occurred due to the inhibition of sulfide on the sox dependent pathway however another possibility is that for the observed decreased was that sulfate reduction increased since the key genes for sulfate reduction have a significant increase in expression at high sulfide concentrations metagenome assembly yielded a number of high quality mags that were unexpectedly phylogenetically and physiologically diverse fig 4 as expected there were sulfide oxidizing denitrifiers but there were also methanogens sulfur oxidizers and a wide array of mags from organisms that appear to be fermenters this diversity is somewhat unexpected given there is no fixed carbon in the influent methanogens unexpectedly dominated in phase iii and iv but their abundance decreased dramatically in phase v likely due to sulfide inhibition fig 4 at the same time the sob which encoded rubisco and sqr were gradually enriched and eventually dominant in phase v organisms that appear to ferment the fixed carbon to acetate for methanogens were not highly represented in the community but were transcriptionally quite active especially in phase iii and iv metagenomic and transcriptomics analyses suggest a potential role for the dominant members of the microbial community which were integrated in a genome based model of the reactor fig 6 in this model the sulfide oxidizers play two critical roles i oxidizing sulfide and ii fixing carbon the energetics associated with denitrification dependent sulfide oxidation is sufficient to fix significant amounts of carbon via the calvin cycle this fixed carbon is then used by other bacteria as both a carbon and energy source a good example of the latter is the occurrence of bacteria who apparently are generating atp via the stickland fermentation using glycine reductase the acetate generated from this reaction as well as from other fermentative bacteria is likely what accounts for the high level of methanogens in the reactor in phases iii and iv one of the archaeal mags is nearly identical to the previously characterized methanothrix soehngenii which is an acetoclastic methanogen huser et al 1982 prevalence of methanogens decreased dramatically in phase v it is uncertain what happens to the acetate during phase v since the apb remained active in this phase recent work has shown that complex microbial ecosystems can be approximated as being cooperative and competitive with the former having non overlapping resource requirements and the latter being highly competitive for common resources machado et al 2021 ecological theory suggests that the cooperative systems better tolerate resource shifts it seems likely the complex community in the bioreactor described here is cooperative which is important for making this system robust to changes in influent as shown by its overall performance stability during each phase except during the latter stages of phase v 5 conclusion this study establishes an efficient denitrification s0 production bioreactor based on inoculating with anaerobic granular sludge in the reactor 80 of the influent sulfide was converted to high quality element sulfur with a purity of 92 5 and 80 of the total nitrogen was removed at an optimal s n molar ratio of 7 2 the expression level of sulfide quinone reductase gene sqr was significantly higher than that of dsr which is consistent with the high sulfide removal rate and s0 transformation ratio tn removal efficiency significantly decreased in phase v but unexpectedly this was not a result of the inhibition of the expression of denitrification related genes by excess sulfide metagenomics binning analysis confirmed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob utilizing sulfide quinone reductase sqr were the principal members of the community driving sulfide oxidation these bacteria were part of a large metabolically complex community that likely was critical for the overall performance stability of the reactor under changing conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgment this work was supported by

16694,long term trends in riverine nutrient availability have rarely been linked to both phytoplankton composition and functioning to explore how the changing availability of n and p affects not only phytoplankton abundance and composition but also the resource use efficiency of n p and co2 a 25 year time series of water quality in the lower han river korea was combined with additional measurements of riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and co2 despite persistent eutrophication recent decreases in p relative to n have been steep in the lowest reach increasing the annual mean mass ratio of n to p n p from 24 1994 2015 to 65 2016 2018 while chl a and cyanobacterial abundance exhibited overall positive and inverse relationships with p concentrations and n p respectively severe harmful algal blooms habs concurred with short term increases in p and temperature microcystis often dominated habs at low n p that usually favors n fixing cyanobacteria such as anabaena in the middle and lower reaches phytoplanktonic p use efficiency was typically lower at low n p v shaped relationships between n p and co2 concentrations together with longitudinal upward shifts in the inverse relationship between chl a and co2 implied that eutrophication enhanced phytoplankton biomass could turn into a significant source of co2 after passing a threshold the combined results suggest that cyanobacterial dominance co limited by p availability and temperature can lower planktonic p use efficiency while enhancing riverine co2 emissions at low n p ratios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon dioxide dissolved organic carbon harmful algal bloom phytoplankton community resource use efficiency river eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication of inland waters has become a global phenomenon as a consequence of increasing urbanization and agricultural expansion conley et al 2009 glibert 2017 ho et al 2019 eutrophic inland waters are often plagued by harmful algal blooms habs with adverse environmental and ecological consequences such as increased turbidity and hypoxia and disrupted food webs paerl 1988 various strategies have been proposed to control habs conley et al 2009 paerl and otten 2013 focusing on p as the primary limiting nutrient in freshwater systems schindler 1977 although this p only strategy has been partly successful in controlling eutrophication and habs in some freshwater systems schindler et al 2008 recent findings have suggested that both n and p need to be reduced to control habs in inland waters experiencing stages of eutrophication and re oligotrophication conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2011 ibáñez and peñuelas 2019 unbalanced reduction of p relative to n may increase the ratio of n to p n p as observed in some inland water systems oelsner and stets 2019 therefore a mechanistic understanding of eutrophication and habs should also consider the relative availability and chemical speciation of n as the primary or complementary factors affecting the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities paerl et al 2011 watson et al 2016 gilbert 2017 the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been a central topic of ecological research in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tilman et al 1996 cardinale et al 2006 thompson et al 2018 the prevailing paradigm states that increased species diversity enhances ecosystem functioning such as primary productivity and nutrient use efficiency tilman et al 1996 hooper et al 2005 resource use efficiency rue is often defined as the proportion of available resources that is incorporated into biomass hodapp et al 2019 the positive relationship between biodiversity and rue has been based on a hypothesis of more efficient nutrient use through niche diversification in more diverse ecosystems connell 1978 however contrasting relationships have been found between species richness or evenness and rue in various freshwater and coastal phytoplankton communities ptacnik et al 2008 filstrup et al 2014 frank et al 2020 for instance ptacnik et al 2008 found a positive relationship between phytoplankton species richness and rue in more than 3000 lake samples whereas filstrup et al 2014 revealed an inverse relationship between phytoplankton evenness and rue based on 9 year monitoring of plankton communities in 131 lakes given the global expansion of habs their role in the carbon dynamics of aquatic ecosystems deserves special attention almeida et al 2016 demars et al 2016 recent global syntheses have shown that many rivers worldwide are supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium as a result of heterotrophic co2 production exceeding autotrophic co2 consumption raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 although the longitudinal increase in the ratio of gross primary production to ecosystem respiration from headwater streams to medium sized rivers was hypothesized as part of the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 however some recent studies have highlighted the role of phytoplankton as a primary sink of co2 in eutrophic river systems crawford et al 2016 demars et al 2016 engel et al 2020 on the other hand dissolved organic matter dom derived from phytoplankton can enhance bacterial respiration and subsequently co2 emissions in both reservoirs and rivers guillemette et al 2016 almeida et al 2016 begum et al 2019 anaerobic conditions created by the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass can also enhance methanogenesis in eutrophic lake sediments zhang et al 2021 although the effect of nutrient imbalance on algal photosynthesis has been widely studied in various aquatic systems striebel et al 2009 demars et al 2016 few studies have investigated co2 dynamics in the context of phytoplankton diversity and functioning in eutrophic river systems under changing nutrient availability the primary objective of this study was to examine the responses of phytoplankton composition and functioning to long term changes in the relative availability of n and p in the lower han river korea as a consequence of wastewater pollution and subsequent pollution control over the last decades specifically we tested the hypothesis that despite the long term declining nutrient levels the dominance of a few harmful cyanobacterial species lowers phytoplanktonic rue when short term increases in the availability of p relative to n coincide with other favorable environmental conditions such as high water temperature we also evaluated the role of phytoplankton biomass as a potential source of labile dom and hence co2 in the eutrophic river it was assumed that co2 released from organic matter degradation would exceed phytoplankton co2 uptake after passing a threshold biomass to achieve the two study goals a 25 year time series of water quality in the lower han river from 1994 to 2018 was complemented with an additional monitoring of riverine dom and co2 from july 2017 to december 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the han river 494 km in length drains a basin area of 34 128 km2 which covers 35 of south korea seoul metropolitan government 2017 two main branches the north han river and south han river feed into the pal dang dam from which the lower han river flows 85 km westward traversing the seoul metropolitan area before discharging into the yellow sea fig 1 the land cover of the han river changes longitudinally with forest dominated upper reaches gradually converting to urbanized areas along the middle and lower reaches the flow of the lower han river is regulated by upstream cascade dams and two submerged weirs 873 m or 1007 m wide built at the eastern and western ends of the city of seoul fig 1 the two weirs maintain the water level above 2 m throughout the year weir construction has substantially increased water retention time during the dry period lowering flow velocity below 0 05 m s 1 from a mean velocity of 0 9 m s 1 during the monsoon season jung et al 2014 the increased water retention time creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton as the dominant primary producer including three major classes bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae seoul metropolitan government 2017 six major tributaries and effluents from four major wastewater treatment plants wwtps treating sewage from the city of seoul feed into the lower han river these four wwtps discharge 4 401 530 m3 day 1 of effluents after tertiary treatments following the modified ludzack ettinger mle and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o processes yoon et al 2017 out of the 1454 8 mm mean annual precipitation from 2006 to 2015 approximately 70 was concentrated in the months from june to september 2 2 long term data analysis monthly water quality data were collected at 11 sites in the lower han river as part of the national water quality monitoring program operated by the ministry of environment fig 1 to describe longitudinal variations in water quality along the lower han river the 11 sites were grouped into three reaches up hr1 hr4 mid hr5 hr8 and down hr9 hr11 while the four up sites are located between a large dam and the upper weir the four mid and three down sites are sandwiched between the upper and lower weirs that demarcate the lower han river traversing the seoul metropolitan area we expected that water quality at the four up sites would be directly influenced by the dam discharge while the mid and down sites would increasingly reflect cumulative effects of the urban tributaries draining the metropolitan area along the river we analyzed the water quality data monitored from january 1994 to december 2018 including flow water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn no3 n nh4 n total phosphorus tp total dissolved

been monitored since 2001 habs monitoring started in 2010 including the cell counting of each of four major cyanobacterial genera anabaena aphanizomenon oscillatoria and microcystis from 2015 on the cyanobacterial data were available for nine sites hr1 to hr9 only therefore only the data from hr9 constituted the down dataset precipitation and air temperature data were obtained from the korea meteorological administration 2 3 monthly co2 monitoring the concentrations of surface water co2 and ancillary water quality components were measured monthly from july 2017 to august 2018 and bimonthly from august 2018 to december 2018 at three sites hr5 hr8 and hr11 water samples were collected at 20 cm below the surface away from a jetty hr5 and hr11 or the riverbank of an island hr8 the manual headspace equilibration method was used to measure the concentration of dissolved co2 in surface water yoon et al 2017 water samples were filtered through pre combusted gf f glass fiber filters

water and gas analyses have been reported elsewhere jin et al 2018 2 4 calculations and statistical analyses the rue of n ruen and p ruep was calculated as the ratio of phytoplankton biomass chl a or cyanobacterial cell concentrations to the resource availability n p or co2 concentrations following ptacnik et al 2008 the rue was calculated as follows r u e c h l a m g m 3 o r c y a n o b a c t e r

ecosystem functioning hodapp et al 2015 species evenness also responds more sensitively to anthropogenic perturbations than species richness chapin et al 2000 therefore we calculated pielou s evenness index as a measure of genus level evenness of the four monitored cyanobacterial genera the evenness index was complemented with the ratio of anabaena to microcystis a to m ratio pielou s evenness index j was calculated as j h h m a x where h is shannon s diversity index and hmax is the maximum diversity in the system when species are equally distributed j values were calculated only when two

followed by the student newman keuls test as a post hoc analysis to compare significant differences in means among the sites or reaches linear regression analysis was conducted to examine long term trends in n p n p and chl a pearson s correlation analysis was conducted between the log transformed datasets of nutrient indices rue chl a and cyanobacterial cell concentrations regression analysis

variations in chl a and the abundance of the two dominant cyanobacterial genera anabaena and microsystis during hab alert periods when chl a concentrations exceed 15 mg m 3 given data availability and

variations among the three reaches up mid and down anova on rank p 0 05 fig 2 tables s1 s2 over the last 25 years the annual mean concentrations of tp displayed significant declining trends in all three reaches while those of tn significantly declined only in the down reach fig 2 at the down sites tp concentrations decreased from 0 31 mg l 1 in 2015 to 0 09 mg l 1 in 2018 fig 2c outpacing the rather moderate decrease in tn concentrations fig 2b thereby resulting in a large increase in n p from 22 in 2015 to 74 in 2018 fig 2d as a result of this recent increase from 2015 onwards n p at the down sites approached the levels found at the up and mid sites which showed gradual increasing trends in n p over the entire monitoring period p 0 05 fig 2d chl a concentration also increased significantly along the river fig 2e table s1 while the annual mean chl a concentration did not show any significant long term trend across the three reaches the extreme hab event in july 2015 150 500

cyanobacterial genera were monitored at hr9 microcystis represented the most dominant genus accounting for 83 of the total cyanobacterial cells on average fig 3 table s3 anabaena sp was the second most abundant genus with an average proportion of 10 chl a concentrations had a significant positive correlation with both tn and tp concentrations from hr6 to hr11 but a negative correlation with n p from hr7 to hr9 fig 4 a the correlation of anabaena cells with p concentrations and n p was significantly positive and negative respectively and became stronger along the lower reach from hr6 to hr9 in contrast anabaena was negatively correlated with tn concentrations at sites hr2 and hr4 fig 4b microcystis only exhibited significant correlations with tn tp and n p at hr9 fig 4c forward stepwise regression analyses revealed important environmental factors controlling variations in chl a anabaena and microcystis at sites hr6 hr9 during the periods of hab alert chl a 15 mg m 3 from 2015 to 2018 table 1 the most significant model predicted up to 44 9 of the total variance in chl a concentration 29 0 of which was attributed to tn concentrations followed by do 6 1 and n p 4 2 the best regression model for anabaena explained 30 1 of the total variance with po4 3 p 22 4 and precipitation 7 7 as primary variables the best regression model explained up to 53 9 of the variance in microcystis abundance attributed mainly to po4 3 p 19 7 water temperature 8 8 and tn 8 2 table 1 when the same data set was analyzed by pca many cyanobacterial indices microcystis anabaena microcystis and total cyanobacterial cells exhibited relatively high covariance with p indices whereas chl a was close to the cluster of n indices fig s1 cyanobacterial evenness along with anabaena and the ratio of anabaena to microcystis displayed orthogonal relationships with cyanobacteria abundance monthly n p ratios and chl a concentrations showed weak but significant non linear relationships left skewed log normal peaks for up r2 0 046 p 0 05 and mid r2 0 131 p 0 0001 sites and for all sites r2 0 065 p 0 0001 fig 5 a peak chl a concentrations around a narrow range of n p tended to shift toward lower n p values along the river the annual means of n p and chl a exhibited significant inverse relationships for the mid r2 0 294 p 0 05 and all sites r2 0 530 p 0 0001 for the latter relationship the down sites represented the lowest n p values except for the three most recent years when n p increased substantially fig 5b across the reaches cyanobacterial abundance peaked at different ranges of n

nutrient controls on phytoplankton abundance the observed spatiotemporal trends in tn and tp fig 2 emphasize urban tributaries carrying wwtp effluents as a critical component of the anthropogenic biogeochemical fluxes in the lower han river yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 while the highest nutrient levels observed at the most downstream site reflected the cumulative impacts of upstream wastewater effluents and urban runoffs on the mainstem water quality the long term trends also revealed substantial reductions in nutrient inputs particularly of p as a consequence of effluent water quality control over recent years in 2012 the korean government imposed a stricter regulation on effluent water quality by strengthening the water quality standard for tp from 2 mg l 1 to 0 2 mg l 1 to respond to the 2015 hab event the seoul metropolitan government enforced wwtps to adopt or upgrade to advanced treatment technologies such as submerged biological aerated filters sbaf and modified ludzack ettinger mle processes kim et al 2017 however the standard for tn was maintained at 20 mg l 1 conforming to the conventional p only strategy schindler et al 2008 tp fluxes have been declining in many rivers across europe north america and some parts of asia over the last few decades eea 2019 oelsner and stets 2019 for instance a majority of european rivers now transport less than 0 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 which is an order of magnitude lower than the high tp yield of the ganges river 5 8 kg p ha 1 yr 1 as a result of a decadal reduction in p loads the annual average concentration of tp in european rivers decreased to 0 06 mg l 1 in 2016 eea 2019 as observed in this study fig 2 n p has been increasing in other river systems in the usa stow et al 2001 oelsner and stets 2019 and the yangtze river in china li et al 2014 while the increased n p ratios observed in these rivers are usually associated with the relative increases in fertilizer derived n compared to the decreasing or constant levels of p our finding of a greater reduction of p than n in wwtps can have significant implications for predicting eutrophication and habs in other urbanized river systems undergoing different phases of wastewater induced pollution and its subsequent control despite a large decrease in the annual tp concentration to 0 09 mg l 1 resulting in a high n p ratio 74 at site hr11 a moderate hab event occurred in 2018 fig 3 similar phenomena were also observed in the early 2000s in the huron river usa lehman 2007 a recent study revealed that intensive microcystis blooms could recur in the downstream river of the lake okeechobee florida usa despite the partial success in eutrophication control focusing on p reduction kramer et al 2018 these studies on river eutrophication support the suggestion based on the study of habs in eutrophic lakes such as lake taihu china that tp concentrations should be maintained below a threshold as low as 0 05 mg l 1 to prevent microcystis dominated blooms in freshwater reservoirs xu et al 2015 this implies that tp concentrations in the lower han river might not be low enough to prevent cyanobacterial habs although the threshold level is yet to be determined for flow controlled river systems although p concentrations appear to be the most significant predictor of cyanobacterial abundance along the middle to lowest reaches of the lower han river fig 4 the variations in cyanobacterial abundance can be better explained by including n concentrations n p and hydroclimatic variables in multiple regressions table 1 the hab events in 2015 and 2018 also illustrate the co limitation of nutrients and hydroclimates on cyanobacterial dominance figs 3 s1 s2 both experimental and observational studies have shown that resource partioning among cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton groups is not only affected by nutrient availability but also by hydroclimatic conditions such as flow velocity cardinale 2011 and temperature paerl and otten 2013 the timing and forms of bioavailable p in complex interactions with short term changes in n availability temperature and other hydroclimatic factors have been found to be crucial to the recurrence of habs dominated by microcystis in lake erie watson et al 2016 and lake taihu paerl et al 2011 the growing evidence that both n and p synergistically control algal blooms in stream and rivers has also corroborated the limitation of p only strategy dodds et al 2002 johnson et al 2009 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 the peak concentrations of chl a around a range of n p observed in the long term time series fig 5 and during the additional co2 monitoring fig 8 imply that the balanced supply of n and p within a certain optimal range can be more important for phytoplankton abundance than the absolute availability of each nutrient in a laboratory experiment with assembled freshwater communities frank et al 2020 also found that phytoplankton biomass peaked at a similar range of n p with a mean value of 23 the log normal relationships between n p and chl a figs 5 8 conform to the famous howard odum s formula depicting power as a function of load odum and pinkerton 1955 the maximum phytoplankton abundance power occurs at the narrow intermediate range of the relative availability of n to p load the dominance of microcystis observed in the lower han river fig 3 is not consistent with past studies that found the dominance of n fixing anabaena under sufficient p availability stockner and shortreed 1988 and microcystis taking advantage of available n and warm temperatures in summer sabour et al 2009 this species level difference in limiting nutrients highlights the limitation of the p only paradigm in controlling habs in eutrophic river systems undergoing rapid changes in nutrient availability glibert 2017 in line with the results of stepwise regressions table 1 and pca fig s1 the dominance of microcystis at low n p depends on multiple environmental factors beyond nutrient availability microcystis species have been shown to have competitive advantages to other taxa in higher temperatures robarts and zohary 1987 and under specific bloom conditions where they can utilize resources through their capacity of buoyancy reynolds et al 1981 stepwise multiple regressions table 1 could not include flow due to limited data availability as a contributing factor for the observed temporal variations in the cyanobacterial dominance fig 3 however the relatively low flows observed during the large hab events in 2015 and 2018 fig s4 suggest that the increased water retention time during low flow periods can facilitate the occurrence of habs under favorable environmental conditions consistent with a previous study that found a greater phytoplankton abundance in the lower han river during the dry season compared to weakened phytoplankton communities under high flow conditions jung et al 2014 varying light conditions might also have affected the observed short term variations in the abundance and composition of habs fig 3 previous studies have shown that light intensity often combined with temperature can co limit the growth and interspecific competition of microcystis and other harmful algae li et al 2012 chaffin et al 2018 buoyant cyanobacteria such as microcystis are known to have competitive advantages over non buoyant competitors in light limited waters chaffin et al 2018 4 2 shifting cyanobacterial composition and rue under changing n and p availability in accordance with our hypothesis the dominance of microcystis across a narrow range of low n p and resulting decreases in cyanobacterial evenness fig 6 had adverse consequences for nutrient use efficiency as illustrated by the weak but significant positive relationships between cyanobacterial evenness and the rue of both n and p fig 7 previous field and laboratory studies have reported weak to strong inverse relationships between nutrient availability and species evenness gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 hillebrand and lehmpfuhl 2011 filstrup et al 2014 however we found only weak negative correlations between n species tn tdn and no3 and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 the insignificant correlation between tp and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 suggests that the species evenness of highly dynamic phytoplankton communities may not be determined by a single limiting nutrient but by a complex array of environmental conditions that vary across spatial and temporal scales lehtinen et al 2017 the negative correlation between flow and the ratio of anabaena to microcystis fig s2 combined with the strong inverse relationship between microcystis and the evenness index fig 6c implies that the dominance of microcystis at low flows often coupled with short term increases in tp levels as observed in the 2015 hab event fig 3 may play a critical role in determining species evenness in the eutrophic river similar to microcystis dominated phytoplankton communities in eutrophic lakes paerl et al 2011 watson et al 2016 although n p did not have any significant correlation with cyanobacterial evenness the significant correlations of n p with the abundance and proportion of microcystis figs 4 s2 indicated some indirect relationship between n p and cyanobacterial evenness fig 6 in an experiment with assembled freshwater phytoplankton communities gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 found the lowest evenness under the most imbalanced supply of limiting nutrients n p ratio 2 although there was no clear relationship between species evenness and the availability or ratio of n and p in agreement with the common inverse relationships between phytoplankton evenness and biomass gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 lehtinen et al 2017 increased cyanobacterial cells and microcystis at lower n p ratios fig 6 may be partly responsible for the inverse relationship between n p and chl a fig 5b given the high proportions of microcystis observed during the severe hab events in the lower han river fig 3 the monopolization of the phytoplankton community by a single or a few species at low n p ratios can lead to disproportionate increases in phytoplankton biomass despite lowered evenness hillebrand et al 2007 while several studies have reported opposing relationships between rue and species diversity or evenness in various freshwater and coastal systems hillebrand et al 2008 filstrup et al 2014 hodapp et al 2015 lehtinen et al 2017 the weak but significant positive relationships between cyanobacterial evenness and both ruen and ruep measured across the lower han river fig 7 suggest that the frequent dominance of cyanobacterial species particularly microcystis can exert adverse effects on the functioning of phytoplankton in the highly eutrophic river in accordance with the biodiversity ecosystem functioning paradigm hooper et al 2005 ptacnik et al 2008 cardinale 2011 the contradictory findings might partly have resulted from the neglect of the fact that a few dominant species have disproportionate roles in ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient use efficiency hillebrand et al 2008 in the lower han river microcystis seems to play a dominant role in lowering the rue of the whole phytoplankton community in contrast anabaena contributed positively to cyanobacterial evenness as indicated by the significant positive relationship between anabaena and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 the significant positive relationship between n p and ruep observed across the reaches fig 7b suggests that the abundant p in the eutrophic han river may not be efficiently used by the cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton community this lowered rue implies that the dominance of a few cyanobacterial species may reduce opportunities for resource partitioning among other phytoplankton species while it is also likely that replete phytoplankton species do not need to use excess p as efficiently as under limited p availability downward shifts in the relationship along the river reflect p surplus above a certain threshold for balanced resource partitioning as observed in the artificially assembled phytoplankton communities gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 frank et al 2020 some microcystis species such as m aeruginosa are known to have a greater ruep than other taxa reynolds et al 1981 filstrup et al 2014 the observed dominance of microcystis species in the lower han river fig 3 illustrates the high capacity of microcystis to adapt to the p rich environment however the dominance of microcystis in the lower han river is not consistent with the usual dominance of the n fixing anabaena species over microcystis with decreasing n p mulholland 2007 schindler et al 2008 as aforementioned explaining the competitive balance between anabaena and microcystis should take into consideration not only the absolute availability of n and p but also the stoichiometric relationships between n and p as well as other factors such as temperature and flow frank et al 2020 the negative or insignificant relationships between n p ratio and ruen fig 8a imply that the n fixing anabaena species may be preferred under conditions of high p availability at low n p thereby also providing microcystis with n leaked from the n fixing process mulholland 2007 this kind of positive interaction between n fixing and other cyanobacteria can enhance ruen at low n p however we need to further investigate whether the observed dominance of microcystis in the han river can be attributed to the additional supply of n from n fixing cyanobacterial species or temporary increases in n derived from external sources it is also unclear whether the dominance of microcystis depends on its adaptability to other environmental conditions such as high water temperature as illustrated by the significant correlations between water temperature and the absolute or relative abundance of microcystis fig s2 maximal growth rates of microcystis and other surface bloom forming cyanobacterial species have often been observed at high temperatures primarily due to their capacity to adapt to hot surface water conditions paerl et al 2011 paerl and otten 2013 if temperature and other environmental conditions are more important for the occurrence of microcystis dominated habs than the absolute or relative availability of n and p it would be too presumptive to predict that the recent trend in n p fig 2 might lead to less frequent occurrences of habs 4 3 the role of phytoplankton in riverine c dynamics in agreement with other studies that have attributed the lowered emissions of co2 to enhanced primary production in eutrophic freshwater systems gu et al 2011 almeida et al 2016 demars et al 2016 chl a and co2 showed inverse relationships across the lower han river fig 8a however the upward shifts in the relationship between co2 and chl a along the han river fig 8a indicate an enhanced turnover of labile dom derived from phytoplankton biomass as a source of riverine co2 emission from the eutrophic system kaplan and bott 1982 yoon et al 2017 the dom from algal extracellular release generally consists of labile materials with lower molecular weights compared to allochthonous high molecular weight dom kaplan and bott 1982 guillemette et al 2016 the relatively low co2 concentrations at the up sites indicate an active phytoplankton uptake of co2 consistent with previous findings of enhanced primary production in the upstream dams and discharged waters jin et al 2018 upward shifts in the negative relationship between co2 and chl a concentration along the lower han river indicate the production of additional co2 molecules from om degradation fluorescent dom components derived from cyanobacterial biomass as identified by the parafac components characteristic of algal dom murphy et al 2011 were reflected in the increased intensities of protein like fluorescence c2 along the lower han river table 2 fig s5 the parabola shaped relationship between n p and chl a showed chl a peaks across the wide range of n p ratio from 25 to 80 at three sites fig 8b which might be considered as an optimal range of n p for phytoplankton growth in each reach although the parabola shaped relationship was not significant at the most downstream site hr11 the downstream shift in the peak chl a toward the lower n p values implies that the longitudinally increasing level of eutrophication may have differentiated the optimal n p ratio along the lower han river despite the relatively short distance the lowest concentrations of co2 and doc around the same range of n p fig 8c d indicate active co2 uptake by the growing phytoplankton biomass within the narrow range of n p in each reach the insignificant relationship between n p and co2 at the most downstream hr11 fig 8c combined with the strongly significant relationship between n and co2 fig s6b suggests that in the most downstream reach there may be a threshold of n across which co2 concentrations either increase or decrease in contrast no significant relationship between tp and co2 is consistent with the dampened relationship between n p and co2 presumably due to the confounding effects of tributary inputs and in stream processes that increase longitudinally toward the river mouth outside of the optimal n p range the phytoplankton biomass may release labile materials that are highly biodegradable and hence easily converted to co2 guillemette et al 2016 sinking debris of phytoplankton has also been suggested to enhance the burial of organic carbon in sediments downing et al 2008 taken together enhanced carbon fixation at the narrow n p range in short river reaches might minimize the extracellular release of co2 and doc but across other n p ranges phytoplankton biomass may function as significant sources of om and co2 in eutrophic river systems the two monitoring sites hr 8 and hr 11 located in the middle to lower sections of the highly eutrophic river were mostly supersaturated in co2 table 2 high loads of anthropogenic dom from wwtps can stimulate co2 production from the labile dom during downstream transport yoon et al 2017 previous studies in the lower han river have identified wwtps as a primary external source of doc and co2 yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 studies conducted in eutrophic impounded rivers have suggested that the impacted system can act either as a source or sink of co2 depending on the prevailing hydroclimatic conditions for instance high precipitation events can turn the system into a co2 sink whereas longer retention time creates a favorable condition for phytoplankton co2 uptake pacheco et al 2015 although the complex relationships between habs and riverine emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs make it challenging to observe a consistent pattern for the effects of habs on ghg emissions some recent studies have revealed increased emissions of ghgs especially ch4 from eutrophic urban rivers jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 5 conclusions the 25 year water quality data emphasize the critical role of p availability and its relation to n n p in the spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton abundance and cyanobacterial dominance in the eutrophic lower han river however microcystis dominated habs continued to occur in recent years despite a drastic increase in n p driven by a large decrease in tp levels implying cyanobacterial responses to multiple factors including a reduced but still high p availability sustained high n availability warm temperature and low flow in the lowest reach which has the highest levels of p and lowest ratios of n p cyanobacterial dominance during habs tends to lower ruep because of reduced complementarity and consequently inefficient resource partitioning consistent with the prevailing biodiversity ecosystem functioning paradigm the observed increases in doc concentrations and pco2 at low n p ratios outside of the optimal range for chl a illustrate the potential contribution of phytoplankton biomass to riverine doc and co2 fluxes as a significant perturbation to ecosystem functioning in the eutrophic river that warrants further investigation to provide a mechanistic understanding of phytoplankton driven co2 dynamics the combined results suggest that predicting future changes in phytoplankton composition and functioning in the eutrophic river receiving decreasing nutrient loads would require a better understanding of the coupled constraints imposed by short term changes in nutrient availability and climatic conditions further research is required to elucidate the complex interplay between nutrient availability and climatic variability in limiting phytoplankton

16694,long term trends in riverine nutrient availability have rarely been linked to both phytoplankton composition and functioning to explore how the changing availability of n and p affects not only phytoplankton abundance and composition but also the resource use efficiency of n p and co2 a 25 year time series of water quality in the lower han river korea was combined with additional measurements of riverine dissolved organic carbon doc and co2 despite persistent eutrophication recent decreases in p relative to n have been steep in the lowest reach increasing the annual mean mass ratio of n to p n p from 24 1994 2015 to 65 2016 2018 while chl a and cyanobacterial abundance exhibited overall positive and inverse relationships with p concentrations and n p respectively severe harmful algal blooms habs concurred with short term increases in p and temperature microcystis often dominated habs at low n p that usually favors n fixing cyanobacteria such as anabaena in the middle and lower reaches phytoplanktonic p use efficiency was typically lower at low n p v shaped relationships between n p and co2 concentrations together with longitudinal upward shifts in the inverse relationship between chl a and co2 implied that eutrophication enhanced phytoplankton biomass could turn into a significant source of co2 after passing a threshold the combined results suggest that cyanobacterial dominance co limited by p availability and temperature can lower planktonic p use efficiency while enhancing riverine co2 emissions at low n p ratios graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon dioxide dissolved organic carbon harmful algal bloom phytoplankton community resource use efficiency river eutrophication 1 introduction eutrophication of inland waters has become a global phenomenon as a consequence of increasing urbanization and agricultural expansion conley et al 2009 glibert 2017 ho et al 2019 eutrophic inland waters are often plagued by harmful algal blooms habs with adverse environmental and ecological consequences such as increased turbidity and hypoxia and disrupted food webs paerl 1988 various strategies have been proposed to control habs conley et al 2009 paerl and otten 2013 focusing on p as the primary limiting nutrient in freshwater systems schindler 1977 although this p only strategy has been partly successful in controlling eutrophication and habs in some freshwater systems schindler et al 2008 recent findings have suggested that both n and p need to be reduced to control habs in inland waters experiencing stages of eutrophication and re oligotrophication conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2011 ibáñez and peñuelas 2019 unbalanced reduction of p relative to n may increase the ratio of n to p n p as observed in some inland water systems oelsner and stets 2019 therefore a mechanistic understanding of eutrophication and habs should also consider the relative availability and chemical speciation of n as the primary or complementary factors affecting the structure and functioning of phytoplankton communities paerl et al 2011 watson et al 2016 gilbert 2017 the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been a central topic of ecological research in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems tilman et al 1996 cardinale et al 2006 thompson et al 2018 the prevailing paradigm states that increased species diversity enhances ecosystem functioning such as primary productivity and nutrient use efficiency tilman et al 1996 hooper et al 2005 resource use efficiency rue is often defined as the proportion of available resources that is incorporated into biomass hodapp et al 2019 the positive relationship between biodiversity and rue has been based on a hypothesis of more efficient nutrient use through niche diversification in more diverse ecosystems connell 1978 however contrasting relationships have been found between species richness or evenness and rue in various freshwater and coastal phytoplankton communities ptacnik et al 2008 filstrup et al 2014 frank et al 2020 for instance ptacnik et al 2008 found a positive relationship between phytoplankton species richness and rue in more than 3000 lake samples whereas filstrup et al 2014 revealed an inverse relationship between phytoplankton evenness and rue based on 9 year monitoring of plankton communities in 131 lakes given the global expansion of habs their role in the carbon dynamics of aquatic ecosystems deserves special attention almeida et al 2016 demars et al 2016 recent global syntheses have shown that many rivers worldwide are supersaturated in co2 relative to the atmospheric equilibrium as a result of heterotrophic co2 production exceeding autotrophic co2 consumption raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 although the longitudinal increase in the ratio of gross primary production to ecosystem respiration from headwater streams to medium sized rivers was hypothesized as part of the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 however some recent studies have highlighted the role of phytoplankton as a primary sink of co2 in eutrophic river systems crawford et al 2016 demars et al 2016 engel et al 2020 on the other hand dissolved organic matter dom derived from phytoplankton can enhance bacterial respiration and subsequently co2 emissions in both reservoirs and rivers guillemette et al 2016 almeida et al 2016 begum et al 2019 anaerobic conditions created by the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass can also enhance methanogenesis in eutrophic lake sediments zhang et al 2021 although the effect of nutrient imbalance on algal photosynthesis has been widely studied in various aquatic systems striebel et al 2009 demars et al 2016 few studies have investigated co2 dynamics in the context of phytoplankton diversity and functioning in eutrophic river systems under changing nutrient availability the primary objective of this study was to examine the responses of phytoplankton composition and functioning to long term changes in the relative availability of n and p in the lower han river korea as a consequence of wastewater pollution and subsequent pollution control over the last decades specifically we tested the hypothesis that despite the long term declining nutrient levels the dominance of a few harmful cyanobacterial species lowers phytoplanktonic rue when short term increases in the availability of p relative to n coincide with other favorable environmental conditions such as high water temperature we also evaluated the role of phytoplankton biomass as a potential source of labile dom and hence co2 in the eutrophic river it was assumed that co2 released from organic matter degradation would exceed phytoplankton co2 uptake after passing a threshold biomass to achieve the two study goals a 25 year time series of water quality in the lower han river from 1994 to 2018 was complemented with an additional monitoring of riverine dom and co2 from july 2017 to december 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the han river 494 km in length drains a basin area of 34 128 km2 which covers 35 of south korea seoul metropolitan government 2017 two main branches the north han river and south han river feed into the pal dang dam from which the lower han river flows 85 km westward traversing the seoul metropolitan area before discharging into the yellow sea fig 1 the land cover of the han river changes longitudinally with forest dominated upper reaches gradually converting to urbanized areas along the middle and lower reaches the flow of the lower han river is regulated by upstream cascade dams and two submerged weirs 873 m or 1007 m wide built at the eastern and western ends of the city of seoul fig 1 the two weirs maintain the water level above 2 m throughout the year weir construction has substantially increased water retention time during the dry period lowering flow velocity below 0 05 m s 1 from a mean velocity of 0 9 m s 1 during the monsoon season jung et al 2014 the increased water retention time creates favorable conditions for phytoplankton as the dominant primary producer including three major classes bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae seoul metropolitan government 2017 six major tributaries and effluents from four major wastewater treatment plants wwtps treating sewage from the city of seoul feed into the lower han river these four wwtps discharge 4 401 530 m3 day 1 of effluents after tertiary treatments following the modified ludzack ettinger mle and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o processes yoon et al 2017 out of the 1454 8 mm mean annual precipitation from 2006 to 2015 approximately 70 was concentrated in the months from june to september 2 2 long term data analysis monthly water quality data were collected at 11 sites in the lower han river as part of the national water quality monitoring program operated by the ministry of environment fig 1 to describe longitudinal variations in water quality along the lower han river the 11 sites were grouped into three reaches up hr1 hr4 mid hr5 hr8 and down hr9 hr11 while the four up sites are located between a large dam and the upper weir the four mid and three down sites are sandwiched between the upper and lower weirs that demarcate the lower han river traversing the seoul metropolitan area we expected that water quality at the four up sites would be directly influenced by the dam discharge while the mid and down sites would increasingly reflect cumulative effects of the urban tributaries draining the metropolitan area along the river we analyzed the water quality data monitored from january 1994 to december 2018 including flow water temperature ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do suspended solids ss biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn total dissolved nitrogen tdn no3 n nh4 n total phosphorus tp total dissolved

been monitored since 2001 habs monitoring started in 2010 including the cell counting of each of four major cyanobacterial genera anabaena aphanizomenon oscillatoria and microcystis from 2015 on the cyanobacterial data were available for nine sites hr1 to hr9 only therefore only the data from hr9 constituted the down dataset precipitation and air temperature data were obtained from the korea meteorological administration 2 3 monthly co2 monitoring the concentrations of surface water co2 and ancillary water quality components were measured monthly from july 2017 to august 2018 and bimonthly from august 2018 to december 2018 at three sites hr5 hr8 and hr11 water samples were collected at 20 cm below the surface away from a jetty hr5 and hr11 or the riverbank of an island hr8 the manual headspace equilibration method was used to measure the concentration of dissolved co2 in surface water yoon et al 2017 water samples were filtered through pre combusted gf f glass fiber filters

water and gas analyses have been reported elsewhere jin et al 2018 2 4 calculations and statistical analyses the rue of n ruen and p ruep was calculated as the ratio of phytoplankton biomass chl a or cyanobacterial cell concentrations to the resource availability n p or co2 concentrations following ptacnik et al 2008 the rue was calculated as follows r u e c h l a m g m 3 o r c y a n o b a c t e r

ecosystem functioning hodapp et al 2015 species evenness also responds more sensitively to anthropogenic perturbations than species richness chapin et al 2000 therefore we calculated pielou s evenness index as a measure of genus level evenness of the four monitored cyanobacterial genera the evenness index was complemented with the ratio of anabaena to microcystis a to m ratio pielou s evenness index j was calculated as j h h m a x where h is shannon s diversity index and hmax is the maximum diversity in the system when species are equally distributed j values were calculated only when two

followed by the student newman keuls test as a post hoc analysis to compare significant differences in means among the sites or reaches linear regression analysis was conducted to examine long term trends in n p n p and chl a pearson s correlation analysis was conducted between the log transformed datasets of nutrient indices rue chl a and cyanobacterial cell concentrations regression analysis was performed to examine the relationships between the water quality and phytoplankton indices forward stepwise regression analysis was performed to identify significant factors that can explain variations in chl a and the abundance of the two dominant cyanobacterial genera anabaena and microsystis during hab alert periods when chl a concentrations exceed 15 mg m 3 given data availability and

variations among the three reaches up mid and down anova on rank p 0 05 fig 2 tables s1 s2 over the last 25 years the annual mean concentrations of tp displayed significant declining trends in all three reaches while those of tn significantly declined only in the down reach fig 2 at the down sites tp concentrations decreased from 0 31 mg l 1 in 2015 to 0 09 mg l 1 in 2018 fig 2c outpacing the rather moderate decrease in tn concentrations fig 2b thereby resulting in a large increase in n p from 22 in 2015 to 74 in 2018 fig 2d as a result of this recent increase from 2015 onwards n p at the down sites approached the levels found at the up and mid sites which showed gradual increasing trends in n p over the entire monitoring period p 0 05 fig 2d chl a concentration also increased significantly along the river fig 2e table s1 while the annual mean chl a concentration did not show any significant long term trend across the three reaches the extreme hab event in july 2015 150 500

cyanobacterial genera were monitored at hr9 microcystis represented the most dominant genus accounting for 83 of the total cyanobacterial cells on average fig 3 table s3 anabaena sp was the second most abundant genus with an average proportion of 10 chl a concentrations had a significant positive correlation with both tn and tp concentrations from hr6 to hr11 but a negative correlation with n p from hr7 to hr9 fig 4 a the correlation of anabaena cells with p concentrations and n p was significantly positive and negative respectively and became stronger along the lower reach from hr6 to hr9 in contrast anabaena was negatively correlated with tn concentrations at sites hr2 and hr4 fig 4b microcystis only exhibited significant correlations with tn tp and n p at hr9 fig 4c forward stepwise regression analyses revealed important environmental factors controlling variations in chl a anabaena and microcystis at sites hr6 hr9 during the periods of hab alert chl a 15 mg m 3 from 2015 to 2018 table 1 the most significant model predicted up to 44 9 of the total variance in chl a concentration 29 0 of which was attributed to tn concentrations followed by do 6 1 and n p 4 2 the best regression model for anabaena explained 30 1 of the total variance with po4 3 p 22 4 and precipitation 7 7 as primary variables the best regression model explained up to 53 9 of the variance in microcystis abundance attributed mainly to po4 3 p 19 7 water temperature 8 8 and tn 8 2 table 1 when the same data set was analyzed by pca many cyanobacterial indices microcystis anabaena microcystis and total cyanobacterial cells exhibited relatively high covariance with p indices whereas chl a was close to the cluster of n indices fig s1 cyanobacterial evenness along with anabaena and the ratio of anabaena to microcystis displayed orthogonal relationships with cyanobacteria abundance monthly n p ratios and chl a concentrations showed weak but significant non linear relationships left skewed log normal peaks for up r2 0 046 p 0 05 and mid r2 0 131 p 0 0001 sites and for all sites r2 0 065 p 0 0001 fig 5 a peak chl a concentrations around a narrow range of n p tended to shift toward lower n p values along the river the annual means of n p and chl a exhibited significant inverse relationships for the mid r2 0 294 p 0 05 and all sites r2 0 530 p 0 0001 for the latter relationship the down sites represented the lowest n p values except for the three most recent years when n p increased substantially fig 5b across the reaches cyanobacterial abundance peaked at different ranges of n p 20 60 with a downstream shift toward lower n p values along the river fig 6 a monthly mean n p ratios and microcystis revealed inverse linear relationships for up r2 0 149 p 0 05 mid r2 0 226 p 0

nutrient controls on phytoplankton abundance the observed spatiotemporal trends in tn and tp fig 2 emphasize urban tributaries carrying wwtp effluents as a critical component of the anthropogenic biogeochemical fluxes in the lower han river yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 while the highest nutrient levels observed at the most downstream site reflected the cumulative impacts of upstream wastewater effluents and urban runoffs on the mainstem water quality the long term trends also revealed substantial reductions in nutrient inputs particularly of p as a consequence of effluent water quality control over recent years in 2012 the korean government imposed a stricter regulation on effluent water quality by strengthening the water quality standard for tp from 2 mg l 1 to 0 2 mg l 1 to respond to the 2015 hab event the seoul metropolitan government enforced wwtps to adopt or upgrade to advanced treatment technologies such as submerged biological aerated filters sbaf and modified ludzack ettinger mle processes kim et al 2017 however the standard for tn was maintained at 20 mg l 1 conforming to the conventional p only strategy schindler et al 2008 tp fluxes have been declining in many rivers across europe north america and some parts of asia over the last few decades eea 2019 oelsner and stets 2019 for instance a majority of european rivers now transport less than 0 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 which is an order of magnitude lower than the high tp yield of the ganges river 5 8 kg p ha 1 yr 1 as a result of a decadal reduction in p loads the annual average concentration of tp in european rivers decreased to 0 06 mg l 1 in 2016 eea 2019 as observed in this study fig 2 n p has been increasing in other river systems in the usa stow et al 2001 oelsner and stets 2019 and the yangtze river in china li et al 2014 while the increased n p ratios observed in these rivers are usually associated with the relative increases in fertilizer derived n compared to the decreasing or constant levels of p our finding of a greater reduction of p than n in wwtps can have significant implications for predicting eutrophication and habs in other urbanized river systems undergoing different phases of wastewater induced pollution and its subsequent control despite a large decrease in the annual tp concentration to 0 09 mg l 1 resulting in a high n p ratio 74 at site hr11 a moderate hab event occurred in 2018 fig 3 similar phenomena were also observed in the early 2000s in the huron river usa lehman 2007 a recent study revealed that intensive microcystis blooms could recur in the downstream river of the lake okeechobee florida usa despite the partial success in eutrophication control focusing on p reduction kramer et al 2018 these studies on river eutrophication support the suggestion based on the study of habs in eutrophic lakes such as lake taihu china that tp concentrations should be maintained below a threshold as low as 0 05 mg l 1 to prevent microcystis dominated blooms in freshwater reservoirs xu et al 2015 this implies that tp concentrations in the lower han river might not be low enough to prevent cyanobacterial habs although the threshold level is yet to be determined for flow controlled river systems although p concentrations appear to be the most significant predictor of cyanobacterial abundance along the middle to lowest reaches of the lower han river fig 4 the variations in cyanobacterial abundance can be better explained by including n concentrations n p and hydroclimatic variables in multiple regressions table 1 the hab events in 2015 and 2018 also illustrate the co limitation of nutrients and hydroclimates on cyanobacterial dominance figs 3 s1 s2 both experimental and observational studies have shown that resource partioning among cyanobacterial and other phytoplankton groups is not only affected by nutrient availability but also by hydroclimatic conditions such as flow velocity cardinale 2011 and temperature paerl and otten 2013 the timing and forms of bioavailable p in complex interactions with short term changes in n availability temperature and other hydroclimatic factors have been found to be crucial to the recurrence of habs dominated by microcystis in lake erie watson et al 2016 and lake taihu paerl et al 2011 the growing evidence that both n and p synergistically control algal blooms in stream and rivers has also corroborated the limitation of p only strategy dodds et al 2002 johnson et al 2009 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 the peak concentrations of chl a around a range of n p observed in the long term time series fig 5 and during the additional co2 monitoring fig 8 imply that the balanced supply of n and p within a certain optimal range can be more important for phytoplankton abundance than the absolute availability of each nutrient in a laboratory experiment with assembled freshwater communities frank et al 2020 also found that phytoplankton biomass peaked at a similar range of n p with a mean value of 23 the log normal relationships between n p and chl a figs 5 8 conform to the famous howard odum s formula depicting power as a function of load odum and pinkerton 1955 the maximum phytoplankton abundance power occurs at the narrow intermediate range of the relative availability of n to p load the dominance of microcystis observed in the lower han river fig 3 is not consistent with past studies that found the dominance of n fixing anabaena under sufficient p availability stockner and shortreed 1988 and microcystis taking advantage of available n and warm temperatures in summer sabour et al 2009 this species level difference in limiting nutrients highlights the limitation of the p only paradigm in controlling habs in eutrophic river systems undergoing rapid changes in nutrient availability glibert 2017 in line with the results of stepwise regressions table 1 and pca fig s1 the dominance of microcystis at low n p depends on multiple environmental factors beyond nutrient availability microcystis species have been shown to have competitive advantages to other taxa in higher temperatures robarts and zohary 1987 and under specific bloom conditions where they can utilize resources through their capacity of buoyancy reynolds et al 1981 stepwise multiple regressions table 1 could not include flow due to limited data availability as a contributing factor for the observed temporal variations in the cyanobacterial dominance fig 3 however the relatively low flows observed during the large hab events in 2015 and 2018 fig s4 suggest that the increased water retention time during low flow periods can facilitate the occurrence of habs under favorable environmental conditions consistent with a previous study that found a greater phytoplankton abundance in the lower han river during the dry season compared to weakened phytoplankton communities under high flow conditions jung et al 2014 varying light conditions might also have affected the observed short term variations in the abundance and composition of habs fig 3 previous studies have shown that light intensity often combined with temperature can co limit the growth and interspecific competition of microcystis and other harmful algae li et al 2012 chaffin et al 2018 buoyant cyanobacteria such as microcystis are known to have competitive advantages over non buoyant competitors in light limited waters chaffin et al 2018 4 2 shifting cyanobacterial composition and rue under changing n and p availability in accordance with our hypothesis the dominance of microcystis across a narrow range of low n p and resulting decreases in cyanobacterial evenness fig 6 had adverse consequences for nutrient use efficiency as illustrated by the weak but significant positive relationships between cyanobacterial evenness and the rue of both n and p fig 7 previous field and laboratory studies have reported weak to strong inverse relationships between nutrient availability and species evenness gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 hillebrand and lehmpfuhl 2011 filstrup et al 2014 however we found only weak negative correlations between n species tn tdn and no3 and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 the insignificant correlation between tp and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 suggests that the species evenness of highly dynamic phytoplankton communities may not be determined by a single limiting nutrient but by a complex array of environmental conditions that vary across spatial and temporal scales lehtinen et al 2017 the negative correlation between flow and the ratio of anabaena to microcystis fig s2 combined with the strong inverse relationship between microcystis and the evenness index fig 6c implies that the dominance of microcystis at low flows often coupled with short term increases in tp levels as observed in the 2015 hab event fig 3 may play a critical role in determining species evenness in the eutrophic river similar to microcystis dominated phytoplankton communities in eutrophic lakes paerl et al 2011 watson et al 2016 although n p did not have any significant correlation with cyanobacterial evenness the significant correlations of n p with the abundance and proportion of microcystis figs 4 s2 indicated some indirect relationship between n p and cyanobacterial evenness fig 6 in an experiment with assembled freshwater phytoplankton communities gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 found the lowest evenness under the most imbalanced supply of limiting nutrients n p ratio 2 although there was no clear relationship between species evenness and the availability or ratio of n and p in agreement with the common inverse relationships between phytoplankton evenness and biomass gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 lehtinen et al 2017 increased cyanobacterial cells and microcystis at lower n p ratios fig 6 may be partly responsible for the inverse relationship between n p and chl a fig 5b given the high proportions of microcystis observed during the severe hab events in the lower han river fig 3 the monopolization of the phytoplankton community by a single or a few species at low n p ratios can lead to disproportionate increases in phytoplankton biomass despite lowered evenness hillebrand et al 2007 while several studies have reported opposing relationships between rue and species diversity or evenness in various freshwater and coastal systems hillebrand et al 2008 filstrup et al 2014 hodapp et al 2015 lehtinen et al 2017 the weak but significant positive relationships between cyanobacterial evenness and both ruen and ruep measured across the lower han river fig 7 suggest that the frequent dominance of cyanobacterial species particularly microcystis can exert adverse effects on the functioning of phytoplankton in the highly eutrophic river in accordance with the biodiversity ecosystem functioning paradigm hooper et al 2005 ptacnik et al 2008 cardinale 2011 the contradictory findings might partly have resulted from the neglect of the fact that a few dominant species have disproportionate roles in ecosystem functions such as productivity and nutrient use efficiency hillebrand et al 2008 in the lower han river microcystis seems to play a dominant role in lowering the rue of the whole phytoplankton community in contrast anabaena contributed positively to cyanobacterial evenness as indicated by the significant positive relationship between anabaena and cyanobacterial evenness fig s2 the significant positive relationship between n p and ruep observed across the reaches fig 7b suggests that the abundant p in the eutrophic han river may not be efficiently used by the cyanobacteria dominated phytoplankton community this lowered rue implies that the dominance of a few cyanobacterial species may reduce opportunities for resource partitioning among other phytoplankton species while it is also likely that replete phytoplankton species do not need to use excess p as efficiently as under limited p availability downward shifts in the relationship along the river reflect p surplus above a certain threshold for balanced resource partitioning as observed in the artificially assembled phytoplankton communities gamfeldt and hillebrand 2011 frank et al 2020 some microcystis species such as m aeruginosa are known to have a greater ruep than other taxa reynolds et al 1981 filstrup et al 2014 the observed dominance of microcystis species in the lower han river fig 3 illustrates the high capacity of microcystis to adapt to the p rich environment however the dominance of microcystis in the lower han river is not consistent with the usual dominance of the n fixing anabaena species over microcystis with decreasing n p mulholland 2007 schindler et al 2008 as aforementioned explaining the competitive balance between anabaena and microcystis should take into consideration not only the absolute availability of n and p but also the stoichiometric relationships between n and p as well as other factors such as temperature and flow frank et al 2020 the negative or insignificant relationships between n p ratio and ruen fig 8a imply that the n fixing anabaena species may be preferred under conditions of high p availability at low n p thereby also providing microcystis with n leaked from the n fixing process mulholland 2007 this kind of positive interaction between n fixing and other cyanobacteria can enhance ruen at low n p however we need to further investigate whether the observed dominance of microcystis in the han river can be attributed to the additional supply of n from n fixing cyanobacterial species or temporary increases in n derived from external sources it is also unclear whether the dominance of microcystis depends on its adaptability to other environmental conditions such as high water temperature as illustrated by the significant correlations between water temperature and the absolute or relative abundance of microcystis fig s2 maximal growth rates of microcystis and other surface bloom forming cyanobacterial species have often been observed at high temperatures primarily due to their capacity to adapt to hot surface water conditions paerl et al 2011 paerl and otten 2013 if temperature and other environmental conditions are more important for the occurrence of microcystis dominated habs than the absolute or relative availability of n and p it would be too presumptive to predict that the recent trend in n p fig 2 might lead to less frequent occurrences of habs 4 3 the role of phytoplankton in riverine c dynamics in agreement with other studies that have attributed the lowered emissions of co2 to enhanced primary production in eutrophic freshwater systems gu et al 2011 almeida et al 2016 demars et al 2016 chl a and co2 showed inverse relationships across the lower han river fig 8a however the upward shifts in the relationship between co2 and chl a along the han river fig 8a indicate an enhanced turnover of labile dom derived from phytoplankton biomass as a source of riverine co2 emission from the eutrophic system kaplan and bott 1982 yoon et al 2017 the dom from algal extracellular release generally consists of labile materials with lower molecular weights compared to allochthonous high molecular weight dom kaplan and bott 1982 guillemette et al 2016 the relatively low co2 concentrations at the up sites indicate an active phytoplankton uptake of co2 consistent with previous findings of enhanced primary production in the upstream dams and discharged waters jin et al 2018 upward shifts in the negative relationship between co2 and chl a concentration along the lower han river indicate the production of additional co2 molecules from om degradation fluorescent dom components derived from cyanobacterial biomass as identified by the parafac components characteristic of algal dom murphy et al 2011 were reflected in the increased intensities of protein like fluorescence c2 along the lower han river table 2 fig s5 the parabola shaped relationship between n p and chl a showed chl a peaks across the wide range of n p ratio from 25 to 80 at three sites fig 8b which might be considered as an optimal range of n p for phytoplankton growth in each reach although the parabola shaped relationship was not significant at the most downstream site hr11 the downstream shift in the peak chl a toward the lower n p values implies that the longitudinally increasing level of eutrophication may have differentiated the optimal n p ratio along the lower han river despite the relatively short distance the lowest concentrations of co2 and doc around the same range of n p fig 8c d indicate active co2 uptake by the growing phytoplankton biomass within the narrow range of n p in each reach the insignificant relationship between n p and co2 at the most downstream hr11 fig 8c combined with the strongly significant relationship between n and co2 fig s6b suggests that in the most downstream reach there may be a threshold of n across which co2 concentrations either increase or decrease in contrast no significant relationship between tp and co2 is consistent with the dampened relationship between n p and co2 presumably due to the confounding effects of tributary inputs and in stream processes that increase longitudinally toward the river mouth outside of the optimal n p range the phytoplankton biomass may release labile materials that are highly biodegradable and hence easily converted to co2 guillemette et al 2016 sinking debris of phytoplankton has also been suggested to enhance the burial of organic carbon in sediments downing et al 2008 taken together enhanced carbon fixation at the narrow n p range in short river reaches might minimize the extracellular release of co2 and doc but across other n p ranges phytoplankton biomass may function as significant sources of om and co2 in eutrophic river systems the two monitoring sites hr 8 and hr 11 located in the middle to lower sections of the highly eutrophic river were mostly supersaturated in co2 table 2 high loads of anthropogenic dom from wwtps can stimulate co2 production from the labile dom during downstream transport yoon et al 2017 previous studies in the lower han river have identified wwtps as a primary external source of doc and co2 yoon et al 2017 jin et al 2018 studies conducted in eutrophic impounded rivers have suggested that the impacted system can act either as a source or sink of co2 depending on the prevailing hydroclimatic conditions for instance high precipitation events can turn the system into a co2 sink whereas longer retention time creates a favorable condition for phytoplankton co2 uptake pacheco et al 2015 although the complex relationships between habs and riverine emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs make it challenging to observe a consistent pattern for the effects of habs on ghg emissions some recent studies have revealed increased emissions of ghgs especially ch4 from eutrophic urban rivers jin et al 2018 beaulieu et al 2019 5 conclusions the 25 year water quality data emphasize the critical role of p availability and its relation to n n p in the spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton abundance and cyanobacterial dominance in the eutrophic lower han river however microcystis dominated habs continued to occur in recent years despite a drastic increase in n p driven by a large decrease in tp levels implying cyanobacterial responses to multiple factors including a reduced but still high p availability sustained high n availability warm temperature and low flow in the lowest reach which has the highest levels of p and lowest ratios of n p cyanobacterial dominance during habs tends to lower ruep because of reduced complementarity and consequently inefficient resource partitioning consistent with the prevailing biodiversity ecosystem functioning paradigm the observed increases in doc concentrations and pco2 at low n p ratios outside of the optimal range for chl a illustrate the potential contribution of phytoplankton biomass to riverine doc and co2 fluxes as a significant perturbation to ecosystem functioning in the eutrophic river that warrants further investigation to provide a mechanistic understanding of phytoplankton driven co2 dynamics the combined results suggest that predicting future changes in phytoplankton composition and functioning in the eutrophic river receiving decreasing nutrient loads would require a better understanding of the coupled constraints imposed by short term changes in nutrient availability and climatic conditions further research is required to elucidate the complex interplay between nutrient availability and climatic variability in limiting phytoplankton
