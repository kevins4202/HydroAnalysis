5000,for shallow lakes the water exchange process is a crucial factor that affects lake eutrophication which can be solved by a water diversion project wdp however the water exchange process in shallow lakes is complex and affected by hydrological characteristics the water level and inflow stream and external forcing the wind field it is of profound significance to evaluate the process of lake water exchange by combining dynamic and static methods in this study for hydrological characterization a morlet wavelet analysis was used for the periodic analysis of 24 year water level data the monthly discharge of the main rivers over three hydrological years was calculated by a hydrological frequency curve and water balance theory the external wind field was studied by the wind sheltering coefficient to simulate an uneven distribution the water age model and particle tracking model were coupled to explore the water exchange process of dianchi lake with the influence of two major wdps the results show that in each scenario the distribution of the water age presents a radial distribution and decreases in age from the centre of the lake to the shore and the largest proportion of the oldest water occurs without exception at the centre of dianchi lake moreover the water mass in dianchi lake generally circulates counter clockwise around a circle of a fixed size when the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp and the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp are combined for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water exchange process water age particle tracking water diversion project wind field hydrological characteristics 1 introduction the eutrophication of shallow lakes has become a worldwide environmental problem meerhoff et al 2012 munar et al 2019 munar et al 2018 as a hydrodynamic characteristic in shallow lakes the water exchange process is a crucial factor that affects lake eutrophication huang et al 2016b wu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 which is caused by the long residence time of lake water khorasani et al 2018 yang et al 2018b the water exchange process of a lake is usually evaluated as a whole by the water residence time which is obtained by dividing the volume of the lake by the total inflow if the residence time of the water in a lake is long polluted water will be difficult to replace and the pollutants will stay in the lake for a long time djihouessi and aina 2018 li et al 2017 however the water exchange process in shallow lakes is complex and affected by hydrological conditions the water level inflow etc and external forcing the wind field the water residence time alone does not reflect the time effect of hydrodynamic processes on material circulation exchange and renewal moreover water diversion projects wdps are frequently used to solve the problem of lake water exchange in the near future which can reduce the residence time of the water in lakes and improve the water quality yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 for shallow lakes a wdp usually directs water into lakes by artificial channels and natural rivers annys et al 2019 dadaser celik et al 2009 which has a significant influence on a lake s hydrodynamics urrutia et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to simulate the water exchange process of lakes as accurately as possible as this process is affected by the hydrological conditions and external forcing dianchi lake a typical plateau shallow lake is one of the most eutrophic lakes in china the main reason for the water pollution in dianchi lake is that the lake is located in the lower reaches of kunming city and its lowest level lies in rural and urban areas huang et al 2014 yan et al 2019 with the increasing population urbanization and modernization around the lake a large amount of rural and urban domestic sewage is discharged into dianchi lake this rapid urbanization and industrialization leads to the excessive consumption of clean water resources in the upper reaches of the basin and the lack of clean water supplies further exacerbates the deterioration of the lake to solve the deterioration of water quality caused by the retention of lake water several studies have reported that a wdp might improve the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources kuo et al 2019 li et al 2016 yu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in january 2014 the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp officially supplied water to dianchi lake by 2025 the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp will also be completed and supply water to dianchi lake which will be the largest and most highly invested in water resource allocation project in southwestern china however there has been almost no specific research on the impact of the aforementioned two important wdps on the water exchange process the hydrological conditions and wind field are the basis for an accurate study of the water exchange process affected by wdps in shallow lakes in terms of the hydrological conditions some studies have used different water levels and water diversion scenarios as variables to explore the hydrodynamics of dianchi lake liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 other studies have analysed the importance of the condition of the inflow calculation through the existing data zhou et al 2014 these studies illustrated the significance of the water level and inflow stream as hydrological characteristics but did not apply the existing data to establish a general case from the specific details in terms of the wind field some studies have not considered the wind in the model calculation other studies have considered the wind over the entire dianchi lake to be uniform and constant however it has been proven by flow field analysis that wind plays an important role in the formation of the flow field in shallow lakes cheng et al 2012 due to the blocking by xishan mountain the distribution of the wind field at dianchi lake is uneven therefore the study of uneven wind fields is of great significance for the further study of the hydrodynamics in dianchi lake in this study we investigated the water exchange process before and after the wdps with the influence of hydrological characteristics and external forcing first in terms of the hydrological characteristics we analysed the periodicity of long series water level data and the typical annual discharge of the main rivers that enter the lake which laid the foundation for the analysis of the lake water exchange aronica and candela 2007 bormann et al 2011 gualtieri et al 2018 second in terms of the external wind field the distribution of the uneven wind field in dianchi lake was further explored which can lay a foundation for further studies third we proposed a coupled model of water age and particle tracking to evaluate the process of water exchange in lakes the water age of lakes informs us when the water at one point in the lake will be replaced li et al 2011 shen and lin 2006 particle tracking is helpful to understand the process of lake water movement basser et al 2019 izbicki et al 2004 li et al 2013 the water age and particle tracking can help explain the change in the water exchange process before and after the wdps tan and zhang 2018 zeng et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 accordingly in contrast to previous studies we can simultaneously evaluate the water exchange process affected by wdps in different periods wet years normal flow years and dry years the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the periodicity of the hydrological characteristics with long time series data 2 research the effect of external forcing the wind field on the flow field in the lake and 3 study the water exchange process in the lake that is affected by the wdps through the water age and particle tracking 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is presented in fig 1 dianchi lake is situated in yunnan province in southwest china according to the survey of the kunming surveying and mapping institute and the kunming dianchi administration bureau the area of the basin lake is 2920 km2 and the lake surface area is 293 km2 with a normal water level of 1887 4 m this means that under normal conditions dianchi lake is 1887 4 m above the sea level of huanghai china the mean depth of the lake is 4 4 m around the lake there are thirteen main rivers on the north east and south sides on the west side xishan mountain with a height of 2477 m has a significant influence on the distribution of the wind field on the lake surface a small lake caohai lake is separated from dianchi lake by haigeng dam therefore there is little water exchange between these two lakes in addition there is only one river that runs out of dianchi lake which is called haikouhe hkh or tanglangchuan tlc and it is situated on the southwest side of the lake the bottom elevation of dianchi lake is between approximately 1879 m and 1889 m eight national control points are distributed in dianchi lake for the purpose of inspection and supervision at the national level to speed up water replacement in dianchi lake a water diversion scheme was proposed in the study on the water quality change of the kunming section of the second phase project in central yunnan and its impact on the water environment of the backwater lake reservoir most of the wdps are tunnels with a diameter of approximately 3 10 m the two water diversion processes are shown in table 1 one wdp the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp was officially opened in january 2014 all the water diverted by the nwdp into dianchi lake is through the panlongjiang plj river the design of the water diversion process is that in one year the water diversion should be decreased in the dry season and increased in the wet season another wdp the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp is under construction and will be completed by 2025 the inflow ratio of the supplementary plj river and bxh river is 2 1 2 2 data sources we collected monthly precipitation and evaporation data and daily water level data from 1964 to 1987 from the hydrology yearbook of the people s republic of china fig 2 a regarding the water level we refer to elevation datum points so that different datum points selected in different studies can be converted to a unified framework in this study the water level datum is based on the huanghai 1956 vertical datum fig 1 a the data sampling point of the yearbook is from the haigeng hydrological station located in the northern part of dianchi lake as shown in fig 1 evaporation data from june to september 1968 and the entire year of 1969 are unavailable in this study we took the average values of precipitation and evaporation over 24 years to construct monthly precipitation and evaporation histograms fig 2 b and an accumulation line chart fig 2 b fig 2 b shows that the precipitation from june to september is greater than the evaporation and the maximum accumulation is in august at 60 92 mm month zhang et al 2013 from october to may of the following year the evaporation is greater than the precipitation and the maximum accumulation loss is 212 98 mm month in march the daily water level data for 24 years were used for a morlet wavelet analysis the average monthly precipitation and evaporation values were utilized to calculate the inflow into dianchi lake according to the water balance principle jarihani et al 2015 li et al 2019 riveros iregui et al 2017 wu et al 2018 2 3 hydrological characteristics analysis 2 3 1 morlet wavelet analysis all hydrological processes between the ecological system and the atmosphere can be regarded as time varying periodic signals yang et al 2018a a hydrologic time series can be achieved by employing models such as the shot noise model fragments model autoregressive moving average model artificial neural networks anns stochastic disaggregation model markov chain model bootstrapping method and wavelets among others niu and sivakumar 2013 to reveal the various change periods hidden in the time series a morlet wavelet analysis can reflect the variation in the system at different time scales and obtain a qualitative assessment of future development labat et al 2000 the continuous fluctuation of the lake water level with time is the result of many factors this fluctuation belongs to a continuous non stationary sequence and contains multi time scale characteristics the periodicity of the water level series in dianchi lake can be revealed by a wavelet analysis the daily water level data in dianchi lake from 1964 to 1987 according to the haigeng hydrological station are shown in fig 2 a a morlet wavelet analysis was used for the water level data and revealed that the oscillation information in the lake water environmental field includes both positive and negative peaks over a wide range cheng et al 2017 kovács et al 2010 2 3 2 flow calculation method in typical years in this study a flow calculation method in three typical years is proposed which can obtain the river flow under the three situations of wet normal flow and dry years the wet year represents a relatively large flow the dry year represents a relatively small flow and a normal year represents the average situation these discharges in three typical years are used as the boundary conditions of the water age and particle tracking model which can determine the strong replacement wet year weak replacement dry year and medium replacement normal flow year of lake water this approach lays a useful foundation for a water exchange analysis step 1 hydrological frequency curve calculation a pearson type iii distribution was used for the hydrological frequency analysis as recommended by the water resources council us wrc bobée 1975 lei et al 2018 phien and ajirajah 1984 the hydrological frequency curve was obtained by a numerical simulation and then fitted by the ocular curve fitting method markus et al 2007 whalen et al 2002 as the computing speed increases the accuracy of the curve fitting is higher in the optimum curve fitting method meng et al 2015 the annual total inflow data for 58 years from 1953 to 2010 are taken from the comprehensive improvement scheme of the water environment in dianchi basin first the original data x m are ranked from large to small second the empirical frequency is calculated by 1 p m n 1 100 where m is the number sequence in descending order n is the quantity of the hydrological data and p is the empirical frequency that corresponds to x m in addition the point p x m is drawn on probability paper then the variation coefficient c v and the skewness coefficient c s are calculated as follows 2 c v 1 n 1 m 1 n k m 1 2 3 c s m 1 n k m 1 3 n 3 c v 3 where k m x m e x is the module ratio coefficient and e x is the average annual inflow finally the hydrological frequency curve discussed by lei et al is drawn lei et al 2018 the standard issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china which is named the standard for essential terminology and symbols in hydrology gb t50095 2014 gives the hydrological frequency definition of a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 these three typical years include the upper and lower limits of river flow step 2 flow calculation of the main rivers the thirteen main rivers that flow into dianchi lake were chosen as the inflow boundary conditions dai et al 2016 gao et al 2015 the rivers with too little flow are merged into the 13 nearby rivers under natural conditions the total annual runoff into the lake is 6 83 108 m3 a in a normal flow year of which the plj river accounts for 21 the bxh river accounts for 8 the lyh river accounts for 14 the cgh river accounts for 11 the byh river accounts for 11 the ddh river accounts for 10 the dqh river accounts for 5 the mlh river accounts for 4 the llh river accounts for 4 the ynh river accounts for 4 the hh river accounts for 3 the gch river accounts for 3 and the nch river accounts for 2 among these rivers the plj river and bxh river are the rivers that are diverted by the two wdps among the 13 rivers the small rivers did not have measured flow data therefore we used the watershed area ratio to predict the monthly streamflow gianfagna et al 2015 hodges 2013 the monthly flow processes of the plj bxh and tlc rivers hkh river from 1999 to 2009 were reported by zhou et al 2014 these data include the monthly flow processes of wet years 25 normal flow years 50 and dry years 75 the calculations of the monthly discharges of the remaining 11 inflow rivers in a hydrological year are as follows 4 q 12 y q 13 y q x y s 12 s 13 s x 5 q x y 1 12 q x y t y 6 q 14 q eva q 1 q 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 q pre 7 q 1 q 2 q 11 α q 1 q 2 q 11 where x is the number of rivers y is the month from january to december q x y represents the flow of river number x in month y m3 s s x is the drainage area of the river number x from gao et al 2014 t y is the time in month s y q x is the annual runoff of river number x m3 a q eva is the annual evaporation from dianchi lake m3 a and q pre is the yearly precipitation at dianchi lake m3 a we can use formulas 4 and 5 to obtain the annual runoff of the remaining 11 rivers q 1 q 2 q 11 with the watershed area ratio method however there will be an error as the total inflow is not equal to the total outflow therefore we calculate the actual annual runoff of the 11 rivers by using formula 6 which is q 1 q 2 q 11 therefore the coefficient of correction α can be calculated by formula 7 and α 1 for river numbers 12 and 13 the known monthly flow processes lack data from 1999 to 2009 another coefficient of correction β can be calculated to make the total inflow fit the hydrological frequency in which the typical hydrological year is a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 8 q 1 q 2 q 13 β q 1 q 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 where q 1 q 2 q 13 is from the hydrological frequency curve q 1 q 2 q 13 q q pre and q includes q 25 q 50 and q 75 in the hydrological frequency curve finally the monthly flow processes of the 13 rivers can be obtained in a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 with the following formula 9 q x y α β q x y here the calculation of groundwater and water withdrawals has been included in the water balance groundwater accounts for 0 88 of the total annual runoff in normal flow years 6 83 108 m3 a water withdrawals account for 1 51 of the total outputs each year 2 4 wind sheltering coefficient analysis we studied the wind field of dianchi lake by using the wind sheltering coefficient which was previously shown to apply to lake surfaces van den hoek et al 2015 the wind sheltering coefficient which ranges from zero to one largely depends on the topography around the lake and reflects the degree of the wind field on the surface of the lake covered by the surrounding mountains or buildings li et al 2015 mcjannet et al 2017 as a general rule a very large lake has effectively no wind sheltering i e the wind sheltering coefficient equals 1 markfort et al 2010 this means that the wind field of the entire lake is typically evenly distributed that is the wind direction and speed at each point in the lake are the same at the same time this discussion emphasises the deficiency of most previous studies on dianchi lake as xishan mountain at 2477 m above sea level west of dianchi lake fig 1 has a blocking effect on the wind field of dianchi lake and results in an uneven distribution of the wind field which means that the wind sheltering coefficient on the surface of dianchi lake is not equal to 1 here the wind sheltering coefficient values between 0 and 1 were defined for an orthogonal curvilinear grid of 3211 cells and the final wind field distribution map of dianchi lake was obtained by verifying the flow field of the lake that is affected by the surface wind field and the measured flow field the monthly data of the wind speed and direction at dianchi lake are the average values of 26 years from 1990 to 2015 as discussed by wang et al 2019 2 5 coupling water exchange model the coupling water exchange model includes a water age model and a particle tracking model which have been separately validated for some water exchange studies the water age model describes the water age of each point on the two dimensional plane of the lake at a certain time which can be considered to be a relatively static model javaheri et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the particle tracking model describes the trajectory of a liquid particle on the two dimensional plane of the lake over a period of time which can be considered to be a relatively dynamic model chen et al 2020 cousquer et al 2018 the two models complement one another and evaluate the process of the lake water exchange from dynamic and static aspects in this study we used the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc to calculate the water age and particle tracking of dianchi lake zhang et al 2016 the simulation time of the water age model was set at 5 years for a pre simulation and 1 year for a normal simulation we used the calculated hydrological conditions in january under wet normal flow and dry years as model spin up times the simulation time of the particle tracking model was 1 month for the dry season we used february as the model spin up time and for the wet season we used august as the model spin up time 2 5 1 water age mathematical model the water age at a point in a lake is defined as the time elapsed since a water mass entered the lake and the age is prescribed to be zero at the entrance of the lake huang et al 2016a accordingly the water age is set at zero at the entrance of the 13 rivers to the lake the transport equations for calculating the tracer and age concentration can be written as follows gao et al 2018 gong et al 2009 liu et al 2015 10 c t x t u c t x k c t x 0 11 α t x t u α t x k α t x c t x where the tracer concentration c t x and age concentration α t x are functions of the time t and location x u denotes the velocity vector and k is the diffusivity tensor the water age a t x can then be obtained as follows 12 a t x α t x c t x the model grid adopts the orthogonal curvilinear grid of 3211 cells fig 1 which has a better effect on the hydrodynamic simulation than an orthogonal grid zhang et al 2016 furthermore to calculate the decreasing rate of the water age in the centre point of the lake under a certain diversion flow it is assumed that the water age of the centre point under the natural condition is an and that the water age of the centre point under the action of water diversion is awdp then the water age reduction rate of the lake centre that is affected by the diversion flow is an awdp an 2 5 2 particle tracking mathematical model the differential equations for the lagrangian movement of particles are as follows craig 2009 13 dx d x drift d x ran u d h x dt 2 d h dt 2 p 1 14 dy d y drift d y ran v d h y dt 2 d h dt 2 p 1 15 dz d z drift d z ran w d v z dt 2 d v dt 2 p 1 where dt is the time step and p is a random number from a uniformly distributed random variable generator with a mean of 0 5 when transformed by using 2p 1 the random component has a mean of zero and a range from 1 to 1 the transformed random value allows the diffusion term to move particles forward and backward about the advected position to determine the lagrangian trajectory of the particle eqs 13 15 were incorporated into the model the numerical solution was separately divided into advective transport and random components as described above in this study we disabled the random components for either the horizontal or vertical directions naves et al 2019 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics of dianchi lake 3 1 1 morlet wavelet analysis of the water level the morlet wavelet transform was utilized to analyse the periodic variation characteristics in the water level series at dianchi lake the real time frequency distribution of the wavelet transform coefficients is presented in fig 3 a and b the x and y axes represent the time year and scale respectively and the results show pronounced cyclical changes in the water level according to the yearly wavelet analysis shown in fig 3 b the fluctuation in the water level series is recognizable on the scales of 13 15 among them the fluctuation of the water level on the scale of 14 appears at 5 high and low water level oscillation centres the five plus or minus signs represented in the figure which have the characteristics of full time distribution on the scale of 14 the real part of the wavelet coefficients was negative from 1965 to 1968 1974 1977 and 1983 1986 which indicates that the water level was falling the real part of the wavelet coefficients was positive from 1969 to 1973 and 1978 1982 which indicates that the water level was rising therefore the water level of the lake had a process of low high low high low and the average period was approximately 7 years according to the monthly wavelet analysis shown in fig 3 a the 13 25 scale change rule of the water level applies during low frequency cyclic evolution on the scale of 18 there are 48 distinct high and low water level oscillation centres in 24 years from 1964 to 1987 moreover the average period was approximately one year accordingly the results show that the water level changes periodically with the main period of one year and the secondary period of seven years the main period of one year shows that the water level changes little from year to year therefore it is feasible to use the average water level from 1964 to 1987 as shown in fig 2 b as the boundary condition of the subsequent simulation 3 1 2 hydrological frequency analysis of the main river streamflow through the 58 blue points that represent the yearly total inflow into dianchi lake from 1953 to 2010 the fitted theoretical frequency curve is shown as a red line in fig 4 the average value among them is 9 85 108 m3 a because the goodness of fit of the curve obtained by different cv and cs values is different that is the r2 values are different it is necessary to adjust the cv and cs values repeatedly to maximize the final goodness of fit which is an r2 value closest to 1 after repeated fitting the variation coefficient c v is 0 30 and the skewness coefficient c s is 0 45 this regression line has a high goodness of fit as represented by a high r2 value of 0 985 the first hydrological frequency of 25 corresponds to a wet year with an inflow of 11 70 108 m3 a the second hydrological frequency of 50 corresponds to a normal flow year with an inflow of 9 63 108 m3 a the third hydrological frequency of 75 corresponds to a dry year with an inflow of 7 75 108 m3 a depending on the water balance between the total inflow and total outflow in dianchi lake we can determine the monthly inflow of the 13 rivers in a wet year fig 5 a a normal flow year fig 5 b and a dry year fig 5 c the red columns represent the monthly natural flow which represents the years before 2014 the green columns represent the supplementary flow of the nwdp which represents the years from 2014 to the present the blue columns represent the supplementary flow of the dwdp which is expected to be opened in 2025 after the implementation of the nwdp the water supplement of the nwdp fully replenished the plj river therefore only the plj river is represented in the green columns the annual inflows of the plj river into dianchi lake are 8 08 108 m3 a in a wet year 7 92 108 m3 a in a normal flow year and 7 47 108 m3 a in a dry year after the nwdp which account for 54 60 and 65 of the total flow from the 13 rivers that flow into the lake respectively the dwdp will supplement the plj river and the bxh river which are represented in the blue columns the annual inflows of the plj river plus the bxh river into dianchi lake are expected to be 14 41 108 m3 a in a wet year 14 09 108 m3 a in a normal flow year and 13 45 108 m3 a in a dry year after the nwdp and dwdp which account for 70 74 and 79 of the total flow from the 13 rivers that flow into the lake respectively as can be seen from fig 5 with the implementation of the two wdps the proportion of the flow of the wdps will be greater and the proportion of the flow under natural conditions will be lower june to november is the wet season while december to may is the dry season 3 2 wind field distribution at dianchi lake as shown table 3 the first study in this context cheng et al 2012 mentioned that research from tsinghua university initially showed that the blocking by xishan mountain may reduce the wind speed by 25 which can be used to simulate the region nevertheless the study did not determine which aspect should be reduced by 25 we referred to this research for further exploration the results of the temporal and spatial distribution of the wind field on the surface of dianchi lake are shown in fig 6 from the perspective of the spatial distribution the wind sheltering coefficient in the south of dianchi lake south of the latitude line where the dianchi water outlet is located is equal to 1 in the north of dianchi lake north of the latitude line where the dianchi water outlet is located the wind sheltering coefficient is 0 75 near the left bank at approximately 0 5 km and the remaining values are 1 from the perspective of the temporal distribution the wind speed is greater in the dry season than in the wet season the wind speed in march is the greatest which is 2 83 and the wind speed in august is the smallest which is 1 58 in addition south westerly winds or southerly winds prevail throughout the year 3 3 water exchange process in dianchi lake 3 3 1 water age distribution we calculated three scenarios in three typical years namely a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year the three scenarios are evaluated in the natural conditions after the nwdp and after the nwdp and dwdp every typical year includes the wet season and the dry season with august representing the wet season and february representing the dry season in each scenario the largest proportion of the water age occurs at the centre of dianchi lake without exception because dianchi lake exhibits a counter clockwise circulation overall fig 11 when the water body is closer to the circulation centre it is less likely to participate in the lake water cycle under natural conditions the discharge of the rivers into dianchi lake is small in the dry season of the three typical years therefore the distribution of the water age presents a radial distribution that decreases from the centre of the lake to the shore fig 7 a c e in addition when comparing the dry season and the wet season in the three typical years the water age at the centre of dianchi lake is approximately 50 d higher in the wet season than in the dry season fig 7 a d and f because the discharge is greater in the wet season than in the dry season the lake water more easily circulates during the wet season in addition it is difficult for the water at the centre of the lake to escape from the internal circulation fig 8 after the nwdp dark blue areas can be seen in the northern part of dianchi lake in each typical year fig 7 a f where the water age is less than 100 d because the replenishment of the nwdp fully applies to the plj river and the inflow of the plj river is located in the northern part of dianchi lake therefore the water age is reduced to less than 100 d in contrast to the water age in natural conditions after the nwdp and dwdp there is little difference in the water age distribution between the dry and wet seasons fig 7 a f in addition the water age in the area near xishan mountain decreases significantly compared to the natural conditions and after the nwdp this outcome occurs because the counter clockwise circulation applies to the supplementary water for the nwdp and dwdp flow the water age values in the centre of dianchi lake under various conditions are shown in table 2 when only the nwdp is used for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 41 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 27 40 when nwdp and dwdp are combined for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 3 3 2 particle tracking distribution a particle tracking simulation of the three scenarios in the three typical years shows the circulation flow in dianchi lake in each typical year the particle trajectory of february in the dry season and august in the wet season is shown there are eight initial sites for particle tracking which are located at eight national control points the results are as follows first internal circulation is formed in all scenarios near the centre of the lake such as the two national control points of gysz and byk shown in fig 8 a f a f and a f second through a contrast analysis of the two national control points of gysz and byk the circulation formed by the water mass is larger in gysz than in byk in the dry season fig 8 a a c c and e e but is smaller in the wet season fig 8 b b d d and f f third compared with the dry season and the wet season in each scenario of the three typical years the water masses at the four national control points of ljy gysx gysd and dcn are on almost the same circulation line in the dry season fig 8 a a c c and e e however in the wet season fig 8 b b d d and f f only the two national control points of ljy and gysd are on the same circulation line the difference between the inflow conditions in the wet season and the dry season is that the overall inflow in the wet season is greater therefore in the dry season due to the small inflow the entire lake presents a counter clockwise water cycle however in the wet season the increased inflow can disrupt the counter clockwise water cycle on the lake bank which can make the water near the lakeshore flow out of the lake and increase the water exchange of the lake 4 discussion 4 1 water exchange process affected by wdps a pre simulation is usually employed to stabilize the simulation results of the water age there are 8 national control points in dianchi lake fig 1 which were extracted to analyse the variation in the water age over time as affected by the wdps in a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year fig 9 here we pre simulated for five years liu et al 2014 and actually simulated for one year because the hydrological conditions and the effect of external force wind brought in by the simulation changed in a year cycle the simulated water age also changed in a year cycle when the change in the water age is essentially the same in the fifth year as in the sixth year the pre simulation can be considered to meet the requirements by comparison with the flow field the two national control points of gysz and byk are located at the two focal points of the elliptic counter clockwise circulation fig 11 this finding indicates that among all points these two points are the least likely to impact the external circulation of the lake therefore the water ages of gysz and byk were the highest in every scenario fig 9 between these two points gysz had a higher water age therefore if the most difficult stable point gysz were to reach the water age balance then the entire lake simulation would reach a balance compared with the highest water age of gysz in the fifth and sixth years the proportion of the water age could be within 1 in the scenario after the nwdp or dwdp fig 9 a c and a c among the scenarios the most difficult to stabilize was a dry year under natural conditions fig 9 c however the proportion of the water age could also be stabilized within 6 therefore in general the error in the water age distribution can be effectively avoided by a 5 year pre simulation dead water zones can be formed in lakes the reason for their formation is that it is difficult for the water that newly enters the lake from the river to reach the zone thus the water circulation process in the zone is maintained at a low level for dianchi lake it can be seen from fig 1 that the lake is a radial sink which means that all of the surrounding rivers flow into dianchi lake therefore the dead water zones will not be formed near the lakeshore but in the centre of the lake due to the counter clockwise circulation of dianchi lake as a whole fig 11 the water mass in the lake generally circulates around a circle of fixed size fig 8 therefore the water masses located in separate circulation circles cannot readily communicate with one another for the rivers with small flows their water masses circulate along the lake shore tu et al 2017 it is unlikely for these masses to reach the centre of the lake this effect leads to the largest value of the water age at the centre of the lake fig 7 through the distribution of the water age and particle tracking in the wet and dry seasons it can be found that compared with the dry season the wet season with increased flow can disrupt the circulation at ljy gysx gysd and dcn the water mass at ljy and gysd is restricted to only one circle and this circle is smaller than the others fig 8 this means that the water age of the lakeshore is lower in the wet season than in the dry season due to the disruption of the circulation on the lakeshore however due to the more compact circulation at the centre of the lake in the wet season the water age at the centre of the lake is greater in the wet season than in the dry season fig 7 from the aspect of the water age the implementation of the wdps can effectively reduce the water age at the lake centre and increase the water exchange process 4 2 model accuracy and uncertainty analysis 4 2 1 inflow the monthly runoff in the three typical years is also calculated by using the watershed area ratio method this method requires the assumption that the town and country conditions are identical in each river basin however the calculated monthly discharge of the 13 rivers is confirmed to be sufficiently accurate by comparing the results with the river discharge values mentioned in other papers fig 10 the upper sideline of the box chart represents a wet year with a hydrological frequency of 25 the middle line represents a normal year with a hydrological frequency of 50 and the lower sideline represents a dry year with a hydrological frequency of 75 despite its preliminary character this study can reveal the monthly flow process in wet years normal flow years and dry years 4 2 2 wind field we can find the measured data of the flow field of dianchi lake in the report by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research study on the effect of water replenishment of the niulanjiang diversion project the actual measurements of dianchi lake were carried out by the nanjing institute of geography and limnology at the chinese academy of sciences in january 1980 and may 1983 the relative water depth of the measuring points was 0 1 m in 1980 the total inflow into dianchi lake was 9 83 108 m3 a which corresponds to a frequency of 49 according to fig 4 and represents a normal flow year in 1983 the total inflow was 12 11 108 m3 a which corresponds to a frequency of 22 according to fig 4 and represents a wet year therefore the inflow in a normal flow year fig 5 b was used as the boundary condition to simulate the flow field in 1980 and the inflow in a wet year fig 5 a was used as the boundary condition to simulate the flow field in 1983 the measured value agrees well with the simulated value fig 11 shows that there is always a large counter clockwise circulation in the central part of dianchi lake regardless of whether it is a wet year or a normal flow year this is because xishan mountain blocks the surface wind of dianchi lake which results in an uneven distribution of the lake surface wind fig 6 a there were also two small circulations in the northern part of dianchi lake in 1980 which is the same as in the simulation of a normal flow year therefore the wind field simulation of dianchi lake is accurate to further explore the impact of wind on shallow lakes we used the inflow data in normal flow years fig 5 b to simulate the flow field in the following three cases 1 no wind fig 12 a 2 a uniform wind field fig 12 b and 3 an uneven wind field fig 12 c flow field analysis was conducted in the dry season and in the wet season which can represent the two extremes of the year according to the results if there is no wind field the lake surface is almost static in the dry season or the wet season except for the lakeshore because the average annual inflow of all rivers is 6 83 108 m3 a the volume of the lake is 12 89 108 m3 at the average water level of 1886 5 m and the water residence time of the lake is 1 89 a compared with the total amount of lake water the inflow of all rivers into the lake is less therefore it is difficult to affect the flow field of the lake through the inflow volume which can affect only the flow field of the lakeshore by comparing the uniform wind field with the uneven wind field the results of the two cases are found to be completely opposite in the dry season for example when the wind speed is 2 62 m s and the wind direction is southwest the centre of dianchi lake presents a clockwise circulation when the wind is uniform and a counter clockwise circulation when the wind is uneven the flow field is also different in the two cases in the wet season therefore considering only the existence of a uniform wind field is insufficient to improve the simulation accuracy and may even make the simulated flow field opposite to the real situation in this study the wind field in dianchi lake is simulated by the wind sheltering method for the first time but is limited by the lack of measured data we used the two measured flow fields to compose the wind field distribution if there are more accurate measured flow field data subsequent research can further study the uneven distribution of the wind field to improve the simulation accuracy 4 2 3 groundwater and water withdrawals although the proportion of groundwater and water withdrawals is small they play an important role in the lake water balance regarding the influence of groundwater on the calculation of the rivers that enter dianchi lake the amount of water that enters dianchi lake through groundwater is 0 06 108 m3 a which accounts for only 0 88 of the total annual runoff in a normal flow year 6 83 108 m3 a a clay layer is widely developed at the bottom of dianchi lake guo et al 2006 that forms a thick aquiclude which blocks the entrance of karst water and pore water at the bottom of the lake in addition the terrain of the entire basin is higher in the east north and west and lower in the southwest the overall flow direction of groundwater is from the northeast to the southwest which is essentially consistent with the total flow direction of the surface water therefore in this paper groundwater is regarded as a part of the rivers that flow into dianchi lake which has little effect on the simulation regarding the influence of water withdrawals in table 3 the seventh study in this context wu et al 2018 conducted in depth research on the water withdrawals in dianchi lake this study proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from lake dianchi and assessed their impacts on the lake s hydrology the authors concluded that water withdrawals accounted for 19 6 of the total outputs from the lake over the corresponding period water withdrawals occur on the shore of the lake which account for a minority of the annual discharge and the flow direction is opposite to that of the rivers that enter the lake therefore the combination of water withdrawals and inflow into the lake has little effect on the flow calculation results according to water balance theory 4 3 research progress and prospects the research progress related to this study is listed in table 3 it was pointed out that the flow field of a shallow lake is driven by wind through our study of the wind field and flow field at dianchi lake we found that the flow field simulated by a uniform wind field is clockwise while the simulation for a non uniform wind field is counter clockwise therefore the accuracy of the wind field simulation will directly affect the flow field of shallow lakes and indirectly affect the water quality simulation results there are several future research topics that can be further explored based on this study first the temperature of the water supplied by the wdps may be different from the temperature of the water that flows into the lake naturally which may affect the original aquatic ecological structure of the lake the clear water exchange process could lay a foundation for the study of water temperature mixing second the pollutant degradation coefficient in shallow lakes may be affected by the water exchange process the spatial variation of the pollutant degradation coefficient caused by wdps could be further studied third the spatial temporal relationship between the concentrations of characteristic pollutants and the water age could be established and the causes of lake eutrophication could be explained from the perspective of hydrodynamics through the water exchange process 5 conclusions in this study a water age model and particle tracking model were coupled to explore the water exchange process of dianchi lake under the influence of two major wdps the advantage of a coupling model is to evaluate the lake water exchange process from both static and dynamic aspects in addition through the analysis of the hydrological conditions water level inflow stream and external forcing wind field which have an influence on the hydrodynamics of the lake the boundary conditions of three typical years i e a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year were obtained which delineate the upper and lower boundaries of the hydrodynamics in the lake this is conducive to our overall evaluation of the water exchange process of the lake the water exchange process results showed that in each scenario the water mass in the lake generally circulates around a circle of fixed size internal counter clockwise circulation arises near the centre of the lake the largest proportion of the water age occurs without exception at the centre of dianchi lake the distribution of the water age exhibits a radial distribution and decreases from the centre of the lake to the shore more importantly the increase in river flow by the wdps will reduce the water age over the entire lake when the annual water diversion volume accounts for 41 of the lake water volume it can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 27 40 and when the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume it can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 the external input conditions of the model especially the wind field have a great influence on the water exchange process of shallow lakes accordingly the uneven wind field on the surface of the lake was simulated by a verification of the measured flow field and the simulated flow field the wind field simulation results show that the wind sheltering coefficient should be considered to simulate the wind field in the hydrodynamic simulation of shallow lakes and considering only the uniform wind field may result in the opposite actual flow direction of the lake credit authorship contribution statement fangjun peng conceptualization methodology software writing original draft kefeng li supervision funding

5000,for shallow lakes the water exchange process is a crucial factor that affects lake eutrophication which can be solved by a water diversion project wdp however the water exchange process in shallow lakes is complex and affected by hydrological characteristics the water level and inflow stream and external forcing the wind field it is of profound significance to evaluate the process of lake water exchange by combining dynamic and static methods in this study for hydrological characterization a morlet wavelet analysis was used for the periodic analysis of 24 year water level data the monthly discharge of the main rivers over three hydrological years was calculated by a hydrological frequency curve and water balance theory the external wind field was studied by the wind sheltering coefficient to simulate an uneven distribution the water age model and particle tracking model were coupled to explore the water exchange process of dianchi lake with the influence of two major wdps the results show that in each scenario the distribution of the water age presents a radial distribution and decreases in age from the centre of the lake to the shore and the largest proportion of the oldest water occurs without exception at the centre of dianchi lake moreover the water mass in dianchi lake generally circulates counter clockwise around a circle of a fixed size when the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp and the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp are combined for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords water exchange process water age particle tracking water diversion project wind field hydrological characteristics 1 introduction the eutrophication of shallow lakes has become a worldwide environmental problem meerhoff et al 2012 munar et al 2019 munar et al 2018 as a hydrodynamic characteristic in shallow lakes the water exchange process is a crucial factor that affects lake eutrophication huang et al 2016b wu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 which is caused by the long residence time of lake water khorasani et al 2018 yang et al 2018b the water exchange process of a lake is usually evaluated as a whole by the water residence time which is obtained by dividing the volume of the lake by the total inflow if the residence time of the water in a lake is long polluted water will be difficult to replace and the pollutants will stay in the lake for a long time djihouessi and aina 2018 li et al 2017 however the water exchange process in shallow lakes is complex and affected by hydrological conditions the water level inflow etc and external forcing the wind field the water residence time alone does not reflect the time effect of hydrodynamic processes on material circulation exchange and renewal moreover water diversion projects wdps are frequently used to solve the problem of lake water exchange in the near future which can reduce the residence time of the water in lakes and improve the water quality yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 zhu et al 2008 for shallow lakes a wdp usually directs water into lakes by artificial channels and natural rivers annys et al 2019 dadaser celik et al 2009 which has a significant influence on a lake s hydrodynamics urrutia et al 2019 therefore it is urgent to simulate the water exchange process of lakes as accurately as possible as this process is affected by the hydrological conditions and external forcing dianchi lake a typical plateau shallow lake is one of the most eutrophic lakes in china the main reason for the water pollution in dianchi lake is that the lake is located in the lower reaches of kunming city and its lowest level lies in rural and urban areas huang et al 2014 yan et al 2019 with the increasing population urbanization and modernization around the lake a large amount of rural and urban domestic sewage is discharged into dianchi lake this rapid urbanization and industrialization leads to the excessive consumption of clean water resources in the upper reaches of the basin and the lack of clean water supplies further exacerbates the deterioration of the lake to solve the deterioration of water quality caused by the retention of lake water several studies have reported that a wdp might improve the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources kuo et al 2019 li et al 2016 yu et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 in january 2014 the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp officially supplied water to dianchi lake by 2025 the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp will also be completed and supply water to dianchi lake which will be the largest and most highly invested in water resource allocation project in southwestern china however there has been almost no specific research on the impact of the aforementioned two important wdps on the water exchange process the hydrological conditions and wind field are the basis for an accurate study of the water exchange process affected by wdps in shallow lakes in terms of the hydrological conditions some studies have used different water levels and water diversion scenarios as variables to explore the hydrodynamics of dianchi lake liu et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 other studies have analysed the importance of the condition of the inflow calculation through the existing data zhou et al 2014 these studies illustrated the significance of the water level and inflow stream as hydrological characteristics but did not apply the existing data to establish a general case from the specific details in terms of the wind field some studies have not considered the wind in the model calculation other studies have considered the wind over the entire dianchi lake to be uniform and constant however it has been proven by flow field analysis that wind plays an important role in the formation of the flow field in shallow lakes cheng et al 2012 due to the blocking by xishan mountain the distribution of the wind field at dianchi lake is uneven therefore the study of uneven wind fields is of great significance for the further study of the hydrodynamics in dianchi lake in this study we investigated the water exchange process before and after the wdps with the influence of hydrological characteristics and external forcing first in terms of the hydrological characteristics we analysed the periodicity of long series water level data and the typical annual discharge of the main rivers that enter the lake which laid the foundation for the analysis of the lake water exchange aronica and candela 2007 bormann et al 2011 gualtieri et al 2018 second in terms of the external wind field the distribution of the uneven wind field in dianchi lake was further explored which can lay a foundation for further studies third we proposed a coupled model of water age and particle tracking to evaluate the process of water exchange in lakes the water age of lakes informs us when the water at one point in the lake will be replaced li et al 2011 shen and lin 2006 particle tracking is helpful to understand the process of lake water movement basser et al 2019 izbicki et al 2004 li et al 2013 the water age and particle tracking can help explain the change in the water exchange process before and after the wdps tan and zhang 2018 zeng et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 accordingly in contrast to previous studies we can simultaneously evaluate the water exchange process affected by wdps in different periods wet years normal flow years and dry years the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the periodicity of the hydrological characteristics with long time series data 2 research the effect of external forcing the wind field on the flow field in the lake and 3 study the water exchange process in the lake that is affected by the wdps through the water age and particle tracking 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is presented in fig 1 dianchi lake is situated in yunnan province in southwest china according to the survey of the kunming surveying and mapping institute and the kunming dianchi administration bureau the area of the basin lake is 2920 km2 and the lake surface area is 293 km2 with a normal water level of 1887 4 m this means that under normal conditions dianchi lake is 1887 4 m above the sea level of huanghai china the mean depth of the lake is 4 4 m around the lake there are thirteen main rivers on the north east and south sides on the west side xishan mountain with a height of 2477 m has a significant influence on the distribution of the wind field on the lake surface a small lake caohai lake is separated from dianchi lake by haigeng dam therefore there is little water exchange between these two lakes in addition there is only one river that runs out of dianchi lake which is called haikouhe hkh or tanglangchuan tlc and it is situated on the southwest side of the lake the bottom elevation of dianchi lake is between approximately 1879 m and 1889 m eight national control points are distributed in dianchi lake for the purpose of inspection and supervision at the national level to speed up water replacement in dianchi lake a water diversion scheme was proposed in the study on the water quality change of the kunming section of the second phase project in central yunnan and its impact on the water environment of the backwater lake reservoir most of the wdps are tunnels with a diameter of approximately 3 10 m the two water diversion processes are shown in table 1 one wdp the niulanjiang water diversion project nwdp was officially opened in january 2014 all the water diverted by the nwdp into dianchi lake is through the panlongjiang plj river the design of the water diversion process is that in one year the water diversion should be decreased in the dry season and increased in the wet season another wdp the dianzhong water diversion project dwdp is under construction and will be completed by 2025 the inflow ratio of the supplementary plj river and bxh river is 2 1 2 2 data sources we collected monthly precipitation and evaporation data and daily water level data from 1964 to 1987 from the hydrology yearbook of the people s republic of china fig 2 a regarding the water level we refer to elevation datum points so that different datum points selected in different studies can be converted to a unified framework in this study the water level datum is based on the huanghai 1956 vertical datum fig 1 a the data sampling point of the yearbook is from the haigeng hydrological station located in the northern part of dianchi lake as shown in fig 1 evaporation data from june to september 1968 and the entire year of 1969 are unavailable in this study we took the average values of precipitation and evaporation over 24 years to construct monthly precipitation and evaporation histograms fig 2 b and an accumulation line chart fig 2 b fig 2 b shows that the precipitation from june to september is greater than the evaporation and the maximum accumulation is in august at 60 92 mm month zhang et al 2013 from october to may of the following year the evaporation is greater than the precipitation and the maximum accumulation loss is 212 98 mm month in march the daily water level data for 24 years were used for a morlet wavelet analysis the average monthly precipitation and evaporation values were utilized to calculate the inflow into dianchi lake according to the water balance principle jarihani et al 2015 li et al 2019 riveros iregui et al 2017 wu et al 2018 2 3 hydrological characteristics analysis 2 3 1 morlet wavelet analysis all hydrological processes between the ecological system and the atmosphere can be regarded as time varying periodic signals yang et al 2018a a hydrologic time series can be achieved by employing models such as the shot noise model fragments model autoregressive moving average model artificial neural networks anns stochastic disaggregation model markov chain model bootstrapping method and wavelets among others niu and sivakumar 2013 to reveal the various change periods hidden in the time series a morlet wavelet analysis can reflect the variation in the system at different time scales and obtain a qualitative assessment of future development labat et al 2000 the continuous fluctuation of the lake water level with time is the result of many factors this fluctuation belongs to a continuous non stationary sequence and contains multi time scale characteristics the periodicity of the water level series in dianchi lake can be revealed by a wavelet analysis the daily water level data in dianchi lake from 1964 to 1987 according to the haigeng hydrological station are shown in fig 2 a a morlet wavelet analysis was used for the water level data and revealed that the oscillation information in the lake water environmental field includes both positive and negative peaks over a wide range cheng et al 2017 kovács et al 2010 2 3 2 flow calculation method in typical years in this study a flow calculation method in three typical years is proposed which can obtain the river flow under the three situations of wet normal flow and dry years the wet year represents a relatively large flow the dry year represents a relatively small flow and a normal year represents the average situation these discharges in three typical years are used as the boundary conditions of the water age and particle tracking model which can determine the strong replacement wet year weak replacement dry year and medium replacement normal flow year of lake water this approach lays a useful foundation for a water exchange analysis step 1 hydrological frequency curve calculation a pearson type iii distribution was used for the hydrological frequency analysis as recommended by the water resources council us wrc bobée 1975 lei et al 2018 phien and ajirajah 1984 the hydrological frequency curve was obtained by a numerical simulation and then fitted by the ocular curve fitting method markus et al 2007 whalen et al 2002 as the computing speed increases the accuracy of the curve fitting is higher in the optimum curve fitting method meng et al 2015 the annual total inflow data for 58 years from 1953 to 2010 are taken from the comprehensive improvement scheme of the water environment in dianchi basin first the original data x m are ranked from large to small second the empirical frequency is calculated by 1 p m n 1 100 where m is the number sequence in descending order n is the quantity of the hydrological data and p is the empirical frequency that corresponds to x m in addition the point p x m is drawn on probability paper then the variation coefficient c v and the skewness coefficient c s are calculated as follows 2 c v 1 n 1 m 1 n k m 1 2 3 c s m 1 n k m 1 3 n 3 c v 3 where k m x m e x is the module ratio coefficient and e x is the average annual inflow finally the hydrological frequency curve discussed by lei et al is drawn lei et al 2018 the standard issued by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china which is named the standard for essential terminology and symbols in hydrology gb t50095 2014 gives the hydrological frequency definition of a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 these three typical years include the upper and lower limits of river flow step 2 flow calculation of the main rivers the thirteen main rivers that flow into dianchi lake were chosen as the inflow boundary conditions dai et al 2016 gao et al 2015 the rivers with too little flow are merged into the 13 nearby rivers under natural conditions the total annual runoff into the lake is 6 83 108 m3 a in a normal flow year of which the plj river accounts for 21 the bxh river accounts for 8 the lyh river accounts for 14 the cgh river accounts for 11 the byh river accounts for 11 the ddh river accounts for 10 the dqh river accounts for 5 the mlh river accounts for 4 the llh river accounts for 4 the ynh river accounts for 4 the hh river accounts for 3 the gch river accounts for 3 and the nch river accounts for 2 among these rivers the plj river and bxh river are the rivers that are diverted by the two wdps among the 13 rivers the small rivers did not have measured flow data therefore we used the watershed area ratio to predict the monthly streamflow gianfagna et al 2015 hodges 2013 the monthly flow processes of the plj bxh and tlc rivers hkh river from 1999 to 2009 were reported by zhou et al 2014 these data include the monthly flow processes of wet years 25 normal flow years 50 and dry years 75 the calculations of the monthly discharges of the remaining 11 inflow rivers in a hydrological year are as follows 4 q 12 y q 13 y q x y s 12 s 13 s x 5 q x y 1 12 q x y t y 6 q 14 q eva q 1 q 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 q pre 7 q 1 q 2 q 11 α q 1 q 2 q 11 where x is the number of rivers y is the month from january to december q x y represents the flow of river number x in month y m3 s s x is the drainage area of the river number x from gao et al 2014 t y is the time in month s y q x is the annual runoff of river number x m3 a q eva is the annual evaporation from dianchi lake m3 a and q pre is the yearly precipitation at dianchi lake m3 a we can use formulas 4 and 5 to obtain the annual runoff of the remaining 11 rivers q 1 q 2 q 11 with the watershed area ratio method however there will be an error as the total inflow is not equal to the total outflow therefore we calculate the actual annual runoff of the 11 rivers by using formula 6 which is q 1 q 2 q 11 therefore the coefficient of correction α can be calculated by formula 7 and α 1 for river numbers 12 and 13 the known monthly flow processes lack data from 1999 to 2009 another coefficient of correction β can be calculated to make the total inflow fit the hydrological frequency in which the typical hydrological year is a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 8 q 1 q 2 q 13 β q 1 q 2 q 11 q 12 q 13 where q 1 q 2 q 13 is from the hydrological frequency curve q 1 q 2 q 13 q q pre and q includes q 25 q 50 and q 75 in the hydrological frequency curve finally the monthly flow processes of the 13 rivers can be obtained in a wet year 25 a normal flow year 50 and a dry year 75 with the following formula 9 q x y α β q x y here the calculation of groundwater and water withdrawals has been included in the water balance groundwater accounts for 0 88 of the total annual runoff in normal flow years 6 83 108 m3 a water withdrawals account for 1 51 of the total outputs each year 2 4 wind sheltering coefficient analysis we studied the wind field of dianchi lake by using the wind sheltering coefficient which was previously shown to apply to lake surfaces van den hoek et al 2015 the wind sheltering coefficient which ranges from zero to one largely depends on the topography around the lake and reflects the degree of the wind field on the surface of the lake covered by the surrounding mountains or buildings li et al 2015 mcjannet et al 2017 as a general rule a very large lake has effectively no wind sheltering i e the wind sheltering coefficient equals 1 markfort et al 2010 this means that the wind field of the entire lake is typically evenly distributed that is the wind direction and speed at each point in the lake are the same at the same time this discussion emphasises the deficiency of most previous studies on dianchi lake as xishan mountain at 2477 m above sea level west of dianchi lake fig 1 has a blocking effect on the wind field of dianchi lake and results in an uneven distribution of the wind field which means that the wind sheltering coefficient on the surface of dianchi lake is not equal to 1 here the wind sheltering coefficient values between 0 and 1 were defined for an orthogonal curvilinear grid of 3211 cells and the final wind field distribution map of dianchi lake was obtained by verifying the flow field of the lake that is affected by the surface wind field and the measured flow field the monthly data of the wind speed and direction at dianchi lake are the average values of 26 years from 1990 to 2015 as discussed by wang et al 2019 2 5 coupling water exchange model the coupling water exchange model includes a water age model and a particle tracking model which have been separately validated for some water exchange studies the water age model describes the water age of each point on the two dimensional plane of the lake at a certain time which can be considered to be a relatively static model javaheri et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 the particle tracking model describes the trajectory of a liquid particle on the two dimensional plane of the lake over a period of time which can be considered to be a relatively dynamic model chen et al 2020 cousquer et al 2018 the two models complement one another and evaluate the process of the lake water exchange from dynamic and static aspects in this study we used the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc to calculate the water age and particle tracking of dianchi lake zhang et al 2016 the simulation time of the water age model was set at 5 years for a pre simulation and 1 year for a normal simulation we used the calculated hydrological conditions in january under wet normal flow and dry years as model spin up times the simulation time of the particle tracking model was 1 month for the dry season we used february as the model spin up time and for the wet season we used august as the model spin up time 2 5 1 water age mathematical model the water age at a point in a lake is defined as the time elapsed since a water mass entered the lake and the age is prescribed to be zero at the entrance of the lake huang et al 2016a accordingly the water age is set at zero at the entrance of the 13 rivers to the lake the transport equations for calculating the tracer and age concentration can be written as follows gao et al 2018 gong et al 2009 liu et al 2015 10 c t x t u c t x k c t x 0 11 α t x t u α t x k α t x c t x where the tracer concentration c t x and age concentration α t x are functions of the time t and location x u denotes the velocity vector and k is the diffusivity tensor the water age a t x can then be obtained as follows 12 a t x α t x c t x the model grid adopts the orthogonal curvilinear grid of 3211 cells fig 1 which has a better effect on the hydrodynamic simulation than an orthogonal grid zhang et al 2016 furthermore to calculate the decreasing rate of the water age in the centre point of the lake under a certain diversion flow it is assumed that the water age of the centre point under the natural condition is an and that the water age of the centre point under the action of water diversion is awdp then the water age reduction rate of the lake centre that is affected by the diversion flow is an awdp an 2 5 2 particle tracking mathematical model the differential equations for the lagrangian movement of particles are as follows craig 2009 13 dx d x drift d x ran u d h x dt 2 d h dt 2 p 1 14 dy d y drift d y ran v d h y dt 2 d h dt 2 p 1 15 dz d z drift d z ran w d v z dt 2 d v dt 2 p 1 where dt is the time step and p is a random number from a uniformly distributed random variable generator with a mean of 0 5 when transformed by using 2p 1 the random component has a mean of zero and a range from 1 to 1 the transformed random value allows the diffusion term to move particles forward and backward about the advected position to determine the lagrangian trajectory of the particle eqs 13 15 were incorporated into the model the numerical solution was separately divided into advective transport and random components as described above in this study we disabled the random components for either the horizontal or vertical directions naves et al 2019 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics of dianchi lake 3 1 1 morlet wavelet analysis of the water level the morlet wavelet transform was utilized to analyse the periodic variation characteristics in the water level series at dianchi lake the real time frequency distribution of the wavelet transform coefficients is presented in fig 3 a and b the x and y axes represent the time year and scale respectively and the results show pronounced cyclical changes in the water level according to the yearly wavelet analysis shown in fig 3 b the fluctuation in the water level series is recognizable on the scales of 13 15 among them the fluctuation of the water level on the scale of 14 appears at 5 high and low water level oscillation centres the five plus or minus signs represented in the figure which have the characteristics of full time distribution on the scale of 14 the real part of the wavelet coefficients was negative from 1965 to 1968 1974 1977 and 1983 1986 which indicates that the water level was falling the real part of the wavelet coefficients was positive from 1969 to 1973 and 1978 1982 which indicates that the water level was rising therefore the water level of the lake had a process of low high low high low and the average period was approximately 7 years according to the monthly wavelet analysis shown in fig 3 a the 13 25 scale change rule of the water level applies during low frequency cyclic evolution on the scale of 18 there are 48 distinct high and low water level oscillation centres in 24 years from 1964 to 1987 moreover the average period was approximately one year accordingly the results show that the water level changes periodically with the main period of one year and the secondary period of seven years the main period of one year shows that the water level changes little from year to year therefore it is feasible to use the average water level from 1964 to 1987 as shown in fig 2 b as the boundary condition of the subsequent simulation 3 1 2 hydrological frequency analysis of the main river streamflow through the 58 blue points that represent the yearly total inflow into dianchi lake from 1953 to 2010 the fitted theoretical frequency curve is shown as a red line in fig 4 the average value among them is 9 85 108 m3 a because the goodness of fit of the curve obtained by different cv and cs values is different that is the r2 values are different it is necessary to adjust the cv and cs values repeatedly to maximize the final goodness of fit which is an r2 value closest to 1 after repeated fitting the variation coefficient c v is 0 30 and the skewness coefficient c s is 0 45 this regression line has a high goodness of fit as represented by a high r2 value of 0 985 the first hydrological frequency of 25 corresponds to a wet year with an inflow of 11 70 108 m3 a the second hydrological frequency of 50 corresponds to a normal flow year with an inflow of 9 63 108 m3 a the third hydrological frequency of 75 corresponds to a dry year with an inflow of 7 75 108 m3 a depending on the water balance between the total inflow and total outflow in dianchi lake we can determine the monthly inflow of the 13 rivers in a wet year fig 5 a a normal flow year fig 5 b and a dry year fig 5 c the red columns represent the monthly natural flow which represents the years before 2014 the green columns represent the supplementary flow of the nwdp which represents the years from 2014 to the present the blue columns represent the supplementary flow of the dwdp which is expected to be opened in 2025 after the implementation of the nwdp the water supplement of the nwdp fully replenished the plj river therefore only the plj river is represented in the green columns the annual inflows of the plj river into dianchi lake are 8 08 108 m3 a in a wet year 7 92 108 m3 a in a normal flow year and 7 47 108 m3 a in a dry year after the nwdp which account for 54 60 and 65 of the total flow from the 13 rivers that flow into the lake respectively the dwdp will supplement the plj river and the bxh river which are represented in the blue columns the annual inflows of the plj river plus the bxh river into dianchi lake are expected to be 14 41 108 m3 a in a wet year 14 09 108 m3 a in a normal flow year and 13 45 108 m3 a in a dry year after the nwdp and dwdp which account for 70 74 and 79 of the total flow from the 13 rivers that flow into the lake respectively as can be seen from fig 5 with the implementation of the two wdps the proportion of the flow of the wdps will be greater and the proportion of the flow under natural conditions will be lower june to november is the wet season while december to may is the dry season 3 2 wind field distribution at dianchi lake as shown table 3 the first study in this context cheng et al 2012 mentioned that research from tsinghua university initially showed that the blocking by xishan mountain may reduce the wind speed by 25 which can be used to simulate the region nevertheless the study did not determine which aspect should be reduced by 25 we referred to this research for further exploration the results of the temporal and spatial distribution of the wind field on the surface of dianchi lake are shown in fig 6 from the perspective of the spatial distribution the wind sheltering coefficient in the south of dianchi lake south of the latitude line where the dianchi water outlet is located is equal to 1 in the north of dianchi lake north of the latitude line where the dianchi water outlet is located the wind sheltering coefficient is 0 75 near the left bank at approximately 0 5 km and the remaining values are 1 from the perspective of the temporal distribution the wind speed is greater in the dry season than in the wet season the wind speed in march is the greatest which is 2 83 and the wind speed in august is the smallest which is 1 58 in addition south westerly winds or southerly winds prevail throughout the year 3 3 water exchange process in dianchi lake 3 3 1 water age distribution we calculated three scenarios in three typical years namely a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year the three scenarios are evaluated in the natural conditions after the nwdp and after the nwdp and dwdp every typical year includes the wet season and the dry season with august representing the wet season and february representing the dry season in each scenario the largest proportion of the water age occurs at the centre of dianchi lake without exception because dianchi lake exhibits a counter clockwise circulation overall fig 11 when the water body is closer to the circulation centre it is less likely to participate in the lake water cycle under natural conditions the discharge of the rivers into dianchi lake is small in the dry season of the three typical years therefore the distribution of the water age presents a radial distribution that decreases from the centre of the lake to the shore fig 7 a c e in addition when comparing the dry season and the wet season in the three typical years the water age at the centre of dianchi lake is approximately 50 d higher in the wet season than in the dry season fig 7 a d and f because the discharge is greater in the wet season than in the dry season the lake water more easily circulates during the wet season in addition it is difficult for the water at the centre of the lake to escape from the internal circulation fig 8 after the nwdp dark blue areas can be seen in the northern part of dianchi lake in each typical year fig 7 a f where the water age is less than 100 d because the replenishment of the nwdp fully applies to the plj river and the inflow of the plj river is located in the northern part of dianchi lake therefore the water age is reduced to less than 100 d in contrast to the water age in natural conditions after the nwdp and dwdp there is little difference in the water age distribution between the dry and wet seasons fig 7 a f in addition the water age in the area near xishan mountain decreases significantly compared to the natural conditions and after the nwdp this outcome occurs because the counter clockwise circulation applies to the supplementary water for the nwdp and dwdp flow the water age values in the centre of dianchi lake under various conditions are shown in table 2 when only the nwdp is used for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 41 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 27 40 when nwdp and dwdp are combined for water diversion the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume which can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 3 3 2 particle tracking distribution a particle tracking simulation of the three scenarios in the three typical years shows the circulation flow in dianchi lake in each typical year the particle trajectory of february in the dry season and august in the wet season is shown there are eight initial sites for particle tracking which are located at eight national control points the results are as follows first internal circulation is formed in all scenarios near the centre of the lake such as the two national control points of gysz and byk shown in fig 8 a f a f and a f second through a contrast analysis of the two national control points of gysz and byk the circulation formed by the water mass is larger in gysz than in byk in the dry season fig 8 a a c c and e e but is smaller in the wet season fig 8 b b d d and f f third compared with the dry season and the wet season in each scenario of the three typical years the water masses at the four national control points of ljy gysx gysd and dcn are on almost the same circulation line in the dry season fig 8 a a c c and e e however in the wet season fig 8 b b d d and f f only the two national control points of ljy and gysd are on the same circulation line the difference between the inflow conditions in the wet season and the dry season is that the overall inflow in the wet season is greater therefore in the dry season due to the small inflow the entire lake presents a counter clockwise water cycle however in the wet season the increased inflow can disrupt the counter clockwise water cycle on the lake bank which can make the water near the lakeshore flow out of the lake and increase the water exchange of the lake 4 discussion 4 1 water exchange process affected by wdps a pre simulation is usually employed to stabilize the simulation results of the water age there are 8 national control points in dianchi lake fig 1 which were extracted to analyse the variation in the water age over time as affected by the wdps in a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year fig 9 here we pre simulated for five years liu et al 2014 and actually simulated for one year because the hydrological conditions and the effect of external force wind brought in by the simulation changed in a year cycle the simulated water age also changed in a year cycle when the change in the water age is essentially the same in the fifth year as in the sixth year the pre simulation can be considered to meet the requirements by comparison with the flow field the two national control points of gysz and byk are located at the two focal points of the elliptic counter clockwise circulation fig 11 this finding indicates that among all points these two points are the least likely to impact the external circulation of the lake therefore the water ages of gysz and byk were the highest in every scenario fig 9 between these two points gysz had a higher water age therefore if the most difficult stable point gysz were to reach the water age balance then the entire lake simulation would reach a balance compared with the highest water age of gysz in the fifth and sixth years the proportion of the water age could be within 1 in the scenario after the nwdp or dwdp fig 9 a c and a c among the scenarios the most difficult to stabilize was a dry year under natural conditions fig 9 c however the proportion of the water age could also be stabilized within 6 therefore in general the error in the water age distribution can be effectively avoided by a 5 year pre simulation dead water zones can be formed in lakes the reason for their formation is that it is difficult for the water that newly enters the lake from the river to reach the zone thus the water circulation process in the zone is maintained at a low level for dianchi lake it can be seen from fig 1 that the lake is a radial sink which means that all of the surrounding rivers flow into dianchi lake therefore the dead water zones will not be formed near the lakeshore but in the centre of the lake due to the counter clockwise circulation of dianchi lake as a whole fig 11 the water mass in the lake generally circulates around a circle of fixed size fig 8 therefore the water masses located in separate circulation circles cannot readily communicate with one another for the rivers with small flows their water masses circulate along the lake shore tu et al 2017 it is unlikely for these masses to reach the centre of the lake this effect leads to the largest value of the water age at the centre of the lake fig 7 through the distribution of the water age and particle tracking in the wet and dry seasons it can be found that compared with the dry season the wet season with increased flow can disrupt the circulation at ljy gysx gysd and dcn the water mass at ljy and gysd is restricted to only one circle and this circle is smaller than the others fig 8 this means that the water age of the lakeshore is lower in the wet season than in the dry season due to the disruption of the circulation on the lakeshore however due to the more compact circulation at the centre of the lake in the wet season the water age at the centre of the lake is greater in the wet season than in the dry season fig 7 from the aspect of the water age the implementation of the wdps can effectively reduce the water age at the lake centre and increase the water exchange process 4 2 model accuracy and uncertainty analysis 4 2 1 inflow the monthly runoff in the three typical years is also calculated by using the watershed area ratio method this method requires the assumption that the town and country conditions are identical in each river basin however the calculated monthly discharge of the 13 rivers is confirmed to be sufficiently accurate by comparing the results with the river discharge values mentioned in other papers fig 10 the upper sideline of the box chart represents a wet year with a hydrological frequency of 25 the middle line represents a normal year with a hydrological frequency of 50 and the lower sideline represents a dry year with a hydrological frequency of 75 despite its preliminary character this study can reveal the monthly flow process in wet years normal flow years and dry years 4 2 2 wind field we can find the measured data of the flow field of dianchi lake in the report by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research study on the effect of water replenishment of the niulanjiang diversion project the actual measurements of dianchi lake were carried out by the nanjing institute of geography and limnology at the chinese academy of sciences in january 1980 and may 1983 the relative water depth of the measuring points was 0 1 m in 1980 the total inflow into dianchi lake was 9 83 108 m3 a which corresponds to a frequency of 49 according to fig 4 and represents a normal flow year in 1983 the total inflow was 12 11 108 m3 a which corresponds to a frequency of 22 according to fig 4 and represents a wet year therefore the inflow in a normal flow year fig 5 b was used as the boundary condition to simulate the flow field in 1980 and the inflow in a wet year fig 5 a was used as the boundary condition to simulate the flow field in 1983 the measured value agrees well with the simulated value fig 11 shows that there is always a large counter clockwise circulation in the central part of dianchi lake regardless of whether it is a wet year or a normal flow year this is because xishan mountain blocks the surface wind of dianchi lake which results in an uneven distribution of the lake surface wind fig 6 a there were also two small circulations in the northern part of dianchi lake in 1980 which is the same as in the simulation of a normal flow year therefore the wind field simulation of dianchi lake is accurate to further explore the impact of wind on shallow lakes we used the inflow data in normal flow years fig 5 b to simulate the flow field in the following three cases 1 no wind fig 12 a 2 a uniform wind field fig 12 b and 3 an uneven wind field fig 12 c flow field analysis was conducted in the dry season and in the wet season which can represent the two extremes of the year according to the results if there is no wind field the lake surface is almost static in the dry season or the wet season except for the lakeshore because the average annual inflow of all rivers is 6 83 108 m3 a the volume of the lake is 12 89 108 m3 at the average water level of 1886 5 m and the water residence time of the lake is 1 89 a compared with the total amount of lake water the inflow of all rivers into the lake is less therefore it is difficult to affect the flow field of the lake through the inflow volume which can affect only the flow field of the lakeshore by comparing the uniform wind field with the uneven wind field the results of the two cases are found to be completely opposite in the dry season for example when the wind speed is 2 62 m s and the wind direction is southwest the centre of dianchi lake presents a clockwise circulation when the wind is uniform and a counter clockwise circulation when the wind is uneven the flow field is also different in the two cases in the wet season therefore considering only the existence of a uniform wind field is insufficient to improve the simulation accuracy and may even make the simulated flow field opposite to the real situation in this study the wind field in dianchi lake is simulated by the wind sheltering method for the first time but is limited by the lack of measured data we used the two measured flow fields to compose the wind field distribution if there are more accurate measured flow field data subsequent research can further study the uneven distribution of the wind field to improve the simulation accuracy 4 2 3 groundwater and water withdrawals although the proportion of groundwater and water withdrawals is small they play an important role in the lake water balance regarding the influence of groundwater on the calculation of the rivers that enter dianchi lake the amount of water that enters dianchi lake through groundwater is 0 06 108 m3 a which accounts for only 0 88 of the total annual runoff in a normal flow year 6 83 108 m3 a a clay layer is widely developed at the bottom of dianchi lake guo et al 2006 that forms a thick aquiclude which blocks the entrance of karst water and pore water at the bottom of the lake in addition the terrain of the entire basin is higher in the east north and west and lower in the southwest the overall flow direction of groundwater is from the northeast to the southwest which is essentially consistent with the total flow direction of the surface water therefore in this paper groundwater is regarded as a part of the rivers that flow into dianchi lake which has little effect on the simulation regarding the influence of water withdrawals in table 3 the seventh study in this context wu et al 2018 conducted in depth research on the water withdrawals in dianchi lake this study proposed a coupled simulation optimization model to determine the unauthorized water withdrawals from lake dianchi and assessed their impacts on the lake s hydrology the authors concluded that water withdrawals accounted for 19 6 of the total outputs from the lake over the corresponding period water withdrawals occur on the shore of the lake which account for a minority of the annual discharge and the flow direction is opposite to that of the rivers that enter the lake therefore the combination of water withdrawals and inflow into the lake has little effect on the flow calculation results according to water balance theory 4 3 research progress and prospects the research progress related to this study is listed in table 3 it was pointed out that the flow field of a shallow lake is driven by wind through our study of the wind field and flow field at dianchi lake we found that the flow field simulated by a uniform wind field is clockwise while the simulation for a non uniform wind field is counter clockwise therefore the accuracy of the wind field simulation will directly affect the flow field of shallow lakes and indirectly affect the water quality simulation results there are several future research topics that can be further explored based on this study first the temperature of the water supplied by the wdps may be different from the temperature of the water that flows into the lake naturally which may affect the original aquatic ecological structure of the lake the clear water exchange process could lay a foundation for the study of water temperature mixing second the pollutant degradation coefficient in shallow lakes may be affected by the water exchange process the spatial variation of the pollutant degradation coefficient caused by wdps could be further studied third the spatial temporal relationship between the concentrations of characteristic pollutants and the water age could be established and the causes of lake eutrophication could be explained from the perspective of hydrodynamics through the water exchange process 5 conclusions in this study a water age model and particle tracking model were coupled to explore the water exchange process of dianchi lake under the influence of two major wdps the advantage of a coupling model is to evaluate the lake water exchange process from both static and dynamic aspects in addition through the analysis of the hydrological conditions water level inflow stream and external forcing wind field which have an influence on the hydrodynamics of the lake the boundary conditions of three typical years i e a wet year a normal flow year and a dry year were obtained which delineate the upper and lower boundaries of the hydrodynamics in the lake this is conducive to our overall evaluation of the water exchange process of the lake the water exchange process results showed that in each scenario the water mass in the lake generally circulates around a circle of fixed size internal counter clockwise circulation arises near the centre of the lake the largest proportion of the water age occurs without exception at the centre of dianchi lake the distribution of the water age exhibits a radial distribution and decreases from the centre of the lake to the shore more importantly the increase in river flow by the wdps will reduce the water age over the entire lake when the annual water diversion volume accounts for 41 of the lake water volume it can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 27 40 and when the annual water diversion volume accounts for 76 of the lake water volume it can reduce the water age of the lake centre by 38 52 the external input conditions of the model especially the wind field have a great influence on the water exchange process of shallow lakes accordingly the uneven wind field on the surface of the lake was simulated by a verification of the measured flow field and the simulated flow field the wind field simulation results show that the wind sheltering coefficient should be considered to simulate the wind field in the hydrodynamic simulation of shallow lakes and considering only the uniform wind field may result in the opposite actual flow direction of the lake credit authorship contribution statement fangjun peng conceptualization methodology software writing original draft kefeng li supervision funding

5001,the influence of entropy values obtained under different multiscale permutation entropy scales on the complexity and unconstrained extreme value problem of traditional bionics algorithms was assessed the multiscale permutation entropy mspe eigenvalue calculation method based on the chaotic moth flame optimization based projection pursuit threat target evaluation cmfo pptte model is proposed cmfo pptte mspe the cmfo pptte mspe not only solves the problems of rough calculation and information loss in traditional eigenvalue calculation but also improves the shortcomings of slow convergence and local optimality in the intelligent bionic algorithm for this purpose the monthly precipitation of 13 administrative regions in heilongjiang province under the global precipitation climatology centre dataset gpcc from 1967 to 2017 was evaluated to improve the precipitation complexity entropy accuracy the main influencing factors were altitude p 0 05 water area p 0 05 urban construction area p 0 05 and forestland area p 0 01 radial basis function rbf neural networks were used to forecast the precipitation in heilongjiang province over 36 months and a better forecast was obtained to verify the rationality of cmfo pptte mspe under gpcc data compared with the situ data it is found that gpcc data can more accurately classify the complexity grade of daxing anling region at the same time the administrative discrimination of gpcc data 1 107 is significantly higher than the situ data 1 023 to verify the rationality of the cmfo pptte mspe the partial mean of mspe mspe pm whale optimization algorithm pptte woa pptte and ω particle swarm optimization pptte ω pso pptte models were also used to calculate the mspe eigenvalues under gpcc data comparisons and evaluations were performed after dividing the grade based on geographical discrimination cmfo pptte mspe 1 107 woa pptte mspe 1 094 w pso pptte mspe 1 090 mspe pm 1 063 and administrative discrimination cmfo pptte mspe 1 146 w pso pptte mspe 1 002 mspe pm 1 012 woa pptte mspe 1 002 the cmfo pptte mspe had a significantly higher distinguishing capabilities than the other algorithms and thus could better distinguish the complexity of precipitation in different regions and geographic locations in summary the cmfo pptte mspe is beneficial for analyzing precipitation complexity and represents a novel approach for mining the fine structural features of regional hydrological series however determining how to apply artificial intelligence algorithms to reasonably calibrate key parameters of the mspe algorithm to further improve the accuracy of complexity diagnosis for hydrological series will be an important avenue of research keywords precipitation complexity algorithm data mining china 1 introduction precipitation is an important hydrological feature in a complex giant system muhammad and widyarto 2004 that is often characterized by uncertainty and chaotic behavior taniguchi 2016 over the long term however chaotic phenomena appear to be less random vallebona et al 2015 as the length of a recorded precipitation time series continuously increases the characteristics of regional precipitation complexity changes become increasingly obvious consequently the regional precipitation cannot be represented in terms of a single changing feature luo et al 2013 the greater the complexity of the characteristics of regional precipitation variations the more factors that are affected during the process of precipitation evolution in the region which increases the difficulty of predicting hydrological features such as precipitation runoff and groundwater resources li et al 2009 as well as to resolving practical problems such as canal head water quantity predictions in irrigation areas zhang et al 2014 urban water management cui et al 2017 and flood peak predictions xu et al 2017 the variational characteristics of precipitation complexity seriously affect the balance and coordinated development of water resource systems li et al 2020 and pose a threat to both industrial and agricultural production and residents living environments therefore it is necessary to develop appropriate methods to study the variational characteristics of precipitation complexity to provide an important reference for the mitigation of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts faiz et al 2020 and provide a practical basis for meteorological hydrological forecasting and water resource management hartmann et al 2016 complexity science first emerged in the 1980s and has gradually matured in various fields of natural science qian et al 1990 in particular the complexity characteristics of regional precipitation has gradually become a popular topic in complexity research liu et al 2018a 2018b with the continuous development of mathematical techniques the methods of measuring the complexity of precipitation are also constantly improving luan et al 2014 niu et al 2013 millán et al 2008 and have yielded meaningful research results however these methods have limitations for long term research and application zhang et al 2019 for example the programming necessary for fractal theory analyses is time consuming and the results lack the ability to facilitate local characterization singh 2013 moreover when performing multifractal calculations analytical solutions can be obtained for only a few special sets which seriously restricts the calculation capabilities korolj et al 2019 although wavelet transform offers noise reduction capabilities and high sensitivity su zhou 2010 its analytical accuracy is not ideal peng et al 2005 and local information is lost from the original signal in the process of noise reduction ji et al 2010 to solve these problems multiscale permutation entropy mspe theory can be applied in the study of precipitation complexity to obtain a concise highly sensitive and highly precise measurement method entropy theory pisano et al 2018 is an important theoretical basis for current complexity research that was developed from thermodynamics and it is widely used in many fields especially in discrete systems with many uncertainties and randomness in particular calculation methods based on the mspe approach are widely used morabito et al 2012 wang and liu 2016 gao et al 2017 in 2005 the mspe algorithm was proposed by aziz and arif 2005 to overcome the problems presented by considering permutation entropy pe at only a single scale and allowing the data to be divided into smaller modules for analysis therefore the calculation process was more sensitive to signal changes and thus avoided the loss of weak signal characteristics this method maintains the advantages of the intuitive results obtained using the pe approach ren 2015 reflects the complexity of the data and yields robust and practical results fan et al 2013 since the mspe algorithm captures only the trends of time series rather than absolute evaluations xi zhu 2015 the average mspe gordon et al 2012 or the mspe partial mean mspe pm chen huang 2016 is commonly calculated as a characteristic index for a certain section of a signal however a large number of calculations and studies have shown that the characteristic index values obtained via this method can lead to the potential omission of information from the results of complexity evaluations chen 2018 zhao et al 2015 to address the shortcomings of the mspe method in obtaining characteristic index values an intelligent bio inspired algorithm can be used to calculate weights for the mspe to improve the calculation accuracy and reduce the occurrence of potential information loss the moth flame optimization mfo algorithm is an intelligent bio inspired optimization algorithm that has the advantages of few parameters to adjust a strong ability to achieve extreme value optimization and ease of incorporation with other problems mirjalili 2015 compared with traditional bio inspired algorithms it offers good convergence accuracy and simple effective and accurate calculations singh prakash 2017 however as the number of dimensions increases the mfo algorithm will have a lower calculation accuracy xu et al 2018 and a slower convergence speed sayed hassanien 2018 moreover the existence of random variables in the mfo algorithm will cause the calculation results to exhibit the unconstrained extremum problem li et al 2017 to address the shortcomings of the mfo algorithm and improve its efficiency li et al 2019 proposed the chaotic mfo based projection pursuit threat target evaluation cmfo pptte model this algorithm increases the randomness in the calculation process realizes a more effective global search process and avoids the phenomenon of slow convergence caused by repeated calculations moreover as an improved version of the original model and algorithm it not only has the ability of the projection pursuit model to solve high dimensional problems but also overcomes the unconstrained extremum problem of the mfo algorithm by means of a penalty coefficient such that the optimal solution is the only definite solution in this paper the cmfo pptte model is combined with the mspe method cmfo pptte mspe to carry out weight processing without modifying the original entropy values to effectively retain the information of the pe value at each scale to the maximum extent the cmfo has strong traversal ability and the conclusions are more reliable when the pptte optimization mechanism is used to determine the unique eigenvalue the cmfo pptte mspe not only solves the problems of rough calculation and information loss in traditional eigenvalue calculation but also improves the shortcomings of slow convergence and local optimality in the intelligent bionic algorithm in summary the objectives of the current research are as follows 1 to explore the possibility of using the cmfo pptte model to improve the traditional mspe method of measuring precipitation complexity 2 to analyze regional precipitation complexity characteristics and possible causes 3 to evaluate the performance of the proposed cmfo pptte mspe complexity measurement algorithm 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area heilongjiang province is the most northeastern provincial administrative region in china and located adjacent to russia and it has 13

wusuli river systems and four large lakes xingkai lake jingpo lake lianhuan lake and wudalianchi lake hui zang 2014 although the province has an intermediate amount of water resources relative to the country in general the vast area and uneven distribution of these water resources lead to a low per capita availability wang jiang 2008 due to spatial differences water resources are abundant in areas adjacent to rivers and lakes although the natural forest areas and some agricultural areas rely on rain fed water sources anonymous 2015 meaning that changes in precipitation have a profound impact on crop growth and forest ecosystem development therefore an analysis of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province can not only extend the literature on complexity theory but also provide important technical support for forest protection agricultural production and water security management 2 2 average deviation calculation to analyze the deviation between the precipitation data in heilongjiang and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and university of delaware udel data the average deviation method is used to calculate the absolute value percentage of the difference between the before and after changes the calculation formula is as follows liu et al 2017 1 b 100 p m p n p n where p m stands for gpcc or udel data and represents p n the situ precipitation data 2 3 multiscale permutation entropy and multiscale permutation entropy partial mean 2 3 1 multiscale permutation entropy mspe the mspe algorithm is an entropy algorithm that combines the coarsening approach used for multiscale entropy analysis with the pe algorithm to define the pe at different scales the properties of the entropy at different scales are assessed based on the entropy values calculated using the pe algorithm the larger the entropy value at a given scale the more complicated the time series is at this scale thus the trends of time series complexity can be judged on the basis of the changes in the entropy values at each scale zheng et al 2016 the specific calculation steps of the mspe algorithm are as follows tiwari et al 2015 1 consider a time series x x i i 1 2 l the coarsening process is expressed as follows 2 y j s j 1 s i j 1 s 1 js x i 1 j l s where y j s j is a multiscale time series and l s is rounded when the scale factor is s 1 the time series is identical to the original series 2 after the extraction of time series at different scales the time associated with y j s is reconstructed as follows 3 y t s y t s y t τ s y t m 1 τ s where m is the number of embedding dimensions and τ is the delay time 3 the reconstructed time series y t s is arranged in ascending order 4 y t j 1 1 τ s y t j 2 1 τ s y t j m 1 τ s when y t j i 1 τ s y t j k 1 τ s exists it is sorted in accordance with the size of r if j i j k then y t j i 1 τ s y t j k 1 τ s the series has m possible arrangements after sorting a set of permutations can be obtained for each vector 5 π j j 1 j 2 j m 4 the number of occurrences nl of each permutation type is counted where 1 l m the probability of the first permutation is expressed as follows 6 p l s n l l s m 1 5 the pe of the time series at multiple scales is defined as follows 7 h p s l 1 m p l s l n p l s when p l s 1 m h p s reaches its maximum value ln m and the permutation entropy of the time series at scale s is normalized to obtain the mspe 8 h p s h p s l n m according to the above definition the calculation of the mspe is greatly influenced by the embedding dimensionality m and the delay time τ if τ is too large or too small it will affect the information content therefore the delay time is generally taken to be τ 2 wang et al 2015 if m is too large the sequence length will be long and the calculation time will be excessive hence m is generally taken to be 2 3 zheng et al 2018 accordingly values of m 3 and τ 1 are chosen for the current analysis in general when the scale factor satisfies s 10 the law governing the changes in the system dynamics will become evident correspondingly the maximum scale factor considered is usually approximately 12 sun et al 2012 2 3 2 multiscale permutation entropy partial mean mspe pm the mspe is usually considered for the purpose of judging the trend of the complexity however it cannot be used to directly judge the absolute complexity of a time series therefore wang et al 2015 proposed the mspe pm as a complexity judgment index that can comprehensively express the information contained at various scales the specific steps of calculating the mspe pm are as follows 1 the entropy values of the normalized time series at each scale are summarized as follows 9 h mp s x h p s 1 h p s 2 h p s s 2 the skewness sk of the entropy values of the different scale permutations is calculated as shown in eq 9 where the skewness is the ratio of the absolute value of the skewness of the series to its standard deviation the calculation formula is as follows 10 s k 3 h mp m h mp c h mp d where h mp m h mp c and h mp d are the mean median and standard deviation of the mspe h mp m respectively 3 the mspe pm of the time series is calculated as follows 11 h mp p 1 s k 3 h mp m among different time series the value of the mspe will change resulting in differences in the value of the mspe pm therefore the mspe pm can be used as a tool to identify the complexity of a time series when the value of the mspe pm is larger this indicates that the overall complexity of the time series is weaker cheng et al 2017 2 4 chaotic moth flame optimization cmfo to better reflect the variational characteristics of the entropy values at different scales and the complexity of different time series the entropy values at each scale obtained from each set of series are substituted into the mfo algorithm by selecting the optimal weight of the pe value at each scale and calculating the aggregate entropy value accordingly the complexity of the time series can be determined however because the mfo algorithm was developed only recently there is a lack of related algorithm variants li et al 2019 introduced chaotic maps into the mfo algorithm improved the repeatability of the distance adjustment parameter r and selected the tent map instead of the singer map to simplify the calculation process and improve the calculation efficiency thereby enhancing the global search capabilities the specific calculation method of the resulting chaotic mfo cmfo algorithm is described as follows 1 initialization the matrix presented in eq 12 shows that the moth population size i e the largest scale factor s of the mspe is n the spatial locations of the moths are optimized for a problem dimensionality of d and the individual fitness values of the moths are stored in the matrix presented in eq 13 where the fitness value is the pe value at each scale 12 m m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 m 1 d m 2 d m n 1 m n 2 m nd 13 om o m 1 o m 2 o m n t 2 flame space location similar to the moth matrix which is expressed as shown in eq 14 the matrix presented in eq 15 is used to store the flame fitness values 14 f f 11 f 12 f 21 f 22 f 1 d f 2 d f n 1 f n 2 f nd 15 of of 1 of 2 of n t 3 mfo algorithm position update the definition used in the mfo algorithm to simulate the spiraling flight paths of moths is expressed as follows 16 s m t 1 i f t 1 j d i e br cos 2 π r f t 1 j 17 d i m t 1 i f t 1 j 18 r a r a n d 1 19 a 1 t 1 t where m t 1 i is the i th moth of the t 1 th generation f t 1 j is the j th flame of the t 1 th generation s is the spiral function di is the distance from the i th moth to the j th flame b is the spiral shape constant r is the distance adjustment parameter rand is a random number distributed in the range 0 1 t is the maximum number of iterations and t is the number of the current iteration the value of a decreases from 1 to 2 with an increasing number of iterations 4 improvement of the random parameters to improve the repeatability of r for random selection the tent map is used for the random calculation instead of rand the formula for calculating the tent map is as follows cheng et al 2007 20 g x 2 x 2 1 x 0 x 1 2 1 2 x 1 21 x n 1 g x n 2 x n m o d 1 where the floating point number after tent map is located at 0 1 5 flame update to ensure the fast convergence speed of the algorithm an adaptive flame quantity updating mechanism is proposed which is calculated as follows 22 f n r o u n d n l n 1 t where f n is a value used to adaptively reduce the number of flames l is the current iteration n is the maximum number of flames and t is the maximum number of iterations 2 5 projection pursuit threat target evaluation pptte 2 5 1 projection pursuit evaluation ppe model the traditional projection pursuit evaluation ppe model is described as follows liu et al 2018a 2018b 1 normalization processing of the sample evaluation index set let the sample set for each index be x i j i 1 n j 1 p where x i j is the value of the j th index for the i th sample and n and p are the numbers of samples and indexes respectively to eliminate the dimensions of each index value and unify their ranges of variation extreme value normalization is carried out as follows 23 x i j x i j x min j x max j x min j 1 where x max j is the maximum value of the j th index x min j is the minimum value of the j th index and x i j is the normalized series of characteristic index values 2 construction of the index projection function q a the objective of the ppe model is to synthesize the p dimensional data x i j j 1 p into a one dimensional projection z i with a a 1 a 2 a p as the projection direction 24 z i j 1 p a j x i j i 1 n where a is a vector of unit length classification in accordance with the one dimensional scatter diagram of z z i i 1 2 n when the projected index values are synthesized the desired characteristics of the projected values z i are as follows the projected points should be as locally dense as possible aggregated into several point clusters whereas globally the projected point clusters should be scattered as far from each other as possible the index projection function is calculated as follows 25 q a s z d z 26 s z i 1 n z i e z 2 n 1 27 d z i 1 n j 1 n r r i j u r r i j where sz is the standard deviation of the projected values z i dz is the local density of the projected values z i e z is the average value of the sequence z i i 1 2 n r is the radius of the window for calculating the local density which is generally taken to be 0 1 s z r i j represents the distance between two samples that is r i j z i z j and u r r i j is the unit step function which takes a value of 1 when r r i j and a value of 0 otherwise 2 5 2 projection pursuit threat target evaluation pptte since the projection pursuit model constructed during the solution process of the cmfo algorithm includes random terms the extreme projection direction cannot be obtained after the solution process the requirements for obtaining the best projection direction a can instead be converted into the following constraints li et al 2019 28 maxq a s a d a a 1 because the result obtained by the mfo algorithm is a minimum value the additive inverse of eq 28 is taken to be used as the objective function 29 m i n f a s a d a a 1 the constraint condition is too simple in this calculation therefore the projection direction a can be randomly generated 30 a a 1 a 2 a n 0 a 1 i 1 2 n then the generated projection direction a is normalized to unity 31 a a a in accordance with eq 24 the projected eigenvalues z i associated with different projection directions ai after normalization are calculated because the magnitude of z i directly affects the quality of the projection with a larger value of z i resulting in a better projection effect the projection eigenvalues are arranged in order from large to small and the projection direction a with the largest projection eigenvalue z is selected as the best projection in summary the whole process of the proposed cmfo pptte based mspe eigenvalue cmfo pptte mspe calculation method is as follows the eigenvalues obtained by the algorithm are processed using the entropy weights for each scale pe and summarized the eigenvalues exhibit the property of the mspe that is a larger eigenvalue corresponds to more complex precipitation changes in the corresponding region the specific algorithm flow of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is summarized as follows a perform coarse graining of the time series b calculate the pe values of the time series at different scales to serve as the initial data c initialize the initial data as a population d obtain the flame space positions and calculate the fitness e use the tent map instead of rand to obtain random numbers f update the locations of the obtained moths g apply an adaptive mechanism to update the flames h terminate the calculation when a unique adaptive solution is generated otherwise return

calculate the eigenvalues z for different projection directions a m select the maximum projection eigenvalue z to determine the optimal projection direction a n output the optimal solution a o calculate the entropy value m at each scale using the calculation weights and summarize the aggregate entropy value m p output the aggregate entropy value to further illustrate the above steps a flow chart of the cmfo pptte mspe complexity measurement algorithm is shown in fig 2 2 6 radial basis function rbf neural networks as a neural network algorithm rbf overcomes the shortcomings of bp neural networks such as a slow convergence speed and easily falling into local extreme values luo et al 2001 moreover its accuracy is close to the nonlinear function and it has strong nonlinear fitting ability narendra and sood 1998 the rbf network is a three layer feedforward network that includes an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the network can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping from the input layer data space to the hidden layer space and a linear mapping from the hidden layer space to the output layer the available linear equations for the output model are as follows 32 y x i 1 i w ij φ j x p c i where y x is the actual output x p is the p th output sample w ij is the network weight from the hidden layer to the output layer and c i is the center of the radial basis function in processing three parameters need to be learned the center of the basis function the variance and the hidden output layer weight the most commonly used radial basis function is the gaussian function 33 φ x p c i e x p x p c i 2 2 σ 2 34 σ i c max 2 i therefore the network weight w from the hidden layer to the output layer can be calculated by the least squares method and the k clustering method can be used to adjust the center in real time 35 w e x p i c max 2 x p c i 2 2 7 discrimination theory to prove the reliability of the proposed algorithm discrimination theory is used to evaluate the algorithm the complexity of the precipitation in the 13 administrative regions of heilongjiang province is analyzed using different methods the resulting precipitation grades are sorted from high to low and the extent to which each algorithm can distinguish the precipitation complexity grade of each region is judged the greater the degree of differentiation achieved the better the effect of the tested algorithm the calculation method is as follows xie and xie 2014 1 there are n evaluation objects and the calculation results are sorted from high to low and associated with corresponding rankings the ranking values are defined as follows 36 d i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 n i 1 n i 2 f 1 f n 2 n n n 1 2 where f is a calculation result and n is the ranking value corresponding to the calculation result 2 the ranges of the results calculated using different evaluation methods will be different therefore it is necessary to standardize the results such that the various calculation results are distributed between 0 and n 37 f i n 1 f i f 1 f 1 f n where f is a calculation result and f is the corresponding standardized calculation result 3 after standardization using eq 36 the following discrimination formula is used 38 d i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 1 n 0 2 n 1 2 i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 1 2 n 2 2 n 1 3 data from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the daily precipitation data at a total of 32 rainfall stations in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were collected according to the existing results as a reference when the number of calculations is too large the mspe will present low computational efficiency and reduced sensitivity thereby resulting in the inability to find subtle changes in the sequence zhang et al 2018 therefore the length of the time series is usually selected in the interval 500 1000 zhou et al 2017 due to the long daily precipitation series in each region 18 627 each the data are decomposed and analyzed to transform the data into monthly precipitation series for calculation the monthly precipitation data of the 13 regions in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were established based on the gpcc becker et al 2012 and udel santos et al 2015 datasets the resolutions of the above datasets are all 0 5 0 5 as reanalysis data the global grid dataset contains more site related information moreover data information such as system errors are provided and the accuracy of the obtained data is higher which ensures the uniformity and completeness of the data from the heilongjiang statistical yearbook 1985 2018 compiled by the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki https www cnki net the underlying surface type and human activity data for each region in heilongjiang province were extracted for use in a subsequent analysis of the causes of precipitation complexity 4 results 4 1 correlation analysis between gpcc and udel data and precipitation data in various regions of heilongjiang province as precipitation datasets gpcc and udel may include more data relative to that collected by meteorological stations and can describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation with high accuracy and high spatial resolution in this study the pearson coefficient method is used to analyze the correlation between the gpcc and udel data at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the precipitation data of various regions in heilongjiang province the results show that there is a significant correlation between the data fig 3 the correlation coefficient between the annual precipitation data and the gpcc and udel data is 0 994 and 0 989 respectively indicating that the gpcc and udel data are very descriptive of precipitation in heilongjiang province the monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province are then sorted into seasonal precipitation data and the correlation analysis showed that the correlation coefficients of each season are all higher than 0 9 and passed the 0 001 level of significance test the average deviation between monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and gpcc and udel data is processed and the following conclusions are obtained fig 4 except for the daqing region the average deviation of monthly precipitation data with gpcc and udel data is less than 10 a comparison of the gpcc data shows that the regions with deviations of 0 5 are harbin 0 976 qiqihar 0 973 mudanjiang 0 961 jixi 0 964 jiamusi 0 965 suihua 0 978 heihe 0 952 and yichun 0 974 and the regions with a deviation of 5 10 are hegang 0 914 shuangyashan 0 933 daxing anling 0 934 and qitaihe 0 904 with an average deviation of 5 3 a comparison of the udel data shows that the regions with deviations of 0 5 are qiqihar 0 965 mudanjiang 0 976 jixi 0 954 suihua 0 961 and harbin 0 948 and the regions with a deviation of 5 10 are hegang 0 908 shuangyashan 0 917 jiamusi 0 947 daxing anling 0 921 qitaihe 0 936 heihe 0 933 and yichun 0 932 with an average deviation of 6 2 the above data show that the gpcc data can better characterize the changes of precipitation data to further judge the linear relationship between gpcc and udel data and monthly precipitation data in heilongjiang province a linear relationship diagram is drawn fig 3 shows that the fitting degree with gpcc and udel data is r 2 0 988 and r 2 0 978 respectively thus the results shows that the gpcc data fit better and are more reasonable and feasible these data can be used to analyze the complexity of precipitation in various regions in heilongjiang province 4 2 judgment of the variational trends of monthly precipitation in heilongjiang province the monthly precipitation data considered here for each region in heilongjiang province are the average data obtained from meteorological stations in each region and cannot directly reflect the characteristics of the precipitation variations in the 13 regions therefore a fitting method was used to obtain monthly precipitation data from 1967 to 2017 612 months in heilongjiang province to form fitted curves by analyzing the precipitation fluctuations in each region the precipitation complexity in each region of heilongjiang province was identified the actual precipitation curve and fitted curve for each region of heilongjiang province are shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the situ monthly precipitation curve for each region presents larger amplitudes in the middle of each year and smaller amplitudes at the beginning and end of each year which is consistent with the characteristics of the rainy summer and dry winter climate in heilongjiang province moreover the precipitation fluctuations in the various regions of heilongjiang province are large and a long term phenomenon of a high fluctuation frequency is observed the fitted curve of the monthly precipitation in each region is close to a horizontal line indicating that there is no long term trend of change in the precipitation in each region of heilongjiang province moreover the goodness of fit r 2 for the precipitation data in each region is less than 0 01 a worse fitting effect is observed as r 2 approaches 0 consequently the findings show that there is no obvious trend of precipitation change in heilongjiang province as a whole in summary the results show that the variations in precipitation in heilongjiang province conform to the characteristics of variations in complexity and thus have significant characteristics for analysis using the tools of complexity research 4 3 analysis of the complexity characteristics of precipitation changes in the various regions of heilongjiang province the gpcc monthly precipitation data of the 13 regions in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were processed via coarse graining analysis to obtain 12 sets of series of different lengths for each region sorting in ascending order time reconstruction and entropy calculations were performed for the obtained series and then the entropy values of the precipitation complexity permutations at the 12 different time scales in each region were obtained through normalization as shown in table 1 to select the unique optimal eigenvalue of the mspe to reflect the complexity of the precipitation in each region the method of finding a weight for the pe at each scale was adopted the entropy values for each region were summarized through the application of the weights for each scale in that region to obtain the characteristic value of precipitation complexity that reflects the complexity of the precipitation changes in that region the calculation results are as follows the cmfo pptte model was used to optimize the entropy values for each scale pe and different groups of random projection directions were obtained the projection eigenvalue z was calculated for each group of random projection directions and the best projection direction was selected as the direction with the largest projection eigenvalue z p 0 064 0 025 0 038 0 073 0 017 0 154 0 063 0 138 0 103 0 154 0 154 0 016 the best projection direction was used to calculate the weights of the entropy values for each scale in each region and summarize the entropy values for the projections at each scale to obtain the following results y 0 9316 0 9307 0 9422 0 9413 0 9291 0 9354 0 9288 0 9357 0 9290 0 9455 0 9301 0 9285 0 9294 the results obtained in the y matrix represent the complexity eigenvalue for each region for the aggregate entropy value obtained by summing the pe weights at each scale its range is the same as the range obtained using the original pe algorithm therefore this value can be classified in accordance with the pe classification standard for precipitation complexity given by zhang and liu 2017 however since the mspe is normalized during the calculation process as shown in eq 8 the normalized version of the original standard must be used as the complexity standard 0 9290 0 9345 corresponds to grade i 0 9345 0 9400 corresponds to grade ii and 0 9400 0 9455 corresponds to grade iii accordingly the complexity grades of the precipitation in each region of heilongjiang province were determined as shown in table 2 according to the calculated grade of precipitation complexity in each region a map of the spatial distribution of the precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province was drawn fig 5 shows that the various regions in heilongjiang province can be ranked in the following order based on their precipitation entropy values from high to low daxing anling qiqihar daqing shuangyashan jiamusi hegang harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua heihe the regions with grade iii precipitation complexity namely daxing anling qiqihar daqing are located in the north and west of heilongjiang province and concentrated in the southwest and northwest the regions of grade ii precipitation complexity namely shuangyashan jiamusi and hegang are mostly located in the east of heilongjiang province and concentrated in the northeast parts of the province the regions of grade i precipitation complexity namely harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua and heihe are mostly located in the middle and southeast of heilongjiang province in summary the spatial distribution of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province mainly shows a trend of increasing from the central to the east and west with a particularly strong increase in complexity toward the west 4 4 attribution analysis of the complexity characteristics of precipitation changes in heilongjiang province based on in gpcc data driven by both natural changes and urbanization the complexity of precipitation varies among different regions and studies have shown that precipitation complexity is mainly affected by geographic location and topography huang et al 2017 heilongjiang province spans both temperate and cold temperate zones and different temperature changes have different effects on promoting the formation of precipitation consequently as the only region in heilongjiang province that is located in the cold temperate zone the complexity of precipitation in daxing anling is significantly higher than that in other regions the topography of heilongjiang province is characterized by high elevations in the northwest and southeast and low elevations in the northeast and southwest the southeast northwest and central regions of heilongjiang province are located on the plains whereas the north and southwest regions are home to mountain ranges to explore the correlation between altitude and precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the variation curves of these two quantities are shown in fig 6 this figure shows that the directions of the fluctuations in the altitude and aggregate entropy values except in the daxing anling region are consistent when the altitude increases the entropy value increases indicating that the altitude has an impact on the complexity of precipitation the correlation coefficient between the aggregate entropy and the altitude is 0 546 p 0 05 according to a data analysis performed using pearson coefficient method ge et al 2012 therefore altitude can be regarded as one of the factors affecting the precipitation complexity to further explore the potential influencing factors of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the data characterizing the underlying surface types cultivated land area forestland area grassland area water area and urban construction area and indicators of human activities population density agricultural output value and industrial output value of 13 regions were selected for mean processing the pearson coefficient method is used to analyze the correlation between the aggregated entropy and the data mean as shown in table 3 the statistical results show that the water area and urban construction area are significantly positively correlated with precipitation complexity p 0 05 and forestland area is significantly negatively correlated with precipitation complexity p 0 01 therefore changes in water area and urban construction area and the felling and expansion of forestland all affect the change of precipitation complexity the landforms of heilongjiang province include mountains hills plains etc due to the different landforms the variation and complexity of precipitation are different to explore the impact of spatial variation of precipitation on the complexity of precipitation the spatial variation map of monthly average precipitation obtained from situ data in each region is drawn as shown in fig 7 according to the natural break point method the precipitation is divided into different intervals and a comparison with fig 5 based on in gpcc data shows that from the perspective of geographical location the division of precipitation is consistent with the complexity of precipitation the precipitation in the eastern western and northern area of heilongjiang province is within same precipitation interval and the precipitation complexity grade of each region remains the same as shown in fig 5 these findings indicate that the spatial variability of gridded precipitation is closely related to the complexity of in situ precipitation in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and the change of monthly average precipitation in different regions will lead to precipitation complexity variations to different degrees according to relationship between spatial variability and precipitation complexity the monthly average precipitation change is used as an assessment to determine the reliability of the factors affecting precipitation complexity daxing anling is the region with the highest altitude in heilongjiang province and there is a big gap between its monthly average precipitation and the surrounding regions daqing and qiqihar regions are located in the nenjiang plain which are also regions with the lowest altitude in heilongjiang province and there are still big gaps between the average precipitation and the surrounding regions daxing anling as the main forest production region in heilongjiang province has the lowest monthly average precipitation as the region with the largest water area urban construction area of heihe region is much smaller than suihua region as the water area and urban construction area have roughly the same degree of influence the monthly average precipitation of the two regions is the same in summary the obtained precipitation complexity influencing factors are significant and reliable 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis with existing research results the cmfo pptte mspe is a cmfo pptte model used to calculate the multiscale permutation entropy eigenvalue after processing the weight of multiscale permutation entropy the correlations between the eigenvalues and different precipitation complexity factors were compared and verified the complexity of precipitation is usually affected by many factors including natural environmental factors such as altitude as the terrain increases the complexity of precipitation increases which is consistent with the results reported by fu et al 2015 the evaluation of the factors affecting the complexity of precipitation showed that the complexity of precipitation is also affected by factors that include the underlying surface and human activities the entropy value calculated by the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is correlated with the average data of cultivated land area forestland area grassland area water area urban construction area population density agricultural output value and industrial output value the water area and urban construction area have a significant impact on the complexity of precipitation the increase of water area will affect water evaporation change the rate of precipitation formation and increase the complexity of precipitation which is consistent with zhang et al 2020 the intensification of human activities leads to the increase of temperature in human living areas accelerates the occurrence of precipitation and affects the complexity of precipitation and it also represents an important reason for the impact of urban construction area on the complexity of precipitation same as hu et al 2018a hu et al 2018b moreover forestland area has the greatest impact on the complexity of precipitation because forests and precipitation act as driving forces for hydrological systems and are also affected by these systems and they can block the formation of airflow with increases in forest coverage area the air humidity increases which increases the complexity of precipitation wang et al 2020 however due to the limitations of existing research methods at this stage and the inevitable differences and complexity of forest land ecology further research is needed chen and li 2001 5 2 influence of time scale on precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province to compare the influence of time scale on the study of precipitation complexity the cmfo pptte mspe was used to calculate daily precipitation data which was normalized to ensure that the obtained entropy values were uniform and in the range of 0 9290 0 9455 after dividing the data according to the precipitation complexity grade standard presented in section 4 2 table 4 is obtained since daily precipitation is an extension of monthly precipitation the complexity of precipitation will inevitably show differences therefore differences will occur in the precipitation complexity grades which presents direct comparisons of the reliability of the two complexity conclusions to further judge the influence of daily and monthly precipitation series on the reliability of precipitation complexity classification the precipitation complexity grade results of various regions in heilongjiang province are summarized and the degree of distinction is calculated the results are shown in table 5 the discrimination results for daily precipitation are significantly lower than that of monthly precipitation which shows that the entropy value under monthly precipitation series can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in different regions although the daily precipitation is a long series the data are more detailed however because there are too many 0 values in the process of daily precipitation statistics a longer sequence will present a gradual increase in 0 values this scenario leads to the sequence approaching regularity which leads to errors in the precipitation complexity analysis obtained therefore cmfo pptte mspe under the monthly precipitation sequence can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province 5 3 precipitation forecast in various regions of heilongjiang province to explore the future trend of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province the rbf neural network is used to predict and analyze the precipitation in situ data for various regions of heilongjiang province the first 350 original data points were selected as training samples and the last 262 were selected as test samples since there are 612 monthly data points from 1967 to 2016 the parameters studied by hamdi et al 2019 can be basically selected therefore the number of neurons is 10 the training accuracy is 0 01 and the distribution density of the rbf is 3 the prediction accuracy of the precipitation data training set and test set is compared and and the fitting curve is drawn fig 8 shows the fit r 2 of training set and test set is 0 9443 approaching to 1 which has good fitting effect it proves that the two sets have high consistency indicating that the model is stable and the evaluation results are accurate chen et al 2005 in summary the precipitation data can be predicted by the rbf neural network under the above parameters the precipitation data of each region are subjected to rbf prediction and the accuracy of the precipitation prediction results increases as the sequence length increases however due to the limited sample length the predicted length is also limited therefore according to the current precipitation data length the precipitation data in the next 36 months are selected and analyzed to obtain the precipitation results sun et al 2014 the predicted change curve of precipitation is drawn according to the results as shown in fig 9 the trend of the change curve of the precipitation data in each region after prediction is the same as that in fig 4 moreover the fitting degree of the precipitation prediction curve in each region is similar to that of the situ data therefore the predicted precipitation series can be used as reference value to provide a basis for future precipitation predictions 5 4 analysis of the reasonability of the precipitation complexity measurement results in gpcc data to verify the performance of the proposed cmfo pptte mspe algorithm in evaluating the overall complexity in terms of the mspe the whale optimization algorithm ibrahim et al 2016 pptte woa pptte model and the ω particle swarm optimization nan wang 2017 pptte ω pso pptte model were also used to calculate the mspe weights to obtain the aggregate entropy value the corresponding algorithms are abbreviated as woa pptte mspe and ω pso pptte mspe respectively as a bio inspired heuristic algorithm the woa also suffers from the unconstrained extreme value problem and minimum results oliv et al 2017 and as a genetic algorithm the ω pso algorithm includes a random term in the generation process tian 2010 which will lead to uncertain projection values moreover the results of this method are also obtained through minimization therefore both of the above algorithms can be applied to select the optimal projection on the basis of a pptte model constructed to calculate the eigenvalues for comparison the results of mspe pm cmfo pptte mspe woa pptte mspe and ω pso pptte mspe algorithms were all used as the mspe eigenvalues to determine the grade distribution of the precipitation complexity under gpcc data in the study area at the same time to verify the superiority results of the gpcc data the situ precipitation data of various regions in heilongjiang province were selected and the cmfo pptte mspe eigenvalues were calculated for comparison then the results obtained using each method were normalized to values between 0 9290 and 0 9455 on this basis the complexity grades were determined as shown in table 6 table 6 shows that there is a gap between the obtained grade results in the gpcc data and the situ data however except for daxing anling region there is a small gap in the complexity grade of other regions it shows in section 4 4 that altitude and forestland area have a significant positive correlation effect on precipitation complexity daxing anling region is greatly affected by these two factors and its complexity grade should be higher therefore the complexity grade obtained under the gpcc data is more accurate and this data has advantages compared with the calculated results of the situ data as the same time among the gpcc precipitation complexity grades of the different regions obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm the grades for the harbin and qitaihe regions are the same as those obtained using the other three methods with the exceptions of daqing jixi and yichun the complexity grades for the other regions are also mostly the same as those obtained with the other three algorithms this finding indicate that the results obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm are reasonable to further clarify that the algorithm results are reasonable significant influencing factors such as are selected to analyze the precipitation complexity of each region the results show that the forestland area in yichun region 4th is relatively large and has a greater impact on the complexity of precipitation with a negative correlation as the same time the water area 12th and urban construction area 11th are both located in the lower part of heilongjiang province therefore the precipitation complexity of the yichun area will be lower the influencing factors of daqing include altitude 4th urban building area 2nd and water area 5th which are positively correlated with precipitation complexity these are all located in the higher part of heilongjiang province however the forestland area 7th with a negative correlation is located in the middle and lower part of heilongjiang province therefore its precipitation complexity grade is higher the influencing factors of jixi include altitude 8th urban construction area 6th and water area 10th which is located in the lower part of heilongjiang province and the forestland area 5th is located in the upper part of heilongjiang province therefore its precipitation complexity grade should be lower these findings indicate that the precipitation complexity grades under the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm are more reasonable to further explore the rationality of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data the 13 administrative regions in heilongjiang province can be divided into different geographical regions as follows the hegang shuangyashan jiamusi and yichun regions are located in the northeast part of the province ne the heihe and daxing anling regions are located in the northwest nw the mudanjiang jixi and qitaihe regions are located in the southeast se the daqing and qiqihar regions are located in the southwest sw and the harbin and suihua regions are located in the central or middle part mp of the province combined with table 6 the distributions of the precipitation complexity grades in each area obtained from the cmfo pptte mspe among them the calculation of situ data is recorded as s cpm and the calculation of gpcc data is recorded as g cmp mspe pm mpm woa pptte mspe wpm and ω pso pptte mspe ω ppm algorithms were statistically analyzed as shown in fig 10 the results of all four algorithms indicate that the precipitation complexity grades are relatively high for the ne and sw regions and low for the se in conclusion the results of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data are consistent with those of the other results 5 5 analysis of the reliability of the precipitation complexity measurement results to further judge the reliability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data the results of fig 8 and table 6 are combined to quantitatively analyze the division of the precipitation complexity grade distribution among the different geographical regions to evaluate the geographical discrimination capabilities of each algorithm and the division of the precipitation complexity grade distribution among the different administrative regions of heilongjiang province to evaluate the administrative discrimination capabilities of the algorithms as shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the geographic discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under the gpcc data is the same as the situ data but the administrative discrimination capability is significantly higher than the situ data therefore the precipitation complexity classification of the cmfo pptte mspe under the gpcc data is more advantageous as the same time the geographical discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data is significantly higher than that of the mspe pm algorithm the four algorithms are ranked as follows from the highest discrimination capability to the lowest cmfo pptte mspe woa pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm the geographical discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is not lower than that of any of the other three algorithms thus demonstrating that the precipitation complexity grades obtained with the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm can well reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm also shows a higher administrative discrimination capability than the mspe pm algorithm this finding indicates that cmfo pptte mspe is more effective than the traditional mspe pm algorithm in characterizing the precipitation distribution in heilongjiang province the ranking of the four algorithms in terms of their administrative discrimination capabilities is as follows from high to low cmfo pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm woa pptte mspe among them the administrative discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms indicating that the proposed algorithm can more effectively distinguish the precipitation grades of the different regions the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm can better distinguish the complexity of this region in terms of the grade distribution thus making the division of the precipitation complexity distribution more balanced thus the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm has advantages for the overall evaluation of the mspe and can be used to more accurately identify the precipitation complexity of various regions in conclusion the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data is superior in performance to the other three algorithms and better than the situ data its yields more accurate complexity results in terms of entropy these results show that this new method is suitable for measuring the complexity of precipitation moreover it also provides a new approach for mining the fine structural features of regional hydrological series 6 conclusions 1 a correlation analysis of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province with gpcc and udel data shows that the correlation coefficient with the gpcc data is 0 989 the correlation coefficient with the udel data is 0 994 the monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province are then sorted into seasonal precipitation data and a correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficients of each season are all higher than 0 9 and pass the 0 001 level of significance test the average deviation between monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and the gpcc and udel data is processed and the following conclusions are obtained except for the daqing region the average deviation of monthly precipitation data with gpcc and udel data is less than 10 2 cmfo pptte model processing of the mspe of precipitation of gpcc data is performed to obtain an aggregate entropy value and compare with situ data thus providing a new method for calculating mspe eigenvalues cmfo pptte mspe these eigenvalues can then be classified in accordance with established evaluation criteria for the entropy based sorting of precipitation complexity grades the regions are ranked in order of their entropy values as follows from high to low daxing anling qiqihar daqing shuangyashan jiamusi hegang harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua heihe a comparison of the correlations between the aggregated entropy values and the underlying surface types human activity indicators terrain characteristics and other related factors shows that the altitude p 0 05 water area p 0 05 forestland area p 0 01 and urban construction area p 0 05 have the most significant impacts on the precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province and all have significant positive correlations 3 an analysis of the influence of the time scale on precipitation complexity research shows that monthly precipitation discrimination is greater than daily precipitation discrimination the results also revealed that cmfo pptte mspe under the monthly precipitation sequence can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province 4 to explore the future trends of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province the rbf neural network is used to predict and analyze the precipitation of situ data in various regions of heilongjiang province the results show that the maximum mean square error of the precipitation data forecast in each region is 0 016 and the minimum is 0 009 the consistency between the training set and the test set is good indicating that the model is stable and the evaluation results are accurate 5 the rationality of the results obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc and in situ data to test the rationality of the results obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm four algorithms are selected for a comparative analysis cmfo pptte mspe mspe pm ω pso pptte mspe and woa pptte mspe the findings of this study prove that the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is more reasonable and has more advantages 6 the reliability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is also evaluated in terms of discrimination theory in terms of geographical discrimination capabilities for heilongjiang province the four algorithms are ranked as follows cmfo pptte mspe woa pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm in terms of their administrative discrimination capabilities for heilongjiang province the algorithms are ranked as follows high to low cmfo pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm woa pptte mspe these results show that the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm can well reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province while also producing a more balanced division of precipitation complexity 7 in the mspe algorithm different values of the embedding dimensionality delay time and scale factor will affect the measurement results for the complexity of hydrological series at present the values of m τ and s are mainly selected based on experience or convention in the future however determining how to apply artificial intelligence algorithms to reasonably calibrate these three key parameters of the mspe algorithm to further improve the accuracy of complexity diagnosis for hydrological series will be an important avenue of research credit authorship contribution statement dong liu writing

5001,the influence of entropy values obtained under different multiscale permutation entropy scales on the complexity and unconstrained extreme value problem of traditional bionics algorithms was assessed the multiscale permutation entropy mspe eigenvalue calculation method based on the chaotic moth flame optimization based projection pursuit threat target evaluation cmfo pptte model is proposed cmfo pptte mspe the cmfo pptte mspe not only solves the problems of rough calculation and information loss in traditional eigenvalue calculation but also improves the shortcomings of slow convergence and local optimality in the intelligent bionic algorithm for this purpose the monthly precipitation of 13 administrative regions in heilongjiang province under the global precipitation climatology centre dataset gpcc from 1967 to 2017 was evaluated to improve the precipitation complexity entropy accuracy the main influencing factors were altitude p 0 05 water area p 0 05 urban construction area p 0 05 and forestland area p 0 01 radial basis function rbf neural networks were used to forecast the precipitation in heilongjiang province over 36 months and a better forecast was obtained to verify the rationality of cmfo pptte mspe under gpcc data compared with the situ data it is found that gpcc data can more accurately classify the complexity grade of daxing anling region at the same time the administrative discrimination of gpcc data 1 107 is significantly higher than the situ data 1 023 to verify the rationality of the cmfo pptte mspe the partial mean of mspe mspe pm whale optimization algorithm pptte woa pptte and ω particle swarm optimization pptte ω pso pptte models were also used to calculate the mspe eigenvalues under gpcc data comparisons and evaluations were performed after dividing the grade based on geographical discrimination cmfo pptte mspe 1 107 woa pptte mspe 1 094 w pso pptte mspe 1 090 mspe pm 1 063 and administrative discrimination cmfo pptte mspe 1 146 w pso pptte mspe 1 002 mspe pm 1 012 woa pptte mspe 1 002 the cmfo pptte mspe had a significantly higher distinguishing capabilities than the other algorithms and thus could better distinguish the complexity of precipitation in different regions and geographic locations in summary the cmfo pptte mspe is beneficial for analyzing precipitation complexity and represents a novel approach for mining the fine structural features of regional hydrological series however determining how to apply artificial intelligence algorithms to reasonably calibrate key parameters of the mspe algorithm to further improve the accuracy of complexity diagnosis for hydrological series will be an important avenue of research keywords precipitation complexity algorithm data mining china 1 introduction precipitation is an important hydrological feature in a complex giant system muhammad and widyarto 2004 that is often characterized by uncertainty and chaotic behavior taniguchi 2016 over the long term however chaotic phenomena appear to be less random vallebona et al 2015 as the length of a recorded precipitation time series continuously increases the characteristics of regional precipitation complexity changes become increasingly obvious consequently the regional precipitation cannot be represented in terms of a single changing feature luo et al 2013 the greater the complexity of the characteristics of regional precipitation variations the more factors that are affected during the process of precipitation evolution in the region which increases the difficulty of predicting hydrological features such as precipitation runoff and groundwater resources li et al 2009 as well as to resolving practical problems such as canal head water quantity predictions in irrigation areas zhang et al 2014 urban water management cui et al 2017 and flood peak predictions xu et al 2017 the variational characteristics of precipitation complexity seriously affect the balance and coordinated development of water resource systems li et al 2020 and pose a threat to both industrial and agricultural production and residents living environments therefore it is necessary to develop appropriate methods to study the variational characteristics of precipitation complexity to provide an important reference for the mitigation of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts faiz et al 2020 and provide a practical basis for meteorological hydrological forecasting and water resource management hartmann et al 2016 complexity science first emerged in the 1980s and has gradually matured in various fields of natural science qian et al 1990 in particular the complexity characteristics of regional precipitation has gradually become a popular topic in complexity research liu et al 2018a 2018b with the continuous development of mathematical techniques the methods of measuring the complexity of precipitation are also constantly improving luan et al 2014 niu et al 2013 millán et al 2008 and have yielded meaningful research results however these methods have limitations for long term research and application zhang et al 2019 for example the programming necessary for fractal theory analyses is time consuming and the results lack the ability to facilitate local characterization singh 2013 moreover when performing multifractal calculations analytical solutions can be obtained for only a few special sets which seriously restricts the calculation capabilities korolj et al 2019 although wavelet transform offers noise reduction capabilities and high sensitivity su zhou 2010 its analytical accuracy is not ideal peng et al 2005 and local information is lost from the original signal in the process of noise reduction ji et al 2010 to solve these problems multiscale permutation entropy mspe theory can be applied in the study of precipitation complexity to obtain a concise highly sensitive and highly precise measurement method entropy theory pisano et al 2018 is an important theoretical basis for current complexity research that was developed from thermodynamics and it is widely used in many fields especially in discrete systems with many uncertainties and randomness in particular calculation methods based on the mspe approach are widely used morabito et al 2012 wang and liu 2016 gao et al 2017 in 2005 the mspe algorithm was proposed by aziz and arif 2005 to overcome the problems presented by considering permutation entropy pe at only a single scale and allowing the data to be divided into smaller modules for analysis therefore the calculation process was more sensitive to signal changes and thus avoided the loss of weak signal characteristics this method maintains the advantages of the intuitive results obtained using the pe approach ren 2015 reflects the complexity of the data and yields robust and practical results fan et al 2013 since the mspe algorithm captures only the trends of time series rather than absolute evaluations xi zhu 2015 the average mspe gordon et al 2012 or the mspe partial mean mspe pm chen huang 2016 is commonly calculated as a characteristic index for a certain section of a signal however a large number of calculations and studies have shown that the characteristic index values obtained via this method can lead to the potential omission of information from the results of complexity evaluations chen 2018 zhao et al 2015 to address the shortcomings of the mspe method in obtaining characteristic index values an intelligent bio inspired algorithm can be used to calculate weights for the mspe to improve the calculation accuracy and reduce the occurrence of potential information loss the moth flame optimization mfo algorithm is an intelligent bio inspired optimization algorithm that has the advantages of few parameters to adjust a strong ability to achieve extreme value optimization and ease of incorporation with other problems mirjalili 2015 compared with traditional bio inspired algorithms it offers good convergence accuracy and simple effective and accurate calculations singh prakash 2017 however as the number of dimensions increases the mfo algorithm will have a lower calculation accuracy xu et al 2018 and a slower convergence speed sayed hassanien 2018 moreover the existence of random variables in the mfo algorithm will cause the calculation results to exhibit the unconstrained extremum problem li et al 2017 to address the shortcomings of the mfo algorithm and improve its efficiency li et al 2019 proposed the chaotic mfo based projection pursuit threat target evaluation cmfo pptte model this algorithm increases the randomness in the calculation process realizes a more effective global search process and avoids the phenomenon of slow convergence caused by repeated calculations moreover as an improved version of the original model and algorithm it not only has the ability of the projection pursuit model to solve high dimensional problems but also overcomes the unconstrained extremum problem of the mfo algorithm by means of a penalty coefficient such that the optimal solution is the only definite solution in this paper the cmfo pptte model is combined with the mspe method cmfo pptte mspe to carry out weight processing without modifying the original entropy values to effectively retain the information of the pe value at each scale to the maximum extent the cmfo has strong traversal ability and the conclusions are more reliable when the pptte optimization mechanism is used to determine the unique eigenvalue the cmfo pptte mspe not only solves the problems of rough calculation and information loss in traditional eigenvalue calculation but also improves the shortcomings of slow convergence and local optimality in the intelligent bionic algorithm in summary the objectives of the current research are as follows 1 to explore the possibility of using the cmfo pptte model to improve the traditional mspe method of measuring precipitation complexity 2 to analyze regional precipitation complexity characteristics and possible causes 3 to evaluate the performance of the proposed cmfo pptte mspe complexity measurement algorithm 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area heilongjiang province is the most northeastern provincial administrative region in china and located adjacent to russia and it has 13 municipal administrative regions zhang and jiang 2011 in accordance with the administrative division criteria in heilongjiang province the municipal administrative districts and their jurisdiction areas can be divided into the following general geographical regions as shown in fig 1 the daxing anling and heihe regions are located in the northwest part of heilongjiang province shuangyashan hegang jiamusi and yichun regions are located in the northeast qiqihar and daqing regions are located in the southwest jixi mudanjiang and qitaihe regions are located in the southeast and suihua and harbin regions are located in the central part of the province zhang 2007 heilongjiang province spans temperate and cold temperate zones with most of the province located in the temperate zone that is affected by the monsoon climate and shows obvious climate changes in the four seasons zhou et al 2014 these changes mainly manifest in complex variational characteristics of temperature and precipitation conditions with high temperatures and frequent precipitation in summer moderate temperatures and moderate precipitation in spring and autumn and cold temperatures and little precipitation in winter as one of the country s two major commodity grain bases heilongjiang province accounts for approximately one tenth of the country s grain output simultaneously heilongjiang province is an important natural forestry province in china with its forestry output value among the highest in china heilongjiang province has three major water systems the heilongjiang songhua and wusuli river systems and four large lakes xingkai lake jingpo lake lianhuan lake and wudalianchi lake hui zang 2014 although the province has an intermediate amount of water resources relative to the country in general the vast area and uneven distribution of these water resources lead to a low per capita availability wang jiang 2008 due to spatial differences water resources are abundant in areas adjacent to rivers and lakes although the natural forest areas and some agricultural areas rely on rain fed water sources anonymous 2015 meaning that changes in precipitation have a profound impact on crop growth and forest ecosystem development therefore an analysis of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province can not only extend the literature on complexity theory but also provide important technical support for forest protection agricultural production and water security management 2 2 average deviation calculation to analyze the deviation between the precipitation data in heilongjiang and the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and university of delaware udel data the average deviation method is used to calculate the absolute value percentage of the difference between the before and after changes the calculation formula is as follows liu et al 2017 1 b 100 p m p n p n where p m stands for gpcc or udel data and represents p n the situ precipitation data 2 3 multiscale permutation entropy and multiscale permutation entropy partial mean 2 3 1 multiscale permutation entropy mspe the mspe algorithm is an entropy algorithm that combines the coarsening approach used for multiscale entropy analysis with the pe algorithm to define the pe at different scales the properties of the entropy at different scales are assessed based on the entropy values calculated using the pe algorithm the larger the entropy value at a given scale the more complicated the time series is at this scale thus the trends of time series complexity can be judged on the basis of the changes in the entropy values at each scale zheng et al 2016 the specific calculation steps of the mspe algorithm are as follows tiwari et al 2015 1 consider a time series x x i i 1 2 l the coarsening process is expressed as follows 2 y j s j 1 s i j 1 s 1 js x i 1 j l s where y j s j is a multiscale time series and l s is rounded when the scale factor is s 1 the time series is identical to the original series 2 after the extraction of time series at different scales the time associated with y j s is reconstructed as follows 3 y t s y t s y t τ s y t m 1 τ s where m is the number of embedding dimensions and τ is the delay time 3 the reconstructed time series y t s is arranged in ascending order 4 y t j 1 1 τ s y t j 2 1 τ s y t j m 1 τ s when y t j i 1 τ s y t j k 1 τ s exists it is sorted in accordance with the size of r if j i j k then y t j i 1 τ s y t j k 1 τ s the series has m possible arrangements after sorting a set of permutations can be obtained for each vector 5 π j j 1 j 2 j m 4 the number of occurrences nl of each permutation type is counted where 1 l m the probability of the first permutation is expressed as follows 6 p l s n l l s m 1 5 the pe of the time series at multiple scales is defined as follows 7 h p s l 1 m p l s l n p l s when p l s 1 m h p s reaches its maximum value ln m and the permutation entropy of the time series at scale s is normalized to obtain the mspe 8 h p s h p s l n m according to the above definition the calculation of the mspe is greatly influenced by the embedding dimensionality m and the delay time τ if τ is too large or too small it will affect the information content therefore the delay time is generally taken to be τ 2 wang et al 2015 if m is too large the sequence length will be long and the calculation time will be excessive hence m is generally taken to be 2 3 zheng et al 2018 accordingly values of m 3 and τ 1 are chosen for the current analysis in general when the scale factor satisfies s 10 the law governing the changes in the system dynamics will become evident correspondingly the maximum scale factor considered is usually approximately 12 sun et al 2012 2 3 2 multiscale permutation entropy partial mean mspe pm the mspe is usually considered for the purpose of judging the trend of the complexity however it cannot be used to directly judge the absolute complexity of a time series therefore wang et al 2015 proposed the mspe pm as a complexity judgment index that can comprehensively express the information contained at various scales the specific steps of calculating the mspe pm are as follows 1 the entropy values of the normalized time series at each scale are summarized as follows 9 h mp s x h p s 1 h p s 2 h p s s 2 the skewness sk of the entropy values of the different scale permutations is calculated as shown in eq 9 where the skewness is the ratio of the absolute value of the skewness of the series to its standard deviation the calculation formula is as follows 10 s k 3 h mp m h mp c h mp d where h mp m h mp c and h mp d are the mean median and standard deviation of the mspe h mp m respectively 3 the mspe pm of the time series is calculated as follows 11 h mp p 1 s k 3 h mp m among different time series the value of the mspe will change resulting in differences in the value of the mspe pm therefore the mspe pm can be used as a tool to identify the complexity of a time series when the value of the mspe pm is larger this indicates that the overall complexity of the time series is weaker cheng et al 2017 2 4 chaotic moth flame optimization cmfo to better reflect the variational characteristics of the entropy values at different scales and the complexity of different time series the entropy values at each scale obtained from each set of series are substituted into the mfo algorithm by selecting the optimal weight of the pe value at each scale and calculating the aggregate entropy value accordingly the complexity of the time series can be determined however because the mfo algorithm was developed only recently there is a lack of related algorithm variants li et al 2019 introduced chaotic maps into the mfo algorithm improved the repeatability of the distance adjustment parameter r and selected the tent map instead of the singer map to simplify the calculation process and improve the calculation efficiency thereby enhancing the global search capabilities the specific calculation method of the resulting chaotic mfo cmfo algorithm is described as follows 1 initialization the matrix presented in eq 12 shows that the moth population size i e the largest scale factor s of the mspe is n the spatial locations of the moths are optimized for a problem dimensionality of d and the individual fitness values of the moths are stored in the matrix presented in eq 13 where the fitness value is the pe value at each scale 12 m m 11 m 12 m 21 m 22 m 1 d m 2 d m n 1 m n 2 m nd 13 om o m 1 o m 2 o m n t 2 flame space location similar to the moth matrix which is expressed as shown in eq 14 the matrix presented in eq 15 is used to store the flame fitness values 14 f f 11 f 12 f 21 f 22 f 1 d f 2 d f n 1 f n 2 f nd 15 of of 1 of 2 of n t 3 mfo algorithm position update the definition used in the mfo algorithm to simulate the spiraling flight paths of moths is expressed as follows 16 s m t 1 i f t 1 j d i e br cos 2 π r f t 1 j 17 d i m t 1 i f t 1 j 18 r a r a n d 1 19 a 1 t 1 t where m t 1 i is the i th moth of the t 1 th generation f t 1 j is the j th flame of the t 1 th generation s is the spiral function di is the distance from the i th moth to the j th flame b is the spiral shape constant r is the distance adjustment parameter rand is a random number distributed in the range 0 1 t is the maximum number of iterations and t is the number of the current iteration the value of a decreases from 1 to 2 with an increasing number of iterations 4 improvement of the random parameters to improve the repeatability of r for random selection the tent map is used for the random calculation instead of rand the formula for calculating the tent map is as follows cheng et al 2007 20 g x 2 x 2 1 x 0 x 1 2 1 2 x 1 21 x n 1 g x n 2 x n m o d 1 where the floating point number after tent map is located at 0 1 5 flame update to ensure the fast convergence speed of the algorithm an adaptive flame quantity updating mechanism is proposed which is calculated as follows 22 f n r o u n d n l n 1 t where f n is a value used to adaptively reduce the number of flames l is the current iteration n is the maximum number of flames and t is the maximum number of iterations 2 5 projection pursuit threat target evaluation pptte 2 5 1 projection pursuit evaluation ppe model the traditional projection pursuit evaluation ppe model is described as follows liu et al 2018a 2018b 1 normalization processing of the sample evaluation index set let the sample set for each index be x i j i 1 n j 1 p where x i j is the value of the j th index for the i th sample and n and p are the numbers of samples and indexes respectively to eliminate the dimensions of each index value and unify their ranges of variation extreme value normalization is carried out as follows 23 x i j x i j x min j x max j x min j 1 where x max j is the maximum value of the j th index x min j is the minimum value of the j th index and x i j is the normalized series of characteristic index values 2 construction of the index projection function q a the objective of the ppe model is to synthesize the p dimensional data x i j j 1 p into a one dimensional projection z i with a a 1 a 2 a p as the projection direction 24 z i j 1 p a j x i j i 1 n where a is a vector of unit length classification in accordance with the one dimensional scatter diagram of z z i i 1 2 n when the projected index values are synthesized the desired characteristics of the projected values z i are as follows the projected points should be as locally dense as possible aggregated into several point clusters whereas globally the projected point clusters should be scattered as far from each other as possible the index projection function is calculated as follows 25 q a s z d z 26 s z i 1 n z i e z 2 n 1 27 d z i 1 n j 1 n r r i j u r r i j where sz is the standard deviation of the projected values z i dz is the local density of the projected values z i e z is the average value of the sequence z i i 1 2 n r is the radius of the window for calculating the local density which is generally taken to be 0 1 s z r i j represents the distance between two samples that is r i j z i z j and u r r i j is the unit step function which takes a value of 1 when r r i j and a value of 0 otherwise 2 5 2 projection pursuit threat target evaluation pptte since the projection pursuit model constructed during the solution process of the cmfo algorithm includes random terms the extreme projection direction cannot be obtained after the solution process the requirements for obtaining the best projection direction a can instead be converted into the following constraints li et al 2019 28 maxq a s a d a a 1 because the result obtained by the mfo algorithm is a minimum value the additive inverse of eq 28 is taken to be used as the objective function 29 m i n f a s a d a a 1 the constraint condition is too simple in this calculation therefore the projection direction a can be randomly generated 30 a a 1 a 2 a n 0 a 1 i 1 2 n then the generated projection direction a is normalized to unity 31 a a a in accordance with eq 24 the projected eigenvalues z i associated with different projection directions ai after normalization are calculated because the magnitude of z i directly affects the quality of the projection with a larger value of z i resulting in a better projection effect the projection eigenvalues are arranged in order from large to small and the projection direction a with the largest projection eigenvalue z is selected as the best projection in summary the whole process of the proposed cmfo pptte based mspe eigenvalue cmfo pptte mspe calculation method is as follows the eigenvalues obtained by the algorithm are processed using the entropy weights for each scale pe and summarized the eigenvalues exhibit the property of the mspe that is a larger eigenvalue corresponds to more complex precipitation changes in the corresponding region the specific algorithm flow of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is summarized as follows a perform coarse graining of the time series b calculate the pe values of the time series at different scales to serve as the initial data c initialize the initial data as a population d obtain the flame space positions and calculate the fitness e use the tent map instead of rand to obtain random numbers f update the locations of the obtained moths g apply an adaptive mechanism to update the flames h terminate the calculation when a unique adaptive solution is generated otherwise return

calculate the eigenvalues z for different projection directions a m select the maximum projection eigenvalue z to determine the optimal projection direction a n output the optimal solution a o calculate the entropy value m at each scale using the calculation weights and summarize the aggregate entropy value m p output the aggregate entropy value to further illustrate the above steps a flow chart of the cmfo pptte mspe complexity measurement algorithm is shown in fig 2 2 6 radial basis function rbf neural networks as a neural network algorithm rbf overcomes the shortcomings of bp neural networks such as a slow convergence speed and easily falling into local extreme values luo et al 2001 moreover its accuracy is close to the nonlinear function and it has strong nonlinear fitting ability narendra and sood 1998 the rbf network is a three layer feedforward network that includes an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer the network can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping from the input layer data space to the hidden layer space and a linear mapping from the hidden layer space to the output layer the available linear equations for the output model are as follows 32 y x i 1 i w ij φ j x p c i where y x is the actual output x p is the p th output sample w ij is the network weight from the hidden layer to the output layer and c i is the center of the radial basis function in processing three parameters need to be learned the center of the basis function the variance and the hidden output layer weight the most commonly used radial basis function is the gaussian function 33 φ x p c i e x p x p c i 2 2 σ 2 34 σ i c max 2 i therefore the network weight w from the hidden layer to the output layer can be calculated by the least squares method and the k clustering method can be used to adjust the center in real time 35 w e x p i c max 2 x p c i 2 2 7 discrimination theory to prove the reliability of the proposed algorithm discrimination theory is used to evaluate the algorithm the complexity of the precipitation in the 13 administrative regions of heilongjiang province is analyzed using different methods the resulting precipitation grades are sorted from high to low and the extent to which each algorithm can distinguish the precipitation complexity grade of each region is judged the greater the degree of differentiation achieved the better the effect of the tested algorithm the calculation method is as follows xie and xie 2014 1 there are n evaluation objects and the calculation results are sorted from high to low and associated with corresponding rankings the ranking values are defined as follows 36 d i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 n i 1 n i 2 f 1 f n 2 n n n 1 2 where f is a calculation result and n is the ranking value corresponding to the calculation result 2 the ranges of the results calculated using different evaluation methods will be different therefore it is necessary to standardize the results such that the various calculation results are distributed between 0 and n 37 f i n 1 f i f 1 f 1 f n where f is a calculation result and f is the corresponding standardized calculation result 3 after standardization using eq 36 the following discrimination formula is used 38 d i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 1 n 0 2 n 1 2 i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 1 2 n 2 2 n 1 3 data from the china meteorological data network http data cma cn the daily precipitation data at a total of 32 rainfall stations in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were collected according to the existing results as a reference when the number of calculations is too large the mspe will present low computational efficiency and reduced sensitivity thereby resulting in the inability to find subtle changes in the sequence zhang et al 2018 therefore the length of the time series is usually selected in the interval 500 1000 zhou et al 2017 due to the long daily precipitation series in each region 18 627 each the data are decomposed and analyzed to transform the data into monthly precipitation series for calculation the monthly precipitation data of the 13 regions in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were established based on the gpcc becker et al 2012 and udel santos et al 2015 datasets the resolutions of the above datasets are all 0 5 0 5 as reanalysis data the global grid dataset contains more site related information moreover data information such as system errors are provided and the accuracy of the obtained data is higher which ensures the uniformity and completeness of the data from the heilongjiang statistical yearbook 1985 2018 compiled by the china national knowledge infrastructure cnki https www cnki net the underlying surface type and human activity data for each region in heilongjiang province were extracted for use in a subsequent analysis of the causes of precipitation complexity 4 results 4 1 correlation analysis between gpcc and udel data and precipitation data in various regions of heilongjiang province as precipitation datasets gpcc and udel may include more data relative to that collected by meteorological stations and can describe the spatial and temporal characteristics of precipitation with high accuracy and high spatial resolution in this study the pearson coefficient method is used to analyze the correlation between the gpcc and udel data at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the precipitation data of various regions in heilongjiang province the results show that there is a significant correlation between the data fig 3 the correlation coefficient between the annual precipitation data and the gpcc and udel data is 0 994 and 0 989 respectively indicating that the gpcc and udel data are very descriptive of precipitation in heilongjiang province the monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province are then sorted into seasonal precipitation data and the correlation analysis showed that the correlation coefficients of each season are all higher than 0 9 and passed the 0 001 level of significance test the average deviation between monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and gpcc and udel data is processed and the following conclusions are obtained fig 4 except for the daqing region the average deviation of monthly precipitation data with gpcc and udel data is less than 10 a comparison of the gpcc data shows that the regions with deviations of 0 5 are harbin 0 976 qiqihar 0 973 mudanjiang 0 961 jixi 0 964 jiamusi 0 965 suihua 0 978 heihe 0 952 and yichun 0 974 and the regions with a deviation of 5 10 are hegang 0 914 shuangyashan 0 933 daxing anling 0 934 and qitaihe 0 904 with an average deviation of 5 3 a comparison of the udel data shows that the regions with deviations of 0 5 are qiqihar 0 965 mudanjiang 0 976 jixi 0 954 suihua 0 961 and harbin 0 948 and the regions with a deviation of 5 10 are hegang 0 908 shuangyashan 0 917 jiamusi 0 947 daxing anling 0 921 qitaihe 0 936 heihe 0 933 and yichun 0 932 with an average deviation of 6 2 the above data show that the gpcc data can better characterize the changes of precipitation data to further judge the linear relationship between gpcc and udel data and monthly precipitation data in heilongjiang province a linear relationship diagram is drawn fig 3 shows that the fitting degree with gpcc and udel data is r 2 0 988 and r 2 0 978 respectively thus the results shows that the gpcc data fit better and are more reasonable and feasible these data can be used to analyze the complexity of precipitation in various regions in heilongjiang province 4 2 judgment of the variational trends of monthly precipitation in heilongjiang province the monthly precipitation data considered here for each region in heilongjiang province are the average data obtained from meteorological stations in each region and cannot directly reflect the characteristics of the precipitation variations in the 13 regions therefore a fitting method was used to obtain monthly precipitation data from 1967 to 2017 612 months in heilongjiang province to form fitted curves by analyzing the precipitation fluctuations in each region the precipitation complexity in each region of heilongjiang province was identified the actual precipitation curve and fitted curve for each region of heilongjiang province are shown in fig 4 fig 4 shows that the situ monthly precipitation curve for each region presents larger amplitudes in the middle of each year and smaller amplitudes at the beginning and end of each year which is consistent with the characteristics of the rainy summer and dry winter climate in heilongjiang province moreover the precipitation fluctuations in the various regions of heilongjiang province are large and a long term phenomenon of a high fluctuation frequency is observed the fitted curve of the monthly precipitation in each region is close to a horizontal line indicating that there is no long term trend of change in the precipitation in each region of heilongjiang province moreover the goodness of fit r 2 for the precipitation data in each region is less than 0 01 a worse fitting effect is observed as r 2 approaches 0 consequently the findings show that there is no obvious trend of precipitation change in heilongjiang province as a whole in summary the results show that the variations in precipitation in heilongjiang province conform to the characteristics of variations in complexity and thus have significant characteristics for analysis using the tools of complexity research 4 3 analysis of the complexity characteristics of precipitation changes in the various regions of heilongjiang province the gpcc monthly precipitation data of the 13 regions in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 were processed via coarse graining analysis to obtain 12 sets of series of different lengths for each region sorting in ascending order time reconstruction and entropy calculations were performed for the obtained series and then the entropy values of the precipitation complexity permutations at the 12 different time scales in each region were obtained through normalization as shown in table 1 to select the unique optimal eigenvalue of the mspe to reflect the complexity of the precipitation in each region the method of finding a weight for the pe at each scale was adopted the entropy values for each region were summarized through the application of the weights for each scale in that region to obtain the characteristic value of precipitation complexity that reflects the complexity of the precipitation changes in that region the calculation results are as follows the cmfo pptte model was used to optimize the entropy values for each scale pe and different groups of random projection directions were obtained the projection eigenvalue z was calculated for each group of random projection directions and the best projection direction was selected as the direction with the largest projection eigenvalue z p 0 064 0 025 0 038 0 073 0 017 0 154 0 063 0 138 0 103 0 154 0 154 0 016 the best projection direction was used to calculate the weights of the entropy values for each scale in each region and summarize the entropy values for the projections at each scale to obtain the following results y 0 9316 0 9307 0 9422 0 9413 0 9291 0 9354 0 9288 0 9357 0 9290 0 9455 0 9301 0 9285 0 9294 the results obtained in the y matrix represent the complexity eigenvalue for each region for the aggregate entropy value obtained by summing the pe weights at each scale its range is the same as the range obtained using the original pe algorithm therefore this value can be classified in accordance with the pe classification standard for precipitation complexity given by zhang and liu 2017 however since the mspe is normalized during the calculation process as shown in eq 8 the normalized version of the original standard must be used as the complexity standard 0 9290 0 9345 corresponds to grade i 0 9345 0 9400 corresponds to grade ii and 0 9400 0 9455 corresponds to grade iii accordingly the complexity grades of the precipitation in each region of heilongjiang province were determined as shown in table 2 according to the calculated grade of precipitation complexity in each region a map of the spatial distribution of the precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province was drawn fig 5 shows that the various regions in heilongjiang province can be ranked in the following order based on their precipitation entropy values from high to low daxing anling qiqihar daqing shuangyashan jiamusi hegang harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua heihe the regions with grade iii precipitation complexity namely daxing anling qiqihar daqing are located in the north and west of heilongjiang province and concentrated in the southwest and northwest the regions of grade ii precipitation complexity namely shuangyashan jiamusi and hegang are mostly located in the east of heilongjiang province and concentrated in the northeast parts of the province the regions of grade i precipitation complexity namely harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua and heihe are mostly located in the middle and southeast of heilongjiang province in summary the spatial distribution of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province mainly shows a trend of increasing from the central to the east and west with a particularly strong increase in complexity toward the west 4 4 attribution analysis of the complexity characteristics of precipitation changes in heilongjiang province based on in gpcc data driven by both natural changes and urbanization the complexity of precipitation varies among different regions and studies have shown that precipitation complexity is mainly affected by geographic location and topography huang et al 2017 heilongjiang province spans both temperate and cold temperate zones and different temperature changes have different effects on promoting the formation of precipitation consequently as the only region in heilongjiang province that is located in the cold temperate zone the complexity of precipitation in daxing anling is significantly higher than that in other regions the topography of heilongjiang province is characterized by high elevations in the northwest and southeast and low elevations in the northeast and southwest the southeast northwest and central regions of heilongjiang province are located on the plains whereas the north and southwest regions are home to mountain ranges to explore the correlation between altitude and precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the variation curves of these two quantities are shown in fig 6 this figure shows that the directions of the fluctuations in the altitude and aggregate entropy values except in the daxing anling region are consistent when the altitude increases the entropy value increases indicating that the altitude has an impact on the complexity of precipitation the correlation coefficient between the aggregate entropy and the altitude is 0 546 p 0 05 according to a data analysis performed using pearson coefficient method ge et al 2012 therefore altitude can be regarded as one of the factors affecting the precipitation complexity to further explore the potential influencing factors of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the data characterizing the underlying surface types cultivated land area forestland area grassland area water area and urban construction area and indicators of human activities population density agricultural output value and industrial output value of 13 regions were selected for mean processing the pearson coefficient method is used to analyze the correlation between the aggregated entropy and the data mean as shown in table 3 the statistical results show that the water area and urban construction area are significantly positively correlated with precipitation complexity p 0 05 and forestland area is significantly negatively correlated with precipitation complexity p 0 01 therefore changes in water area and urban construction area and the felling and expansion of forestland all affect the change of precipitation complexity the landforms of heilongjiang province include mountains hills plains etc due to the different landforms the variation and complexity of precipitation are different to explore the impact of spatial variation of precipitation on the complexity of precipitation the spatial variation map of monthly average precipitation obtained from situ data in each region is drawn as shown in fig 7 according to the natural break point method the precipitation is divided into different intervals and a comparison with fig 5 based on in gpcc data shows that from the perspective of geographical location the division of precipitation is consistent with the complexity of precipitation the precipitation in the eastern western and northern area of heilongjiang province is within same precipitation interval and the precipitation complexity grade of each region remains the same as shown in fig 5 these findings indicate that the spatial variability of gridded precipitation is closely related to the complexity of in situ precipitation in heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and the change of monthly average precipitation in different regions will lead to precipitation complexity variations to different degrees according to relationship between spatial variability and precipitation complexity the monthly average precipitation change is used as an assessment to determine the reliability of the factors affecting precipitation complexity daxing anling is the region with the highest altitude in heilongjiang province and there is a big gap between its monthly average precipitation and the surrounding regions daqing and qiqihar regions are located in the nenjiang plain which are also regions with the lowest altitude in heilongjiang province and there are still big gaps between the average precipitation and the surrounding regions daxing anling as the main forest production region in heilongjiang province has the lowest monthly average precipitation as the region with the largest water area urban construction area of heihe region is much smaller than suihua region as the water area and urban construction area have roughly the same degree of influence the monthly average precipitation of the two regions is the same in summary the obtained precipitation complexity influencing factors are significant and reliable 5 discussion 5 1 comparative analysis with existing research results the cmfo pptte mspe is a cmfo pptte model used to calculate the multiscale permutation entropy eigenvalue after processing the weight of multiscale permutation entropy the correlations between the eigenvalues and different precipitation complexity factors were compared and verified the complexity of precipitation is usually affected by many factors including natural environmental factors such as altitude as the terrain increases the complexity of precipitation increases which is consistent with the results reported by fu et al 2015 the evaluation of the factors affecting the complexity of precipitation showed that the complexity of precipitation is also affected by factors that include the underlying surface and human activities the entropy value calculated by the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is correlated with the average data of cultivated land area forestland area grassland area water area urban construction area population density agricultural output value and industrial output value the water area and urban construction area have a significant impact on the complexity of precipitation the increase of water area will affect water evaporation change the rate of precipitation formation and increase the complexity of precipitation which is consistent with zhang et al 2020 the intensification of human activities leads to the increase of temperature in human living areas accelerates the occurrence of precipitation and affects the complexity of precipitation and it also represents an important reason for the impact of urban construction area on the complexity of precipitation same as hu et al 2018a hu et al 2018b moreover forestland area has the greatest impact on the complexity of precipitation because forests and precipitation act as driving forces for hydrological systems and are also affected by these systems and they can block the formation of airflow with increases in forest coverage area the air humidity increases which increases the complexity of precipitation wang et al 2020 however due to the limitations of existing research methods at this stage and the inevitable differences and complexity of forest land ecology further research is needed chen and li 2001 5 2 influence of time scale on precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province to compare the influence of time scale on the study of precipitation complexity the cmfo pptte mspe was used to calculate daily precipitation data which was normalized to ensure that the obtained entropy values were uniform and in the range of 0 9290 0 9455 after dividing the data according to the precipitation complexity grade standard presented in section 4 2 table 4 is obtained since daily precipitation is an extension of monthly precipitation the complexity of precipitation will inevitably show differences therefore differences will occur in the precipitation complexity grades which presents direct comparisons of the reliability of the two complexity conclusions to further judge the influence of daily and monthly precipitation series on the reliability of precipitation complexity classification the precipitation complexity grade results of various regions in heilongjiang province are summarized and the degree of distinction is calculated the results are shown in table 5 the discrimination results for daily precipitation are significantly lower than that of monthly precipitation which shows that the entropy value under monthly precipitation series can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in different regions although the daily precipitation is a long series the data are more detailed however because there are too many 0 values in the process of daily precipitation statistics a longer sequence will present a gradual increase in 0 values this scenario leads to the sequence approaching regularity which leads to errors in the precipitation complexity analysis obtained therefore cmfo pptte mspe under the monthly precipitation sequence can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province 5 3 precipitation forecast in various regions of heilongjiang province to explore the future trend of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province the rbf neural network is used to predict and analyze the precipitation in situ data for various regions of heilongjiang province the first 350 original data points were selected as training samples and the last 262 were selected as test samples since there are 612 monthly data points from 1967 to 2016 the parameters studied by hamdi et al 2019 can be basically selected therefore the number of neurons is 10 the training accuracy is 0 01 and the distribution density of the rbf is 3 the prediction accuracy of the precipitation data training set and test set is compared and and the fitting curve is drawn fig 8 shows the fit r 2 of training set and test set is 0 9443 approaching to 1 which has good fitting effect it proves that the two sets have high consistency indicating that the model is stable and the evaluation results are accurate chen et al 2005 in summary the precipitation data can be predicted by the rbf neural network under the above parameters the precipitation data of each region are subjected to rbf prediction and the accuracy of the precipitation prediction results increases as the sequence length increases however due to the limited sample length the predicted length is also limited therefore according to the current precipitation data length the precipitation data in the next 36 months are selected and analyzed to obtain the precipitation results sun et al 2014 the predicted change curve of precipitation is drawn according to the results as shown in fig 9 the trend of the change curve of the precipitation data in each region after prediction is the same as that in fig 4 moreover the fitting degree of the precipitation prediction curve in each region is similar to that of the situ data therefore the predicted precipitation series can be used as reference value to provide a basis for future precipitation predictions 5 4 analysis of the reasonability of the precipitation complexity measurement results in gpcc data to verify the performance of the proposed cmfo pptte mspe algorithm in evaluating the overall complexity in terms of the mspe the whale optimization algorithm ibrahim et al 2016 pptte woa pptte model and the ω particle swarm optimization nan wang 2017 pptte ω pso pptte model were also used to calculate the mspe weights to obtain the aggregate entropy value the corresponding algorithms are abbreviated as woa pptte mspe and ω pso pptte mspe respectively as a bio inspired heuristic algorithm the woa also suffers from the unconstrained extreme value problem and minimum results oliv et al 2017 and as a genetic algorithm the ω pso algorithm includes a random term in the generation process tian 2010 which will lead to uncertain projection values moreover the results of this method are also obtained through minimization therefore both of the above algorithms can be applied to select the optimal projection on the basis of a pptte model constructed to calculate the eigenvalues for comparison the results of mspe pm cmfo pptte mspe woa pptte mspe and ω pso pptte mspe algorithms were all used as the mspe eigenvalues to determine the grade distribution of the precipitation complexity under gpcc data in the study area at the same time to verify the superiority results of the gpcc data the situ precipitation data of various regions in heilongjiang province were selected and the cmfo pptte mspe eigenvalues were calculated for comparison then the results obtained using each method were normalized to values between 0 9290 and 0 9455 on this basis the complexity grades were determined as shown in table 6 table 6 shows that there is a gap between the obtained grade results in the gpcc data and the situ data however except for daxing anling region there is a small gap in the complexity grade of other regions it shows in section 4 4 that altitude and forestland area have a significant positive correlation effect on precipitation complexity daxing anling region is greatly affected by these two factors and its complexity grade should be higher therefore the complexity grade obtained under the gpcc data is more accurate and this data has advantages compared with the calculated results of the situ data as the same time among the gpcc precipitation complexity grades of the different regions obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm the grades for the harbin and qitaihe regions are the same as those obtained using the other three methods with the exceptions of daqing jixi and yichun the complexity grades for the other regions are also mostly the same as those obtained with the other three algorithms this finding indicate that the results obtained using the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm are reasonable to further clarify that the algorithm results are reasonable significant influencing factors such as are selected to analyze the precipitation complexity of each region the results show that the forestland area in yichun region 4th is relatively large and has a greater impact on the complexity of precipitation with a negative correlation as the same time the water area 12th and urban construction area 11th are both located in the lower part of heilongjiang province therefore the precipitation complexity of the yichun area will be lower the influencing factors of daqing include altitude 4th urban building area 2nd and water area 5th which are positively correlated with precipitation complexity these are all located in the higher part of heilongjiang province however the forestland area 7th with a negative correlation is located in the middle and lower part of heilongjiang province therefore its precipitation complexity grade is higher the influencing factors of jixi include altitude 8th urban construction area 6th and water area 10th which is located in the lower part of heilongjiang province and the forestland area 5th is located in the upper part of heilongjiang province therefore its precipitation complexity grade should be lower these findings indicate that the precipitation complexity grades under the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm are more reasonable to further explore the rationality of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data the 13 administrative regions in heilongjiang province can be divided into different geographical regions as follows the hegang shuangyashan jiamusi and yichun regions are located in the northeast part of the province ne the heihe and daxing anling regions are located in the northwest nw the mudanjiang jixi and qitaihe regions are located in the southeast se the daqing and qiqihar regions are located in the southwest sw and the harbin and suihua regions are located in the central or middle part mp of the province combined with table 6 the distributions of the precipitation complexity grades in each area obtained from the cmfo pptte mspe among them the calculation of situ data is recorded as s cpm and the calculation of gpcc data is recorded as g cmp mspe pm mpm woa pptte mspe wpm and ω pso pptte mspe ω ppm algorithms were statistically analyzed as shown in fig 10 the results of all four algorithms indicate that the precipitation complexity grades are relatively high for the ne and sw regions and low for the se in conclusion the results of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data are consistent with those of the other results 5 5 analysis of the reliability of the precipitation complexity measurement results to further judge the reliability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data the results of fig 8 and table 6 are combined to quantitatively analyze the division of the precipitation complexity grade distribution among the different geographical regions to evaluate the geographical discrimination capabilities of each algorithm and the division of the precipitation complexity grade distribution among the different administrative regions of heilongjiang province to evaluate the administrative discrimination capabilities of the algorithms as shown in table 7 table 7 shows that the geographic discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under the gpcc data is the same as the situ data but the administrative discrimination capability is significantly higher than the situ data therefore the precipitation complexity classification of the cmfo pptte mspe under the gpcc data is more advantageous as the same time the geographical discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data is significantly higher than that of the mspe pm algorithm the four algorithms are ranked as follows from the highest discrimination capability to the lowest cmfo pptte mspe woa pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm the geographical discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm is not lower than that of any of the other three algorithms thus demonstrating that the precipitation complexity grades obtained with the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm can well reflect the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm also shows a higher administrative discrimination capability than the mspe pm algorithm this finding indicates that cmfo pptte mspe is more effective than the traditional mspe pm algorithm in characterizing the precipitation distribution in heilongjiang province the ranking of the four algorithms in terms of their administrative discrimination capabilities is as follows from high to low cmfo pptte mspe ω pso pptte mspe mspe pm woa pptte mspe among them the administrative discrimination capability of the cmfo pptte mspe is significantly higher than that of the other three algorithms indicating that the proposed algorithm can more effectively distinguish the precipitation grades of the different regions the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm can better distinguish the complexity of this region in terms of the grade distribution thus making the division of the precipitation complexity distribution more balanced thus the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm has advantages for the overall evaluation of the mspe and can be used to more accurately identify the precipitation complexity of various regions in conclusion the cmfo pptte mspe algorithm under gpcc data is superior in performance to the other three algorithms and better than the situ data its yields more accurate complexity results in terms of entropy these results show that this new method is suitable for measuring the complexity of precipitation moreover it also provides a new approach for mining the fine structural features of regional hydrological series 6 conclusions 1 a correlation analysis of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province with gpcc and udel data shows that the correlation coefficient with the gpcc data is 0 989 the correlation coefficient with the udel data is 0 994 the monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province are then sorted into seasonal precipitation data and a correlation analysis shows that the correlation coefficients of each season are all higher than 0 9 and pass the 0 001 level of significance test the average deviation between monthly precipitation data of heilongjiang province from 1967 to 2017 and the gpcc and udel data is processed and the following conclusions are obtained except for the daqing region the average deviation of monthly precipitation data with gpcc and udel data is less than 10 2 cmfo pptte model processing of the mspe of precipitation of gpcc data is performed to obtain an aggregate entropy value and compare with situ data thus providing a new method for calculating mspe eigenvalues cmfo pptte mspe these eigenvalues can then be classified in accordance with established evaluation criteria for the entropy based sorting of precipitation complexity grades the regions are ranked in order of their entropy values as follows from high to low daxing anling qiqihar daqing shuangyashan jiamusi hegang harbin mudanjiang qitaihe yichun jixi suihua heihe a comparison of the correlations between the aggregated entropy values and the underlying surface types human activity indicators terrain characteristics and other related factors shows that the altitude p 0 05 water area p 0 05 forestland area p 0 01 and urban construction area p 0 05 have the most significant impacts on the precipitation complexity in heilongjiang province and all have significant positive correlations 3 an analysis of the influence of the time scale on precipitation complexity research shows that monthly precipitation discrimination is greater than daily precipitation discrimination the results also revealed that cmfo pptte mspe under the monthly precipitation sequence can better reflect the complexity of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province 4 to explore the future trends of precipitation in various regions of heilongjiang province the rbf neural network is used to predict and analyze the precipitation of situ data in various regions of heilongjiang province the results

5002,forests play an important role in the water cycle and in the control of soil erosion the canopy as the first active surface of the forest directly affects soil erosion by redistributing rainfall however the effects of the plant morphological characteristics of different tree species on rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction have not been determined we determined 116 globally important woody tree species and classified them based on the differences of plant life forms leaf textures and trichomes on leaves in the guizhou karstic regions of china the water adsorbed on the branches and leaves of these species was measured to explain rainfall interception we further selected four representative species among the 116 species and measured rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall as well as the corresponding indices of plant morphological characteristics under simulated rainfall results indicated that the adsorbed water showed considerable differences between tree species with different plant morphological characteristics tree species with trichomes on their leaves had the largest amount of adsorbed water compared to those with papery or leathery leaves and those without trichomes rainfall interception was significantly dependent on leaf area index lai mean leaf area mla and leaf shape factor lsf but stemflow and throughfall were dependent on diffuse non

regions 1 introduction soil erosion is one of the major causes of land degradation worldwide vegetation plays an important role in the control of soil erosion yuan 1997 wang 2002 gyssels et al 2005 xu et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that different types of forests and tree species have significant impacts on soil erosion casermeiro et al 2004 the first impact begins with the regulation of rainfall by forest canopy morphology vis 1986 the regulation includes rainfall interception and kinetic energy nanko et al 2015a 2015b allen et al 2017 in karstic regions the strong exchange between surface water and groundwater easily results in the insidious loss of soil and water through the crevices of stony habitats and causes barren soil environment borghi et al 2016 the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction of karst forest canopy play a more important role in the water resource conservation and prevention from the loss of finite soil than non karstic regions boulding 1995 ries et al 2015 the forest canopy consists of plant species with different morphological characteristics and this increases the complexities in the regulations of rainfall interception and kinetic energy wang et al 2006 fan et al 2014 many scientists have explored these regulations to clarify their complexities allen et al 2017 corresponding results can be used to explain the underlying mechanisms of the redistribution of rainfall and can screen plant species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for application to the control of soil erosion dai et al 2015 borghi et al 2016 specific studies have primarily focused on three aspects i e the roles of rainfall characteristics canopy structures and weather factors in the regulation of rainfall inkiläinen et al 2013 nanko et al 2015a xiao and mcpherson 2016 many studies have indicated that rainfall interception by the forest canopy increases with an increase of rainfall under low rainfall intensities however with a prolonged period of rainfall the interception reaches saturation even if rainfall continues to increase bochet et al 1998 wang et al 2012 the differences of rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction under the canopies of forests or tree species are particularly large when rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity and duration change over time aston 1979 herwitz 1985 nanko et al 2015a second rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction are dependent on the variation of canopy structure klaassen et al 1998 aboal et al 1999 fleischbein et al 2005 different tree species have different morphological characteristics such as the spatial distribution and densities of branches and leaves the size of the branch and leaf biomass canopy cover and certain botanical characteristics which traditionally define canopy structure and then affect rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction asdak et al 1998 jackson 2000 levia and frost 2003 many studies have found that rainfall kinetic energy is closely related to raindrop size distribution and the terminal velocity of raindrops which are directly regulated by the canopy structure ziadat and taimeh 2013 nadal romero et al 2015 cerdà et al 2016 third rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction change significantly with different seasons wind and temperature chen and li 2016 the rate of rainfall interception during a dry season is far higher than during a wet season for a forest but the kinetic energy reduction of raindrops is the opposite coutinho and tomás 1995 in a forest there are many different plant species these species have evolved from different geological eras to develop many different botanical characteristics such as plant life form leaf textures trichomes on leaves mla lsf lai mta leaf mass area and difn the fraction of the sky that is not blocked by foliage in a tree canopy liu and pattey 2010 these characteristics define the differences of canopy structure among plant species the structure of canopies will reflect the structure of the dominant tree type e g an evergreen conifer forest compared with a deciduous forest however there have been few studies concerned with the effects of the botanical characteristics which are often measured by instruments or classified by plant ecology on rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction at a plant individual level wang and duan 2010 wang et al 2014 holder and gibbes 2017 levia et al 2017 a systematical study of the relationships between these characteristics and rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction at a level of the individual species can not only clarify the mechanisms underlying the redistribution of rainfall but also screen tree species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for application to ecological engineering controlling soil erosion liu and pattey 2010 levia et al 2017 here we measured the amount of water adsorbed on the branches and leaves of 116 important woody species and the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction of four representative species selected from the 116 tree species most of which are globally distributed under simulated rainfall at seven sites in the guizhou karst region of china we assumed that 1 the adsorbed water on branches and leaves was dependent on plant life form leaf texture trichomes on leaves mla blma and lsf i e six types of plant morphological characteristics and the rainfall interception of different tree species changed identically with their adsorbed water on branches and leaves based on the tests of four species under simulated rainfall 2 the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for four tree species could be explained by lai mta difn mla and lsf which could well describe the canopy structures of the tree species the aims of this study are to understand the botanical mechanisms underlying rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction and the optimal species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction we intend to answer the following questions 1 are there significant differences among tree species in the adsorption of water by branches and leaves 2 what are the dominant plant morphological characteristics and tree species affecting the adsorption of water by branches and leaves closely related to rainfall interception 3 how do plant morphological characteristics influence the redistribution and kinetic energy of rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites sampling sites for measuring the adsorption of water by branches and leaves are located in the central guizhou province of china fig 1 the region is the largest karst ecosystem in the world yuan 1997 evergreen broadleaf forest is a zonal vegetation in the region which reflects the characteristics of water and heat in the middle subtropical zone climate on the floristic composition appearance and structure of the forest community planning commission of guizhou 1987 the climate is characterized as a subtropical type annual average rainfall is 1189 75 mm and annual average temperature ranges from 13 6 c to 19 6 c prior to the experiment we selected 116 tree species with an important role in structuring the karst evergreen broadleaf forests in this region and seven forest sites for measuring the adsorption of water by branches and leaves these tree species have been recorded in previous studies and are accepted as important tree species with a mostly global distribution huang et al 1988 wang et al 2014 these species include 67 evergreen plants and 49 deciduous plants supplemental file 1 the four representative tree species photinia davidsoniae rehd et wils ligustrum lucidum ait cinnamomum camphora linn presl and cercis yunnanensis huet were selected from 116 tree species for an artificial rainfall experiment above the forest canopy fig 2 c yunnanensis huet is deciduous and the others are evergreen the experimental site for the artificial rainfall experiment is located in the forest of the south campus of guizhou university 106 40 00 e 26 25 38 n fig 1 the type of the forest is evergreen broadleaf and the soil under the forest is yellow soil we selected a representative individual of the four species with a complete canopy and its height and the project area of the canopy was not more than 3 5 m and 20 m2 because the rain height and area of the artificial rainfall simulator were 4 m and 25 m2 respectively 2 2 tests of the adsorption of water by branches and leaves the popular method for determining rainfall interception is spiral groove technology levia and frost 2003 reid and lewis 2009 however this method cannot be used on a large number of plants including small bush and herbs in a forest therefore we tested the adsorption of water by branches and leaves to explain rainfall interception the adsorption of water by branches and leaves is comprised of the water films and water drops adhering to the branches and leaves in a tree canopy when rainwater falls onto the tree canopy huang et al 1988 wang and duan 2010 the water on the branches and leaves can change to throughfall and stemflow but the relatively stable section on the branches and leaves is considered rainfall interception nanko et al 2015a 2015b we successively searched 2 4 sample trees of each species at the first site based on the average diameter at breast height of each species according to the data from a previous vegetation survey wang et al 2014 if the sample tree of a target species at the first site was not found we would continue to search at another site until all species were found all sample trees were required to have a complete canopy and to be growing well without artificial destruction pests or disease we sampled five standard branches five replicates with leaves from the different sections of the tree canopy for each of the sample trees the basal diameters of the sampled branches for all tree species were determined to be one centimeter because most of leaves in different tree species mainly grow on the branches the diameters of which are generally about one centimeter according to our investigation wang and duan 2010 the diameters of the second or third order of branches on each standard branch some plants had but other plants could not had not been unified in sampling which was considered as interspecific differences in botanical characteristics we tried to sample similarly sized and aged branches from different tree species based on visual detection and branching then each branch was fixed in the device for the test of the adsorbed water and weighed fig 3 the manner of stretching of the branch in the device was similar to that in a tree canopy tap water was used as rainfall to spray the surface of each branch for three minutes with a sprayer placed above the device the volume of spraying water was equal to 150 mm rainfall which was the maximum daily rainfall in the region we used the maximum rainfall during one day so that the surface of a sampled branch and the leaves on which were completely wetted during a short time then we could test the approximate value of the maximum rainfall interception of the branch and leaves the completely wet branch was weighed when no water dripped from the branch after one minute the ratios of the weight of adsorbed water on branch and the upper surface of leaves to the weight of the branch and leaves rwwu for each species were calculate using eq 1 1 rwwu or rwwul weight of sample after spraying water g weight of sample without spraying water g 100 weight of sample without spraying water g rwwu was one result obtained when we did not rotate the knob linking the branch at the right of the device fig 3 under the circumstance the sprays primarily touched the upper surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch after weighing we obtained the data of the weight of adsorbed water on the upper surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch the goal of the experiment was to test adsorbed water under the conditions of no wind blowing branches and leaves to flip them up and raindrops only falling on the upper surfaces of branches and leaves during a rain event subsequently we rotated the knob linking the branch at the right of the device and caused the branch to rotate 1080 i e three circles when we sprayed water to the branch for three minutes fig 3 the rotation caused both the upper and lower surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch to touch sprays therefore water was adsorbed on both the upper and lower surfaces of branch and leaves then when no water dripped from the branch and leaves for about one minute the fully wet branch and leaves were weighed the ratios of the weight of adsorbed water on branch and the upper and lower surface of leaves to the weight of the branch and leaves rwwul for each species were calculated using equation 1 the goal of the experiment was to test adsorbed water after wind had blown branches and leaves to flip them up in a tree canopy and raindrops had fallen to the upper and lower surfaces of branches and leaves during a rain event with wind rwwu and rwwul are the approximate value of the maximum rainfall interception of branches and leaves rather than real rainfall interception but the two indices can be used to compare the influences of the plant morphological characteristics of many different species on rainfall interception and screen plant species with high interception rainfall concretely we sampled 15 leaves from the tree canopy of 116 sample trees and used the laser leaf area meter ci 203 cid bio science inc usa to test mla and lsf lsf is the corrected ratio of leaf area and square of perimeter calculated by eq 2 which is equal to one for a circular leaf liu and pattey 2010 wang et al 2019 2 f 4 π a p 2 where f is leaf shape factor a is leaf area m2 and p is perimeter m then we counted the number of leaves on the standard branches of 116 tree species which were used to test rwwu and rwwul and calculated the total leaf area of each standard branch by multiplying mla and the number of leaves blma g cm 2 an index similar to leaf mass area was equal to the ratios of the weight of a standard branch with leaves to the total leaf area of the standard meanwhile leaf texture was identified it was recorded whether there were trichomes on the leaves the type of plant life form including evergreen and deciduous plants was also determined for each species supplemental file 1 then all tree species were grouped into two groups based on leaf texture whether there were trichomes and plant life form respectively the differences of the adsorption of water by branches and leaves between groups were compared the relationships between the adsorption of water and plant morphological traits were analyzed 2 3 artificial simulation of rainfall a portable artificial rainfall simulator sc 101 developed by institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences was used in this experiment zhang et al 2012 zhou 2013 supplemental file 2 the simulator had 12 sprinkler heads four groups produced by spaying systems co usa they crossed to spray water to a 25 m2 range and rain was evenly distributed within the range based on product manual we also checked rain intensity at different points within the 25 m2 range by a digital rain gauge linked to the rain simulator placed at a similar height bracket to four tree canopies before the rainfall experiments rain intensity was similar the coefficient of rainfall uniformity on the surface is more than 88 among different points and directly displayed on the control panel the data of rain intensity was automatically recorded and could be downloaded rain intensity for a rain event was set beforehand by a manual way according to the pressure values corresponding to different rain intensity on a pressure gauge installed in the main pipe of the simulator however we accepted the rain intensity measured by the intelligent rain gauge during each rain event based on the instructions in product manual the specific operation of each artificial rain included the following steps 1 the intelligent rain gauge linked to the simulator was placed on a bracket beside a tree canopy within the range of 25 m2 so that the splash raindrop from the tree canopy could not come into the gauge and then the power was turned on to display the menu on the control panel 2 the manual operation of rainfall was selected the unit of rain intensity was set to mm and the interval of rainfall intensity sampling was set to 20 s 3 start was pressed to begin the rain and the pressure gauge was adjusted to the value corresponding to the rainfall intensity that the experiment required 4 rain intensity was automatically measured and the recorded data was downloaded through the control panel of the simulator after a rain event had ended for the whole experiment a total of 20 artificial rainfall events were conducted with five rainfall events for each tree species the rainfall duration of each event was 10 min the observed intensity of rainfall ranged from 8 8 mm h to 69 8 mm h 2 3 1 tests of the parameters of the canopy structure we used a laser leaf area meter ci 203 to determine mla and lsf for the four representative tree species lai mta and difn were measured using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln usa the spatial distribution of leaves on branches in a tree canopy can be comprehensively reflected by mta which is an important indicator of canopy structure mta strongly affects the effective photosynthetic area of leaves feng et al 2016 2 3 2 tests of stemflow throughfall interception and rainfall intensity we used a collection tank method to determine the volume of throughfall tp under the canopy four containers with sharp edged rims were placed under a tree canopy to collect throughfall the spaces among four containers were averagely assigned each container was 50 cm length 31 cm width and 30 cm height and its area was 1550 cm2 we measured and converted the volume of throughfall in the four containers into the total volume of throughfall tp with the projection area of the tree canopy after each rainfall stemflow sp was tested using the spiral groove method reid and lewis 2009 a rectangular plastic tank 50 cm 31 cm 30 cm was used to collect stemflow sp specifically a rubber tube with a diameter of 2 cm was longitudinally cut and spirally wound around the trunk for two and a half weeks before the simulation of rainfall one edge of the cut tube was fixed with pushpins and the seam between the edge of the cut tube and the surface of the trunk was sealed with melted silica gel or paraffin wax stemflow flowed into the plastic tank when the rainfall simulation was conducted stemflow in the tank was tested using a graduated cylinder after each rain event the interception ip of rainfall was calculated using eq 3 in which we ignored the section of evaporation during rain 3 i p r tp sp where ip is interception l r is rainfall l tp is throughfall l and sp is stemflow l r is calculated by the following equation r r i t 3600 l a in the equation r i is rainfall intensity mm h t is rainfall duration s l a is the projection area of a tree canopy m2 2 3 3 raindrop diameter we used the splash procedure to determine the raindrop diameter in the artificial simulation of rainfall wiesner 1895 hu et al 2016 specifically the different specifications of syringes needles and droppers were prepared to make different diameters of water droplets similar to raindrops supplemental file 3 we used each syringe to absorb enough water and then weighed the syringe the syringe was then reweighed after 100 water drops were allowed to drip at heights of 2 m and 10 cm onto filter papers coated with eosin powder eosin talc 1 10 the average weight of each droplet g for the different types of water droplets was calculated the volume v and diameter d of each droplet are given by eqs 4 and 5 hu et al 2016 li et al 2019 4 v g r 5 d 3 v 4 π 3 2 where v d and g are the volume cm3 diameter cm and weight of a single droplet g respectively and r is the density of water 1 g cm3 the dried filter papers were scanned into a computer and the mean area a cm2 and diameter d of the color spots mm caused by each droplet was calculated using image analysis software the models of the correlations between d and d were established using a regression of power function supplemental file 3 we selected eq 6 to apply to the following study considering that the height at which the raindrops fell from the canopies was relatively close to 2 m 6 d 0 2859 d 0 7938 r 2 0 9971 where d and d are the diameters of the color spots mm and raindrops mm 2 3 4 kinetic energy of raindrops we used two raindrop samplers to alternately collect raindrops at four sampling points under a tree canopy during each rain event five filter papers diameter 15 cm were used at each point each filter paper in a raindrop sampler was exposed for five seconds then the diameters d of splash spots on the dried filter papers were measured by scanning and image analysis the d of each raindrop was calculated using eq 6 based on the d values of all raindrops measured during five rain events with different intensity for a tree species we grouped the numbers of raindrops with different diameters the accumulative volume and percentage of the raindrops at these different diameters were analyzed levia et al 2017 as the percentage of the accumulative volume of raindrops reached 50 of the total volume the corresponding diameter of raindrops d50 was determined d50 was used to indicate the raindrop distribution furthermore the v and g values of each raindrop during each rain event were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the kinetic energy of each raindrop was calculated by eq 7 nanko et al 2004 hu et al 2016 7 e i 1 2 m i v i where ei mi and vi are the kinetic energy j mass kg and terminal velocity m s 1 of the individual raindrop with diameter di under simulated rainfall the vi is given with eq 8 8 v i v m 1 e x p 2 g v m 2 h where v m is the terminal velocity of the individual raindrop under natural rainfall m s 1 based on eqs 9 and 10 h is the raindrop falling height from crown bottom m and g is the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 hu et al 2016 li et al 2019 when 0 05 mm d 1 9 mm 9 v m 0 496

3 1 differences in the adsorption of water for different tree species descriptive statistics based on spss indicated that the average wwu wwul rwwu and rwwul of all 116 tree species were 3 28 g 5 51 g 15 42 and 24 76 respectively table 1 for the specific values of each tree species refer to supplemental file 1 there was a large interspecific variation in the adsorbed water of branches and leaves based on the maximum minimum and standard variation of the four indices all indices including adsorbed water and morphological traits followed the approximately normal distributions according to p p figures supplemental file 4 the wwul and rwwul of all the tree species were unanimously larger than their wwu and rwwu the lower surface of branches and leaves obviously increased the adsorption of water comparatively plant life form leaf texture and trichomes significantly affected on the adsorption of water on branches and leaves specifically the rwwu and rwwul of evergreen trees were 14 45 and 22 45 respectively which were smaller than those of deciduous trees 16 86 and 28 16 table 2 the rwwu and rwwul of tree species with leathery leaves were 14 05 and 21 73 respectively which were smaller than those of tree species with papery leaves 17 24 and 28 77 table 3 the rwwu and rwwul of the tree species with trichomes were 19 80 and 36 61 respectively obviously higher than for tree species without trichomes 13 68 and 20 06 table 4 by comparison the tree species with trichomes had the largest rwwul 36 61 tree species with papery leaves 28 77 deciduous tree species 28 16 evergreen tree species 22 45 and tree species with leathery leaves 21 73 had moderate rwwul values the tree species without trichomes 20 06 had the smallest rwwul the rwwu for these types of tree species showed the following order the tree species with trichomes 19 80 the tree species with papery leaves 17 24 deciduous tree species 16 86 evergreen tree species 14 45 the tree species with leathery leaves 14 05 tree species without trichomes 13 68 in addition to the rwwul and rwwu there were also significant differences between these types of tree species in most of the botanical morphological indices including the weight of branches and leaves mla total leaf area lsf and blma 3 2 dominant morphological traits and tree species affecting the adsorption of water 3 2 1 relationships between plant morphological traits and the adsorption of water it was found that there were different degrees of the relationships between the indices of plant morphological traits including the weight of branches and leaves mla total leaf area lsf and blma and wwu and wwul respectively table 5 the weight of branches and leaves total leaf area and mla were significantly related to wwu and wwul respectively blma was also significantly related to wwul however there were not significantly relationships between blma and wwu and between lsf and both wwu and wwul 3 2 2 dominant plant morphological traits affecting the adsorption of water further regression analysis with four significantly correlated indices of plant morphological traits on wwu and wwul in table 5 indicated that the weight of branches and leaves could explain about 36 and 43 variation of wwu and wwul respectively fig 4 a total leaf area could explain about 45 and 44 variation of wwu and wwul which was higher than the weight of branches and leaves fig 4b mla showed lower explanatory power for wwu and wwul than total leaf area and the weight of branches and leaves fig 4c blma showed the lowest explanation for wwu and wwul among the four indices fig 4d 3 2 3 dominant tree species in the adsorption of water the sequence of rwwu and rwwul for the 116 tree species showed a gradual change supplemental file 1 the five largest tree species in wwul were successively eriobotrya japonica thunb lindl brandisia hancei hook f millettia pachycarpa benth viburnum chinshanense graebn and millettia dielsiana harms e japonica thunb lindl has large and long leaves on which there are many trichomes although the tree species is evergreen and its leaves are leathery b hancei hook f is also evergreen but it has moderate sized papery leaves on which there are many trichomes m pachycarpa benth v chinshanense graebn and m dielsiana harms are all deciduous plants and there are trichomes on their moderate sized papery leaves for the wwu the five largest tree species were respectively paulownia tomentosa thunb steud millettia dielsiana harms brandisia hancei hook f viburnum dilatatum thunb and mallotus repandus willd muell arg p tomentosa thunb steud m repandus willd muell arg and v dilatatum thunb are deciduous plants and the former two species have large papery leaves with trichomes however there are relatively less trichomes on the leaves of m repandus willd muell arg than on p tomentosa thunb steud and v dilatatum thunb the other two species are in the lists of the five largest tree species for rwwul 3 3 redistribution of the artificially simulated rainfall 3 3 1 rainfall intensity and stemflow throughfall and interception the interception of four species increased with rainfall intensity and the interception ability was different among the four species fig 5 under the same rainfall intensity of 60 mm h c yunnanensis huet and l lucidum ait had the largest and smallest interception the four species also had different throughfall under the same rainfall intensity the throughfall of each species continually increased with increasing rainfall intensity and the throughfall of p davidsoniae rehd et wils and c yunnanensis huet was obviously higher than that of the other two species the stemflow of p davidsoniae rehd et wils was highest among the four species followed by c yunnanensis huet and l lucidum ait the least stemflow occurred in the main stem of c camphora linn presl regression analysis indicated that the relationships between rainfall intensity and interception could be fitted by logarithmic function but the relationships between intensity and throughfall and stemflow were better fitted by linear models table 6 3 3 2 plant morphological characteristics and stemflow throughfall and interception interspecific differences in lai mta mla lsf rwwu and rwwul for the four tree species were significant table 7 however differences in the index difn and lsf were not significant the large broadleaf plant p davidsoni had the largest lai and correspondingly the small broadleaf one l lucidum ait had the smallest lai the mta of c yunnanens was largest among the four tree species and that of p davidsoni was unexpectedly tested as zero because its leaves were almost flat for the index mla c yunnanens had the largest value and p davidsoni had the smallest value the mla of c yunnanens was many times greater than that of the other three species the difn and lsf of the four tree species were all smaller than 1 interspecific differences in interception stemflow and throughfall for the four tree species were also significant table 7 the rwwu and rwwul of c yunnanens and c camphora were about two times more than that of p davidsoni and l lucidum ait correspondingly c yunnanens and l lucidum ait had the highest and lowest interception respectively among these four tree species l lucidum ait had the highest throughfall and p davidsoni had the highest stemflow regression analysis indicated that the relationships between interception and lai mla and lsf respectively were statistically significant indicating the interception was dependent on the three indices conversely throughfall and stemflow were highly related to difn table 8 3 4 kinetic energy analysis of simulated rainfall 3 4 1 percentages of the numbers of raindrops with different diameters we defined the different diameters of raindrops by a 0 1 mm increment and calculated the percentages of the numbers of raindrops with different diameters the percentages of the numbers of raindrops consistently showed a single peak curve with an increase in the diameter of the raindrops fig 6 a1 d1 the highest peak of the curve appeared between the raindrop diameters of 0 5 and 1 5 mm for the four tree species the percentages of the numbers of raindrops increased rapidly to the highest peak between the intervals of a small diameter at the beginning stage then gradually became small over a raindrop diameter of 1 5 mm and approached zero at a diameter of 7 mm therefore these curves of the percentages exhibited a long tail the percentages of the numbers of raindrops under the canopies also fluctuated greatly with increasing rainfall intensity with a change of rainfall intensity the highest peaks for the curves showed some differences in height for each tree species fig 6a1 d1 by comparison the raindrops of the simulated rainfall outside the canopies were only distributed between a small range of diameters fig 6a2 d2 the percentage of the numbers of raindrops outside the canopies fluctuated relatively less than that under the canopies indicating that tree canopy played a significant role in the regulation of the raindrop sizes 3 4 2 percentages of the volumes of raindrops with different diameters four tree species had an obvious peak in the percentages of the volumes of raindrops between the diameters of 4 mm and 7 mm fig 7 however the peak for c yunnanensis huet occurred a little bit later than p davidsoniae rehd et wils l lucidum ait and c camphora linn presl the percentages of the volumes of raindrops with the raindrop diameter showed a gradual increasing trend based on trend lines for the four tree species comparatively the peak of raindrops outside the canopy mainly occurred between the diameters of 0 mm and 2 mm we can also see from fig 7 that l lucidum ait and p davidsoniae rehd et wils showed a relatively small percentage of the volume of raindrops between the diameters of 0 5 mm and 1 5 mm indicating that the two species had a bit higher interception to the rainfall of the diameter than c camphora linn presl and c yunnanensis huet compared with outside of canopies the interception of the four tree species between the diameters of 0 5 mm and 1 5 mm brought in a large amount of throughfall between the diameter between 4 mm and 6 mm 3 4 3 percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops with different diameters the percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops for four tree species all presented smooth s form curves but that of raindrops outside the canopies was a logarithmic curve fig 8 the percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops outside the canopy rapidly increased to 100 from 0 45 to 1 99 mm of the diameters of the raindrops conversely the percentage of the cumulative volumes of raindrops under the canopies slowly increased from 0 5 to 7 8 mm of the diameters of the raindrops indicating that the canopies changed dsd with interception and obviously increased the volume of the large raindrops of the four tree species c yunnanensis huet showed a lower percentage of the cumulative volumes of raindrops than the other three tree species with the same raindrop diameter 3 4 4 kinetic intensity the kinetic energy of the raindrops under the canopies of four tree species most more than 15 j m 2 mm 1 was far greater than that outside the canopy only 7 98 j m 2 mm 1 table 9 the canopies of these four tree species significantly changed the kinetic energy of the raindrops c yunnanensis huet and p davidsoniae rehd et wils had relatively higher kinetic energies than l lucidum ait and c camphora linn presl 3 4 5 plant morphological characteristics and kinetic energy regression analysis indicated that mta mla and lsf could well explain d50 but for keu lai mta and mla showed a high explanatory power table 10 lai was an important parameter of plant morphology but the r2 of the regression model between lai and d50 was very small 0 205 indicating that lai was not a highly explanatory variable for d50 in the study conversely the r2 of the regression model between lai and keu was relatively large r2 0 732 the values of r2 for the regressions between difn and both d50 and keu were also very small 0 105 0 031 the regression of lsf on d50 and keu showed different r2 0 777 and 0 194 this indicated different impacts of lsf on d50 and keu 4 discussion 4 1 adsorption of water by branches and leaves the most important two factors in rainfall interception are the weather conditions and the morphological characteristics of the tree species xiao and mcpherson 2011 zabret 2013 most previous studies primarily compared the differences of tree species in the morphological characteristics and the corresponding effects on the redistribution of rainfall livesley et al 2014 sun et al 2015 these studies mainly focused on direct tests of interception stemflow and throughfall for different tree species and analyzed the qualitative effects of the morphological characteristics xiao and mcpherson 2011 fan et al 2014 li et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the adsorption of water by branches and leaves in trees is the primary mechanism of rainfall interception and affects its magnitude wang and duan 2010 prior studies that have noted the importance of particulate matter on foliage with different hair densities or types alter the surface tension of detained droplets levia et al 2017 in this instance the adsorption of water by branches and leaves was assumed to be dependent on these morphological characteristics the branches and leaves were not separately sampled to test adsorbed water and simulate the real state of branches and leaves in canopies we quantitatively identified the effects of plant life forms leaf texture and leaves with or without trichomes on the adsorption of water by branches and leaves based on large sample evergreen broadleaf and deciduous broadleaf plants plant life forms leaf textures and leaves with or without trichomes obviously affected the adsorbed water the adsorption ability of water for deciduous tree species having papery leaves and trichomes on leaves was strong while evergreen tree species having leathery leaves and no trichomes on leaves was weak the presence of trichomes on leaves had the largest effect on the adsorbed water deciduous trees had a larger mla than evergreen trees there was a significantly positive relationship between mla and adsorbed water meanwhile many deciduous trees evolutionarily form papery leaves consequently deciduous trees showed a higher adsorption ability of water than evergreen tree species for the papery leaves there are no or only thin hydrophobic horny layers on the leaves thus the tree species with papery leaves naturally had a high adsorption ability of water trichomes on leaves are a structure that can directly hold raindrops and can significantly increase the adsorption volume of water wang and duan 2010 in addition the adsorption volume of water was obviously dependent on the size of mla but not lsf large leaf areas mean more adsorption surfaces to increase the adsorption volume of water however lsf is an ecological index explaining the relationship between mla and perimeter lsf was not directly related to the adsorption volume of water the three types of plant morphological characteristics are different among the 116 tree species due to long term evolution and adaption of plant species to environments chitwood and topp 2015 levia et al 2015 this indicates that plant evolution and adaption have an obvious effect on the hydrological processes of plant organs however we found that the characteristics of branches did not show as great a difference as that of leaves among these tree species because we sampled branches that were similar in diameter and age wang and duan 2010 the surface areas of branches were also very small compared with that of the leaves this supports our mixed sampling of branches and leaves which could simulate the state of branches and leaves in a tree canopy comparatively there were trichomes on the back of leaves for many of the 116 tree species which mainly resulted in larger wwul than wwu values supplemental file 1 the sequence of the rwwu and rwwul for the 116 tree species indicated the ability of each tree species to adsorb water onto branches and leaves supplemental file 1 most of these tree species are globally distributed the twentieth largest tree species in rwwu and rwwul in the sequence are obviously dominant species in terms of the adsorbed water based on the relationship between adsorbed water and rainfall interception these dominant species can be used to some degree in applications of ecological engineering for soil and water conservation however the species with a good performance in adsorbed water may not be able to adapt to the stress of habitats in some regions attarod et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2016 zhou et al 2016 in application it is necessary to consider not only the adsorption capacity of water to increase rainfall interception but also plant growth and adaptation to the environment 4 2 redistribution of rainfall rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall were primarily influenced by three factors i the type of rainfall events magnitude intensity and duration ii tree species and canopy structure iii antecedent weather aston 1979 crockford and richardson 2000 nanko et al 2015a many studies indicated that throughfall and stemflow gradually increased but rainfall interception tended to remain at a high level with an increase of rainfall intensity parsons and stone 2006 in this study we verified similar changes of rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow with increasing rainfall intensity for different tree species however rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow were significantly different at the same levels of rainfall intensity among the tree species the differences were caused by canopy structure described by plant morphological characteristics livesley et al 2014 nanko et al 2015a the different tree species developed unique plant morphological characteristics and corresponding canopy structures in a long term evolutionary history to adapt to various environments asdak et al 1998 chappell et al 2001 dietz et al 2006 in previous studies scientists have tended to quantify canopy structures by crown width tree height numbers of branches leaf biomass diameter at the breast height and individual density and to establish the relationships between these parameters and rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall crockford and richardson 2000 chappell et al 2001 in this study lai mta difn mla and lsf were tested to quantify canopy structure for four tree species lai mta difn mla and lsf are comprehensive plant morphological indices to describe canopy structure liu and pattey 2010 lai and mla represent the density of leaves in the canopy high lai and mla values denote a large area of rainfall interception mta is the intersection angle between the surfaces of leaves and flat ground obviously a small mta favors rainfall interception difn mainly represents the size of gaps in the canopy and a large value of difn will theoretically result in a large throughfall liu and pattey 2010 based on the results of the analysis rainfall interception was significantly dependent on lai mla and lsf and lai showed the highest correlation with rainfall interception suggesting that the three easily tested indicators can be used to indirectly explain rainfall interception however difn was significantly related to throughfall and stemflow we consider that when a high difn is tested for a tree a large amount of rainfall will fall through the relatively many gaps in the canopy to the stems of trees and the forest floor resulting in high throughfall and stemflow therefore difn can also be used to explain throughfall and stemflow these results verified our previous assumptions by comparison of the results of four representative tree species we found that if a tree species had a large rwwu or rwwul the tree species correspondingly showed a large rainfall interception specifically l lucidum ait was found to have the lowest rainfall interception and its rwwu or rwwul were also very small among the four tree species l lucidum ait has the smallest leathery leaves without any trichomes on the leaves than the other three tree species it is also an evergreen tree species these characteristics are most unfavorable to adsorb water the rainfall interception of c yunnanensis huet was the largest among the four tree species and correspondingly the rwwu or rwwul of the tree species were very large c yunnanens has thick and large papery leaves and on the central and lower sections of the leaves there are trichomes the tree species is also a deciduous tree species these characteristics are very favorable for water adsorption onto the leaves evergreen p davidsoniae rehd has relatively larger leathery leaves without trichomes therefore it exhibited moderate rainfall interception with low rwwu and rwwul evergreen c camphora linn presl has thin and relatively small leathery leavers without trichomes which is disadvantageous to water adsorption to the leaves however c camphora linn presl was found to have a smaller rainfall interception and large rwwu or rwwul for the species the gaps in its canopy were large which decreased rainfall interception specifically in the test of adsorbed water the experiment did not show the influence of the gaps on adsorption of water by branches and leaves the branches with leaves were not precisely identical in their size and large branches might have caused a large increase of adsorbed water with more branches and leaves however the study has basically verified the suggested assumption i e the rainfall interception of tree species identically changed with their adsorption of water by branches and leaves aston 1979 holwerda et al 2010 4 3 kinetic energy of rainfall the different diameters of raindrops directly lead to a change in terminal velocities and kinetic energy of the raindrops beard 1976 atlas and ulbrich 1977 zabret et al 2017 it was essential to measure dsd for an evaluation of the kinetic energy of rainfall under a tree canopy levia et al 2019 in previous studies beginning from 1892 scientists have developed a series of methods such as a splash staining method a flour pellet method dsd instrument measurement a glass plate method an automated momentum method a photographic method and an optical disdrometer to measure dsd levia et al 2017 recently nanko et al 2004 adopted multiple laser disdrometers for the first time to measure dsd in the sub canopy study we used the traditional splash procedure to test the diameters of raindrops and established the relationships between the diameters of raindrops and the size of color spots testik and barros 2007 angulo martínez et al 2012 angulo martínez and barros 2015 furthermore dsd and velocities of raindrops have been quantified to estimate the kinetic energy of rainfall under the canopies of four tree species when the gradual rainfall intensity was manipulated levia et al 2019 the number of large raindrops obviously increased due to the impacts of canopy structure on dsd however small raindrops were still dominant in number similar to the rainfall outside the canopies however the volume and cumulative volume of large raindrops formed by interception and reassembling of canopies obviously increased under the canopies of the four tree species in the simulated rainfall consequently the canopies linearly enlarged the kinetic energy of the raindrops but which was smaller than the results observed under the canopies of china fir forest with natural rainfall wang 2001 the amplitude of increases in the kinetic energy of raindrops under canopies with simulated rainfall in the present study is similar to that observed with natural rainfall in warm tropical forest and china fir forest vis 1986 li et al 2019 compared with four tree species the warm tropical forest has lush branches and leaves vis 1986 the branches and leaves of china fir has about 45 angle of extending forward the surface of ground li et al 2019 the botanical morphological traits in the two studies are obviously advantageous to intercepting and reassembling of raindrops and increase the kinetic energy of raindrops the intensity of the simulated rainfall in the study was greater than that of natural rainfall which resulted in the formation of comparatively heavier drops and high kinetic energy of raindrops with intercepting and reassembling of canopies mosley 1982 crockford and richardson 2000 we further used the lai mta difn mla and lsf values of each tree species to explain the impacts of canopy structure on the kinetic energy of rainfall as the redistribution of rainfall we associated these indices with the d50 and kinetic energy of raindrops by regression there were significantly positive correlations between most of these five indices and d50 and the kinetic energy of raindrops respectively d50 reflects the dominance of raindrops at different sizes during a raining event nanko et al 2015a 2015b small d50 indicates that the small raindrop is dominant during a rain event conversely the large raindrop is dominant lai is the ratio of the area of all leaves in a tree canopy to the projection area of the canopy feng et al 2016 theoretically the big lai tested under a tree canopy indicates that there are thick leaves in the canopy to intercept and reassemble raindrops and lead to bigger d50 and kinetic energy of rainfall under the canopy the positive correlation between d50 and keu and lai in the study supports this point mta represents the mean intersection angles between all leaves and horizontal ground feng et al 2016 the intersection angles between the leaves of most tree species and horizontal ground range from 0 to 45 wang et al 2014 when the angle increases the oblique leaves in a tree canopy will increase the falling raindrops are easily reassembled by the oblique leaves to produce bigger raindrops therefore the test results showed high correlations between mta and d50 and keu respectively difn reflects the sizes of gaps through a tree canopy liu and pattey 2010 evidently high difen will result in more raindrops falling directly through the gaps to the forest floor as a consequence the index was not significantly related to d50 and keu due to without the interception in the gaps of the canopy to rainfall mla directly showed the average sizes of leaves as mla increases the role of leaves in the reassembling of small raindrops into large ones also enhances therefore tested mla showed a positive correlation with keu and d50 respectively lsf represents the relationships between the mla and perimeter of leaves lsf is related to mla to some degree so the impact of lsf on the d50 and kinetic energy of rainfall is identical to that of mla these results indicate that lai mta difn mla and lsf can be used to explain d50 and keu under a tree canopy 5 conclusions trees of a deciduous type the presence of trichomes on leaves and papery leaves for a tree species are dominant characteristics that can result in the stronger ability of adsorbed water and can further increase rainfall interception trichomes on leaves have the greatest impact on adsorbed water e japonica thunb lindl is the strongest species for the ability to adsorb water and machilus pingii cheng ex yang is the weakest species among all evergreen tree species for deciduous plants millettia pachycarpa benth is the strongest species in adsorption of water and sapium sebiferum linn roxb is the weakest one the ability to adsorb water for 116 tree species presented a gradient which can serve as a justification for the selection of tree species which are most efficient at rainfall interception the rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow increased under the canopies of the four tree species with increasing rainfall intensity the percentages of the number volume and cumulative volume of large raindrops increased due to the interception and reassembling of canopies the kinetic energy of raindrops under the canopies was far higher than that outside the forest the rainfall interception was linearly correlated with lai mla and lsf but the kinetic energy of rainfall was correlated with lai mla and mta there was a high correlation between difn and throughfall and stemflow lai mta difn mla and lsf as indices of plant morphological characteristics can explain the redistribution and kinetic energy of rainfall credit

5002,forests play an important role in the water cycle and in the control of soil erosion the canopy as the first active surface of the forest directly affects soil erosion by redistributing rainfall however the effects of the plant morphological characteristics of different tree species on rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction have not been determined we determined 116 globally important woody tree species and classified them based on the differences of plant life forms leaf textures and trichomes on leaves in the guizhou karstic regions of china the water adsorbed on the branches and leaves of these species was measured to explain rainfall interception we further selected four representative species among the 116 species and measured rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall as well as the corresponding indices of plant morphological characteristics under simulated rainfall results indicated that the adsorbed water showed considerable differences between tree species with different plant morphological characteristics tree species with trichomes on their leaves had the largest amount of adsorbed water compared to those with papery or leathery leaves and those without trichomes rainfall interception was significantly dependent on leaf area index lai mean leaf area mla and leaf shape factor lsf but stemflow and throughfall were dependent on diffuse non interceptance difn under tree canopies tree canopies increased the numbers volumes and kinetic energy of large raindrops lai mean foliage tilt angle mta mla and lsf had differently significant impacts on drop size distribution dsd and the kinetic energy of rainfall under canopies but difn did not any impacts on them the results presented in this study quantitatively clarify the impacts of the

et al 2017 previous studies have indicated that different types of forests and tree species have significant impacts on soil erosion casermeiro et al 2004 the first impact begins with the regulation of rainfall by forest canopy morphology vis 1986 the regulation includes rainfall interception and kinetic energy nanko et al 2015a 2015b allen et al 2017 in karstic regions the strong exchange between surface water and groundwater easily results in the insidious loss of soil and water through the crevices of stony habitats and causes barren soil environment borghi et al 2016 the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction of karst forest canopy play a more important role in the water resource conservation and prevention from the loss of finite soil than non karstic regions boulding 1995 ries et al 2015 the forest canopy consists of plant species with different morphological characteristics and this increases the complexities in the regulations of rainfall interception and kinetic energy wang et al 2006 fan et al 2014 many scientists have explored these regulations to clarify their complexities allen et al 2017 corresponding results can be used to explain the underlying mechanisms of the redistribution of rainfall and can screen plant species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for application to the control of soil erosion dai et al 2015 borghi et al 2016 specific studies have primarily focused on three aspects i e the roles of rainfall characteristics canopy structures and weather factors in the regulation of rainfall inkiläinen et al 2013 nanko et al 2015a xiao and mcpherson 2016 many studies have indicated that rainfall interception by the forest canopy increases with an increase of rainfall under low rainfall intensities however with a prolonged period of rainfall the interception reaches saturation even if rainfall continues to increase bochet et al 1998 wang et al 2012 the differences of rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction under the canopies of forests or tree species are particularly large when rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity and duration change over time aston 1979 herwitz 1985 nanko et al 2015a second rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction are dependent on the variation of canopy structure klaassen et al 1998 aboal et al 1999 fleischbein et al 2005 different tree species have different morphological characteristics such as the spatial distribution and densities of branches and leaves the size of the branch and leaf biomass canopy cover and certain botanical characteristics which traditionally define canopy structure and then affect rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction asdak et al 1998 jackson 2000 levia and frost 2003 many studies have found that rainfall kinetic energy is closely related to raindrop size distribution and the terminal velocity of raindrops which are directly regulated by the canopy structure ziadat and taimeh 2013 nadal romero et al 2015 cerdà et al 2016 third rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction change significantly with different seasons wind and temperature chen and li 2016 the rate of rainfall interception during a dry season is far higher than during a wet season for a forest but the kinetic energy reduction of raindrops is the opposite coutinho and tomás 1995 in a forest there are many different plant species these species have evolved from different geological eras to develop many different botanical characteristics such as plant life form leaf textures trichomes on leaves mla lsf lai mta leaf mass area and difn the fraction of the sky that is not blocked by foliage in a tree canopy liu and pattey 2010 these characteristics define the differences of canopy structure among plant species the structure of canopies will reflect the structure of the dominant tree type e g an evergreen conifer forest compared with a deciduous forest however there have been few studies concerned with the effects of the botanical characteristics which are often measured by instruments or classified by plant ecology on rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction at a plant individual level wang and duan 2010 wang et al 2014 holder and gibbes 2017 levia et al 2017 a systematical study of the relationships between these characteristics and rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction at a level of the individual species can not only clarify the mechanisms underlying the redistribution of rainfall but also screen tree species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for application to ecological engineering controlling soil erosion liu and pattey 2010 levia et al 2017 here we measured the amount of water adsorbed on the branches and leaves of 116 important woody species and the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction of four representative species selected from the 116 tree species most of which are globally distributed under simulated rainfall at seven sites in the guizhou karst region of china we assumed that 1 the adsorbed water on branches and leaves was dependent on plant life form leaf texture trichomes on leaves mla blma and lsf i e six types of plant morphological characteristics and the rainfall interception of different tree species changed identically with their adsorbed water on branches and leaves based on the tests of four species under simulated rainfall 2 the rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction for four tree species could be explained by lai mta difn mla and lsf which could well describe the canopy structures of the tree species the aims of this study are to understand the botanical mechanisms underlying rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction and the optimal species with high rainfall interception and kinetic energy reduction we intend to answer the following questions 1 are there significant differences among tree species in the adsorption of water by branches and leaves 2 what are the dominant plant morphological characteristics and tree species affecting the adsorption of water by branches and leaves closely related to rainfall interception 3 how do plant morphological characteristics influence the redistribution and kinetic energy of rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites sampling sites for measuring the adsorption of water by branches and leaves are located in the central guizhou province of china fig 1 the region is the largest karst ecosystem in the world yuan 1997 evergreen broadleaf forest is a zonal vegetation in the region which reflects the characteristics of water and heat in the middle subtropical zone climate on the floristic composition appearance and structure of the forest community planning commission of guizhou 1987 the climate is characterized as a subtropical type annual average rainfall is 1189 75 mm and annual average temperature ranges from 13 6 c to 19 6 c prior to the experiment we selected 116 tree species with an important role in structuring the karst evergreen broadleaf forests in this region and seven forest sites for measuring the adsorption of water by branches and leaves these tree species have been recorded in previous studies and are accepted as important tree species with a mostly global distribution huang et al 1988 wang et al 2014 these species include 67 evergreen plants and 49 deciduous plants supplemental file 1 the four representative tree species photinia davidsoniae rehd et wils ligustrum lucidum ait cinnamomum camphora linn presl and cercis yunnanensis huet were selected from 116 tree species for an artificial rainfall experiment above the forest canopy fig 2 c yunnanensis huet is deciduous and the others are evergreen the experimental site for the artificial rainfall experiment is located in the forest of the south campus of guizhou university 106 40 00 e 26 25 38 n fig 1 the type of the forest is evergreen broadleaf and the soil under the forest is yellow soil we selected a representative individual of the four species with a complete canopy and its height and the project area of the canopy was not more than 3 5 m and 20 m2 because the rain height and area of the artificial rainfall simulator were 4 m and 25 m2 respectively 2 2 tests of the adsorption of water by branches and leaves the popular method for determining rainfall interception is spiral groove technology levia and frost 2003 reid and lewis 2009 however this method cannot be used on a large number of plants including small bush and herbs in a forest therefore we tested the adsorption of water by branches and leaves to explain rainfall interception the adsorption of water by branches and leaves is comprised of the water films and water drops adhering to the branches and leaves in a tree canopy when rainwater falls onto the tree canopy huang et al 1988 wang and duan 2010 the water on the branches and leaves can change to throughfall and stemflow but the relatively stable section on the branches and leaves is considered rainfall interception nanko et al 2015a 2015b we successively searched 2 4 sample trees of each species at the first site based on the average diameter at breast height of each species according to the data from a previous vegetation survey wang et al 2014 if the sample tree of a target species at the first site was not found we would continue to search at another site until all species were found all sample trees were required to have a complete canopy and to be growing well without artificial destruction pests or disease we sampled five standard branches five replicates with leaves from the different sections of the tree canopy for each of the sample trees the basal diameters of the sampled branches for all tree species were determined to be one centimeter because most of leaves in different tree species mainly grow on the branches the diameters of which are generally about one centimeter according to our investigation wang and duan 2010 the diameters of the second or third order of branches on each standard branch some plants had but other plants could not had not been unified in sampling which was considered as interspecific differences in botanical characteristics we tried to sample similarly sized and aged branches from different tree species based on visual detection and branching then each branch was fixed in the device for the test of the adsorbed water and weighed fig 3 the manner of stretching of the branch in the device was similar to that in a tree canopy tap water was used as rainfall to spray the surface of each branch for three minutes with a sprayer placed above the device the volume of spraying water was equal to 150 mm rainfall which was the maximum daily rainfall in the region we used the maximum rainfall during one day so that the surface of a sampled branch and the leaves on which were completely wetted during a short time then we could test the approximate value of the maximum rainfall interception of the branch and leaves the completely wet branch was weighed when no water dripped from the branch after one minute the ratios of the weight of adsorbed water on branch and the upper surface of leaves to the weight of the branch and leaves rwwu for each species were calculate using eq 1 1 rwwu or rwwul weight of sample after spraying water g weight of sample without spraying water g 100 weight of sample without spraying water g rwwu was one result obtained when we did not rotate the knob linking the branch at the right of the device fig 3 under the circumstance the sprays primarily touched the upper surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch after weighing we obtained the data of the weight of adsorbed water on the upper surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch the goal of the experiment was to test adsorbed water under the conditions of no wind blowing branches and leaves to flip them up and raindrops only falling on the upper surfaces of branches and leaves during a rain event subsequently we rotated the knob linking the branch at the right of the device and caused the branch to rotate 1080 i e three circles when we sprayed water to the branch for three minutes fig 3 the rotation caused both the upper and lower surfaces of a branch and the leaves on the branch to touch sprays therefore water was adsorbed on both the upper and lower surfaces of branch and leaves then when no water dripped from the branch and leaves for about one minute the fully wet branch and leaves were weighed the ratios of the weight of adsorbed water on branch and the upper and lower surface of leaves to the weight of the branch and leaves rwwul for each species were calculated using equation 1 the goal of the experiment was to test adsorbed water after wind had blown branches and leaves to flip them up in a tree canopy and raindrops had fallen to the upper and lower surfaces of branches and leaves during a rain event with wind rwwu and rwwul are the approximate value of the maximum rainfall interception of branches and leaves rather than real rainfall interception but the two indices can be used to compare the influences of the plant morphological characteristics of many different species on rainfall interception and screen plant species with high interception rainfall concretely we sampled 15 leaves from the tree canopy of 116 sample trees and used the laser leaf area meter ci 203 cid bio science inc usa to test mla and lsf lsf is the corrected ratio of leaf area and square of perimeter calculated by eq 2 which is equal to one for a circular leaf liu and pattey 2010 wang et al 2019 2 f 4 π a p 2 where f is leaf shape factor a is leaf area m2 and p is perimeter m then we counted the number of leaves on the standard branches of 116 tree species which were used to test rwwu and rwwul and calculated the total leaf area of each standard branch by multiplying mla and the number of leaves blma g cm 2 an index similar to leaf mass area was equal to the ratios of the weight of a standard branch with leaves to the total leaf area of the standard meanwhile leaf texture was identified it was recorded whether there were trichomes on the leaves the type of plant life form including evergreen and deciduous plants was also determined for each species supplemental file 1 then all tree species were grouped into two groups based on leaf texture whether there were trichomes and plant life form respectively the differences of the adsorption of water by branches and leaves between groups were compared the relationships between the adsorption of water and plant morphological traits were analyzed 2 3 artificial simulation of rainfall a portable artificial rainfall simulator sc 101 developed by institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences was used in this experiment zhang et al 2012 zhou 2013 supplemental file 2 the simulator had 12 sprinkler heads four groups produced by spaying systems co usa they crossed to spray water to a 25 m2 range and rain was evenly distributed within the range based on product manual we also checked rain intensity at different points within the 25 m2 range by a digital rain gauge linked to the rain simulator placed at a similar height bracket to four tree canopies before the rainfall experiments rain intensity was similar the coefficient of rainfall uniformity on the surface is more than 88 among different points and directly displayed on the control panel the data of rain intensity was automatically recorded and could be downloaded rain intensity for a rain event was set beforehand by a manual way according to the pressure values corresponding to different rain intensity on a pressure gauge installed in the main pipe of the simulator however we accepted the rain intensity measured by the intelligent rain gauge during each rain event based on the instructions in product manual the specific operation of each artificial rain included the following steps 1 the intelligent rain gauge linked to the simulator was placed on a bracket beside a tree canopy within the range of 25 m2 so that the splash raindrop from the tree canopy could not come into the gauge and then the power was turned on to display the menu on the control panel 2 the manual operation of rainfall was selected the unit of rain intensity was set to mm and the interval of rainfall intensity sampling was set to 20 s 3 start was pressed to begin the rain and the pressure gauge was adjusted to the value corresponding to the rainfall intensity that the experiment required 4 rain intensity was automatically measured and the recorded data was downloaded through the control panel of the simulator after a rain event had ended for the whole experiment a total of 20 artificial rainfall events were conducted with five rainfall events for each tree species the rainfall duration of each event was 10 min the observed intensity of rainfall ranged from 8 8 mm h to 69 8 mm h 2 3 1 tests of the parameters of the canopy structure we used a laser leaf area meter ci 203 to determine mla and lsf for the four representative tree species lai mta and difn were measured using a plant canopy analyzer lai 2000 li cor lincoln usa the spatial distribution of leaves on branches in a tree canopy can be comprehensively reflected by mta which is an important indicator of canopy structure mta strongly affects the effective photosynthetic area of leaves feng et al 2016 2 3 2 tests of stemflow throughfall interception and rainfall intensity we used a collection tank method to determine the volume of throughfall tp under the canopy four containers with sharp edged rims were placed under a tree canopy to collect throughfall the spaces among four containers were averagely assigned each container was 50 cm length 31 cm width and 30 cm height and its area was 1550 cm2 we measured and converted the volume of throughfall in the four containers into the total volume of throughfall tp with the projection area of the tree canopy after each rainfall stemflow sp was tested using the spiral groove method reid and lewis 2009 a rectangular plastic tank 50 cm 31 cm 30 cm was used to collect stemflow sp specifically a rubber tube with a diameter of 2 cm was longitudinally cut and spirally wound around the trunk for two and a half weeks before the simulation of rainfall one edge of the cut tube was fixed with pushpins and the seam between the edge of the cut tube and the surface of the trunk was sealed with melted silica gel or paraffin wax stemflow flowed into the plastic tank when the rainfall simulation was conducted stemflow in the tank was tested using a graduated cylinder after each rain event the interception ip of rainfall was calculated using eq 3 in which we ignored the section of evaporation during rain 3 i p r tp sp where ip is interception l r is rainfall l tp is throughfall l and sp is stemflow l r is calculated by the following equation r r i t 3600 l a in the equation r i is rainfall intensity mm h t is rainfall duration s l a is the projection area of a tree canopy m2 2 3 3 raindrop diameter we used the splash procedure to determine the raindrop diameter in the artificial simulation of rainfall wiesner 1895 hu et al 2016 specifically the different specifications of syringes needles and droppers were prepared to make different diameters of water droplets similar to raindrops supplemental file 3 we used each syringe to absorb enough water and then weighed the syringe the syringe was then reweighed after 100 water drops were allowed to drip at heights of 2 m and 10 cm onto filter papers coated with eosin powder eosin talc 1 10 the average weight of each droplet g for the different types of water droplets was calculated the volume v and diameter d of each droplet are given by eqs 4 and 5 hu et al 2016 li et al 2019 4 v g r 5 d 3 v 4 π 3 2 where v d and g are the volume cm3 diameter cm and weight of a single droplet g respectively and r is the density of water 1 g cm3 the dried filter papers were scanned into a computer and the mean area a cm2 and diameter d of the color spots mm caused by each droplet was calculated using image analysis software the models of the correlations between d and d were established using a regression of power function supplemental file 3 we selected eq 6 to apply to the following study considering that the height at which the raindrops fell from the canopies was relatively close to 2 m 6 d 0 2859 d 0 7938 r 2 0 9971 where d and d are the diameters of the color spots mm and raindrops mm 2 3 4 kinetic energy of raindrops we used two raindrop samplers to alternately collect raindrops at four sampling points under a tree canopy during each rain event five filter papers diameter 15 cm were used at each point each filter paper in a raindrop sampler was exposed for five seconds then the diameters d of splash spots on the dried filter papers were measured by scanning and image analysis the d of each raindrop was calculated using eq 6 based on the d values of all raindrops measured during five rain events with different intensity for a tree species we grouped the numbers of raindrops with different diameters the accumulative volume and percentage of the raindrops at these different diameters were analyzed levia et al 2017 as the percentage of the accumulative volume of raindrops reached 50 of the total volume the corresponding diameter of raindrops d50 was determined d50 was used to indicate the raindrop distribution furthermore the v and g values of each raindrop during each rain event were obtained using eqs 4 and 5 respectively the kinetic energy of each raindrop was calculated by eq 7 nanko et al 2004 hu et al 2016 7 e i 1 2 m i v i where ei mi and vi are the kinetic energy j mass kg and terminal velocity m s 1 of the individual raindrop with diameter di under simulated rainfall the vi is given with eq 8 8 v i v m 1 e x p 2 g v m 2 h where v m is the terminal velocity of the individual raindrop under natural rainfall m s 1 based on eqs 9 and 10 h is the raindrop falling height from crown bottom m and g is the acceleration of gravity 9 8 m s 2 hu et al 2016 li et al 2019 when 0 05 mm d 1 9 mm 9 v m 0 496

3 1 differences in the adsorption of water for different tree species descriptive statistics based on spss indicated that the average wwu wwul rwwu and rwwul of all 116 tree species were 3 28 g 5 51 g 15 42 and 24 76 respectively table 1 for the specific values of each tree species refer to supplemental file 1 there was a large interspecific variation in the adsorbed water of branches and leaves based on the maximum minimum and standard variation of the four indices all indices including adsorbed water and morphological traits followed the approximately normal distributions according to p p figures supplemental file 4 the wwul and rwwul of all the tree species were unanimously larger than their wwu and rwwu the lower surface of branches and leaves obviously increased the adsorption of water comparatively plant life form leaf texture and trichomes significantly affected on the adsorption of water on branches and leaves specifically the rwwu and rwwul of evergreen trees were 14 45 and 22 45 respectively which were smaller than those of deciduous trees 16 86 and 28 16 table 2 the rwwu and rwwul of tree species with leathery leaves were 14 05 and 21 73 respectively which were smaller than those of tree species with papery leaves 17 24 and 28 77 table 3 the rwwu and rwwul of the tree species with trichomes were 19 80 and 36 61 respectively obviously higher than for tree species without trichomes 13 68 and 20 06 table 4 by comparison the tree species with trichomes had the largest rwwul 36 61 tree species with papery leaves 28 77 deciduous tree species 28 16 evergreen tree species 22 45 and tree species with leathery leaves 21 73 had moderate rwwul values the tree species without trichomes 20 06 had the smallest rwwul the rwwu for these types of tree species showed the following order the tree species with trichomes 19 80 the tree species with papery leaves 17 24 deciduous tree species 16 86 evergreen tree species 14 45 the tree species with leathery leaves 14 05 tree species without trichomes 13 68 in addition to the rwwul and rwwu there were also significant differences between these types of tree species in most of the botanical morphological indices including the weight of branches and leaves mla total leaf area lsf and blma 3 2 dominant morphological traits and tree species affecting the adsorption of water 3 2 1 relationships between plant morphological traits and the adsorption of water it was found that there were different degrees of the relationships between the indices of plant morphological traits including the weight of branches and leaves mla total leaf area lsf and blma and wwu and wwul respectively table 5 the weight of branches and leaves total leaf area and mla were significantly related to wwu and wwul respectively blma was also significantly related to wwul however there were not significantly relationships between blma and wwu and between lsf and both wwu and wwul 3 2 2 dominant plant morphological traits affecting the adsorption of water further regression analysis with four significantly correlated indices of plant morphological traits on wwu and wwul in table 5 indicated that the weight of branches and leaves could explain about 36 and 43 variation of wwu and wwul respectively fig 4 a total leaf area could explain about 45 and 44 variation of wwu and wwul which was higher than the weight of branches and leaves fig 4b mla showed lower explanatory power for wwu and wwul than total leaf area and the weight of branches and leaves fig 4c blma showed the lowest explanation for wwu and wwul among the four indices fig 4d 3 2 3 dominant tree species in the adsorption of water the sequence of rwwu and rwwul for the 116 tree species showed a gradual change supplemental file 1 the five largest tree species in wwul were successively eriobotrya japonica thunb lindl brandisia hancei hook f millettia pachycarpa benth viburnum chinshanense graebn and millettia dielsiana harms e japonica thunb lindl has large and long leaves on which there are many trichomes although the tree species is evergreen and its leaves are leathery b hancei hook f is also evergreen but it has moderate sized papery leaves on which there are many trichomes m pachycarpa benth v chinshanense graebn and m dielsiana harms are all deciduous plants and there are trichomes on their moderate sized papery leaves for the wwu the five largest tree species were respectively paulownia tomentosa thunb steud millettia dielsiana harms brandisia hancei hook f viburnum dilatatum thunb and mallotus repandus willd muell arg p tomentosa thunb steud m repandus willd muell arg and v dilatatum thunb are deciduous plants and the former two species have large papery leaves with trichomes however there are relatively less trichomes on the leaves of m repandus willd muell arg than on p tomentosa thunb steud and v dilatatum thunb the other two species are in the lists of the five largest tree species for rwwul 3 3 redistribution of the artificially simulated rainfall 3 3 1 rainfall intensity and stemflow throughfall and interception the interception of four species increased with rainfall intensity and the interception ability was different among the four species fig 5 under the same rainfall intensity of 60 mm h c yunnanensis huet and l lucidum ait had the largest and smallest interception the four species also had different throughfall under the same rainfall intensity the throughfall of each species continually increased with increasing rainfall intensity and the throughfall of p davidsoniae rehd et wils and c yunnanensis huet was obviously higher than that of the other two species the stemflow of p davidsoniae rehd et wils was highest among the four species followed by c yunnanensis huet and l lucidum ait the least stemflow occurred in the main stem of c camphora linn presl regression analysis indicated that the relationships between rainfall intensity and interception could be fitted by logarithmic function but the relationships between intensity and throughfall and stemflow were better fitted by linear models table 6 3 3 2 plant morphological characteristics and stemflow throughfall and interception interspecific differences in lai mta mla lsf rwwu and rwwul for the four tree species were significant table 7 however differences in the index difn and lsf were not significant the large broadleaf plant p davidsoni had the largest lai and correspondingly the small broadleaf one l lucidum ait had the smallest lai the mta of c yunnanens was largest among the four tree species and that of p davidsoni was unexpectedly tested as zero because its leaves were almost flat for the index mla c yunnanens had the largest value and p davidsoni had the smallest value the mla of c yunnanens was many times greater than that of the other three species the difn and lsf of the four tree species were all smaller than 1 interspecific differences in interception stemflow and throughfall for the four tree species were also significant table 7 the rwwu and rwwul of c yunnanens and c camphora were about two times more than that of p davidsoni and l lucidum ait correspondingly c yunnanens and l lucidum ait had the highest and lowest interception respectively among these four tree species l lucidum ait had the highest throughfall and p davidsoni had the highest stemflow regression analysis indicated that the relationships between interception and lai mla and lsf respectively were statistically significant indicating the interception was dependent on the three indices conversely throughfall and stemflow were highly related to difn table 8 3 4 kinetic energy analysis of simulated rainfall 3 4 1 percentages of the numbers of raindrops with different diameters we defined the different diameters of raindrops by a 0 1 mm increment and calculated the percentages of the numbers of raindrops with different diameters the percentages of the numbers of raindrops consistently showed a single peak curve with an increase in the diameter of the raindrops fig 6 a1 d1 the highest peak of the curve appeared between the raindrop diameters of 0 5 and 1 5 mm for the four tree species the percentages of the numbers of raindrops increased rapidly to the highest peak between the intervals of a small diameter at the beginning stage then gradually became small over a raindrop diameter of 1 5 mm and approached zero at a diameter of 7 mm therefore these curves of the percentages exhibited a long tail the percentages of the numbers of raindrops under the canopies also fluctuated greatly with increasing rainfall intensity with a change of rainfall intensity the highest peaks for the curves showed some differences in height for each tree species fig 6a1 d1 by comparison the raindrops of the simulated rainfall outside the canopies were only distributed between a small range of diameters fig 6a2 d2 the percentage of the numbers of raindrops outside the canopies fluctuated relatively less than that under the canopies indicating that tree canopy played a significant role in the regulation of the raindrop sizes 3 4 2 percentages of the volumes of raindrops with different diameters four tree species had an obvious peak in the percentages of the volumes of raindrops between the diameters of 4 mm and 7 mm fig 7 however the peak for c yunnanensis huet occurred a little bit later than p davidsoniae rehd et wils l lucidum ait and c camphora linn presl the percentages of the volumes of raindrops with the raindrop diameter showed a gradual increasing trend based on trend lines for the four tree species comparatively the peak of raindrops outside the canopy mainly occurred between the diameters of 0 mm and 2 mm we can also see from fig 7 that l lucidum ait and p davidsoniae rehd et wils showed a relatively small percentage of the volume of raindrops between the diameters of 0 5 mm and 1 5 mm indicating that the two species had a bit higher interception to the rainfall of the diameter than c camphora linn presl and c yunnanensis huet compared with outside of canopies the interception of the four tree species between the diameters of 0 5 mm and 1 5 mm brought in a large amount of throughfall between the diameter between 4 mm and 6 mm 3 4 3 percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops with different diameters the percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops for four tree species all presented smooth s form curves but that of raindrops outside the canopies was a logarithmic curve fig 8 the percentages of the cumulative volumes of raindrops outside the canopy rapidly increased to 100 from 0 45 to 1 99 mm of the diameters of the raindrops conversely the percentage of the cumulative volumes of raindrops under the canopies slowly increased from 0 5 to 7 8 mm of the diameters of the raindrops indicating that the canopies changed dsd with interception and obviously increased the volume of the large raindrops of the four tree species c yunnanensis huet showed a lower percentage of the cumulative volumes of raindrops than the other three tree species with the same raindrop diameter 3 4 4 kinetic intensity the kinetic energy of the raindrops under the canopies of four tree species most more than 15 j m 2 mm 1 was far greater than that outside the canopy only 7 98 j m 2 mm 1 table 9 the canopies of these four tree species significantly changed the kinetic energy of the raindrops c yunnanensis huet and p davidsoniae rehd et wils had relatively higher kinetic energies than l lucidum ait and c camphora linn presl 3 4 5 plant morphological characteristics and kinetic energy regression analysis indicated that mta mla and lsf could well explain d50 but for keu lai mta and mla showed a high explanatory power table 10 lai was an important parameter of plant morphology but the r2 of the regression model between lai and d50 was very small 0 205 indicating that lai was not a highly explanatory variable for d50 in the study conversely the r2 of the regression model between lai and keu was relatively large r2 0 732 the values of r2 for the regressions between difn and both d50 and keu were also very small 0 105 0 031 the regression of lsf on d50 and keu showed different r2 0 777 and 0 194 this indicated different impacts of lsf on d50 and keu 4 discussion 4 1 adsorption of water by branches and leaves the most important two factors in rainfall interception are the weather conditions and the morphological characteristics of the tree species xiao and mcpherson 2011 zabret 2013 most previous studies primarily compared the differences of tree species in the morphological characteristics and the corresponding effects on the redistribution of rainfall livesley et al 2014 sun et al 2015 these studies mainly focused on direct tests of interception stemflow and throughfall for different tree species and analyzed the qualitative effects of the morphological characteristics xiao and mcpherson 2011 fan et al 2014 li et al 2016 levia et al 2019 the adsorption of water by branches and leaves in trees is the primary mechanism of rainfall interception and affects its magnitude wang and duan 2010 prior studies that have noted the importance of particulate matter on foliage with different hair densities or types alter the surface tension of detained droplets levia et al 2017 in this instance the adsorption of water by branches and leaves was assumed to be dependent on these morphological characteristics the branches and leaves were not separately sampled to test adsorbed water and simulate the real state of branches and leaves in canopies we quantitatively identified the effects of plant life forms leaf texture and leaves with or without trichomes on the adsorption of water by branches and leaves based on large sample evergreen broadleaf and deciduous broadleaf plants plant life forms leaf textures and leaves with or without trichomes obviously affected the adsorbed water the adsorption ability of water for deciduous tree species having papery leaves and trichomes on leaves was strong while evergreen tree species having leathery leaves and no trichomes on leaves was weak the presence of trichomes on leaves had the largest effect on the adsorbed water deciduous trees had a larger mla than evergreen trees there was a significantly positive relationship between mla and adsorbed water meanwhile many deciduous trees evolutionarily form papery leaves consequently deciduous trees showed a higher adsorption ability of water than evergreen tree species for the papery leaves there are no or only thin hydrophobic horny layers on the leaves thus the tree species with papery leaves naturally had a high adsorption ability of water trichomes on leaves are a structure that can directly hold raindrops and can significantly increase the adsorption volume of water wang and duan 2010 in addition the adsorption volume of water was obviously dependent on the size of mla but not lsf large leaf areas mean more adsorption surfaces to increase the adsorption volume of water however lsf is an ecological index explaining the relationship between mla and perimeter lsf was not directly related to the adsorption volume of water the three types of plant morphological characteristics are different among the 116 tree species due to long term evolution and adaption of plant species to environments chitwood and topp 2015 levia et al 2015 this indicates that plant evolution and adaption have an obvious effect on the hydrological processes of plant organs however we found that the characteristics of branches did not show as great a difference as that of leaves among these tree species because we sampled branches that were similar in diameter and age wang and duan 2010 the surface areas of branches were also very small compared with that of the leaves this supports our mixed sampling of branches and leaves which could simulate the state of branches and leaves in a tree canopy comparatively there were trichomes on the back of leaves for many of the 116 tree species which mainly resulted in larger wwul than wwu values supplemental file 1 the sequence of the rwwu and rwwul for the 116 tree species indicated the ability of each tree species to adsorb water onto branches and leaves supplemental file 1 most of these tree species are globally distributed the twentieth largest tree species in rwwu and rwwul in the sequence are obviously dominant species in terms of the adsorbed water based on the relationship between adsorbed water and rainfall interception these dominant species can be used to some degree in applications of ecological engineering for soil and water conservation however the species with a good performance in adsorbed water may not be able to adapt to the stress of habitats in some regions attarod et al 2015 xiao and mcpherson 2016 zhou et al 2016 in application it is necessary to consider not only the adsorption capacity of water to increase rainfall interception but also plant growth and adaptation to the environment 4 2 redistribution of rainfall rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall were primarily influenced by three factors i the type of rainfall events magnitude intensity and duration ii tree species and canopy structure iii antecedent weather aston 1979 crockford and richardson 2000 nanko et al 2015a many studies indicated that throughfall and stemflow gradually increased but rainfall interception tended to remain at a high level with an increase of rainfall intensity parsons and stone 2006 in this study we verified similar changes of rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow with increasing rainfall intensity for different tree species however rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow were significantly different at the same levels of rainfall intensity among the tree species the differences were caused by canopy structure described by plant morphological characteristics livesley et al 2014 nanko et al 2015a the different tree species developed unique plant morphological characteristics and corresponding canopy structures in a long term evolutionary history to adapt to various environments asdak et al 1998 chappell et al 2001 dietz et al 2006 in previous studies scientists have tended to quantify canopy structures by crown width tree height numbers of branches leaf biomass diameter at the breast height and individual density and to establish the relationships between these parameters and rainfall interception stemflow and throughfall crockford and richardson 2000 chappell et al 2001 in this study lai mta difn mla and lsf were tested to quantify canopy structure for four tree species lai mta difn mla and lsf are comprehensive plant morphological indices to describe canopy structure liu and pattey 2010 lai and mla represent the density of leaves in the canopy high lai and mla values denote a large area of rainfall interception mta is the intersection angle between the surfaces of leaves and flat ground obviously a small mta favors rainfall interception difn mainly represents the size of gaps in the canopy and a large value of difn will theoretically result in a large throughfall liu and pattey 2010 based on the results of the analysis rainfall interception was significantly dependent on lai mla and lsf and lai showed the highest correlation with rainfall interception suggesting that the three easily tested indicators can be used to indirectly explain rainfall interception however difn was significantly related to throughfall and stemflow we consider that when a high difn is tested for a tree a large amount of rainfall will fall through the relatively many gaps in the canopy to the stems of trees and the forest floor resulting in high throughfall and stemflow therefore difn can also be used to explain throughfall and stemflow these results verified our previous assumptions by comparison of the results of four representative tree species we found that if a tree species had a large rwwu or rwwul the tree species correspondingly showed a large rainfall interception specifically l lucidum ait was found to have the lowest rainfall interception and its rwwu or rwwul were also very small among the four tree species l lucidum ait has the smallest leathery leaves without any trichomes on the leaves than the other three tree species it is also an evergreen tree species these characteristics are most unfavorable to adsorb water the rainfall interception of c yunnanensis huet was the largest among the four tree species and correspondingly the rwwu or rwwul of the tree species were very large c yunnanens has thick and large papery leaves and on the central and lower sections of the leaves there are trichomes the tree species is also a deciduous tree species these characteristics are very favorable for water adsorption onto the leaves evergreen p davidsoniae rehd has relatively larger leathery leaves without trichomes therefore it exhibited moderate rainfall interception with low rwwu and rwwul evergreen c camphora linn presl has thin and relatively small leathery leavers without trichomes which is disadvantageous to water adsorption to the leaves however c camphora linn presl was found to have a smaller rainfall interception and large rwwu or rwwul for the species the gaps in its canopy were large which decreased rainfall interception specifically in the test of adsorbed water the experiment did not show the influence of the gaps on adsorption of water by branches and leaves the branches with leaves were not precisely identical in their size and large branches might have caused a large increase of adsorbed water with more branches and leaves however the study has basically verified the suggested assumption i e the rainfall interception of tree species identically changed with their adsorption of water by branches and leaves aston 1979 holwerda et al 2010 4 3 kinetic energy of rainfall the different diameters of raindrops directly lead to a change in terminal velocities and kinetic energy of the raindrops beard 1976 atlas and ulbrich 1977 zabret et al 2017 it was essential to measure dsd for an evaluation of the kinetic energy of rainfall under a tree canopy levia et al 2019 in previous studies beginning from 1892 scientists have developed a series of methods such as a splash staining method a flour pellet method dsd instrument measurement a glass plate method an automated momentum method a photographic method and an optical disdrometer to measure dsd levia et al 2017 recently nanko et al 2004 adopted multiple laser disdrometers for the first time to measure dsd in the sub canopy study we used the traditional splash procedure to test the diameters of raindrops and established the relationships between the diameters of raindrops and the size of color spots testik and barros 2007 angulo martínez et al 2012 angulo martínez and barros 2015 furthermore dsd and velocities of raindrops have been quantified to estimate the kinetic energy of rainfall under the canopies of four tree species when the gradual rainfall intensity was manipulated levia et al 2019 the number of large raindrops obviously increased due to the impacts of canopy structure on dsd however small raindrops were still dominant in number similar to the rainfall outside the canopies however the volume and cumulative volume of large raindrops formed by interception and reassembling of canopies obviously increased under the canopies of the four tree species in the simulated rainfall consequently the canopies linearly enlarged the kinetic energy of the raindrops but which was smaller than the results observed under the canopies of china fir forest with natural rainfall wang 2001 the amplitude of increases in the kinetic energy of raindrops under canopies with simulated rainfall in the present study is similar to that observed with natural rainfall in warm tropical forest and china fir forest vis 1986 li et al 2019 compared with four tree species the warm tropical forest has lush branches and leaves vis 1986 the branches and leaves of china fir has about 45 angle of extending forward the surface of ground li et al 2019 the botanical morphological traits in the two studies are obviously advantageous to intercepting and reassembling of raindrops and increase the kinetic energy of raindrops the intensity of the simulated rainfall in the study was greater than that of natural rainfall which resulted in the formation of comparatively heavier drops and high kinetic energy of raindrops with intercepting and reassembling of canopies mosley 1982 crockford and richardson 2000 we further used the lai mta difn mla and lsf values of each tree species to explain the impacts of canopy structure on the kinetic energy of rainfall as the redistribution of rainfall we associated these indices with the d50 and kinetic energy of raindrops by regression there were significantly positive correlations between most of these five indices and d50 and the kinetic energy of raindrops respectively d50 reflects the dominance of raindrops at different sizes during a raining event nanko et al 2015a 2015b small d50 indicates that the small raindrop is dominant during a rain event conversely the large raindrop is dominant lai is the ratio of the area of all leaves in a tree canopy to the projection area of the canopy feng et al 2016 theoretically the big lai tested under a tree canopy indicates that there are thick leaves in the canopy to intercept and reassemble raindrops and lead to bigger d50 and kinetic energy of rainfall under the canopy the positive correlation between d50 and keu and lai in the study supports this point mta represents the mean intersection angles between all leaves and horizontal ground feng et al 2016 the intersection angles between the leaves of most tree species and horizontal ground range from 0 to 45 wang et al 2014 when the angle increases the oblique leaves in a tree canopy will increase the falling raindrops are easily reassembled by the oblique leaves to produce bigger raindrops therefore the test results showed high correlations between mta and d50 and keu respectively difn reflects the sizes of gaps through a tree canopy liu and pattey 2010 evidently high difen will result in more raindrops falling directly through the gaps to the forest floor as a consequence the index was not significantly related to d50 and keu due to without the interception in the gaps of the canopy to rainfall mla directly showed the average sizes of leaves as mla increases the role of leaves in the reassembling of small raindrops into large ones also enhances therefore tested mla showed a positive correlation with keu and d50 respectively lsf represents the relationships between the mla and perimeter of leaves lsf is related to mla to some degree so the impact of lsf on the d50 and kinetic energy of rainfall is identical to that of mla these results indicate that lai mta difn mla and lsf can be used to explain d50 and keu under a tree canopy 5 conclusions trees of a deciduous type the presence of trichomes on leaves and papery leaves for a tree species are dominant characteristics that can result in the stronger ability of adsorbed water and can further increase rainfall interception trichomes on leaves have the greatest impact on adsorbed water e japonica thunb lindl is the strongest species for the ability to adsorb water and machilus pingii cheng ex yang is the weakest species among all evergreen tree species for deciduous plants millettia pachycarpa benth is the strongest species in adsorption of water and sapium sebiferum linn roxb is the weakest one the ability to adsorb water for 116 tree species presented a gradient which can serve as a justification for the selection of tree species which are most efficient at rainfall interception the rainfall interception throughfall and stemflow increased under the canopies of the four tree species with increasing rainfall intensity the percentages of the number volume and cumulative volume of large raindrops increased due to the interception and reassembling of canopies the kinetic energy of raindrops under the canopies was far higher than that outside the forest the rainfall interception was linearly correlated with lai mla and lsf but the kinetic energy of rainfall was correlated with lai mla and mta there was a high correlation between difn and throughfall and stemflow lai mta difn mla and lsf as indices of plant morphological characteristics can explain the redistribution and kinetic energy of rainfall credit

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief the apparent potential evaporation e pa represents the atmospheric evaporation demand which is essential in estimating the actual evaporation in practice e pa is usually formulated by different functions based on penman method or by pan measurements however it remains unclear which formulation is preferred for different ecosystems in this study we adopted two formulations of e pa by the penman methods e pmo based on the monin obukhov similarity theory and e pu2 based on the rome wind function and another two formulations by the pan evaporation measurements e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan at multi eddy covariance ec stations including different ecosystem types the four formulations were compared in estimating actual evaporation e with the aid of a generalized complementary function our results show that 1 for short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is a competitive candidate because this in situ measurement can accurately reflect the dynamics of the underlying surface through observation and it is widely accessible and easy to deploy 2 for high vegetations like forests e pmo is the best candidate because this theoretical formulation incorporates both evaporation demands from the high canopy and ground surface which cannot be reasonably captured by the other three candidates 3 when the canopy information e g displacement height and roughness lengths is not available e pu2 can be regarded as a useful alternative formulation of e pa with moderate accuracy in evaporation estimation keywords evaporation d20 pan e601b pan monin obukhov similarity theory rome wind function sigmoid generalized complementary function 1 introduction the concept of apparent potential evaporation e pa was first proposed by brutsaert 1982 which is used to represent the atmospheric evaporation demand it is named apparent to distinguish with the potential evaporation e po which takes place from an extensive surface with the abundant supply of water in contrast e pa is the evaporation takes place from a small saturated surface inside the extensive surface brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2020 the word small refers that the surface is small enough to eliminate its effect on the surrounding environment and surrounding evaporation in this manner e pa is corresponding to the same non potential atmospheric conditions of actual evaporation e brutsaert 2015 e pa is an essential variable in estimating the actual evaporation which is one of the largest components of terrestrial water cycle and returns about two thirds of global precipitation over the land chahine 1992 oki and kanae 2006 in fact the actual evaporation is calculated as e pa multiplying a reduction coefficient this coefficient can be defined as a function of either soil moisture content in penman function penman 1950 shuttleworth 1993 or surface resistance in penman monteith function monteith 1965 or atmospheric wetness in complementary function han et al 2012 the reasonable formulation of e pa is therefore the prerequisite of accurate actual evaporation estimation since actual evaporation is important for hydrological research because of its direct impact on the hydrologic processes water cycle drought occurrence and water resources management it is essential to find the best formulation of e pa for different scenarios before using e pa to estimate actual e brutsaert 1982 suggested that e pa can be formulated by the penman method or by a calibrated evaporimeter specifically the evaporation pan brutsaert and parlange 1998 different functions have been developed based on the penman method for example the rome wind function is an original simplified method to formulate apparent potential evaporation thereafter termed as e pu2 penman 1948 it is designed for the water surface thus is suitable for the smooth underlying surface e pu2 has been frequently used e g brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert 1982 szilagyi 2007 ma et al 2019 for its independence of surface information such as displacement height and roughness lengths however morton 1983 suggested that the wind speed is not a good indicator of e pa because of its high variation the combination of penman 1948 and the monin obukhov similarity theory monin obukhov 1954 provides the most sophisticated manner to formulate e pa thereafter termed as e pmo parlange and katul 1992 crago and crowley 2005 this method introduces the boundary layer theory and reflects the effect of roughness lengths which is fully consistent with the definition of e pa to address the inherent uncertainties of roughness lengths associated with empirical parameters in e pmo brutsaert et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 modified the calculation from different perspectives but at the cost of higher data requirement pan evaporation measurements serve as another method to formulate e pa evaporation pan is one of the simplest and cheapest ways to observe local atmospheric evaporation demand stanhill 2002 compared with the analytical functions based on penman methods e pu2 and e pmo pan evaporation measurement requires no additional data and parameters but it suffers from various biases induced by heat transfer from pan walls and others in previous studies the observation of class a pan was frequently used to formulate e pa kahler and brutsaert 2006 szilagyi 2007 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 zhang et al 2017 brutsaert and parlange 1998 however different types of pans are used in different countries and pan evaporation measurements are significantly affected by size structure materials and installation method of pans fu et al 2004 rotstayn et al 2006 the class a pan is common in north american and australia the bmo tank is used in the u k and the ggi3000 pan is adopted in russia mcvicar et al 2012 in china d20 pan was continuously used from the 1950s to 2000s but it has been gradually replaced by e601b pan around 2002 wang et al 2019 in practice it was found that e601b pan suffers frozen problems in the winter thus d20 pan is kept or re deployed in some regions d20 pan is made of galvanized copper with the radial rim to prevent birds drinking the water fig 1 a the diameter and depth of d20 pan are 20 cm and 10 cm respectively it is equipped on a platform 70 cm above the ground the evaporation rate is calculated according to the weight change of water at two adjacent hours via electronic scales e601b pan is made of fiberglass and sunk into the ground fig 1b the diameter and depth of the e601b pan are 60 cm the bottom is tapered and the depth of the cone is 7 cm it is surrounded by a 20 cm wide flume filled by water to eliminate the edge effect the evaporation rate is calculated according to the difference of water surface height at two adjacent hours via a micrometer there were more than 700 stations with pans around china and the observations are continuous since the 1950s wang et al 2019 these data will be more valuable if they can be properly used in actual evaporation estimation a few studies have compared different apparent evaporation formulations under different situations penman evaporation is traditionally considered to be close to pan evaporation when multiplied by a coefficient eagleman 1967 kohler et al 1959 for example koerselman and beltman 1988 showed that pan evaporation is lower than penman evaporation e pu2 at a fens site with a ratio of about 0 4 however donohue et al 2010 found that the pan evaporation is 46 25 mm month 1 higher than e pu2 according to the results at 102 sites across australia these contradicted studies may be invoked by different empirical parameters in the rome wind function furthermore ma et al 2015a showed that e pmo is lower than e pu2 when the wind speed is low but higher than e pu2 when the wind speed increases in an alpine steppe in spite of these progresses the difference among apparent evaporation formulations remains less understood for different ecosystems and a comprehensive comparison study is necessary for the application of apparent potential evaporation in estimating actual evaporation in this study we systematically compared the four e pa formulations e pmo e pu2 e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan at four eddy covariance ec sites including two grassland sites one cropland site and one forest site these are the only ec sites with sufficient long observations of both d20 and e601b pan evaporation on the database of chinaflux we can find so far another three forest ec sites with short term measurements were further chosen to validate our conclusions for high canopy vegetation the four formulations were evaluated in estimating actual evaporation with the aid of a complementary function the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the four e pa formulations the method we used to estimate actual e and the data sources and processing section 3 mainly shows the comparison among the four formulations as well as their performance in evaporation estimation section 4 explains the different performance of the four formulations and their applicability in different situations the main findings are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 the apparent potential evaporation in this study two penman equations e pmo and e pu2 and two pan evaporations e d20 and e e601 were compared in formulating the apparent potential evaporation e pa according to the penman s equation penman 1948 and the monin obukhov similarity theory monin obukhov 1954 e pmo can be expressed as 1 e pa e pmo δ r n g δ γ ρ c p δ γ κ 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where δ kpac 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor curve at air temperature r n is the net radiation g is the ground heat flux γ kpac 1 is a psychrometric constant ρ is the air density c p is the specific heat κ 0 4 is the von karman constant u is the wind speed at measurement height e a and e a are the saturated and actual vapor pressures of air respectively z is the measurement height table 2 d 0 is the displacement height z 0m and z 0v are the roughness lengths for momentum and water vapor respectively which are estimated from the canopy height h c table 2 z 0 m 0 123 h c d 0 5 5 z 0 m and z 0 v 0 1 z 0 m monin and obukhov 1954 allen et al 1998 another empirical formulation of apparent potential evaporation e pu2 can be expressed as 2 e pa e p u 2 δ r n g δ γ γ δ γ f u 2 e a e a where f u2 2 6 1 0 54 u2 is the rome wind function and u2 is the wind speed at 2 m penman 1948 brutsaert 1982 for the two pan measurements e pa was directly formulated by the pan evaporations e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan which assumes the pan coefficient equals to unity for the two pan types following ma et al 2015a and zuo et al 2016 3 e pa e d 20 4 e pa e e 601 eqs 1 4 represent four different formulations of e pa and their results are compared in section 3 1 then each of the four formulations was used to estimate actual evaporation 2 2 the sigmoid generalized complementary function when e pa is used to estimate the actual evaporation the penman monteith function monteith 1965 and penman function penman 1950 shuttleworth 1993 need additional surface information as input for example the surface resistance or soil moisture content however the complementary principle does not request the complicated surface property information besides the formulation of e pa in the complementary principle needs to be determined more carefully since the data requirement is lower thus we chose the complementary principle as the method to estimate the actual evaporation in previous complementary studies different formulations of e pa have been used to estimate e the few comparison studies were summarized in table 1 generally those studies indicated that the complementary functions perform best in evaporation estimation when e pa was formulated by e pmo but worse when e pa e e601 the results of ma et al 2015a shed some light on the applicability of e d20 in formulating e pa if the evaporation of the chinese pans is competent at formulating e pa in the complementary principle it will be more convenient to estimate the actual evaporation because more than 700 pan observation stations are located across china as the development of the complementary theory the original symmetric linear function bouchet 1963 was extended to many other functions over time including asymmetric linear function brutsaert and stricker 1979 concave function katerji and perrier 1983 polynomial function brutsaert 2015 and the sigmoid function han et al 2012 han tian 2018 although the sigmoid complementary function exhibited high accuracy in evaporation estimation han and tian 2018 ma et al 2015b zhou et al 2020 the quantitative comparison among different formulations of e pa in e estimation with this function is absent table 1 thus in this study we adopted the sigmoid complementary function han tian 2018 the sigmoid generalized complementary function expresses e e pa as a sigmoid function of e rad e pa 5 y e e pa 1 1 m x max x x x min n where x e rad e pa xmax and xmin correspond to specific maximum or minimum values of x under extremely wet or arid conditions for convenience xmax and xmin were set as 1 and 0 respectively which has been approved reasonable wang et al 2020b e pa is formulated by eqs 1 4 e rad is the radiation term of the penman evaporation 6 e

and rouse 1977 han et al 2012 and the asymmetric parameter b was calibrated by an optimization algorithm with the objective function as minimization of the root mean square error rmse between the estimated e est by eq 5 and the observed e 2 3 data sources and data processing the eddy covariance ec data and pan evaporation data d20 and e601b were used to assess evaporation estimation by the four formulations of e pa at four sites include two grassland sites nmg and hbg one cropland site ycs and one forest site cha the data of three additional forest sites dhs qia and bns were used to further compare the results of e d20 and e pmo these sites were selected because the energy fluxes and the pan evaporation were measured simultaneously in the same research fields the detailed information about these sites can be found in table 2 the ec data were collected from the chinaflux http www chinaflux org yu et al 2006 and the pan evaporation data can be achieved from the chinese national ecosystem research network http rs cern ac cn the daily energy fluxes net radiation ground heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux meteorological variables air temperature air pressure relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit and pan evaporations were used in this study the main results except section 3 3 were presented as monthly results through accumulations of the daily data to avoid the uncertainty in daily pan measurements fu et al 2004 and get the best performance of the generalized complementary function wang et al 2020a the bowen ratio energy balance method twine et al 2000 was adopted in the energy closure correction in this method the residual term in energy balance was attributed into sensible heat and latent heat by preserving the bowen ratio after energy balance correction the available energy r n g sensible heat and latent heat were restricted to positive values han tian 2018 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and

e d20 and e e601 although all these formulations can represent the apparent potential evaporation in a sense their values differ from each other substantially the variations of the four formulations e pmo e pu2 e d20 and e e601 are shown in fig 2 following the time sequence at the nmg site grassland fig 2a the results show that the simulated e pmo is close to the observed e d20 and their values are significantly higher than e pu2 p values 0 01 the p values are from paired samples t tests between monthly e pmo or e d20 and e pu2 which mean that the differences between e pmo or e d20 and e pu2 are significant for example in the year 2007 and 2008 when the availability of the three formulations are maximum the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 141 35 w m 2 and 141 26 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 81 16 w m 2 in the nongrowing seasons november to march the difference between e pmo and e pu2 is minor compared with that in the growing seasons the difference peaked in may and june when e pmo and e pu2 achieve the maximum values e pmo or e d20 can reach more than 300 w m 2 about two times of e pu2 according to the results during the limited months in the growing season of the last two years we found e e601 is closer to e pu2 fig 2a at another grassland site hbg fig 2b located in northwest china the differences among the four formulations are smaller than those at the nmg site however it can also be recognized that e pmo and e d20 are clearly higher than e pu2 in 2007 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 91 59 w m 2 and 105 24 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 69 03 w m 2 the maximum values of these formulations occur in may or june which is similar to those at the nmg site at the hbg site the pan evaporations e d20 and e e601 are relatively higher than other formulations for example the highest e d20 can reach 197 7 w m 2 in may of 2008 about 10 w m 2 higher than e pmo in the growing seasons of 2007 2009 results show that e d20 is significantly higher than e pmo p value 0 01 e e601 is close to e pmo in the nongrowing season and even higher than e pmo in the growing season according to the limited observations at the cropland site ycs fig 2c the results of the four formulations are very similar to those at the nmg site in brief e pmo has the same magnitude as e d20 and e pu2 is close to e e601 the first two formulations are substantially higher than the latter two in 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 162 72 w m 2 and 139 56 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 87 80 w m 2 e pmo and e d20 show a high correlation with a pearson correlation efficient of 0 91 if we focus on the growing season of 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 180 88 w m 2and 181 4 w m 2 and those of e pu2 and e e601 are 116 59 w m 2 and 112 90 w m 2 respectively the maximum values of e pmo and e d20 about 310 w m 2 are double of those of e pu2 and e e601 about 160 w m 2 however the situation is different at the mixed forest sites cha fig 2d it can be confirmed that e pmo is significantly higher than the other formulations p value 0 05 the maximum value of e pmo can reach 641 1 w m 2 and the annual mean value is 323 1 w m 2 while for e d20 as the highest one of the other three formulations the maximum value is only 191 5 w m 2 and the mean value is 88 7 w m 2 the difference among e d20 e pu2 and e e601is minor compared with the gaps between them and e pmo to summarize we found the four formulations of e pa show clearly seasonal pattern and the maximum values occur in april to june generally e d20 are higher than e e601 at the three short vegetation sites nmg hbs and ycs e pmo is close to e d20 and they are substantially higher than e pu2 especially in the growing seasons at the mixed forest site e pmo is greatly higher than the other formulations this phenomenon is related to the consideration of canopy height in e pmo and it will be discussed latter in section 4 3 2 performance of different formulations on e pa in this section we presented the performance of the four formulations of e pa on evaporation estimation the sigmoid generalized complementary curves with e pa formulated by e d20 are shown in fig 3 first column generally the monthly results black dots are tight around the sigmoid curves red lines implied that e d20 is efficient in formulating e pa in the complementary function the blue lines the p t and penman boundary lines are the theoretical upper boundary of the evaporation when the surface moisture condition improves the sigmoid curve red lines will approach but does not exceed the blue lines which means the actual evaporation get close to its upper boundary the regression relationship between the estimated e est and the observed e of the four sites is shown in fig 4 first column these results are close to the 1 1 line slopes 0 86 1 22 with high r2 values 0 75 0 89 the results for e e601 fig 3 second column is the most scattered among the four formulations in fig 3 e d20 and e e601 and fig 5 e pmo and e pu2 figs 3 and 5 provided a general qualitative impression about which methods e d20 e e601 e pmo and e pu2 gave better results according to the visible distance between the dots observations and the lines simulations also the merits of different methods can be qualitatively evaluated by whether the results follow an approximate sigmoid shape or part of the sigmoid shape the regression relationship fig 4 second column shows the e est derivates from e at the site nmg e est 0 39 e 36 1 and cha e est 1 35 e 12 1 there are few observations of the e601b pans because of latter installation and discontinuous records it seems that the few observations partly affect the determination of accurate model parameters and result in improper fitted curves however in previous researches e g ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020a even though few observations can generate favorable fitted curves when e pa is formulated appropriately as for the penman methods fig 5 shows the sigmoid curves derived from the monthly results of e pmo and e pu2 and fig 6 shows the corresponding regression results between modeled e est and actual e generally the shapes of the curves based on e pmo are similar to those based on e d20 except at the forest site the results are consistent with fig 2 which shows that e pmo is close to e d20 at the grassland sites and the cropland site but deviates from e d20 at the forest site e pmo is relative higher at the nmg site and the cha site resulting in the points of e rad e pmo e e pmo concentrated in the lower and middle part of the sigmoid lines the regression slopes between e est and e range from 0 97 to 1 1 with high r2 0 72 0 91 which indicate that e pmo performs well in formulating e pa fig 6 first column except at the cropland site intercept 6 93 w m 2 when e pa is formulated by e pu2 the results become more scattered fig 5 second column compared with e pmo fig 5 first column generally the scattered results move to the upper right in each panel fig 5 when e pmo is replaced by e pu2 because the denominators of x and y decrease according to the regression analysis fig 6 second column the estimation accuracy is slightly lower but still acceptable r2 0 82 the higher regression slopes 1 04 1 23 and lower intercepts 1 22 6 78 w m 2 indicate higher biases than those based on e pmo at most sites however the cropland site ycs is an exception in which the e pu2 method shows better results at the cropland site the regression slope is closer to 1 1 04 vs 1 1 and the intercept is smaller 1 71 w m 2 vs 6 93 w m 2 indicating the results based on e pu2 have lower biases than those based on e pmo fig 6e vs fig 6f although the sigmoid plots fig 5e vs fig 5f show that the results based on e pmo are closer to the fitted curve the biases are amplified by the magnitude of e pmo which is about two times of e pu2 164 32 w m 2 vs 81 85 w m 2 the evaluation merits rmse mae and nse were summarized in table 3 the results shows that e e601 perform worse than e d20 and those based on the penman methods e pmo and e pu2 the mean nses based on e e601 and e d20 are 0 60 and 0 78 respectively the mean value of rmses and maes of e e601 are 16 66 w m 2 and 13 42 w m 2 respectively about 2 w m 2 higher than those of e d20 generally we found measurements of e601b pans are not appropriate in formulating e pa at the monthly scale in table 3 there are several cases with infinite b values which represent the sigmoid curves approach but do not exceed the p t boundary line e g fig 3e this situation occurs when the land surface moisture condition is ample for example the wetland and irrigated cropland when b is infinity m and n in eq 5 are equal to 0 60 and 1 21 respectively according to eq 7 b 1 0 for the penman methods results show that the mean rmse and mae of the e pmo method 13 15 w m 2 and 10 28 w m 2 are lower than that of the e pu2 method 15 55 w m 2 and 12 12 w m 2 and the mean nse of the e pmo method 0 81 is higher than that of the e pu2 method 0 74 except for the cropland site ycs at the cropland site rmse and mae of the e pmo method are about 2 w m 2 higher than that of the e pu2 method and nse is lower 0 53 vs 0 62 these results suggest that the e pmo method performs better than the e pu2 method except for the cropland site according to table 3 at the grassland sites e d20 mean nse 0 78 and e pmo 0 77 perform better than e pu2 0 70 and e e601 0 64 in estimating e ma et al 2015a showed similar results in a grassland they found e pu2 and e e601 perform worse while e pmo and e d20 perform better table 2 in ma et al 2015a besides e d20 perform slightly better than e pmo according to the mean rmse 13 89 w m 2 vs 14 40 w m 2 at the grassland sites at the crop land site e d20 performs nse 0 75 better than e pu2 0 62 e pmo 0 53 and e e601 0 49 however at the forest site e pmo performs best with the highest nse 0 89 and lowest rmse 10 67 w m 2 which is 3 4 w m 2 lower than other terms 3 3 e d20 and e e601 at the daily scale according to the results of e d20 and e e601 at the monthly scale we found the complementary function perform worst in evaporation estimation when e pa is formulated by e e601 it is uncertain whether the performance of e e601 will improve when its observation number increases at the daily scale thus in this section we further compared the daily results of the d20 and e601b pans when both of them have records it provides a fairer comparison for the two pans fig 7 provides an example of the continuous daily observations of the d20 and e601b pans at the site nmg from may 11 2009 to september 30 2009 the results show that e d20 is higher than e e601 at the daily scale which is consistent with the overall trend at the monthly scale in this specific period the mean value of e d20 is 255 06 w m 2 which is 86 w m 2 higher than e e601 generally e d20 and e e601 exhibit similar temporal dynamic patterns but with different amplitudes fig 7 ma et al 2015a presented the similar results in the alpine steppe of the tibetan plateau which showed daily e d20 200 w m 2 is much higher than e e601 100 w m 2 and the temporal patterns keep consistent as the e601b pan has a much larger size the lower magnitude of e601b pan observation should be attributed to the scale effect the daily performance of e d20 and e e601 on evaporation estimation was shown in fig 8 generally the results based on e d20 are more concentrated around the sigmoid curves and the results based on e e601 are more scattered with higher rmses except at the forest site the performance of e e601 is still unsatisfactory in most cases compared with the monthly results the rmse values are even higher at the daily scale combining the results at the monthly scale and the daily scale we infer that e e601 is not a good formulation of e pa this is consistent with the conclusion made by ma et al 2015a and liu et al 2018 the definition of e pa is the evaporation from a small saturated surface inside the extensive landscape brutsaert 2015 han tian 2020 representing the evaporation demand of the atmosphere however the evaporation surface of e601b pan is 2826 cm2 about nine times of d20 pan which may influence the surrounding areas more substantially than d20 pan secondly e pa is considered to correspond to the same non potential atmospheric conditions as actual evaporation but the surrounded water flume may affect the atmosphere around e601b pan chen 2013 also found that the performance of e e601 is not as good as e d20 when it was used to formulate e pa in the complementary principle and tends to overestimate the actual e our result does not mean that the e601b pan is inaccuracy in measurements instead the result only suggests that the evaporation of the e601b pan e e601 does not match the definition of e pa from a small saturated surface it does not contradict with previous study which found the measurements of the e601b pan is better than that of the d20 pan in representing the evaporation from the wide open water surface wang et al 2019 the structure of the e601b pan decreases the non uniformity between evaporation surface and underlying surface by reducing the influence of heat transfer from pan wall and bottom and makes the observation closer to the evaporation from a wide uniform and saturated open surface but not a small surface 4 discussion 4 1 explanation of differences between the pan measurement and penman method in the results section it was found that the performance of e d20 is obviously better than e e601 for the two penman methods the performance of e pmo is better than e pu2 at the grassland and forest sites while the performance of e pu2 is better at the cropland site in this section we will further explain the difference among the performance of the observed e d20 simulated e pmo and the empirical e pu2 generally the results show that e pmo perform well at most sites except the cropland site and we inferred it is due to the high variation of the canopy height in eq 1 the displacement height and roughness lengths are estimated from a fixed canopy height however the canopy height of crops changes greatly throughout the year which is heavily influenced by both plant growing and agricultural practices such as harvesting the accuracy of e pmo is limited by the fixed canopy height setting which was pointed out in wang et al 2020b such limitation may result in low efficiency of the generalized complementary function especially in the nongrowing season when there is no standing vegetation aboveground however this limitation will be avoided if e d20 is used as an observed variable e d20 directly reflects the integration effect of climatic factors without the assumption of a fixed canopy height and the empirical ratios this is the reason why e d20 performs better than e pmo at the cropland site on the other hand e pmo performs obviously better than other formulations at the forest site also due to the canopy height issue the mature forest has a relatively stable canopy height thus a fixed value is acceptable moreover this height 26 m is substantially higher than the measurement height of the d20 pan 0 75 m thus the simulated e pmo represents the whole evaporation demand of the atmosphere including both the canopy and near ground however the d20 pan can only achieve the information around the ground and loss them in the high canopy it s the reason why e pmo perform better than e d20 at the forest site as a traditional empirical formulation of e pa the advantages of e pu2 are concise and independent of surface information e g displacement height and roughness lengths which is essential in the calculation process of e pmo although the accuracy may be partly sacrificed e pu2 still can be regarded as a useful alternative method nses range from 0 61 to 0 82 when the underlaying surface information is missing and the pan measurement is unavailable especially for large scale regional estimation to further test the efficiency of e pu2 we added the analysis at all the ten sites with observations for longer than 10 years on the fluxnet website http fluxnet fluxdata org belonging to croplands cro 5 sites and grasslands gra 5 sites generally the results table s1 show that e pu2 performs slightly better than e pmo at cropland sites while e pmo performs slightly better at the grass land sites which is consistent with the results in table 3 although the magnitudes of differences are much tiny and some exceptions exist e g us var in a summary both of the two formulations show similar performance with high nses which indicates e pu2 nses range from 0 53 to 0 87 is competent for estimating e just like e pmo nses range from 0 48 to 0 88 for these long term monitoring sites 4 2 short vegetations vs high vegetations to further confirm our inference that e pmo is more applicable than e d20 in forests we analyzed these two formulations at three additional forest sites bns dhs and qia the evaluation merits are shown in table 4 the results show that e pmo performs better than e d20 with higher nses and lower rmses at the site bns h c 35 m and dhs h c 20 m these results confirm what we found at the site cha h c 26 m however at the site qia h c 12 m the results show that the two formulations perform very similar with the same nse and rmse values only the mae shows negligible difference 6 08 w m 2 vs 5 98 w m 2 we inferred this phenomenon is related to the relatively lower canopy height at the site qia when we divide the four study sites and the three additional forest sites into two groups as short canopy sites grasslands and cropland n 3 and high canopy sites forests n 4 the mean nse values at the short canopy sites are 0 77 0 06 and 0 69 0 15 for e d20 and e pmo respectively at the high canopy sites the mean nse values of e d20 and e pmo are 0 85 0 13 and 0 88 0 11 respectively although the differences are not statistically significant p value 0 17 and 0 05 it can be recognized that e d20 is more competent for short vegetations and e pmo is more applicable for high vegetations to summarize e pmo performs well in evaporation estimation and can satisfy the requirement in most situations unless the canopy height varies greatly but it needs accurate surface information as input e d20 is a good and even better replacement of e pmo for short vegetations especially when the canopy height has high variation compared with e pmo e d20 reflects the underlying surface changes better by observation instead of simulation and avoids the strict assumption of monin obukhov similarity theory however such advantages disappear when the canopy heights are above a certain limit thus for the high vegetations 20 m i e forest we suggest that e pmo is the best formulation of e pa for the short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is better on condition that the pan evaporation is available since there were more than 700 stations for d20 pans around china wang et al 2019 e d20 has a wide range of application for the long run we need to keep or reuse d20 pans instead of totally abandoning them taking a step back if there is no observation of the d20 pan the simulated e d20 product proposed by wang et al 2019 can be used instead however the performance needs to be tested before the application although a general comparison of different e pa formulations was provided there are some limitations in this study the number of our study sites were limited by the available data which may attenuate the robustness of the conclusion future studies can investigate more sites to validate our findings in more ecosystem types also the comparisons between d20 e601b pans and other types of pans i e class a pan were absent but necessary for wider uses of pan data on the global scale this study emphasizes the importance of pan observation in evaporation estimation by using complementary theory and provides a new consideration in the configuration of routine hydrometeorological measurements 5 conclusions in this study we compared the different formulations of e pa e pmo e pu2 e d20 and e e601 at four ec stations including two grassland sites one cropland site and one forest site with simultaneous eddy covariance and pan evaporation measurements three additional forest sites were used to further compare the results of e d20 and e pmo the four formulations were used in estimating actual evaporation with the aid of a complementary function we found these formulations perform well in estimating e and each one has its own advantages except for e e601 the main findings are summarized as follows 1 for short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is a competitive candidate to formulate e pa because this in situ measurement can accurately reflect the dynamics of the underlying surface through observation compared with the penman methods e d20 does not need to satisfy the strict assumption nor the empirical parameterizations however this method loses its advantage when the canopy heights are above a certain limit 20 m 2 for high vegetations like forests e pmo is the best candidate to formulate e pa and performs well in estimating e this analytical formulation incorporates both evaporation demands from high canopy and ground surface which cannot be reasonably captured by the other three candidates however e pmo does not perform well as other formulations when the canopy height has high variation 3 when the canopy information is not available e g regional scale e pu2 can be regarded as a useful alternative formulation of e pa with moderate accuracy in evaporation estimation as a traditional empirical formulation of e pa the advantages of e pu2 are concise and independent of surface information 4 e e601 is not a good formulation of e pa the structure of e601b pan makes e e601 closer to the evaporation in a wide uniform and saturated open surface thus e e601 does not match the definition of e pa which represents the evaporation from a small saturated surface credit

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by emmanouil anagnostou editor in chief the apparent potential evaporation e pa represents the atmospheric evaporation demand which is essential in estimating the actual evaporation in practice e pa is usually formulated by different functions based on penman method or by pan measurements however it remains unclear which formulation is preferred for different ecosystems in this study we adopted two formulations of e pa by the penman methods e pmo based on the monin obukhov similarity theory and e pu2 based on the rome wind function and another two formulations by the pan evaporation measurements e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan at multi eddy covariance ec stations including different ecosystem types the four formulations were compared in estimating actual evaporation e with the aid of a generalized complementary function our results show that 1 for short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is a competitive candidate because this in situ measurement can accurately reflect the dynamics of the underlying surface through observation and it is widely accessible and easy to deploy 2 for high vegetations like forests e pmo is the best candidate because this theoretical formulation incorporates both evaporation demands from the high canopy and ground surface which cannot be reasonably captured by the other three candidates 3 when the canopy information e g displacement height and roughness lengths is not available e pu2 can be regarded as a useful alternative formulation of e pa with moderate accuracy in evaporation estimation keywords evaporation d20 pan e601b pan monin obukhov similarity theory rome wind function sigmoid generalized complementary function 1 introduction the concept of apparent potential evaporation e pa was first proposed by brutsaert 1982 which is used to represent the atmospheric evaporation demand it is named apparent to distinguish with the potential evaporation e po which takes place from an extensive surface with the abundant supply of water in contrast e pa is the evaporation takes place from a small saturated surface inside the extensive surface brutsaert 2015 han and tian 2020 the word small refers that the surface is small enough to eliminate its effect on the surrounding environment and surrounding evaporation in this manner e pa is corresponding to the same non potential atmospheric conditions of actual evaporation e brutsaert 2015 e pa is an essential variable in estimating the actual evaporation which is one of the largest components of terrestrial water cycle and returns about two thirds of global precipitation over the land chahine 1992 oki and kanae 2006 in fact the actual evaporation is calculated as e pa multiplying a reduction coefficient this coefficient can be defined as a function of either soil moisture content in penman function penman 1950 shuttleworth 1993 or surface resistance in penman monteith function monteith 1965 or atmospheric wetness in complementary function han et al 2012 the reasonable formulation of e pa is therefore the prerequisite of accurate actual evaporation estimation since actual evaporation is important for hydrological research because of its direct impact on the hydrologic processes water cycle drought occurrence and water resources management it is essential to find the best formulation of e pa for different scenarios before using e pa to estimate actual e brutsaert 1982 suggested that e pa can be formulated by the penman method or by a calibrated evaporimeter specifically the evaporation pan brutsaert and parlange 1998 different functions have been developed based on the penman method for example the rome wind function is an original simplified method to formulate apparent potential evaporation thereafter termed as e pu2 penman 1948 it is designed for the water surface thus is suitable for the smooth underlying surface e pu2 has been frequently used e g brutsaert and stricker 1979 brutsaert 1982 szilagyi 2007 ma et al 2019 for its independence of surface information such as displacement height and roughness lengths however morton 1983 suggested that the wind speed is not a good indicator of e pa because of its high variation the combination of penman 1948 and the monin obukhov similarity theory monin obukhov 1954 provides the most sophisticated manner to formulate e pa thereafter termed as e pmo parlange and katul 1992 crago and crowley 2005 this method introduces the boundary layer theory and reflects the effect of roughness lengths which is fully consistent with the definition of e pa to address the inherent uncertainties of roughness lengths associated with empirical parameters in e pmo brutsaert et al 2017 and zhang et al 2017 modified the calculation from different perspectives but at the cost of higher data requirement pan evaporation measurements serve as another method to formulate e pa evaporation pan is one of the simplest and cheapest ways to observe local atmospheric evaporation demand stanhill 2002 compared with the analytical functions based on penman methods e pu2 and e pmo pan evaporation measurement requires no additional data and parameters but it suffers from various biases induced by heat transfer from pan walls and others in previous studies the observation of class a pan was frequently used to formulate e pa kahler and brutsaert 2006 szilagyi 2007 szilagyi and jozsa 2008 zhang et al 2017 brutsaert and parlange 1998 however different types of pans are used in different countries and pan evaporation measurements are significantly affected by size structure materials and installation method of pans fu et al 2004 rotstayn et al 2006 the class a pan is common in north american and australia the bmo tank is used in the u k and the ggi3000 pan is adopted in russia mcvicar et al 2012 in china d20 pan was continuously used from the 1950s to 2000s but it has been gradually replaced by e601b pan around 2002 wang et al 2019 in practice it was found that e601b pan suffers frozen problems in the winter thus d20 pan is kept or re deployed in some regions d20 pan is made of galvanized copper with the radial rim to prevent birds drinking the water fig 1 a the diameter and depth of d20 pan are 20 cm and 10 cm respectively it is equipped on a platform 70 cm above the ground the evaporation rate is calculated according to the weight change of water at two adjacent hours via electronic scales e601b pan is made of fiberglass and sunk into the ground fig 1b the diameter and depth of the e601b pan are 60 cm the bottom is tapered and the depth of the cone is 7 cm it is surrounded by a 20 cm wide flume filled by water to eliminate the edge effect the evaporation rate is calculated according to the difference of water surface height at two adjacent hours via a micrometer there were more than 700 stations with pans around china and the observations are continuous since the 1950s wang et al 2019 these data will be more valuable if they can be properly used in actual evaporation estimation a few studies have compared different apparent evaporation formulations under different situations penman evaporation is traditionally considered to be close to pan evaporation when multiplied by a coefficient eagleman 1967 kohler et al 1959 for example koerselman and beltman 1988 showed that pan evaporation is lower than penman evaporation e pu2 at a fens site with a ratio of about 0 4 however donohue et al 2010 found that the pan evaporation is 46 25 mm month 1 higher than e pu2 according to the results at 102 sites across australia these contradicted studies may be invoked by different empirical parameters in the rome wind function furthermore ma et al 2015a showed that e pmo is lower than e pu2 when the wind speed is low but higher than e pu2 when the wind speed increases in an alpine steppe in spite of these progresses the difference among apparent evaporation formulations remains less understood for different ecosystems and a comprehensive comparison study is necessary for the application of apparent potential evaporation in estimating actual evaporation in this study we systematically compared the four e pa formulations e pmo e pu2 e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan at four eddy covariance ec sites including two grassland sites one cropland site and one forest site these are the only ec sites with sufficient long observations of both d20 and e601b pan evaporation on the database of chinaflux we can find so far another three forest ec sites with short term measurements were further chosen to validate our conclusions for high canopy vegetation the four formulations were evaluated in estimating actual evaporation with the aid of a complementary function the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the four e pa formulations the method we used to estimate actual e and the data sources and processing section 3 mainly shows the comparison among the four formulations as well as their performance in evaporation estimation section 4 explains the different performance of the four formulations and their applicability in different situations the main findings are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 the apparent potential evaporation in this study two penman equations e pmo and e pu2 and two pan evaporations e d20 and e e601 were compared in formulating the apparent potential evaporation e pa according to the penman s equation penman 1948 and the monin obukhov similarity theory monin obukhov 1954 e pmo can be expressed as 1 e pa e pmo δ r n g δ γ ρ c p δ γ κ 2 u ln z d 0 z 0 m ln z d 0 z 0 v e a e a where δ kpac 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor curve at air temperature r n is the net radiation g is the ground heat flux γ kpac 1 is a psychrometric constant ρ is the air density c p is the specific heat κ 0 4 is the von karman constant u is the wind speed at measurement height e a and e a are the saturated and actual vapor pressures of air respectively z is the measurement height table 2 d 0 is the displacement height z 0m and z 0v are the roughness lengths for momentum and water vapor respectively which are estimated from the canopy height h c table 2 z 0 m 0 123 h c d 0 5 5 z 0 m and z 0 v 0 1 z 0 m monin and obukhov 1954 allen et al 1998 another empirical formulation of apparent potential evaporation e pu2 can be expressed as 2 e pa e p u 2 δ r n g δ γ γ δ γ f u 2 e a e a where f u2 2 6 1 0 54 u2 is the rome wind function and u2 is the wind speed at 2 m penman 1948 brutsaert 1982 for the two pan measurements e pa was directly formulated by the pan evaporations e d20 observed by the d20 pan and e e601 observed by the e601b pan which assumes the pan coefficient equals to unity for the two pan types following ma et al 2015a and zuo et al 2016 3 e pa e d 20 4 e pa e e 601 eqs 1 4 represent four different formulations of e pa and their results are compared in section 3 1 then each of the four formulations was used to estimate actual evaporation 2 2 the sigmoid generalized complementary function when e pa is used to estimate the actual evaporation the penman monteith function monteith 1965 and penman function penman 1950 shuttleworth 1993 need additional surface information as input for example the surface resistance or soil moisture content however the complementary principle does not request the complicated surface property information besides the formulation of e pa in the complementary principle needs to be determined more carefully since the data requirement is lower thus we chose the complementary principle as the method to estimate the actual evaporation in previous complementary studies different formulations of e pa have been used to estimate e the few comparison studies were summarized in table 1 generally those studies indicated that the complementary functions perform best in evaporation estimation when e pa was formulated by e pmo but worse when e pa e e601 the results of ma et al 2015a shed some light on the applicability of e d20 in formulating e pa if the evaporation of the chinese pans is competent at formulating e pa in the complementary principle it will be more convenient to estimate the actual evaporation because more than 700 pan observation stations are located across china as the development of the complementary theory the original symmetric linear function bouchet 1963 was extended to many other functions over time including asymmetric linear function brutsaert and stricker 1979 concave function katerji and perrier 1983 polynomial function brutsaert 2015 and the sigmoid function han et al 2012 han tian 2018 although the sigmoid complementary function exhibited high accuracy in evaporation estimation han and tian 2018 ma et al 2015b zhou et al 2020 the quantitative comparison among different formulations of e pa in e estimation with this function is absent table 1 thus in this study we adopted the sigmoid complementary function han tian 2018 the sigmoid generalized complementary function expresses e e pa as a sigmoid function of e rad e pa 5 y e e pa 1 1 m x max x x x min n where x e rad e pa xmax and xmin correspond to specific maximum or minimum values of x under extremely wet or arid conditions for convenience xmax and xmin were set as 1 and 0 respectively which has been approved reasonable wang et al 2020b e pa is formulated by eqs 1 4 e rad is the radiation term of the penman evaporation 6 e

and rouse 1977 han et al 2012 and the asymmetric parameter b was calibrated by an optimization algorithm with the objective function as minimization of the root mean square error rmse between the estimated e est by eq 5 and the observed e 2 3 data sources and data processing the eddy covariance ec data and pan evaporation data d20 and e601b were used to assess evaporation estimation by the four formulations of e pa at four sites include two grassland sites nmg and hbg one cropland site ycs and one forest site cha the data of three additional forest sites dhs qia and bns were used to further compare the results of e d20 and e pmo these sites were selected because the energy fluxes and the pan evaporation were measured simultaneously in the same research fields the detailed information about these sites can be found in table 2 the ec data were collected from the chinaflux http www chinaflux org yu et al 2006 and the pan evaporation data can be achieved from the chinese national ecosystem research network http rs cern ac cn the daily energy fluxes net radiation ground heat flux sensible heat flux and latent heat flux meteorological variables air temperature air pressure relative humidity or vapor pressure deficit and pan evaporations were used in this study the main results except section 3 3 were presented as monthly results through accumulations of the daily data to avoid the uncertainty in daily pan measurements fu et al 2004 and get the best performance of the generalized complementary function wang et al 2020a the bowen ratio energy balance method twine et al 2000 was adopted in the energy closure correction in this method the residual term in energy balance was attributed into sensible heat and latent heat by preserving the bowen ratio after energy balance correction the available energy r n g sensible heat and latent heat were restricted to positive values han tian 2018 the root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and

e d20 and e e601 although all these formulations can represent the apparent potential evaporation in a sense their values differ from each other substantially the variations of the four formulations e pmo e pu2 e d20 and e e601 are shown in fig 2 following the time sequence at the nmg site grassland fig 2a the results show that the simulated e pmo is close to the observed e d20 and their values are significantly higher than e pu2 p values 0 01 the p values are from paired samples t tests between monthly e pmo or e d20 and e pu2 which mean that the differences between e pmo or e d20 and e pu2 are significant for example in the year 2007 and 2008 when the availability of the three formulations are maximum the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 141 35 w m 2 and 141 26 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 81 16 w m 2 in the nongrowing seasons november to march the difference between e pmo and e pu2 is minor compared with that in the growing seasons the difference peaked in may and june when e pmo and e pu2 achieve the maximum values e pmo or e d20 can reach more than 300 w m 2 about two times of e pu2 according to the results during the limited months in the growing season of the last two years we found e e601 is closer to e pu2 fig 2a at another grassland site hbg fig 2b located in northwest china the differences among the four formulations are smaller than those at the nmg site however it can also be recognized that e pmo and e d20 are clearly higher than e pu2 in 2007 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 91 59 w m 2 and 105 24 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 69 03 w m 2 the maximum values of these formulations occur in may or june which is similar to those at the nmg site at the hbg site the pan evaporations e d20 and e e601 are relatively higher than other formulations for example the highest e d20 can reach 197 7 w m 2 in may of 2008 about 10 w m 2 higher than e pmo in the growing seasons of 2007 2009 results show that e d20 is significantly higher than e pmo p value 0 01 e e601 is close to e pmo in the nongrowing season and even higher than e pmo in the growing season according to the limited observations at the cropland site ycs fig 2c the results of the four formulations are very similar to those at the nmg site in brief e pmo has the same magnitude as e d20 and e pu2 is close to e e601 the first two formulations are substantially higher than the latter two in 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 162 72 w m 2 and 139 56 w m 2 respectively while the mean value of e pu2 is 87 80 w m 2 e pmo and e d20 show a high correlation with a pearson correlation efficient of 0 91 if we focus on the growing season of 2009 the mean values of e pmo and e d20 are 180 88 w m 2and 181 4 w m 2 and those of e pu2 and e e601 are 116 59 w m 2 and 112 90 w m 2 respectively the maximum values of e pmo and e d20 about 310 w m 2 are double of those of e pu2 and e e601 about 160 w m 2 however the situation is different at the mixed forest sites cha fig 2d it can be confirmed that e pmo is significantly higher than the other formulations p value 0 05 the maximum value of e pmo can reach 641 1 w m 2 and the annual mean value is 323 1 w m 2 while for e d20 as the highest one of the other three formulations the maximum value is only 191 5 w m 2 and the mean value is 88 7 w m 2 the difference among e d20 e pu2 and e e601is minor compared with the gaps between them and e pmo to summarize we found the four formulations of e pa show clearly seasonal pattern and the maximum values occur in april to june generally e d20 are higher than e e601 at the three short vegetation sites nmg hbs and ycs e pmo is close to e d20 and they are substantially higher than e pu2 especially in the growing seasons at the mixed forest site e pmo is greatly higher than the other formulations this phenomenon is related to the consideration of canopy height in e pmo and it will be discussed latter in section 4 3 2 performance of different formulations on e pa in this section we presented the performance of the four formulations of e pa on evaporation estimation the sigmoid generalized complementary curves with e pa formulated by e d20 are shown in fig 3 first column generally the monthly results black dots are tight around the sigmoid curves red lines implied that e d20 is efficient in formulating e pa in the complementary function the blue lines the p t and penman boundary lines are the theoretical upper boundary of the evaporation when the surface moisture condition improves the sigmoid curve red lines will approach but does not exceed the blue lines which means the actual evaporation get close to its upper boundary the regression relationship between the estimated e est and the observed e of the four sites is shown in fig 4 first column these results are close to the 1 1 line slopes 0 86 1 22 with high r2 values 0 75 0 89 the results for e e601 fig 3 second column is the most scattered among the four formulations in fig 3 e d20 and e e601 and fig 5 e pmo and e pu2 figs 3 and 5 provided a general qualitative impression about which methods e d20 e e601 e pmo and e pu2 gave better results according to the visible distance between the dots observations and the lines simulations also the merits of different methods can be qualitatively evaluated by whether the results follow an approximate sigmoid shape or part of the sigmoid shape the regression relationship fig 4 second column shows the e est derivates from e at the site nmg e est 0 39 e 36 1 and cha e est 1 35 e 12 1 there are few observations of the e601b pans because of latter installation and discontinuous records it seems that the few observations partly affect the determination of accurate model parameters and result in improper fitted curves however in previous researches e g ma et al 2019 wang et al 2020a even though few observations can generate favorable fitted curves when e pa is formulated appropriately as for the penman methods fig 5 shows the sigmoid curves derived from the monthly results of e pmo and e pu2 and fig 6 shows the corresponding regression results between modeled e est and actual e generally the shapes of the curves based on e pmo are similar to those based on e d20 except at the forest site the results are consistent with fig 2 which shows that e pmo is close to e d20 at the grassland sites and the cropland site but deviates from e d20 at the forest site e pmo is relative higher at the nmg site and the cha site resulting in the points of e rad e pmo e e pmo concentrated in the lower and middle part of the sigmoid lines the regression slopes between e est and e range from 0 97 to 1 1 with high r2 0 72 0 91 which indicate that e pmo performs well in formulating e pa fig 6 first column except at the cropland site intercept 6 93 w m 2 when e pa is formulated by e pu2 the results become more scattered fig 5 second column compared with e pmo fig 5 first column generally the scattered results move to the upper right in each panel fig 5 when e pmo is replaced by e pu2 because the denominators of x and y decrease according to the regression analysis fig 6 second column the estimation accuracy is slightly lower but still acceptable r2 0 82 the higher regression slopes 1 04 1 23 and lower intercepts 1 22 6 78 w m 2 indicate higher biases than those based on e pmo at most sites however the cropland site ycs is an exception in which the e pu2 method shows better results at the cropland site the regression slope is closer to 1 1 04 vs 1 1 and the intercept is smaller 1 71 w m 2 vs 6 93 w m 2 indicating the results based on e pu2 have lower biases than those based on e pmo fig 6e vs fig 6f although the sigmoid plots fig 5e vs fig 5f show that the results based on e pmo are closer to the fitted curve the biases are amplified by the magnitude of e pmo which is about two times of e pu2 164 32 w m 2 vs 81 85 w m 2 the evaluation merits rmse mae and nse were summarized in table 3 the results shows that e e601 perform worse than e d20 and those based on the penman methods e pmo and e pu2 the mean nses based on e e601 and e d20 are 0 60 and 0 78 respectively the mean value of rmses and maes of e e601 are 16 66 w m 2 and 13 42 w m 2 respectively about 2 w m 2 higher than those of e d20 generally we found measurements of e601b pans are not appropriate in formulating e pa at the monthly scale in table 3 there are several cases with infinite b values which represent the sigmoid curves approach but do not exceed the p t boundary line e g fig 3e this situation occurs when the land surface moisture condition is ample for example the wetland and irrigated cropland when b is infinity m and n in eq 5 are equal to 0 60 and 1 21 respectively according to eq 7 b 1 0 for the penman methods results show that the mean rmse and mae of the e pmo method 13 15 w m 2 and 10 28 w m 2 are lower than that of the e pu2 method 15 55 w m 2 and 12 12 w m 2 and the mean nse of the e pmo method 0 81 is higher than that of the e pu2 method 0 74 except for the cropland site ycs at the cropland site rmse and mae of the e pmo method are about 2 w m 2 higher than that of the e pu2 method and nse is lower 0 53 vs 0 62 these results suggest that the e pmo method performs better than the e pu2 method except for the cropland site according to table 3 at the grassland sites e d20 mean nse 0 78 and e pmo 0 77 perform better than e pu2 0 70 and e e601 0 64 in estimating e ma et al 2015a showed similar results in a grassland they found e pu2 and e e601 perform worse while e pmo and e d20 perform better table 2 in ma et al 2015a besides e d20 perform slightly better than e pmo according to the mean rmse 13 89 w m 2 vs 14 40 w m 2 at the grassland sites at the crop land site e d20 performs nse 0 75 better than e pu2 0 62 e pmo 0 53 and e e601 0 49 however at the forest site e pmo performs best with the highest nse 0 89 and lowest rmse 10 67 w m 2 which is 3 4 w m 2 lower than other terms 3 3 e d20 and e e601 at the daily scale according to the results of e d20 and e e601 at the monthly scale we found the complementary function perform worst in evaporation estimation when e pa is formulated by e e601 it is uncertain whether the performance of e e601 will improve when its observation number increases at the daily scale thus in this section we further compared the daily results of the d20 and e601b pans when both of them have records it provides a fairer comparison for the two pans fig 7 provides an example of the continuous daily observations of the d20 and e601b pans at the site nmg from may 11 2009 to september 30 2009 the results show that e d20 is higher than e e601 at the daily scale which is consistent with the overall trend at the monthly scale in this specific period the mean value of e d20 is 255 06 w m 2 which is 86 w m 2 higher than e e601 generally e d20 and e e601 exhibit similar temporal dynamic patterns but with different amplitudes fig 7 ma et al 2015a presented the similar results in the alpine steppe of the tibetan plateau which showed daily e d20 200 w m 2 is much higher than e e601 100 w m 2 and the temporal patterns keep consistent as the e601b pan has a much larger size the lower magnitude of e601b pan observation should be attributed to the scale effect the daily performance of e d20 and e e601 on evaporation estimation was shown in fig 8 generally the results based on e d20 are more concentrated around the sigmoid curves and the results based on e e601 are more scattered with higher rmses except at the forest site the performance of e e601 is still unsatisfactory in most cases compared with the monthly results the rmse values are even higher at the daily scale combining the results at the monthly scale and the daily scale we infer that e e601 is not a good formulation of e pa this is consistent with the conclusion made by ma et al 2015a and liu et al 2018 the definition of e pa is the evaporation from a small saturated surface inside the extensive landscape brutsaert 2015 han tian 2020 representing the evaporation demand of the atmosphere however the evaporation surface of e601b pan is 2826 cm2 about nine times of d20 pan which may influence the surrounding areas more substantially than d20 pan secondly e pa is considered to correspond to the same non potential atmospheric conditions as actual evaporation but the surrounded water flume may affect the atmosphere around e601b pan chen 2013 also found that the performance of e e601 is not as good as e d20 when it was used to formulate e pa in the complementary principle and tends to overestimate the actual e our result does not mean that the e601b pan is inaccuracy in measurements instead the result only suggests that the evaporation of the e601b pan e e601 does not match the definition of e pa from a small saturated surface it does not contradict with previous study which found the measurements of the e601b pan is better than that of the d20 pan in representing the evaporation from the wide open water surface wang et al 2019 the structure of the e601b pan decreases the non uniformity between evaporation surface and underlying surface by reducing the influence of heat transfer from pan wall and bottom and makes the observation closer to the evaporation from a wide uniform and saturated open surface but not a small surface 4 discussion 4 1 explanation of differences between the pan measurement and penman method in the results section it was found that the performance of e d20 is obviously better than e e601 for the two penman methods the performance of e pmo is better than e pu2 at the grassland and forest sites while the performance of e pu2 is better at the cropland site in this section we will further explain the difference among the performance of the observed e d20 simulated e pmo and the empirical e pu2 generally the results show that e pmo perform well at most sites except the cropland site and we inferred it is due to the high variation of the canopy height in eq 1 the displacement height and roughness lengths are estimated from a fixed canopy height however the canopy height of crops changes greatly throughout the year which is heavily influenced by both plant growing and agricultural practices such as harvesting the accuracy of e pmo is limited by the fixed canopy height setting which was pointed out in wang et al 2020b such limitation may result in low efficiency of the generalized complementary function especially in the nongrowing season when there is no standing vegetation aboveground however this limitation will be avoided if e d20 is used as an observed variable e d20 directly reflects the integration effect of climatic factors without the assumption of a fixed canopy height and the empirical ratios this is the reason why e d20 performs better than e pmo at the cropland site on the other hand e pmo performs obviously better than other formulations at the forest site also due to the canopy height issue the mature forest has a relatively stable canopy height thus a fixed value is acceptable moreover this height 26 m is substantially higher than the measurement height of the d20 pan 0 75 m thus the simulated e pmo represents the whole evaporation demand of the atmosphere including both the canopy and near ground however the d20 pan can only achieve the information around the ground and loss them in the high canopy it s the reason why e pmo perform better than e d20 at the forest site as a traditional empirical formulation of e pa the advantages of e pu2 are concise and independent of surface information e g displacement height and roughness lengths which is essential in the calculation process of e pmo although the accuracy may be partly sacrificed e pu2 still can be regarded as a useful alternative method nses range from 0 61 to 0 82 when the underlaying surface information is missing and the pan measurement is unavailable especially for large scale regional estimation to further test the efficiency of e pu2 we added the analysis at all the ten sites with observations for longer than 10 years on the fluxnet website http fluxnet fluxdata org belonging to croplands cro 5 sites and grasslands gra 5 sites generally the results table s1 show that e pu2 performs slightly better than e pmo at cropland sites while e pmo performs slightly better at the grass land sites which is consistent with the results in table 3 although the magnitudes of differences are much tiny and some exceptions exist e g us var in a summary both of the two formulations show similar performance with high nses which indicates e pu2 nses range from 0 53 to 0 87 is competent for estimating e just like e pmo nses range from 0 48 to 0 88 for these long term monitoring sites 4 2 short vegetations vs high vegetations to further confirm our inference that e pmo is more applicable than e d20 in forests we analyzed these two formulations at three additional forest sites bns dhs and qia the evaluation merits are shown in table 4 the results show that e pmo performs better than e d20 with higher nses and lower rmses at the site bns h c 35 m and dhs h c 20 m these results confirm what we found at the site cha h c 26 m however at the site qia h c 12 m the results show that the two formulations perform very similar with the same nse and rmse values only the mae shows negligible difference 6 08 w m 2 vs 5 98 w m 2 we inferred this phenomenon is related to the relatively lower canopy height at the site qia when we divide the four study sites and the three additional forest sites into two groups as short canopy sites grasslands and cropland n 3 and high canopy sites forests n 4 the mean nse values at the short canopy sites are 0 77 0 06 and 0 69 0 15 for e d20 and e pmo respectively at the high canopy sites the mean nse values of e d20 and e pmo are 0 85 0 13 and 0 88 0 11 respectively although the differences are not statistically significant p value 0 17 and 0 05 it can be recognized that e d20 is more competent for short vegetations and e pmo is more applicable for high vegetations to summarize e pmo performs well in evaporation estimation and can satisfy the requirement in most situations unless the canopy height varies greatly but it needs accurate surface information as input e d20 is a good and even better replacement of e pmo for short vegetations especially when the canopy height has high variation compared with e pmo e d20 reflects the underlying surface changes better by observation instead of simulation and avoids the strict assumption of monin obukhov similarity theory however such advantages disappear when the canopy heights are above a certain limit thus for the high vegetations 20 m i e forest we suggest that e pmo is the best formulation of e pa for the short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is better on condition that the pan evaporation is available since there were more than 700 stations for d20 pans around china wang et al 2019 e d20 has a wide range of application for the long run we need to keep or reuse d20 pans instead of totally abandoning them taking a step back if there is no observation of the d20 pan the simulated e d20 product proposed by wang et al 2019 can be used instead however the performance needs to be tested before the application although a general comparison of different e pa formulations was provided there are some limitations in this study the number of our study sites were limited by the available data which may attenuate the robustness of the conclusion future studies can investigate more sites to validate our findings in more ecosystem types also the comparisons between d20 e601b pans and other types of pans i e class a pan were absent but necessary for wider uses of pan data on the global scale this study emphasizes the importance of pan observation in evaporation estimation by using complementary theory and provides a new consideration in the configuration of routine hydrometeorological measurements 5 conclusions in this study we compared the different formulations of e pa e pmo e pu2 e d20 and e e601 at four ec stations including two grassland sites one cropland site and one forest site with simultaneous eddy covariance and pan evaporation measurements three additional forest sites were used to further compare the results of e d20 and e pmo the four formulations were used in estimating actual evaporation with the aid of a complementary function we found these formulations perform well in estimating e and each one has its own advantages except for e e601 the main findings are summarized as follows 1 for short vegetations i e grass and crop e d20 is a competitive candidate to formulate e pa because this in situ measurement can accurately reflect the dynamics of the underlying surface through observation compared with the penman methods e d20 does not need to satisfy the strict assumption nor the empirical parameterizations however this method loses its advantage when the canopy heights are above a certain limit 20 m 2 for high vegetations like forests e pmo is the best candidate to formulate e pa and performs well in estimating e this analytical formulation incorporates both evaporation demands from high canopy and ground surface which cannot be reasonably captured by the other three candidates however e pmo does not perform well as other formulations when the canopy height has high variation 3 when the canopy information is not available e g regional scale e pu2 can be regarded as a useful alternative formulation of e pa with moderate accuracy in evaporation estimation as a traditional empirical formulation of e pa the advantages of e pu2 are concise and independent of surface information 4 e e601 is not a good formulation of e pa the structure of e601b pan makes e e601 closer to the evaporation in a wide uniform and saturated open surface thus e e601 does not match the definition of e pa which represents the evaporation from a small saturated surface credit

5004,numerous studies have focused on the retrieval of soil moisture sm and evaporative fraction ef based on the surface temperature vegetation index tvx framework however few literatures have investigated whether these two variables can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework besides most previous studies only demonstrated the application of the tvx framework under clear sky conditions the estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions is still a challenging task the main motivation for this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef specifically the optimization scheme was designed to construct the constraints and objective functions of the tvx framework at seasonal scale in situ sm and ef measurements were utilized to calibrate the theoretical boundaries of the tvx framework respectively the applicability of this new scheme was demonstrated over the southern great plains sgp of the united states of america in the year 2005 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products the comparisons between present method and previous traditional tvx models indicate that the accuracy of the optimization scheme produced using only one site for calibration has reached a comparable level over the whole study domain however the new scheme holds unique advantages in simplicity and continuity it has not only circumvented the complex parameterization scheme of theoretical tvx framework but also achieved estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions the validation results of sm estimates show that the absolute value of correlation coefficient r under clear and partially cloudy sky conditions was 0 51 and 0 43 respectively the validation results of ef estimates indicate that the r and root mean square error rmse under clear sky conditions was 0 70 and 0 163 in contrast the r and rmse under partially cloudy conditions was 0 66 and 0 158 in addition the coupled estimation of sm and ef means that these two objective variables can be interconverted into each other within the optimization framework thus either sm or ef can be used to calibrate the theoretical dry edge that applies to the estimation of both variables keywords soil moisture evaporative fraction tvx method observation driven modis 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an essential state variable that controls water and energy balance processes between the land surface and atmosphere evaporative fraction is a flux based diagnostic that represents a ratio of latent heat flux to the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes in general sm and ef play major roles in qualifying the water cycle behavior as well as controlling the energy balance processes koster and mahanama 2012 tang and li 2017 sadeghi et al 2019 accurate spatial distributed estimation of daily sm and ef is important to a wide range of meteorology hydrology and ecology disciplines gentine et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 dong and crow 2018 however conventional in situ measurements of sm and ef are usually costly time consuming and available only at a handful of sparse field networks baldocchi et al 2001 abdolghafoorian et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 advances in satellite remote sensing rs technology numerous models have given rise to an alternative to characterize the sm and ef patterns at different spatiotemporal scales which is unachievable from sparse experiment networks xu et al 2011 schwingshackl et al 2017 yagci et al 2017 sheffield et al 2018 the electromagnetic spectrum involved in rs model to retrieve sm and ef related information is mainly distributed in optical thermal and microwave bands among them active and passive microwave remote sensing make it possible to produce sm map with varying spatiotemporal scales under all weather conditions merlin et al 2010 khodayar et al 2019 nevertheless the applicability of microwave technique is hampered by its low repeat intervals e g ers envisat for active sensors and coarse spatial resolution e g smos amsr e for passive sensors mallick et al 2009 merlin et al 2010 in contrast optical and thermal sensors can achieve finer spatial and temporal resolutions as a result various optical thermal based approaches have been proposed to estimate soil moisture status and disaggregate microwave based soil moisture information sun et al 2012 yang et al 2015a sadeghi et al 2017 zhu et al 2017a within this context numerous studies have demonstrated the emergence of temperature vegetation index tvx method has led to various parameterization schemes relating the surface temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c space to surface soil moisture sandholt et al 2002 mallick et al 2009 holzman et al 2014 tagesson et al 2018 according to this method a physically meaningful triangular or trapezoidal shape constituted by the scatterplots of t s and f c measurements would be constructed when a full range of soil moisture availability and vegetation cover conditions are available over the study domain within the triangular or trapezoidal space dry edge and wet edge form two physical limits of soil moisture availability the isopleths of soil moisture enclosed in such space can be estimated by various soil moisture index smi comprehensive reviews on the estimation of smi from the tvx method can be learned from carlson 2007 petropoulos et al 2009 2015 on contrary ef cannot be measured directly by remote sensing observations consequently a number of remote sensing based ef modeling schemes from simple empirical formulas to complex land surface process models have been proposed over past few decades norman et al 1995 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 nishida et al 2003 allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2007 mu et al 2007 bateni et al 2013 xu et al 2014 due to the strong feedbacks between the land surface and atmosphere it is well known that sm has significant potential in controlling the rate of both soil evaporation and plant transpiration detto et al 2006 garcía et al 2013 williams and torn 2015 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 on this premise the various smi retrieved from the t s f c space lays good foundation for the further development of rs based ef models accordingly a considerable amount of tvx models have been developed for the estimation of evapotranspiration et and ef moran et al 1994 stisen et al 2008 long and singh 2012 garcía et al 2014 minacapilli et al 2016 several review papers on rs based et models have summarized the applications of tvx method in ef estimates courault et al 2005 carlson 2007 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 chen and liu 2020 numerous literatures have documented the advantages of the tvx method and its applicability in the estimation of sm and ef has been proved in many different regions worldwide rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 yang et al 2015b liu et al 2017 hu et al 2018 carlson and petropoulos 2019 however there are still several critical issues involved in the tvx framework 1 tvx method has been widely used to retrieve either sm or ef but few literatures have documented whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework 2 in situ sm and ef observations are usually involved in the evaluation of aforementioned models but a few number of studies have documented whether in situ observations can be incorporated into these models for calibration purposes and 3 clear sky days are usually required to accurately parameterize the dry edge and wet edge within the tvx framework the retrieval of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions is still a challenging task batra et al 2006 wang et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017a in recent years data mining technology has provided new opportunities for characterizing land surface water cycle and energy fluxes from rs observations abbaszadeh et al 2018 sanaa et al 2018 for example the study of farhadi et al 2016 suggests that coupled and continuous retrieval of surface variables is feasible by developing objective functions that link atmospheric forcing surface states and unknown parameters recent studies also demonstrate that the parameters optimized at multi site has well spatial extension for the estimation of regional objective variables xu et al 2018 yao et al 2019 in the tvx framework the pixels plotted in two dimensional space share common boundaries which provides a new perspective for calibrating these boundaries using a limited number of field measurements besides these boundaries are applicable for the estimation of both sm and ef it means that these boundaries can be retrieved from either sm or ef observations so sm and ef can be interconverted into each other inspired by this the main motivation for this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef it is speciallydesigned to answer the following two questions critical to the tvx method but have not been addressed in the literature 1 whether in situ sm or ef measurements can be used for the calibration of the tvx method 2 whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework and interconverted into each other 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the tvx method 2 1 1 parameterization of sm from the tvx framework following sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a a conceptual diagram of the trapezoidal tvx framework is presented in fig 1 it is enclosed by physically meaningful upper and lower boundaries the decreasing dry edge and horizontal wet edge denote the temperature under water stressed conditions and unlimited water access conditions respectively assuming the isopleths of soil moisture availability decreases linearly from the wet edge to the dry edge the soil moisture state involved in the t s f c space was retrieved by the temperate vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 which was implemented as 1 tvdi i j t s i j t w j t max i j t w j 1 w i j w min i w max i w min i 2 t max i j t smax j f c i j t w j t smax j where w i j represents the volumetric sm of a given pixel i on day j w min i and w max i represent the lower and upper thresholds of w i j respectively t w j and t smax j represent the wet edge and the dry point of bare soil respectively t max i j denotes the observed maximum surface temperature along the dry edge for a given f c i j interval which is usually determined by the linear regression approach however observed dry edge often suffers from uncertainty sun et al 2012 and long and singh 2012 developed the theoretical solution of dry edge based on surface energy balance equations the calculation of unknown parameters was converted from t smax j and t w j to t smax j t cmax j and t w j meanwhile more complex parameterization process was involved in the determination of theoretical dry edge in order to reduce the determination of t cmax j the above tvdi method was modified by zhu et al 2017a to develop the following modified temperature vegetation dryness index mtvdi 3 mtvdi i j t smax i j t w j t smax j t w j 1 w i j w min i w max i w min i 4 t smax i j t s i j f c i j t cmax i j 1 f c i j t s i j f c i j t a i j 1 f c i j where t cmax i j and t smax i j represent the surface temperature of full cover vegetation and bare soil along the isopleths of soil moisture availability respectively t cmax i j is approximately replaced by the air temperature t a i j following the assumption that the air temperature within the canopy is in equilibrium with the radiative temperature of a full vegetated surface prihodko and goward 1997 nieto et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 2 1 2 parameterization of ef from the tvx framework based on the definition of ef and the extension of the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 jiang and islam 1999 proposed that ef could be retrieved from the t s f c space as follows 5 ef i j i j δ i j δ i j γ 6 δ i j 0 611 17 502 240 97 e x p 17 502 t a i j t a i j 240 97 t a i j 240 97 2 where δ i j represents the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature t a i j and γ represents a psychrometric constant which was set as 0 06738 i j represents a complex priestley taylor parameter accounting for surface and canopy resistances it is noteworthy that although parameter i j looks similar to the α pt α pt 1 26 in the initial version of priestley taylor equation it encompasses a wide range of surface evaporative conditions and can take a range of values the maximum value of i j varies with different tvx studies jiang and islam 2001 agam et al 2010 following previous tvx studies applied to the same study region wang et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 yagci and santanello 2018 the maximum value of i j was set as 1 26 in this study numerous parameterization schemes have been proposed to retrieve i j from tvdi and mtvdi e g yang and shang 2013 yang et al 2015c minacapilli et al 2016 in this study i j is retrieved from mtvdi as below a modification of the parameterization scheme proposed by komatsu 2003 is used to retrieve i j from mtvdi for bare soil which is defined as 7 s i j 1 26 1 e x p mtvdi i j 1 following the assumption that the air temperature within the canopy is in equilibrium with the radiative temperature of a full vegetated surface the parameter i j for full cover vegetation c is always close to its maximum value c 1 26 jiang and islam 1999 2001 long et al 2012 consequently the parameter i j of a mixed pixel is interpolated linearly between c and s i j by using f c i j as the weight 8 i j s i j 1 f c i j c f c i j 2 2 optimization scheme of the tvx framework the combination of eq 3 to eq 8 shows that both mtvdi and ef can be expressed as follows 9 mtvdi i j ef i j f t s i j f c i j t a i j t smax j t w j obviously t smax j and t w j are the only two unknown parameters t w j is the surface temperature at the conditions of saturated water supply in previous studies three parameterization schemes have been developed for the retrieval of t w j zhu et al 2017b specifically the minimum t s over the study domain sandholt et al 2002 t s of some typical pixels such as water bodies sun et al 2012 and dense vegetation stands zhang et al 2008 and the observed near surface t a long and singh 2012 have all been taken as t w j following sandholt et al 2002 the minimum t s within the study region is set as t w j in this study in contrast the retrieval of t smax j is much more complex both empirical and theoretical methods have been developed for the determination of t smax j under clear sky conditions however both these two methods have significant disadvantages more specifically the empirical method based on linear regression suffers from huge uncertainty and subjectivity long and singh 2012 while the theoretical method determined by land surface energy balance equations requires complex parameterization process and the ancillary field measurements sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b in order to overcome the disadvantages of these two methods an optimization scheme was proposed in this study to parameterize the tvx framework fig 2 similar to previous studies of the tvx method the parameterization scheme used in this study was also developed using remote sensing observations under clear sky conditions following venturini et al 2008 the cloudy pixels over study domain less than 20 were marked as clear sky days in theory t smax j denotes the radiative temperature of bare soil at the conditions of maximum water stress the studies of sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017b also suggest that the seasonal variation of t smax j on clear sky days can be dominated by the incoming solar radiation according to the definition of incoming solar radiation the annual variations of t smax j was designed as a cosine function combined with t smax j observations and solar zenith angle θ j observations in the optimization method 10 t smax j a cos a θ j b the subscript j means that the inputs of optimization method are observed on day j assuming the phase variation curve of t smax j following the same trend of the observed t max j the parameters a and b were fitted by using t max j observed from land surface temperature product and θ j observed from geo location fields of the clear sky days fig 3 the initial fitting parameters are given in eq 11 which constitutes the observed dry edge of the entire region in order to produce the statistically optimal dry edge at a specific site eq 11 was further converted to eq 12 11 t max j 322 cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 12 t smax j a cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 the parameter a defining the amplitude of t smax j was determined using optimization algorithm which can be calibrated at a specific site using either in situ sm or ef observations specifically following our recent work zhu et al 2020a 2020b the objective functions driven by in situ observations are defined as below for soil moisture 13 a s m i m a x a b s cor j 1 n sm i j mtvdi i j for evaporative fraction 14 a e f i m i n j 1 n ef i j ef i j where n is the number of clear sky days mtvdi i j and sm i j are the estimated soil moisture index and measured soil moisture at site i on day j ef i j and ef i j denote the estimated and measured evaporative fraction respectively the purpose of eq 13 and eq 14 is to obtain the optimal parameter a s m i and a e f i when the absolute value of correlation coefficient reaches its highest and the value of mean absolute error approaches its smallest the top and bottom edges of these two objective functions are site dependent and not set in advance additionally these two objective functions share the same constraints which are defined as follows constraint 1 for all pixels over the study area 15 0 mtvdi i j 1 constraint 2 for t smax j in eq 10 16 t max j t smax j u or 17 322 cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 a cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 u where u represents the upper threshold of t smax j there are few literatures and methodologies to determine u at annual scale over this study domain the time series of t max j retrieved from land surface temperature product over this study domain indicates that the maximum value during the period from 2000 to 2017 is 344 48 k zhu et al 2020 accordingly u was set empirically as 345 k in this study and the variation step was also set as 0 5 k compared with t smax j the determination of t w j is much more straightforward it was implemented as 18 t w j m i n t min j t min j 19 t smin j 296 9 c o s 0 5507 θ j 0 2348 where t min j is the predicted t min j by the cosine function which is determined by daily minimum land surface temperature t min j retrieved from surface temperature product and θ j retrieved from geo location fields under clear sky conditions fig 3 the combination of eq 9 17 18 and 19 indicates that the amplitude a is the only unknown variable in the optimization scheme therefore the solution of a value in the proposed method is designed to figure out the optimal value within the allowable variation range that optimizes the objective functions at a given site it should be noted that the conventional sm and ef observations are only available at a handful of sparse sites to reduce the reliance of the proposed method on the number of sites the optimization method was designed by using only one site for calibration leaving the other sites for validation 2 3 error metrics four error metrics are used to validate the performance of the proposed method entekhabi et al 2010 which are defined as 20 r i 1 n p i p i q i q i i 1 n p i p i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 21 mae 1 n i 1 n p i q i 22 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i q i 2 23 b p i q i 1 where p i represents rs based sm and ef estimates q i represents in situ measurements p i and q i represent the mean value of rs based estimates and in situ observations respectively three issues should be kept in mind when the accuracy is evaluated firstly mtvdi represents relative soil moisture rather than volumetric soil moisture content so only r was selected for sm accuracy assessment in contrast all the four metrics were suitable for the evaluation of ef accuracy secondly there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the accuracy of sm and ef retrieved from rs observations due to the mismatch in spatial scale following most previous studies sm and ef observations obtained at site scale were used directly to validate the accuracy of rs based estimates at 1 km spatial resolution batra et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 long et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b thirdly in situ sm and ef observations also suffer from uncertainty to obtain robust statistical results quality control strategies for in situ measurements were included liu et al 2016 zhou and wang 2016 1 based on physical characteristics sm and ef measurements outside the range 0 to 1 were excluded 2 based on historical records bowen ratio the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux exceeding 8 for ef measurements was removed and 3 outliers beyond three standard deviations 3σ were excluded 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the southern great plains sgp region is located in an area ranging in latitude between 34 30 n to 38 30 n and in longitude from 95 18 w to 99 30 w covering the southern part of kansas and most of oklahoma in the united states of america it is a relatively flat region characterized by tall and short grass mixed farming interrupted forest water bodies and a small fraction of urban area fig 4 among all vegetation cover types grassland is the dominant one in the area croplands are mainly scattered in the northwest and the center and some conifer forests can be found in the southeast the dominant soil types of this region are silt loam and sandy loam the annual precipitation is 500 mm which increases gradually from west to east the sgp region is the first field experiment network chosen by the atmospheric radiation measurement arm relatively dense flux network have been established over this region to monitor moisture momentum fluxes and surface heat consequently this region has been adopted by numerous studies to demonstrate the applicability of the tvx method wang et al 2006 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b yagci and santanello 2018 this makes the sgp region an ideal domain for the comparison of different studies 3 2 field measurements three field datasets were adopted in this study 1 hourly sm observations from the soil water and temperature system swats instruments were involved in the calibration and validation of the sm optimization method 2 30 minute ef observations from the energy balance bowen ratio ebbr instruments were used for the calibration and validation of the ef optimization method and 3 30 minute near surface air temperature t a observations from the surface meteorological systems met were adopted for the validation of t a estimates the swats system provided volumetric sm measurements at eight different depths only the measurements at surface soil layer were used in this study ebbr system estimated the latent and sensible heat fluxes using the observations of soil energy storage net radiation vapor pressure and gradients of temperature ef observations were obtained using the ratio of latent heat flux to the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes detailed descriptions about swats and ebbr measurements were available at the arm website https www arm gov the information of thirteen sites with sm of ef observations were summarized in table 1 and drawn in fig 4 among them twelve sites provide swats measurements and eight sites provide ebbr measurements the seven sites with the availability of both sm and ef observations were used to investigate whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework 3 3 modis data besides ground based measurements the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products were also used in this study specifically the modis products consisted of daily t s observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod11a1 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km spatial resolution mod13a2 daily solar zenith θ observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod03 daily cloud observations mod06 l2 and daily atmosphere profile observations mod07 l2 at 5 km spatial resolution daily cloud and atmosphere profile observations were adopted for the estimation of near surface air temperature t a following zhu et al 2017c the 16 day ndvi was time series smoothed using the algorithm proposed by chen et al 2006 and interpolated to the daily value the squared relationship between fractional vegetation cover f c and ndvi proposed by gillies et al 1997 is implemented as 24 f c i j ndvi i j ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 where ndvi i j is the ndvi value of pixel i on day j ndvi min and ndvi max represent the minimum and maximum ndvi values over the sgp region respectively following the study of zhu et al 2017a the full vegetated surface is defined as ndvi max 0 94 and bare soil is recognized as ndvi min 0 05 4 results and discussions 4 1 accuracy of optimization method on clear sky days following batra et al 2006 and venturini et al 2008 an image was marked as clear sky days when the cloudy pixels over the whole study domain is less than 20 accordingly the total number of clear sky days in 2005 is 86 however due to the deficiency of in situ measurements and rs observations at site scale the sample number used for calibration in eq 13 and eq 14 is around 60 at most sites in general the samples within each specific site are distributed evenly throughout the year which enables us to capture the seasonal variations of the dry and wet edges as for the accuracy of t a estimates the met sites used for validation are e1 e5 e6 e7 e9 e11 e13 and e20 the r mae rmse and b of t a estimates across all sites over the year 2005 are 0 94 2 31 k 2 85 k and 0 03 which is consistent with the accuracy produced by zhu et al 2017c in the model calibration and validation under clear sky conditions only seven sites with the availability of both sm and ef measurements were adopted for illustration purpose it should also be noted that we adopted a s m and a e f to discriminate the optimal a calibrated by sm and ef objective function respectively table 2 presents the accuracy of sm and ef estimates as well as the values of a s m and a e f calibrated at each site using two different objective functions specifically the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function ranged from 332 k to 340 5 k with the largest value observed at site e9 the lowest value was achieved at five sites including e2 e7 e12 e20 and e22 in contrast the optimal a e f produced by ef objective function ranged from 332 k to 348 5 k with the largest value observed at site e7 the lowest value was also 332 k which was observed at sites e12 e13 e20 and e22 obviously the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function was more stable its variation range was 8 5 k which was only half of the variation range achieved by ef objective function the reasons leading to the difference of a value can be explained as follows in theory t smax denotes the radiative temperature of bare soil at the conditions of maximum water stress under this context incoming solar radiation has ability to dominate its seasonal variations therefore all factors influencing the incoming solar radiation such as latitude and altitude will result in the variations of a value however due to the similarity in latitude and altitude of the seven sites in this study domain the difference of optimal a s m or a e f calibrated by different sites is not mainly caused by these factors as bagley et al 2017 and williams and torn 2015 pointed out in principle the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is plant and soil dependent and no unique relationship exists a constant relationship between mtvdi versus sm and mtvdi versus ef was assumed in this study just as most previous tvx studies did which will certainly introduce huge uncertainty this explains why the optimal parameter is not stable but varies with the calibration sites in terms of the calibration accuracy negative correlation relationship between sm measurements and mtvdi was observed across all sites with r ranged from 0 29 to 0 76 in general the correlation of all sites was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level however the correlation of sites e7 e12 and e20 was obviously lower than the other sites it can be interpreted as the slight variations of field soil moisture measurements which is obvious at site e12 where the lowest correlation was obtained in fact there was no negative correlation observed between mtvdi and field sm measurements at site e12 in the year 2004 reported in the studies of sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a this partly explains why the lowest correlation was achieved at site e12 in this study in addition the accuracy of mtvdi estimates is also influenced by vegetation cover both sandholt et al 2002 and zhu et al 2017b suggested that the uncertainty of tvx method is larger for high ndvi values judging from the correlation better accuracy was acquired for the estimation of ef the average absolute r value of sm estimates across all sites was 0 52 while the average r value of ef estimates was 0 75 specifically the r values of ef estimates ranged from 0 47 to 0 96 with the largest value observed at site e12 the mae and rmse for the calibration of ef ranged from 0 112 to 0 153 and from 0 127 to 0 177 respectively both statistics indicate that the highest calibration accuracy was achieved at site e20 the average values of mae and rmse were 0 131 and 0 155 across all sites respectively to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method under clear sky conditions the optimal a value calibrated at one site were designed to estimate sm and ef for the remaining six sites as fig 5 shows similar accuracy of sm estimates was observed by different calibration sites the r ranged from 0 48 to 0 55 with an average of 0 51 it should be noted that table 2 shows that the lowest and highest calibration accuracy was observed at site e12 and e13 respectively however fig 5 indicates that the lowest and highest validation accuracy was produced by calibration site e13 and e12 respectively this contradiction is because the calibration site has not been incorporated into the validation samples this would to some extent compromise the accuracy of validation the site with highest calibration accuracy produced the lowest validation accuracy and vice versa for ef estimates the difference of accuracy produced by different calibration sites is not significant fig 6 the largest difference in r mae and rmse generated by different calibration sites was only 0 09 0 005 and 0 007 respectively in terms of r mae rmse the worst and best validation accuracy were achieved by site e20 and e2 similar to sm estimates the comparison between table 2 and fig 6 also indicates that the site with highest calibration accuracy produced the lowest validation accuracy and vice versa specifically the sites with the worst and best calibration accuracy were e2 and e20 respectively it is also noteworthy that although the optimal a value produced by different calibration sites varied significantly the difference observed in the accuracy validation is not significant accordingly the optimization scheme using only one site for calibration is applicable to the estimation of sm and ef over the whole study domain there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate sm and ef estimates retrieved from remote sensing observations in the above analysis in situ sm and ef measurements at site scale were utilized directly to validate the accuracy of the optimization method at 1 km spatial resolution as several studies have pointed out the mismatch in spatial scale and the heterogeneity of the surface should be considered in the evaluation batra et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 biggs et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to conduct a comparison with other tvx studies for better understanding the accuracy of our parameterization scheme however the performance of aforementioned method counts not only on the resolution of satellite observations but also the areas of the spatial domain long et al 2012 tomas et al 2014 in view of this only previous studies which applied the tvx method to this study region based on rs observations at 1 km spatial resolution were used in our comparison for sm estimates both empirical and theoretical approaches have been adopted by sun et al 2012 to investigate the applicability of the tvx method over the sgp region the r produced by their studies on 21 clear sky days was 0 53 and 0 59 respectively for the same 21 clear sky days the r produced by mtvdi in zhu et al 2017a was 0 58 fig 5 shows that the r produced by the optimization method ranged from 0 48 to 0 55 which is very similar to the accuracy of the above two studies as for the estimation of ef three previous studies were adopted here for comparison specifically the applicability of the empirical tvx method over the sgp region was demonstrated by jiang and islam 2003 using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr observations the rmse of ef estimates over six sites on two clear sky days was 0 12 and the r ranged from 0 55 to 0 63 in the study of yagci and santanello 2018 the rmse produced at two sites over the whole year 2011 was 0 147 and 0 177 respectively the r and mae achieved by the original tvx method on 16 clear sky days were 0 54 and 0 141 in wang et al 2006 although the accuracy has been improved significantly by the utilization of thermal inertia the comparison between fig 6 and the above three studies shows that although the accuracy of sm estimates generated by the proposed method is a little lower the accuracy of ef estimates has approached a level reasonable to those achieved in previous studies however the number of sm and ef estimates used for validation in fig 5 and fig 6 is much larger than those presented in the above five studies the influence of sample number on the accuracy should be considered when such comparison is conducted kaplan et al 2014 in order to further investigate whether the correlation relationship is statically significant the significance level of correlation coefficient between rs based estimates and in situ measurements is tested when the sample number is 300 and the significant level is set as 0 01 the threshold value of significance level is 0 148 which is much less than the correlation coefficient this study achieved in fig 5 and fig 6 consequently the significance test has further confirmed the validity and robustness of the optimization scheme due to the sparse distribution of ground based sm and ef observations in most areas of the world the focus of this study was to develop an in situ observation driven optimization scheme based on only one calibration site in order to investigate the performance of the optimization scheme based on more calibration sites here we adopted three sites for calibration and conducted the validation with the remaining four sites the values of optimal a s m and a e f are listed in table 3 and the overall accuracy of sm and ef estimates is presented in fig 7 specifically there are totally 35 combinations of different calibration sites compared with the results produced by using only one site for calibration table 2 the parameter a produced by more calibration sites was indeed more stable which was 332 k in most combinations however the comparison of fig 7 with fig 5 and fig 6 shows that the accuracy of ef and sm estimates has not been improved significantly specifically the difference in r for sm estimates was 0 01 and the difference in r mae and rmse for ef estimates was 0 02 0 03 and 0 03 respectively this has conformed once again that the accuracy of sm and ef estimates produced by one calibration site has reached an acceptable level 4 2 accuracy of optimization method on partially cloudy days both empirical and theoretical tvx framework requires a broad range of vegetation cover and soil moisture availability pixels for the construction of t s f c space as a result most previous tvx models only work well when the cloud cover of interested region is less than the threshold similarly the calibration of the optimization scheme was also performed under clear sky conditions however unlike previous empirical and theoretical framework at daily scale the optimization scheme was designed at seasonal scale once the optimal parameter a is calibrated on clear sky days the boundaries of the t s f c space at daily scale can be retrieved directly by using solar zenith as the inputs to further investigate the applicability of the proposed method under partially cloudy conditions the optimal a s m and a e f values calibrated from two objective functions at one site under clear sky conditions were directly applied to the estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions respectively the partially cloudy conditions defined here refers to the cloud cover over the study domain larger than 20 the results are presented in table 4 overall the sample number under partially cloudy conditions was larger than that under clear sky conditions as for the accuracy of sm estimates the correlation between sm measurements and mtvdi ranged from 0 40 to 0 46 with the average absolute value as 0 43 it is obvious that lower accuracy was observed at all sites under partially cloudy conditions by comparing with the accuracy produced under clear sky conditions fig 5 as a whole the average absolute value of r was 0 08 lower than that under clear sky conditions in terms of ef estimates the r between estimated and observed ef varied from 0 62 to 0 71 with an average value as 0 66 similarly compared with clear sky conditions a lower r value was also observed at all sites under partially cloudy conditions however a slight accuracy improvement was observed in the average value of mae and rmse which has been reduced by 0 006 and 0 005 respectively the relatively low accuracy of sm and ef estimates on partially cloudy days can be interpreted from two perspectives on the one hand the amplitude a was calibrated on clear sky days rather than on cloudy days which would to some extent compromise the accuracy of the sm and ef estimation under partially cloudy conditions on the other hand the t s gaps caused by large cloud cover bring in huge uncertainty for the retrieval of sm and ef leng et al 2017 nevertheless it should be noted that the accuracy achieved under partially cloudy days has reached an acceptable level in contrast with previous empirical and theoretical methods the optimization method calibrated under clear sky conditions hold true under partially cloudy conditions thus it can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide a quick and continuous monitoring of sm and ef the validity of the optimization method on both clear sky and cloudy days makes it possible for us to conduct a continuous monitoring of sm and ef the results at site scale are presented in fig 8 in general the estimates produced by the optimization method captured the seasonal variations of sm and ef at most sites which was particularly obvious for ef estimates specifically the r produced for sm estimates under all weather conditions ranged from 0 32 to 0 66 relatively poor correlation relationship was observed at three sites including e7 e12 and e20 the r of which was 0 33 0 32 and 0 32 respectively as we explained in section 4 1 this poor accuracy can be interpreted as the slight variations of field soil moisture measurements as noticed by sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a the above slight variations of sm can t be well captured by t s f c space the r reported by sun et al 2012 for these three sites on clear sky days was 0 64 0 00 and 0 30 and that reported in the study of zhu et al 2017a was 0 7 0 00 and 0 26 the value of zero means that no correlation was produced between sm measurements and mtvdi in contrast better agreement was achieved for ef estimates the r produced under all weather conditions ranged from 0 48 to 0 91 which was higher than the accuracy of sm estimates at most sites the mae and rmse ranged from 0 112 to 0 149 and from 0 132 to 0 172 respectively the values of b indicate that ef has been overestimated at all sites except site e7 the traditional empirical and theoretical tvx framework only works under clear sky conditions which makes it impossible for us to conduct a direct comparison with previous studies regarding to the estimation of sm and ef under all weather conditions however the comparison with table 2 shows that the accuracy of sm and ef estimates under all weather conditions is comparable to that achieved on clear sky days 4 3 accuracy of sm and ef coupled estimation eqs 13 and 14 show that the optimal parameter a s m or a e f can be calibrated from either sm or ef observations which makes it possible for us to retrieve the spatial patterns of sm and ef from a limited number of sites with in situ observations however the key assumption of coupled estimation is that the estimation of sm and ef within the tvx framework shares the same boundaries so that they can be interconverted into each other it means that the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function holds true for the estimation of ef and vice versa in order to test the validity of this assumption the optimal a s m and a e f values produced by sm objective function and ef objective function were used to estimate ef and sm respectively considering the land cover type of the seven calibration sites is very limited six more sites have been added here for validation purpose specifically sites e1 e5 e6 e10 and e11 with swats observations have been added for the validation of sm estimates and site e19 with ebbr observations has been added for the validation of ef estimates validation results are presented in table 5 for sm estimates the average value of r was 0 56 compared with sm estimates calibrated by sm observations in fig 5 there was a slight increase in the r value increase by 0 05 besides there is no significant difference between the sm estimates calibrated by sm observations and those calibrated by ef observations the maximum difference in r was observed at site e13 which was only 0 07 it should also be noted that the accuracy of sm estimates calibrated by the seven common sites was higher than that presented in fig 5 it means that the addition of site e19 has improved the validation accuracy of sm estimates in terms of ef estimates the average difference in r mae and rmse produced by two calibration objective functions was only 0 02 0 002 and 0 001 respectively the maximum difference in ef accuracy calibrated by two objective functions was observed at site e7 its difference in values of r mae and rmse were 0 03 0 006 and 0 006 respectively consequently the optimal a s m value calibrated by sm measurements is also applicable to ef estimates moreover the addition of five new sites with different land cover types demonstrates the feasibility of coupled estimation of sm and ef over heterogeneous surfaces the above comparison was conducted based on in situ observations to evaluate the difference in accuracy produced by two objective functions although the similarity in accuracy confirmed the feasibility of interconversion between sm and ef within the optimization framework a direct comparison of the estimates produced by these two objective functions is still necessary for better understanding their differences in order to make sure the number of estimates produced by these two objective functions is consistent only the estimates of the seven common sites were adopted for illustration good agreements were primarily observed in fig 9 for sm estimates the four statistical metrics of mtvdi produced by two objective functions across all sites were 0 86 0 05 0 07 and 0 07 respectively the mtvdi produced by sm objective was a little higher than those produced by ef objective in contrast the r mae rmse and b of ef produced by two objective functions were 0 98 0 02 0 03 and 0 02 respectively obviously the difference in ef estimates produced by these two objective functions was much smaller than that observed in sm estimates this difference can be explained as below fig 9 a shows that the mtvdi produced by ef objective function was overestimated at site e13 and underestimated at sites e2 and e7 the combination of eq 3 and eq 16 indicates that mtvdi was negatively correlated with a value because the a e f 332 k at site e13 was lower than a s m 335 k the decrease in a value would lead to an increase of mtvdi estimates on the contrary the a e f calibrated by sites e2 and e7 was higher than a s m which would certainly result in a decrease of mtvdi estimates the comparison between eq 3 and eq 5 shows that the estimates of ef was less sensitive to the value of a than sm estimates consequently the difference of ef estimates produced by two objective functions was not significant in fig 9 b although ef estimates were negatively correlated with mtvdi in summary all the above four statistics indicate that the optimal a s m or a e f produced by either of these two objective functions was applicable to the estimation of both sm and ef therefore the optimization method has achieved the coupled estimation of sm and ef 4 4 sensitivity analysis of the coupled model a close look at table 2 suggest the optimal a s m and a e f values produced by these two objective functions were 332 k at most sites this partly explains why the coupled estimation of sm and ef can be achieved by the optimization method however it still can t answer why the optimal parameter a s m and a e f calibrated by different sites produced similar accuracy of sm and ef estimates in order to further investigate the reasons behind a sensitivity analysis is presented in table 6 as presented in table 2 the optimal a values produced by different calibration sites ranged from 332 k to 349 k a step of 1 k within this range was employed to present the variations of a values the motivation of sensitivity analysis was to compare the accuracy of sm and ef estimates produced by different a values for the seven common sites for sm estimates the best accuracy was achieved when a was set as 332 k as a result the correlation between sm measurements and mtvdi decreased with the increase of a value in contrast the accuracy of ef estimates increased with the increase of a value by judging from the values of r however the other three statistics suggest that the optimal solution of a values were set as somewhere between 332 k and 336 k nevertheless different a values have slight influence on the accuracy of sm and ef estimates specifically the maximum difference in r for sm estimates was only 0 012 the maximum difference in r mae and rmse for ef estimates was 0 03 0 003 and 0 005 respectively the stability in accuracy explains why the coupled estimation of sm and ef can be achieved by the optimization method from another perspective in terms of the spatial distribution of sm and ef estimates the sensitivity analysis was conducted by comparing the mtvdi and ef estimates calibrated by the minimum and maximum a values according to table 2 the maximum and minimum a values were 332 k and 349 k respectively the maps of mtvdi and ef estimated by a values of 332 k and 349 k and their difference are presented in fig 10 in general mtvdi produced by a value of 332 k ranged from 0 11 to 0 82 with a mean of 0 47 fig 10 a and mtvdi produced by a value of 349 k varied from 0 07 to 0 55 with a mean of 0 31 fig 10 c due the negative correlation relationship between t smax j and mtvdi estimates the increase of a value from 332 k to 349 k led to 34 0 decrease of mtvdi estimates accordingly the difference in mtvdi estimates was observed with a negative value at each pixel ranged from 0 26 to 0 04 as for ef estimates ef estimates produced by a value of 332 k ranged from 0 27 to 0 96 with an average value of 0 62 fig 10 b and ef estimates ranged from 0 43 to 0 96 with an average value of 0 70 when a value was set as 349 k fig 10 d in contrast with sm estimates there is a positive correlation relationship between t smax j and ef estimates accordingly the increase of a value from 332 k to 349 k led to 12 9 increase of ef estimates as a whole the difference in ef estimates was observed with a positive value at each pixel ranging from 0 to 0 16 the sensitivity analysis indicates that sm estimates were more sensitive to the variations of a value than ef estimates the average absolute difference of mtvdi and ef estimates produced by different a values was 0 16 and 0 08 respectively another difference between sm and ef estimates in sensitivity analysis is that with the increase of a value significant underestimation of sm estimates was observed for the high values of sm fig 10 e on the contrary the overestimation of evaporative fraction estimates for the low values was observed with the increase of a value fig 10 f the reasons for this difference can be explained as follows compared with ef estimates the estimation of mtvdi from the t s f c space is more straightforward as a result the mtvdi estimates perform high correlation with t smax j and a values the high values of mtvdi estimates were more sensitive to the increase of a value than the low values in contrast the retrieval of ef from the tvx framework is much more complex than sm the influence of other parameters of priestley taylor equation has weaken the direct impact of t smax j on ef estimates due to the negative correction relationship between ef and mtvdi the low values of ef estimates were more sensitive to the increase of a value than the high values this has also partly explained why the scatterplots of mtvdi estimates produced by two objective functions in fig 9 were more discrete than ef estimates 5 summary and conclusion soil moisture and evaporative fraction play major roles in qualifying the water cycle behavior as well as controlling the energy balance processes the surface temperature vegetation index framework has been widely adopted to retrieve the spatial distribution of sm and ef over the past few decades however complex parameterization schemes and clear sky conditions are usually required to parameterize traditional tvx framework besides few literatures have documented whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework against this background the main motivation of this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef the essence of this new method is to optimize the theoretical dry edge of the t s f c space using either in situ sm or ef observations at the seasonal scale assuming that the seasonal variations of the maximum temperature of bare soil along the dry edge followed a cosine function of solar zenith we optimized the amplitude parameter a of this function under clear sky conditions results show that although the optimal a produced by different calibration sites varied significantly the difference observed in the accuracy of sm and ef estimates is not significant the accuracy of the optimization method produced using one site for calibration has reached a comparable level limited by its assumptions previous tvx framework is usually parameterized at daily scale and only works under clear sky conditions however the optimization scheme was designed at annual scale which makes it possible to retrieve daily dry edge directly from solar zenith regardless of cloud cover results show that the optimal a calibrated on clear sky days held true on partially cloudy days thus the optimization method is a suitable tool to provide a quick and continuous retrieval of sm and ef another notable characteristic of the optimization scheme is that it can be driven by either in situ sm or ef observations the optimal parameters calibrated by sm observations are applicable to the estimation of ef and vice versa consequently the optimization method has achieved the coupled estimation of sm and ef which means that sm and ef can be interconverted into each other over a large heterogeneous area the main disadvantage of the new method lies in its reliance on in situ sm or ef observations although the accuracy of one site calibration scheme has reached a comparable level the sparse distribution of ground based sm and ef observations still limits its worldwide application the combination of the optimization method with microwave based sm products holds great potential to overcome this disadvantage lu et al 2017 purdy et al 2018 in addition the optimal parameter produced by different calibration sites varies significantly although the accuracy of sm and ef estimates is not sensitive to the variations of a values the dependence of the optimization scheme on sites still brings in some uncertainties this dependence can be explained from two aspects firstly as bagley et al 2017 and williams and torn 2015 suggested the coupled relationship between sm and ef is influenced by land cover types and seasons secondly the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is also plant and soil dependent the focus of this study is to develop an observation driven optimization scheme for the coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef based on the assumptions of traditional tvx framework so the complex coupled relationship between sm and ef and the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is beyond our focus only a unique relationship was assumed just as most previous tvx studies did how to incorporate more physically based coupled relationships within the optimization framework is another direction in the future work credit authorship contribution

5004,numerous studies have focused on the retrieval of soil moisture sm and evaporative fraction ef based on the surface temperature vegetation index tvx framework however few literatures have investigated whether these two variables can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework besides most previous studies only demonstrated the application of the tvx framework under clear sky conditions the estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions is still a challenging task the main motivation for this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef specifically the optimization scheme was designed to construct the constraints and objective functions of the tvx framework at seasonal scale in situ sm and ef measurements were utilized to calibrate the theoretical boundaries of the tvx framework respectively the applicability of this new scheme was demonstrated over the southern great plains sgp of the united states of america in the year 2005 using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products the comparisons between present method and previous traditional tvx models indicate that the accuracy of the optimization scheme produced using only one site for calibration has reached a comparable level over the whole study domain however the new scheme holds unique advantages in simplicity and continuity it has not only circumvented the complex parameterization scheme of theoretical tvx framework but also achieved estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions the validation results of sm estimates show that the absolute value of correlation coefficient r under clear and partially cloudy sky conditions was 0 51 and 0 43 respectively the validation results of ef estimates indicate that the r and root mean square error rmse under clear sky conditions was 0 70 and 0 163 in contrast the r and rmse under partially cloudy conditions was 0 66 and 0 158 in addition the coupled estimation of sm and ef means that these two objective variables can be interconverted into each other within the optimization framework thus either sm or ef can be used to calibrate the theoretical dry edge that applies to the estimation of both variables keywords soil moisture evaporative fraction tvx method observation driven modis 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an essential state variable that controls water and energy balance processes between the land surface and atmosphere evaporative fraction is a flux based diagnostic that represents a ratio of latent heat flux to the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes in general sm and ef play major roles in qualifying the water cycle behavior as well as controlling the energy balance processes koster and mahanama 2012 tang and li 2017 sadeghi et al 2019 accurate spatial distributed estimation of daily sm and ef is important to a wide range of meteorology hydrology and ecology disciplines gentine et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 dong and crow 2018 however conventional in situ measurements of sm and ef are usually costly time consuming and available only at a handful of sparse field networks baldocchi et al 2001 abdolghafoorian et al 2017 kumar et al 2016 advances in satellite remote sensing rs technology numerous models have given rise to an alternative to characterize the sm and ef patterns at different spatiotemporal scales which is unachievable from sparse experiment networks xu et al 2011 schwingshackl et al 2017 yagci et al 2017 sheffield et al 2018 the electromagnetic spectrum involved in rs model to retrieve sm and ef related information is mainly distributed in optical thermal and microwave bands among them active and passive microwave remote sensing make it possible to produce sm map with varying spatiotemporal scales under all weather conditions merlin et al 2010 khodayar et al 2019 nevertheless the applicability of microwave technique is hampered by its low repeat intervals e g ers envisat for active sensors and coarse spatial resolution e g smos amsr e for passive sensors mallick et al 2009 merlin et al 2010 in contrast optical and thermal sensors can achieve finer spatial and temporal resolutions as a result various optical thermal based approaches have been proposed to estimate soil moisture status and disaggregate microwave based soil moisture information sun et al 2012 yang et al 2015a sadeghi et al 2017 zhu et al 2017a within this context numerous studies have demonstrated the emergence of temperature vegetation index tvx method has led to various parameterization schemes relating the surface temperature t s and fractional vegetation cover f c space to surface soil moisture sandholt et al 2002 mallick et al 2009 holzman et al 2014 tagesson et al 2018 according to this method a physically meaningful triangular or trapezoidal shape constituted by the scatterplots of t s and f c measurements would be constructed when a full range of soil moisture availability and vegetation cover conditions are available over the study domain within the triangular or trapezoidal space dry edge and wet edge form two physical limits of soil moisture availability the isopleths of soil moisture enclosed in such space can be estimated by various soil moisture index smi comprehensive reviews on the estimation of smi from the tvx method can be learned from carlson 2007 petropoulos et al 2009 2015 on contrary ef cannot be measured directly by remote sensing observations consequently a number of remote sensing based ef modeling schemes from simple empirical formulas to complex land surface process models have been proposed over past few decades norman et al 1995 bastiaanssen et al 1998 su 2002 nishida et al 2003 allen et al 2007 anderson et al 2007 mu et al 2007 bateni et al 2013 xu et al 2014 due to the strong feedbacks between the land surface and atmosphere it is well known that sm has significant potential in controlling the rate of both soil evaporation and plant transpiration detto et al 2006 garcía et al 2013 williams and torn 2015 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 on this premise the various smi retrieved from the t s f c space lays good foundation for the further development of rs based ef models accordingly a considerable amount of tvx models have been developed for the estimation of evapotranspiration et and ef moran et al 1994 stisen et al 2008 long and singh 2012 garcía et al 2014 minacapilli et al 2016 several review papers on rs based et models have summarized the applications of tvx method in ef estimates courault et al 2005 carlson 2007 li et al 2009 zhang et al 2016 chen and liu 2020 numerous literatures have documented the advantages of the tvx method and its applicability in the estimation of sm and ef has been proved in many different regions worldwide rahimzadeh bajgiran et al 2012 yang et al 2015b liu et al 2017 hu et al 2018 carlson and petropoulos 2019 however there are still several critical issues involved in the tvx framework 1 tvx method has been widely used to retrieve either sm or ef but few literatures have documented whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework 2 in situ sm and ef observations are usually involved in the evaluation of aforementioned models but a few number of studies have documented whether in situ observations can be incorporated into these models for calibration purposes and 3 clear sky days are usually required to accurately parameterize the dry edge and wet edge within the tvx framework the retrieval of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions is still a challenging task batra et al 2006 wang et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017a in recent years data mining technology has provided new opportunities for characterizing land surface water cycle and energy fluxes from rs observations abbaszadeh et al 2018 sanaa et al 2018 for example the study of farhadi et al 2016 suggests that coupled and continuous retrieval of surface variables is feasible by developing objective functions that link atmospheric forcing surface states and unknown parameters recent studies also demonstrate that the parameters optimized at multi site has well spatial extension for the estimation of regional objective variables xu et al 2018 yao et al 2019 in the tvx framework the pixels plotted in two dimensional space share common boundaries which provides a new perspective for calibrating these boundaries using a limited number of field measurements besides these boundaries are applicable for the estimation of both sm and ef it means that these boundaries can be retrieved from either sm or ef observations so sm and ef can be interconverted into each other inspired by this the main motivation for this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef it is speciallydesigned to answer the following two questions critical to the tvx method but have not been addressed in the literature 1 whether in situ sm or ef measurements can be used for the calibration of the tvx method 2 whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework and interconverted into each other 2 methodology 2 1 framework of the tvx method 2 1 1 parameterization of sm from the tvx framework following sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a a conceptual diagram of the trapezoidal tvx framework is presented in fig 1 it is enclosed by physically meaningful upper and lower boundaries the decreasing dry edge and horizontal wet edge denote the temperature under water stressed conditions and unlimited water access conditions respectively assuming the isopleths of soil moisture availability decreases linearly from the wet edge to the dry edge the soil moisture state involved in the t s f c space was retrieved by the temperate vegetation dryness index tvdi sandholt et al 2002 which was implemented as 1 tvdi i j t s i j t w j t max i j t w j 1 w i j w min i w max i w min i 2 t max i j t smax j f c i j t w j t smax j where w i j represents the volumetric sm of a given pixel i on day j w min i and w max i represent the lower and upper thresholds of w i j respectively t w j and t smax j represent the wet edge and the dry point of bare soil respectively t max i j denotes the observed maximum surface temperature along the dry edge for a given f c i j interval which is usually determined by the linear regression approach however observed dry edge often suffers from uncertainty sun et al 2012 and long and singh 2012 developed the theoretical solution of dry edge based on surface energy balance equations the calculation of unknown parameters was converted from t smax j and t w j to t smax j t cmax j and t w j meanwhile more complex parameterization process was involved in the determination of theoretical dry edge in order to reduce the determination of t cmax j the above tvdi method was modified by zhu et al 2017a to develop the following modified temperature vegetation dryness index mtvdi 3 mtvdi i j t smax i j t w j t smax j t w j 1 w i j w min i w max i w min i 4 t smax i j t s i j f c i j t cmax i j 1 f c i j t s i j f c i j t a i j 1 f c i j where t cmax i j and t smax i j represent the surface temperature of full cover vegetation and bare soil along the isopleths of soil moisture availability respectively t cmax i j is approximately replaced by the air temperature t a i j following the assumption that the air temperature within the canopy is in equilibrium with the radiative temperature of a full vegetated surface prihodko and goward 1997 nieto et al 2011 zhu et al 2013 2 1 2 parameterization of ef from the tvx framework based on the definition of ef and the extension of the priestley taylor equation priestley and taylor 1972 jiang and islam 1999 proposed that ef could be retrieved from the t s f c space as follows 5 ef i j i j δ i j δ i j γ 6 δ i j 0 611 17 502 240 97 e x p 17 502 t a i j t a i j 240 97 t a i j 240 97 2 where δ i j represents the gradient of the saturated vapor pressure to the air temperature t a i j and γ represents a psychrometric constant which was set as 0 06738 i j represents a complex priestley taylor parameter accounting for surface and canopy resistances it is noteworthy that although parameter i j looks similar to the α pt α pt 1 26 in the initial version of priestley taylor equation it encompasses a wide range of surface evaporative conditions and can take a range of values the maximum value of i j varies with different tvx studies jiang and islam 2001 agam et al 2010 following previous tvx studies applied to the same study region wang et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 yagci and santanello 2018 the maximum value of i j was set as 1 26 in this study numerous parameterization schemes have been proposed to retrieve i j from tvdi and mtvdi e g yang and shang 2013 yang et al 2015c minacapilli et al 2016 in this study i j is retrieved from mtvdi as below a modification of the parameterization scheme proposed by komatsu 2003 is used to retrieve i j from mtvdi for bare soil which is defined as 7 s i j 1 26 1 e x p mtvdi i j 1 following the assumption that the air temperature within the canopy is in equilibrium with the radiative temperature of a full vegetated surface the parameter i j for full cover vegetation c is always close to its maximum value c 1 26 jiang and islam 1999 2001 long et al 2012 consequently the parameter i j of a mixed pixel is interpolated linearly between c and s i j by using f c i j as the weight 8 i j s i j 1 f c i j c f c i j 2 2 optimization scheme of the tvx framework the combination of eq 3 to eq 8 shows that both mtvdi and ef can be expressed as follows 9 mtvdi i j ef i j f t s i j f c i j t a i j t smax j t w j obviously t smax j and t w j are the only two unknown parameters t w j is the surface temperature at the conditions of saturated water supply in previous studies three parameterization schemes have been developed for the retrieval of t w j zhu et al 2017b specifically the minimum t s over the study domain sandholt et al 2002 t s of some typical pixels such as water bodies sun et al 2012 and dense vegetation stands zhang et al 2008 and the observed near surface t a long and singh 2012 have all been taken as t w j following sandholt et al 2002 the minimum t s within the study region is set as t w j in this study in contrast the retrieval of t smax j is much more complex both empirical and theoretical methods have been developed for the determination of t smax j under clear sky conditions however both these two methods have significant disadvantages more specifically the empirical method based on linear regression suffers from huge uncertainty and subjectivity long and singh 2012 while the theoretical method determined by land surface energy balance equations requires complex parameterization process and the ancillary field measurements sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b in order to overcome the disadvantages of these two methods an optimization scheme was proposed in this study to parameterize the tvx framework fig 2 similar to previous studies of the tvx method the parameterization scheme used in this study was also developed using remote sensing observations under clear sky conditions following venturini et al 2008 the cloudy pixels over study domain less than 20 were marked as clear sky days in theory t smax j denotes the radiative temperature of bare soil at the conditions of maximum water stress the studies of sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017b also suggest that the seasonal variation of t smax j on clear sky days can be dominated by the incoming solar radiation according to the definition of incoming solar radiation the annual variations of t smax j was designed as a cosine function combined with t smax j observations and solar zenith angle θ j observations in the optimization method 10 t smax j a cos a θ j b the subscript j means that the inputs of optimization method are observed on day j assuming the phase variation curve of t smax j following the same trend of the observed t max j the parameters a and b were fitted by using t max j observed from land surface temperature product and θ j observed from geo location fields of the clear sky days fig 3 the initial fitting parameters are given in eq 11 which constitutes the observed dry edge of the entire region in order to produce the statistically optimal dry edge at a specific site eq 11 was further converted to eq 12 11 t max j 322 cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 12 t smax j a cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 the parameter a defining the amplitude of t smax j was determined using optimization algorithm which can be calibrated at a specific site using either in situ sm or ef observations specifically following our recent work zhu et al 2020a 2020b the objective functions driven by in situ observations are defined as below for soil moisture 13 a s m i m a x a b s cor j 1 n sm i j mtvdi i j for evaporative fraction 14 a e f i m i n j 1 n ef i j ef i j where n is the number of clear sky days mtvdi i j and sm i j are the estimated soil moisture index and measured soil moisture at site i on day j ef i j and ef i j denote the estimated and measured evaporative fraction respectively the purpose of eq 13 and eq 14 is to obtain the optimal parameter a s m i and a e f i when the absolute value of correlation coefficient reaches its highest and the value of mean absolute error approaches its smallest the top and bottom edges of these two objective functions are site dependent and not set in advance additionally these two objective functions share the same constraints which are defined as follows constraint 1 for all pixels over the study area 15 0 mtvdi i j 1 constraint 2 for t smax j in eq 10 16 t max j t smax j u or 17 322 cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 a cos 0 6086 θ j 0 2358 u where u represents the upper threshold of t smax j there are few literatures and methodologies to determine u at annual scale over this study domain the time series of t max j retrieved from land surface temperature product over this study domain indicates that the maximum value during the period from 2000 to 2017 is 344 48 k zhu et al 2020 accordingly u was set empirically as 345 k in this study and the variation step was also set as 0 5 k compared with t smax j the determination of t w j is much more straightforward it was implemented as 18 t w j m i n t min j t min j 19 t smin j 296 9 c o s 0 5507 θ j 0 2348 where t min j is the predicted t min j by the cosine function which is determined by daily minimum land surface temperature t min j retrieved from surface temperature product and θ j retrieved from geo location fields under clear sky conditions fig 3 the combination of eq 9 17 18 and 19 indicates that the amplitude a is the only unknown variable in the optimization scheme therefore the solution of a value in the proposed method is designed to figure out the optimal value within the allowable variation range that optimizes the objective functions at a given site it should be noted that the conventional sm and ef observations are only available at a handful of sparse sites to reduce the reliance of the proposed method on the number of sites the optimization method was designed by using only one site for calibration leaving the other sites for validation 2 3 error metrics four error metrics are used to validate the performance of the proposed method entekhabi et al 2010 which are defined as 20 r i 1 n p i p i q i q i i 1 n p i p i 2 i 1 n q i q i 2 21 mae 1 n i 1 n p i q i 22 rmse 1 n i 1 n p i q i 2 23 b p i q i 1 where p i represents rs based sm and ef estimates q i represents in situ measurements p i and q i represent the mean value of rs based estimates and in situ observations respectively three issues should be kept in mind when the accuracy is evaluated firstly mtvdi represents relative soil moisture rather than volumetric soil moisture content so only r was selected for sm accuracy assessment in contrast all the four metrics were suitable for the evaluation of ef accuracy secondly there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate the accuracy of sm and ef retrieved from rs observations due to the mismatch in spatial scale following most previous studies sm and ef observations obtained at site scale were used directly to validate the accuracy of rs based estimates at 1 km spatial resolution batra et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 long et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b thirdly in situ sm and ef observations also suffer from uncertainty to obtain robust statistical results quality control strategies for in situ measurements were included liu et al 2016 zhou and wang 2016 1 based on physical characteristics sm and ef measurements outside the range 0 to 1 were excluded 2 based on historical records bowen ratio the ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux exceeding 8 for ef measurements was removed and 3 outliers beyond three standard deviations 3σ were excluded 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the southern great plains sgp region is located in an area ranging in latitude between 34 30 n to 38 30 n and in longitude from 95 18 w to 99 30 w covering the southern part of kansas and most of oklahoma in the united states of america it is a relatively flat region characterized by tall and short grass mixed farming interrupted forest water bodies and a small fraction of urban area fig 4 among all vegetation cover types grassland is the dominant one in the area croplands are mainly scattered in the northwest and the center and some conifer forests can be found in the southeast the dominant soil types of this region are silt loam and sandy loam the annual precipitation is 500 mm which increases gradually from west to east the sgp region is the first field experiment network chosen by the atmospheric radiation measurement arm relatively dense flux network have been established over this region to monitor moisture momentum fluxes and surface heat consequently this region has been adopted by numerous studies to demonstrate the applicability of the tvx method wang et al 2006 sun et al 2012 zhu et al 2017b yagci and santanello 2018 this makes the sgp region an ideal domain for the comparison of different studies 3 2 field measurements three field datasets were adopted in this study 1 hourly sm observations from the soil water and temperature system swats instruments were involved in the calibration and validation of the sm optimization method 2 30 minute ef observations from the energy balance bowen ratio ebbr instruments were used for the calibration and validation of the ef optimization method and 3 30 minute near surface air temperature t a observations from the surface meteorological systems met were adopted for the validation of t a estimates the swats system provided volumetric sm measurements at eight different depths only the measurements at surface soil layer were used in this study ebbr system estimated the latent and sensible heat fluxes using the observations of soil energy storage net radiation vapor pressure and gradients of temperature ef observations were obtained using the ratio of latent heat flux to the sum of sensible and latent heat fluxes detailed descriptions about swats and ebbr measurements were available at the arm website https www arm gov the information of thirteen sites with sm of ef observations were summarized in table 1 and drawn in fig 4 among them twelve sites provide swats measurements and eight sites provide ebbr measurements the seven sites with the availability of both sm and ef observations were used to investigate whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework 3 3 modis data besides ground based measurements the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products were also used in this study specifically the modis products consisted of daily t s observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod11a1 16 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product at 1 km spatial resolution mod13a2 daily solar zenith θ observations at 1 km spatial resolution mod03 daily cloud observations mod06 l2 and daily atmosphere profile observations mod07 l2 at 5 km spatial resolution daily cloud and atmosphere profile observations were adopted for the estimation of near surface air temperature t a following zhu et al 2017c the 16 day ndvi was time series smoothed using the algorithm proposed by chen et al 2006 and interpolated to the daily value the squared relationship between fractional vegetation cover f c and ndvi proposed by gillies et al 1997 is implemented as 24 f c i j ndvi i j ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 2 where ndvi i j is the ndvi value of pixel i on day j ndvi min and ndvi max represent the minimum and maximum ndvi values over the sgp region respectively following the study of zhu et al 2017a the full vegetated surface is defined as ndvi max 0 94 and bare soil is recognized as ndvi min 0 05 4 results and discussions 4 1 accuracy of optimization method on clear sky days following batra et al 2006 and venturini et al 2008 an image was marked as clear sky days when the cloudy pixels over the whole study domain is less than 20 accordingly the total number of clear sky days in 2005 is 86 however due to the deficiency of in situ measurements and rs observations at site scale the sample number used for calibration in eq 13 and eq 14 is around 60 at most sites in general the samples within each specific site are distributed evenly throughout the year which enables us to capture the seasonal variations of the dry and wet edges as for the accuracy of t a estimates the met sites used for validation are e1 e5 e6 e7 e9 e11 e13 and e20 the r mae rmse and b of t a estimates across all sites over the year 2005 are 0 94 2 31 k 2 85 k and 0 03 which is consistent with the accuracy produced by zhu et al 2017c in the model calibration and validation under clear sky conditions only seven sites with the availability of both sm and ef measurements were adopted for illustration purpose it should also be noted that we adopted a s m and a e f to discriminate the optimal a calibrated by sm and ef objective function respectively table 2 presents the accuracy of sm and ef estimates as well as the values of a s m and a e f calibrated at each site using two different objective functions specifically the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function ranged from 332 k to 340 5 k with the largest value observed at site e9 the lowest value was achieved at five sites including e2 e7 e12 e20 and e22 in contrast the optimal a e f produced by ef objective function ranged from 332 k to 348 5 k with the largest value observed at site e7 the lowest value was also 332 k which was observed at sites e12 e13 e20 and e22 obviously the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function was more stable its variation range was 8 5 k which was only half of the variation range achieved by ef objective function the reasons leading to the difference of a value can be explained as follows in theory t smax denotes the radiative temperature of bare soil at the conditions of maximum water stress under this context incoming solar radiation has ability to dominate its seasonal variations therefore all factors influencing the incoming solar radiation such as latitude and altitude will result in the variations of a value however due to the similarity in latitude and altitude of the seven sites in this study domain the difference of optimal a s m or a e f calibrated by different sites is not mainly caused by these factors as bagley et al 2017 and williams and torn 2015 pointed out in principle the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is plant and soil dependent and no unique relationship exists a constant relationship between mtvdi versus sm and mtvdi versus ef was assumed in this study just as most previous tvx studies did which will certainly introduce huge uncertainty this explains why the optimal parameter is not stable but varies with the calibration sites in terms of the calibration accuracy negative correlation relationship between sm measurements and mtvdi was observed across all sites with r ranged from 0 29 to 0 76 in general the correlation of all sites was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level however the correlation of sites e7 e12 and e20 was obviously lower than the other sites it can be interpreted as the slight variations of field soil moisture measurements which is obvious at site e12 where the lowest correlation was obtained in fact there was no negative correlation observed between mtvdi and field sm measurements at site e12 in the year 2004 reported in the studies of sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a this partly explains why the lowest correlation was achieved at site e12 in this study in addition the accuracy of mtvdi estimates is also influenced by vegetation cover both sandholt et al 2002 and zhu et al 2017b suggested that the uncertainty of tvx method is larger for high ndvi values judging from the correlation better accuracy was acquired for the estimation of ef the average absolute r value of sm estimates across all sites was 0 52 while the average r value of ef estimates was 0 75 specifically the r values of ef estimates ranged from 0 47 to 0 96 with the largest value observed at site e12 the mae and rmse for the calibration of ef ranged from 0 112 to 0 153 and from 0 127 to 0 177 respectively both statistics indicate that the highest calibration accuracy was achieved at site e20 the average values of mae and rmse were 0 131 and 0 155 across all sites respectively to further demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method under clear sky conditions the optimal a value calibrated at one site were designed to estimate sm and ef for the remaining six sites as fig 5 shows similar accuracy of sm estimates was observed by different calibration sites the r ranged from 0 48 to 0 55 with an average of 0 51 it should be noted that table 2 shows that the lowest and highest calibration accuracy was observed at site e12 and e13 respectively however fig 5 indicates that the lowest and highest validation accuracy was produced by calibration site e13 and e12 respectively this contradiction is because the calibration site has not been incorporated into the validation samples this would to some extent compromise the accuracy of validation the site with highest calibration accuracy produced the lowest validation accuracy and vice versa for ef estimates the difference of accuracy produced by different calibration sites is not significant fig 6 the largest difference in r mae and rmse generated by different calibration sites was only 0 09 0 005 and 0 007 respectively in terms of r mae rmse the worst and best validation accuracy were achieved by site e20 and e2 similar to sm estimates the comparison between table 2 and fig 6 also indicates that the site with highest calibration accuracy produced the lowest validation accuracy and vice versa specifically the sites with the worst and best calibration accuracy were e2 and e20 respectively it is also noteworthy that although the optimal a value produced by different calibration sites varied significantly the difference observed in the accuracy validation is not significant accordingly the optimization scheme using only one site for calibration is applicable to the estimation of sm and ef over the whole study domain there are no generally accepted methodologies to evaluate sm and ef estimates retrieved from remote sensing observations in the above analysis in situ sm and ef measurements at site scale were utilized directly to validate the accuracy of the optimization method at 1 km spatial resolution as several studies have pointed out the mismatch in spatial scale and the heterogeneity of the surface should be considered in the evaluation batra et al 2006 venturini et al 2008 biggs et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to conduct a comparison with other tvx studies for better understanding the accuracy of our parameterization scheme however the performance of aforementioned method counts not only on the resolution of satellite observations but also the areas of the spatial domain long et al 2012 tomas et al 2014 in view of this only previous studies which applied the tvx method to this study region based on rs observations at 1 km spatial resolution were used in our comparison for sm estimates both empirical and theoretical approaches have been adopted by sun et al 2012 to investigate the applicability of the tvx method over the sgp region the r produced by their studies on 21 clear sky days was 0 53 and 0 59 respectively for the same 21 clear sky days the r produced by mtvdi in zhu et al 2017a was 0 58 fig 5 shows that the r produced by the optimization method ranged from 0 48 to 0 55 which is very similar to the accuracy of the above two studies as for the estimation of ef three previous studies were adopted here for comparison specifically the applicability of the empirical tvx method over the sgp region was demonstrated by jiang and islam 2003 using the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr observations the rmse of ef estimates over six sites on two clear sky days was 0 12 and the r ranged from 0 55 to 0 63 in the study of yagci and santanello 2018 the rmse produced at two sites over the whole year 2011 was 0 147 and 0 177 respectively the r and mae achieved by the original tvx method on 16 clear sky days were 0 54 and 0 141 in wang et al 2006 although the accuracy has been improved significantly by the utilization of thermal inertia the comparison between fig 6 and the above three studies shows that although the accuracy of sm estimates generated by the proposed method is a little lower the accuracy of ef estimates has approached a level reasonable to those achieved in previous studies however the number of sm and ef estimates used for validation in fig 5 and fig 6 is much larger than those presented in the above five studies the influence of sample number on the accuracy should be considered when such comparison is conducted kaplan et al 2014 in order to further investigate whether the correlation relationship is statically significant the significance level of correlation coefficient between rs based estimates and in situ measurements is tested when the sample number is 300 and the significant level is set as 0 01 the threshold value of significance level is 0 148 which is much less than the correlation coefficient this study achieved in fig 5 and fig 6 consequently the significance test has further confirmed the validity and robustness of the optimization scheme due to the sparse distribution of ground based sm and ef observations in most areas of the world the focus of this study was to develop an in situ observation driven optimization scheme based on only one calibration site in order to investigate the performance of the optimization scheme based on more calibration sites here we adopted three sites for calibration and conducted the validation with the remaining four sites the values of optimal a s m and a e f are listed in table 3 and the overall accuracy of sm and ef estimates is presented in fig 7 specifically there are totally 35 combinations of different calibration sites compared with the results produced by using only one site for calibration table 2 the parameter a produced by more calibration sites was indeed more stable which was 332 k in most combinations however the comparison of fig 7 with fig 5 and fig 6 shows that the accuracy of ef and sm estimates has not been improved significantly specifically the difference in r for sm estimates was 0 01 and the difference in r mae and rmse for ef estimates was 0 02 0 03 and 0 03 respectively this has conformed once again that the accuracy of sm and ef estimates produced by one calibration site has reached an acceptable level 4 2 accuracy of optimization method on partially cloudy days both empirical and theoretical tvx framework requires a broad range of vegetation cover and soil moisture availability pixels for the construction of t s f c space as a result most previous tvx models only work well when the cloud cover of interested region is less than the threshold similarly the calibration of the optimization scheme was also performed under clear sky conditions however unlike previous empirical and theoretical framework at daily scale the optimization scheme was designed at seasonal scale once the optimal parameter a is calibrated on clear sky days the boundaries of the t s f c space at daily scale can be retrieved directly by using solar zenith as the inputs to further investigate the applicability of the proposed method under partially cloudy conditions the optimal a s m and a e f values calibrated from two objective functions at one site under clear sky conditions were directly applied to the estimation of sm and ef under partially cloudy conditions respectively the partially cloudy conditions defined here refers to the cloud cover over the study domain larger than 20 the results are presented in table 4 overall the sample number under partially cloudy conditions was larger than that under clear sky conditions as for the accuracy of sm estimates the correlation between sm measurements and mtvdi ranged from 0 40 to 0 46 with the average absolute value as 0 43 it is obvious that lower accuracy was observed at all sites under partially cloudy conditions by comparing with the accuracy produced under clear sky conditions fig 5 as a whole the average absolute value of r was 0 08 lower than that under clear sky conditions in terms of ef estimates the r between estimated and observed ef varied from 0 62 to 0 71 with an average value as 0 66 similarly compared with clear sky conditions a lower r value was also observed at all sites under partially cloudy conditions however a slight accuracy improvement was observed in the average value of mae and rmse which has been reduced by 0 006 and 0 005 respectively the relatively low accuracy of sm and ef estimates on partially cloudy days can be interpreted from two perspectives on the one hand the amplitude a was calibrated on clear sky days rather than on cloudy days which would to some extent compromise the accuracy of the sm and ef estimation under partially cloudy conditions on the other hand the t s gaps caused by large cloud cover bring in huge uncertainty for the retrieval of sm and ef leng et al 2017 nevertheless it should be noted that the accuracy achieved under partially cloudy days has reached an acceptable level in contrast with previous empirical and theoretical methods the optimization method calibrated under clear sky conditions hold true under partially cloudy conditions thus it can be regarded as a suitable tool to provide a quick and continuous monitoring of sm and ef the validity of the optimization method on both clear sky and cloudy days makes it possible for us to conduct a continuous monitoring of sm and ef the results at site scale are presented in fig 8 in general the estimates produced by the optimization method captured the seasonal variations of sm and ef at most sites which was particularly obvious for ef estimates specifically the r produced for sm estimates under all weather conditions ranged from 0 32 to 0 66 relatively poor correlation relationship was observed at three sites including e7 e12 and e20 the r of which was 0 33 0 32 and 0 32 respectively as we explained in section 4 1 this poor accuracy can be interpreted as the slight variations of field soil moisture measurements as noticed by sun et al 2012 and zhu et al 2017a the above slight variations of sm can t be well captured by t s f c space the r reported by sun et al 2012 for these three sites on clear sky days was 0 64 0 00 and 0 30 and that reported in the study of zhu et al 2017a was 0 7 0 00 and 0 26 the value of zero means that no correlation was produced between sm measurements and mtvdi in contrast better agreement was achieved for ef estimates the r produced under all weather conditions ranged from 0 48 to 0 91 which was higher than the accuracy of sm estimates at most sites the mae and rmse ranged from 0 112 to 0 149 and from 0 132 to 0 172 respectively the values of b indicate that ef has been overestimated at all sites except site e7 the traditional empirical and theoretical tvx framework only works under clear sky conditions which makes it impossible for us to conduct a direct comparison with previous studies regarding to the estimation of sm and ef under all weather conditions however the comparison with table 2 shows that the accuracy of sm and ef estimates under all weather conditions is comparable to that achieved on clear sky days 4 3 accuracy of sm and ef coupled estimation eqs 13 and 14 show that the optimal parameter a s m or a e f can be calibrated from either sm or ef observations which makes it possible for us to retrieve the spatial patterns of sm and ef from a limited number of sites with in situ observations however the key assumption of coupled estimation is that the estimation of sm and ef within the tvx framework shares the same boundaries so that they can be interconverted into each other it means that the optimal a s m produced by sm objective function holds true for the estimation of ef and vice versa in order to test the validity of this assumption the optimal a s m and a e f values produced by sm objective function and ef objective function were used to estimate ef and sm respectively considering the land cover type of the seven calibration sites is very limited six more sites have been added here for validation purpose specifically sites e1 e5 e6 e10 and e11 with swats observations have been added for the validation of sm estimates and site e19 with ebbr observations has been added for the validation of ef estimates validation results are presented in table 5 for sm estimates the average value of r was 0 56 compared with sm estimates calibrated by sm observations in fig 5 there was a slight increase in the r value increase by 0 05 besides there is no significant difference between the sm estimates calibrated by sm observations and those calibrated by ef observations the maximum difference in r was observed at site e13 which was only 0 07 it should also be noted that the accuracy of sm estimates calibrated by the seven common sites was higher than that presented in fig 5 it means that the addition of site e19 has improved the validation accuracy of sm estimates in terms of ef estimates the average difference in r mae and rmse produced by two calibration objective functions was only 0 02 0 002 and 0 001 respectively the maximum difference in ef accuracy calibrated by two objective functions was observed at site e7 its difference in values of r mae and rmse were 0 03 0 006 and 0 006 respectively consequently the optimal a s m value calibrated by sm measurements is also applicable to ef estimates moreover the addition of five new sites with different land cover types demonstrates the feasibility of coupled estimation of sm and ef over heterogeneous surfaces the above comparison was conducted based on in situ observations to evaluate the difference in accuracy produced by two objective functions although the similarity in accuracy confirmed the feasibility of interconversion between sm and ef within the optimization framework a direct comparison of the estimates produced by these two objective functions is still necessary for better understanding their differences in order to make sure the number of estimates produced by these two objective functions is consistent only the estimates of the seven common sites were adopted for illustration good agreements were primarily observed in fig 9 for sm estimates the four statistical metrics of mtvdi produced by two objective functions across all sites were 0 86 0 05 0 07 and 0 07 respectively the mtvdi produced by sm objective was a little higher than those produced by ef objective in contrast the r mae rmse and b of ef produced by two objective functions were 0 98 0 02 0 03 and 0 02 respectively obviously the difference in ef estimates produced by these two objective functions was much smaller than that observed in sm estimates this difference can be explained as below fig 9 a shows that the mtvdi produced by ef objective function was overestimated at site e13 and underestimated at sites e2 and e7 the combination of eq 3 and eq 16 indicates that mtvdi was negatively correlated with a value because the a e f 332 k at site e13 was lower than a s m 335 k the decrease in a value would lead to an increase of mtvdi estimates on the contrary the a e f calibrated by sites e2 and e7 was higher than a s m which would certainly result in a decrease of mtvdi estimates the comparison between eq 3 and eq 5 shows that the estimates of ef was less sensitive to the value of a than sm estimates consequently the difference of ef estimates produced by two objective functions was not significant in fig 9 b although ef estimates were negatively correlated with mtvdi in summary all the above four statistics indicate that the optimal a s m or a e f produced by either of these two objective functions was applicable to the estimation of both sm and ef therefore the optimization method has achieved the coupled estimation of sm and ef 4 4 sensitivity analysis of the coupled model a close look at table 2 suggest the optimal a s m and a e f values produced by these two objective functions were 332 k at most sites this partly explains why the coupled estimation of sm and ef can be achieved by the optimization method however it still can t answer why the optimal parameter a s m and a e f calibrated by different sites produced similar accuracy of sm and ef estimates in order to further investigate the reasons behind a sensitivity analysis is presented in table 6 as presented in table 2 the optimal a values produced by different calibration sites ranged from 332 k to 349 k a step of 1 k within this range was employed to present the variations of a values the motivation of sensitivity analysis was to compare the accuracy of sm and ef estimates produced by different a values for the seven common sites for sm estimates the best accuracy was achieved when a was set as 332 k as a result the correlation between sm measurements and mtvdi decreased with the increase of a value in contrast the accuracy of ef estimates increased with the increase of a value by judging from the values of r however the other three statistics suggest that the optimal solution of a values were set as somewhere between 332 k and 336 k nevertheless different a values have slight influence on the accuracy of sm and ef estimates specifically the maximum difference in r for sm estimates was only 0 012 the maximum difference in r mae and rmse for ef estimates was 0 03 0 003 and 0 005 respectively the stability in accuracy explains why the coupled estimation of sm and ef can be achieved by the optimization method from another perspective in terms of the spatial distribution of sm and ef estimates the sensitivity analysis was conducted by comparing the mtvdi and ef estimates calibrated by the minimum and maximum a values according to table 2 the maximum and minimum a values were 332 k and 349 k respectively the maps of mtvdi and ef estimated by a values of 332 k and 349 k and their difference are presented in fig 10 in general mtvdi produced by a value of 332 k ranged from 0 11 to 0 82 with a mean of 0 47 fig 10 a and mtvdi produced by a value of 349 k varied from 0 07 to 0 55 with a mean of 0 31 fig 10 c due the negative correlation relationship between t smax j and mtvdi estimates the increase of a value from 332 k to 349 k led to 34 0 decrease of mtvdi estimates accordingly the difference in mtvdi estimates was observed with a negative value at each pixel ranged from 0 26 to 0 04 as for ef estimates ef estimates produced by a value of 332 k ranged from 0 27 to 0 96 with an average value of 0 62 fig 10 b and ef estimates ranged from 0 43 to 0 96 with an average value of 0 70 when a value was set as 349 k fig 10 d in contrast with sm estimates there is a positive correlation relationship between t smax j and ef estimates accordingly the increase of a value from 332 k to 349 k led to 12 9 increase of ef estimates as a whole the difference in ef estimates was observed with a positive value at each pixel ranging from 0 to 0 16 the sensitivity analysis indicates that sm estimates were more sensitive to the variations of a value than ef estimates the average absolute difference of mtvdi and ef estimates produced by different a values was 0 16 and 0 08 respectively another difference between sm and ef estimates in sensitivity analysis is that with the increase of a value significant underestimation of sm estimates was observed for the high values of sm fig 10 e on the contrary the overestimation of evaporative fraction estimates for the low values was observed with the increase of a value fig 10 f the reasons for this difference can be explained as follows compared with ef estimates the estimation of mtvdi from the t s f c space is more straightforward as a result the mtvdi estimates perform high correlation with t smax j and a values the high values of mtvdi estimates were more sensitive to the increase of a value than the low values in contrast the retrieval of ef from the tvx framework is much more complex than sm the influence of other parameters of priestley taylor equation has weaken the direct impact of t smax j on ef estimates due to the negative correction relationship between ef and mtvdi the low values of ef estimates were more sensitive to the increase of a value than the high values this has also partly explained why the scatterplots of mtvdi estimates produced by two objective functions in fig 9 were more discrete than ef estimates 5 summary and conclusion soil moisture and evaporative fraction play major roles in qualifying the water cycle behavior as well as controlling the energy balance processes the surface temperature vegetation index framework has been widely adopted to retrieve the spatial distribution of sm and ef over the past few decades however complex parameterization schemes and clear sky conditions are usually required to parameterize traditional tvx framework besides few literatures have documented whether sm and ef can be retrieved simultaneously under the same tvx framework against this background the main motivation of this study is to develop an observation driven optimization framework combined with tvx method for coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef the essence of this new method is to optimize the theoretical dry edge of the t s f c space using either in situ sm or ef observations at the seasonal scale assuming that the seasonal variations of the maximum temperature of bare soil along the dry edge followed a cosine function of solar zenith we optimized the amplitude parameter a of this function under clear sky conditions results show that although the optimal a produced by different calibration sites varied significantly the difference observed in the accuracy of sm and ef estimates is not significant the accuracy of the optimization method produced using one site for calibration has reached a comparable level limited by its assumptions previous tvx framework is usually parameterized at daily scale and only works under clear sky conditions however the optimization scheme was designed at annual scale which makes it possible to retrieve daily dry edge directly from solar zenith regardless of cloud cover results show that the optimal a calibrated on clear sky days held true on partially cloudy days thus the optimization method is a suitable tool to provide a quick and continuous retrieval of sm and ef another notable characteristic of the optimization scheme is that it can be driven by either in situ sm or ef observations the optimal parameters calibrated by sm observations are applicable to the estimation of ef and vice versa consequently the optimization method has achieved the coupled estimation of sm and ef which means that sm and ef can be interconverted into each other over a large heterogeneous area the main disadvantage of the new method lies in its reliance on in situ sm or ef observations although the accuracy of one site calibration scheme has reached a comparable level the sparse distribution of ground based sm and ef observations still limits its worldwide application the combination of the optimization method with microwave based sm products holds great potential to overcome this disadvantage lu et al 2017 purdy et al 2018 in addition the optimal parameter produced by different calibration sites varies significantly although the accuracy of sm and ef estimates is not sensitive to the variations of a values the dependence of the optimization scheme on sites still brings in some uncertainties this dependence can be explained from two aspects firstly as bagley et al 2017 and williams and torn 2015 suggested the coupled relationship between sm and ef is influenced by land cover types and seasons secondly the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is also plant and soil dependent the focus of this study is to develop an observation driven optimization scheme for the coupled and continuous estimation of sm and ef based on the assumptions of traditional tvx framework so the complex coupled relationship between sm and ef and the relationship between t s f c space and ef and sm is beyond our focus only a unique relationship was assumed just as most previous tvx studies did how to incorporate more physically based coupled relationships within the optimization framework is another direction in the future work credit authorship contribution
