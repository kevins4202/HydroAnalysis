3030,in recent decades frequent compound dry and hot events cdhes have posed a great threat to humans and the ecological environment especially in inner mongolia which has typical arid and semi arid characteristics therefore while exploring the characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of the cdhes in inner mongolia and elucidating their teleconnections with large scale circulation indexes it can not only provide useful enlightenment for ecological protection but also provide more detailed information for understanding the corresponding details of cdhes with large scale circulation indexes in this study monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia for each summer from 1981 to 2020 were used to establish a standardised dry and hot index sdhi characterising the severity of extreme compound events of drought and high temperature in inner mongolia this data was also used to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of such compound events over the past 40 years thereafter pearson s correlation stepwise multiple regression models and multivariate wavelet analysis methods were used to assess the relationship between the atmospheric circulation index and sdhi in terms of linear non linear and different combinations of the four large scale circulation indexes the results show that sdhi performs well in the assessment of cdhes in inner mongolia and shows great similarities with historical records the overall trend of cdhes in inner mongolia over the past 40 years has intensified over time spatially abnormal and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia before the 21st century and the frequency of occurrence was higher in the eastern region than in the western region furthermore the severity of cdhes has increased significantly since the 21st century with severe and extreme dry and hot events occurring more frequently in the western region than in the eastern region the results of the correlation analysis show that among the four large scale circulation indexes the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo has the greatest influence on the cdhes in inner mongolia when it is positive with the highest significance and when the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and north atlantic oscillation nao show negative phases they are more likely to cause dry and hot events in inner mongolia further where the number of stations negatively influenced by nao is higher the effect of el niño southern oscillation enso on dry and hot events is usually insignificant partial wavelet coherence pwc analysis suggests that the independent effects of circulation factors may be weaker but appear to be stronger due to their interdependence with other circulation patterns finally the multiple wavelet coherence mwc results show that the changes in sdhi values can be best explained by a combination of two or more factors keywords compound event climate change dry and hot teleconnection inner mongolia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of global warming the current global average surface temperature is approximately 1 c higher than that during the industrialisation era leading to frequent extreme climate events among which heat waves and drought events have already had a serious impact on society and human life ye et al 2019 joshi et al 2020 leng et al 2020 yu and zhai 2020 xu et al 2021 it has been shown that the frequency and severity of global terrestrial droughts and high temperatures are increasing in addition the simultaneous occurrence of multiple compound effects has been observed in several regions of the globe for example both european and russian heat wave events in 2003 were accompanied by drought events horton et al 2016 hao et al 2018a which are compound dry and hot events the probability of compound extreme events has likely increased due to human induced climate change concurrent heat waves and droughts have become more frequent over the last century and this trend will continue with greater global warming high confidence zhou 2021 because the impact of compound dry and hot events is much larger than that of individual extreme events an integrated analysis of the characteristics of compound dry and hot events can provide more impactful information for mitigating global warming and maintaining ecological stability the definition of a compound event extreme given in the special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex is as follows seneviratne 2012 1 two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously 2 the occurrence of compounded extreme events that amplifies the impact of a single event 3 not an extreme event in itself but it is the combination that has an extreme impact in this way compound events often involve multiple variables furthermore because of the joint characterisation of these variables occurring at the same time compound dry and hot events usually exhibit scarce precipitation and abnormally high temperatures initial studies on compound dry and hot events have emerged globally in the past zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao et al 2018b and monitoring and forecasting systems for information on hot and dry conditions have been developed globally based on a variety of research concepts for example modelling using bivariate distributions of drought precipitation and high temperature temperature has been used to describe the occurrence of compound dry and hot events cong and brady 2012 zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 quantified the occurrence of compound dry and hot events on a global scale by establishing a joint distribution function based on copula s principle and found that when summer rainfall and temperature are negatively correlated it results in a compound event wu et al 2019 explored the historical characteristics of compound extreme events under four combinations including dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold based on monthly precipitation and temperature observations in summer and winter in china from 1961 to 2014 in terms of indices hao et al 2018c hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b established standardised compound event indicators scei and a standardised dry and hot index sdhi based on the meta gaussian model and the concept of standardised precipitation index spi respectively these indicators were used to characterise the severity and spatial distribution of compound dry and hot events in southern africa and globally although there are studies analysing the characteristics and spatial distribution by formulating indicators there is still a lack of unified systems and indicators for the characterisation of cdhes furthermore these studies focus on large scale ranges or coastal areas leading to a lack of detailed studies of cdhes in arid and semi arid areas therefore in this study we used the sdhi to analyse the characteristics of compound dry and hot events in the inner mongolia autonomous region which is a typical arid and semi arid region as the impact of compound dry and hot events becomes greater it is crucial to understand the driving factors behind them based on the analysis of the characteristics of their spatiotemporal evolution to mitigate the adverse effects of dry and hot events alexander 2016 land atmosphere interactions feedbacks play an important role in the onset and evolution of the global warming of seasonal climates déry and wood 2005 trenberth and shea 2005 it has been shown that the variability of extreme climate events in the chinese region is closely related to the large scale circulation indexes tong et al 2006 feng et al 2011 of el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo these and other natural circulation patterns or large scale circulation indexes are important drivers of precipitation and high temperature variability in different regions of china sun 2012 liu et al 2014 ouyang et al 2014 luo and lau 2019 moreover these atmospheric circulation patterns on inter annual time scales influence precipitation and temperature in several regions especially in tropical and subtropical regions baxter and nigam 2015 however the mechanisms by which these large scale circulation indexes cause compound extreme events especially cdhes are unknown and the developed and improved wavelet transform analysis is considered an effective tool for probe multi scale responses torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 in this study we chose multiple wavelet coherence mwc and partial wavelet coherence pwc methods to explore the distant relations between four large scale circulation indexes and sdhi the mwc was assigned to find the wavelet coherence for multiple independent time series on a dependent time series while the pwc was used to find the wavelet coherence between the two time series after removing the effect of its common dependence both methods show sufficient reliability in detecting periodic changes in geophysical signals along a sequence of time rigozo et al 2008 tan et al 2016 song et al 2020 moreover to further validate the influence of each large scale circulation pattern on sdhi changes a multivariate stepwise regression model was chosen to calculate the contribution of the large scale circulation indexes and quantify the distant correlation to obtain clearer and more credible results since the late 1990 s droughts and high temperatures have become more frequent severe widespread and longer lasting throughout china especially in the northern regions inner mongolia is a vast region with a complex and diverse climate and topography it is a transitional zone between the arid semi arid inland region of the northwest influenced by the asian monsoon and the humid semi humid region of the southeast coast hu et al 2015 it is both an important ecological barrier in the northern border areas of china and a sensitive area affected by global warming currently there are many studies on single extreme climate events in inner mongolia wang et al 2019 guo et al 2020a li et al 2020a b however studies on the characteristics of compound extreme weather events and the remote correlation with large scale circulation indexes are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to construct a standardised dry heat index sdhi and analyse the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia and 2 explore the effects of four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo on cdhes using mwc pwc and multivariate stepwise regression models the results of this study can provide important information for understanding the climate change situation and achieving sustainable development in the region 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the inner mongolia autonomous region is located in the northern border area of china between 7 12 126 04 e and 37 24 53 23 n the total area of the region is 118 3 km2 which makes it the third largest province in china accounting for 12 3 of china s total land area it has a predominantly temperate continental monsoon climate with obvious regional differences an average annual temperature of 1 15 c and an average annual precipitation of 50 500 mm precipitation in the region decreases from northeast to southwest and shows an obvious gradient distribution pattern whereas the annual average temperature increases from northeast to southwest influenced by south easterly winds in the summer it easily forms a hot and rainy climate however in winter the climate of the region becomes dry and cold again due to the influence of the siberian mongolian high pressure wang et al 2019 the main types of landforms in inner mongolia include mountains hills and plateaus the average elevation is 1000 m and the terrain clearly undulates with a downward sloping trend from south to north and from west to east fig 1 topographic conditions indirectly affect the development and distribution of vegetation by influencing the redistribution of atmospheric circulation and surface water and heat conditions ultimately forming unique natural environmental conditions and vegetation 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological data in this study monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia during the summers of 1981 2020 were selected these were obtained from the meteorological information center of the inner mongolia meteorological bureau as we focus on extreme dry and hot phenomena in terrestrial areas the aim is to emphasize cdhes zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 defined the warm season for each grid point on the global land area as the three hottest months in local temperature climatology therefore for each station we calculated three indicators spi sti and sdhi to characterise drought high temperature and compound hot and dry events this was performed on a station by station basis for the average precipitation and temperature in the three months of the year with the highest temperatures summer 2 2 2 indices of large scale circulation patterns in addition the indices of four large scale circulation indexes that have been shown to have a significant impact on the asian climate were selected for this study enso nao pdo and amo dittus et al 2018 wu et al 2019 hao et al 2021 this was done to investigate the potential influence of large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi in inner mongolia during summer these indices were obtained from the global climate observing system working group on surface pressure https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries the monthly values of these indices were used to represent the strengths of these modes of variability in this study enso is represented by the nino3 4 index which represents the global average of the ocean surface temperature sst in the regions between 170 w 120 w and 5 s 5 n 2 3 methods 2 3 1 construction of indices of dry and hot extreme events when describing a compound event it makes sense to indicate the severity of the event by normalising the variables zhang et al 2011 steinemann et al 2015 in this study rainfall p was used as a measure of the severity of drought events in the assessment of compound dry and hot events while higher temperature values t were used to indicate more severe hot events the method for assessing the severity x of a compound dry and hot event is x p t to study the state of drought and high temperature events when they occur simultaneously we first calculated the marginal probability distribution functions g1 p and g2 t for precipitation and temperature gringorten s empirical method was used to calculate the marginal probability distribution gringorten 1963 1 p i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank and n is the length of observations next we defined x g1 p g2 t where lower x values indicate more severe compound dry and hot events and then normalized x based on the standardised precipitation index spi first we fitted the marginal cumulative distribution f and then performed normalization according to the standard normal distribution φ this index is referred to as the standardised dry heat index sdhi hao et al 2018b which can be expressed as 2 sdhi φ 1 f x this standardisation procedure has been applied to a variety of variables to derive extreme indices including the standardised temperature index sti in calculating the sdhi three marginal distribution functions need to be fitted i e g1 p g2 t and f a lower sdhi value indicates more severe compound dry and hot events as the sdhi is also calculated using a standardised approach that is similar to the spi the same grading approach as the spi is used for grading dry and hot events consequently the threshold values of 0 5 0 8 1 3 1 6 and 2 0 were chosen to define abnormal dry and hot events moderate dry and hot events severe dry and hot events extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events respectively hao et al 2018a in this manuscript we will also study the part of the compound dry and hot events sdhi 0 5 which is called no dry and hot events for easy reading we use the variable y to represent sdhi in the following equations 2 3 2 spatiotemporal variation analysis by combining the theil sen median trend analysis and the mann kendall test method to analyse the trend of long time series the resulting method does not require the data to obey a certain distribution pattern and is more resistant to data errors furthermore the results are more scientific and reliable than other research methods through the significance level test guo et al 2020b wang et al 2020 kang et al 2021 the theil sen median trend analysis is a non parametric statistical calculation method that is calculated as follows 3 β m e d i a n y j y i j i where yj and yi is the sdhi value in years i and j for each pixel respectively in this article 2020 j i 1981 β represents the median of the requested sequence β greater than 0 indicates an increasing trend of sdhi β less than 0 indicates a decreasing trend of sdhi and β equal to 0 indicates a stable trend of sdhi the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test that has been widely used to test the significance of trends in long time series data for the time series sdhii the mann kendall trend test combined with the theil sen median trend analysis in this study the significance test results of the mann kendall test value zc at a confidence level of 0 05 were classified as a significant change zc 1 96 and an insignificant change zc 1 96 2 3 3 pearson s correlation coefficient in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r was applied to explore the effects of four large scale circulation indexes on cdhes in inner mongolia pearson s correlations are the most frequently used method to measure correlation in statistics pearson 1929 zhu and yuan 2015 therefore we calculated the correlation coefficients and their p values between the sdhi and the data of the four large scale circulation models based on the sdhi for each summer month from 1981 to 2020 2 3 4 partial wavelet coherence the partial wavelet coherence was developed by mihanović et al 2009 on the basis of bwc and was further improved by hu and si 2021 the purpose of this manuscript is to use the concept of partial wavelet coherence analysis to understand the independent dependencies of each of our chosen four large scale circulation factors on sdhi it is used to obtain phase information by excluding multiple remaining variables the principle is similar to that of partial correlation that is the exploration of bivariate relationships from different scales and locations by eliminating the influence of other variables the principal calculation formula is as follows 4 r p y x 1 x 2 2 s t r y x 1 s t r y x 2 s t r y x 1 s t 2 1 r y x 2 s t 2 1 r x 2 x 1 s t 2 where r denotes the wavelet coherence between the two variables if x2 is 0 at a particular interval frequency point it means that it has no significant effect on the sequence y both p y x 1 x 2 2 s t and p y x 2 x 1 2 s t have significant bands implying that both time series x1 and x2 have a significant effect on the series y more details on partial wavelet coherence can be found the study done by ng and chan 2012 2 3 5 multiple wavelet coherence multiple wavelet coherence detects the relationship between multiple variables by constructing cross wavelet power spectra between multiple variables in this study mwc was used to study the combined effects of two or more of these four large scale circulation indexes on sdhi in inner mongolia the sdhi for june july and august within the last 40 years in inner mongolia was chosen as the response variable yt and two or more large scale circulation indexes were considered as predictor variables xt for a given scale s and period t it can be defined as hu and si 2016 lee et al 2016 5 rm 2 s t w y x s t w y x s t w x x s t w y y s t where is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power between the sdhi and the four large scale circulation indexes is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power between the four large scale circulation indexes and is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power between the four large scale circulation indexes w y y s t is the matrix of the smoothed wavelet power of the sdhi and w y x s t is the complex conjugate of w y x s t 2 3 6 relative importance analysis stepwise multiple regression models were used to assess the relative importance of the four large scale circulation indexes on the inter annual variability of the summer sdhi in the inner mongolia region the determined regression and predictor are represented by equation 6 6 y i β 0 β 1 x i 1 β p x ip e i the response of object i is modelled as a linear function of regressor values xi1 xip with unknown coefficients β1 βp and ei represents the unexplained part in linear regression the coefficients βk k 0 p are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared unexplained parts if we denote the estimated coefficients as β k and the fitted response values as y i β 0 x i 1 β 1 x ip β p the coefficient of determination r2 can be written as 7 r 2 modelss totalss i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 r2 measures the proportion of variation in y that is explained by the p regressors in the model where i 1 n yi represents the response variable the annual sdhi values in inner mongolia xi1 xip represents the control variables the annual intensity of enso pdo nao and amo large scale circulation indexes β1 βp represent coefficients of different control variables here representing the relative importance of each large scale circulation index with respect to the response variable sdhi β0 is a constant variable and ei represents the unexplained part to reduce the uncertainty of other factors or interactions between factors the relative importance of large scale circulation indexes for sdhi changes in our study we chose four models in a multiple regression framework including lmg lindeman 1980 first groemping 2006 genizi genizi 1993 and car zuber and strimmer 2011 this method can be implemented using the r package relaimpo groemping 2006 3 results 3 1 applicability analysis of sdhi 3 1 1 overall applicability to investigate the accuracy of the sdhi index for compound events in this study we used the standardised precipitation index spi and the standardised temperature index sti to define individual and compound dry and hot events and compared the results of the two methods to determine the accuracy of the sdhi index in identifying compound events according to the grading criteria of ksiksi and al blooshi 2019 we used spi 0 5 and sti 0 5 to define drought and high temperature conditions respectively when both conditions were satisfied at the same time we considered compound dry and hot events to be occurring if only one of the two events occurs or neither of them occurs the compound event was not considered to have occurred we compare the results of the above two methods in identifying compound dry and hot events fig 2 from the results it is clearly that when sdhi performed the identification of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia the accuracy of the 115 stations participating in the study was higher than 80 with the highest accuracy rate of 92 5 indicating that sdhi has a high applicability in inner mongolia these results demonstrate the feasibility of sdhi for compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia and reveal the level of applicability of this indicator in various regions of inner mongolia 3 1 2 regional applicability to further validate the ability of the sdhi to characterise drought and high temperature events hohhot city which had high accuracy in sdhi recognition and uniform distribution of meteorological stations was selected as the representative area the changes in the summer spi sti and sdhi in hohhot from 1981 to 2020 are shown in fig 3 usually when the spi value is low and the sti value is high simultaneously the sdhi value is low this is because relatively lower precipitation and higher temperatures will result in lower g1 p and higher g2 t marginal probability distributions in local precipitation and temperature leading to lower g1 p g2 t lower sdhi values for example the spi value in hohhot city in the summer of 1999 was the lowest in nearly 40 years and the sti value in the same period was also extremely high signalling the occurrence of severe hot and drought events happening at the same time the sdhi in the same period also reached the lowest in nearly 40 years reflecting the severity of the compound dry and hot events as these indicators are calculated based on empirical methods the extreme values of sdhi and spi in 1999 almost coincide because this was the most extreme year in the historical record for both drought and complex conditions guo et al 2020c cai et al 2021 the compound events that occurred in hohhot in 1999 are clearly shown in fig 3 the scatter plot of sti spi in hohhot city for the period of 1981 2020 fig 4 showed that the magnitude of the marker is indicated by the value of sdhi with low spi and high sti corresponding to negative values of sdhi for example the upper left quadrant represents an abnormally low spi value and an abnormally high sti value several points in the upper right quadrant with negative sdhi values correspond to positive spi and sti values this indicates that the spi values although not indicating drought conditions and the combined conditions of sti and spi still lead to cdhes it also reflects another interesting feature of the sdhi indicator when the independent events themselves might not satisfy the extreme conditions but the combined compound events do the sdhi can also be used to describe the extreme conditions the above validation results show that sdhi can be used as an indicator of the severity of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia 3 2 the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of compound dry and hot events based on sdhi 3 2 1 temporal variation in sdhi the trends of sdhi and its various levels in inner mongolia during the summers of 1981 2020 are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the overall trend of sdhi values in this time period is decreasing year by year at a rate of 0 04 year with the lowest value occurring in 2010 indicating that the greatest severity of cdhes occurred in this year to study the severity of cdhes in depth the sdhi was graded according to the grading criteria of hao et al 2018b and the percentage of stations with each level of dry and hot events was counted year by year fig 5 b f the ratio of stations with abnormal dry and hot events increased at a rate of 0 24 year and fluctuated around 10 until 1997 there was a sudden change after 1997 and the maximum was reached in 2001 the ratio of stations with moderate dry and hot events increased at a rate of 0 22 year and the year with the highest number of stations with moderate dry and hot events was 2010 before 1999 the ratio of stations with severe dry and hot events in inner mongolia was less than 10 and the number of stations with severe dry and hot events started to increase in 1999 among which the number of stations with severe dry and hot events in 2007 and 2010 was much higher than that in other years approximately 20 87 and 18 26 of the total number of stations respectively there were great similarities in the trends of extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events over the last 40 years with the ratio of stations experiencing both extreme and exceptional dry and hot events below 10 before 2009 the maximum value was reached in 2010 due to the anti cyclonic circulation and the increase in potential height tong et al 2019 guo et al 2020a which making 2010 was the worst year for cdhes within the last 40 years overall it is seen that the ratio of stations with five levels of cdhes in inner mongolia showed an increasing trend from to 1981 2020 with the most significant increase in abnormal dry and hot events furthermore it can be clearly seen that the severity and frequency of cdhes in inner mongolia have increased since the 21st century 3 2 2 spatial variation in sdhi to further analyse the spatial variation patterns of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in different months as well as their spatial responses to changes in drought and high temperature events the theil sen median trend analysis and mann kendall test were performed this was done for the three indices of spi sti and sdhi for june and august of each year from 1981 to 2020 fig 6 from the results it can be seen that the sdhi values of more than 97 of the 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia showed a decreasing trend during 1981 2020 indicating an overall increase in the severity of dry and hot events in the inner mongolia region over the last 40 years among them 75 stations showed a significant decrease and the remaining stations that did not show a significant decrease were mainly located in alxa league erdos city chifeng city and tongliao city from the trend in spi changes 85 of the 115 stations in the region showed a decreasing trend indicating that the overall drought situation in inner mongolia has shown a worsening trend over the past 40 years of which 80 stations showed a non significant decreasing trend nevertheless 100 sti values out of 115 stations showed a significant increasing trend indicating a significant temperature increase in inner mongolia in the last 40 years furthermore combining the results of spi and sti trends it can be suggested that the increase in the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia in the last 40 years may be dominated by the factor of increasing temperature wu et al 2010 wu et al 2017 shi et al 2018 to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of compound events in inner mongolia this study included an analysis of the frequency of sdhi at each station in the study area over 40 years based on spatiotemporal analysis the severity of sdhi was classified into six levels abnormal dry and hot events moderate dry and hot events severe dry and hot events severe dry and hot events extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events fig 7 from the results it can be seen that abnormal and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia before 2000 and the severity of cdhes was higher in the eastern region than in the western region since the 21st century the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia has increased and the severity in the western region began to be higher than that in the eastern region with the highest frequency of exceptional dry and hot events being seen in 2010 which was the most severe dry and hot situation in the past 40 years 3 3 correlation between large scale circulation indexes and sdhi in inner mongolia 3 3 1 pearson s correlation analysis of large scale circulation indexes with sdhi fig 8 shows the effects of four large scale circulation indexes based on pearson s correlation coefficient on the cdhes in inner mongolia the results were analysed for significance at the 0 05 confidence level from the results it can be seen that during the enso event 66 of the 115 stations in inner mongolia showed a positive correlation between sdhi and enso whereas the remaining 49 stations showed a negative correlation a few stations showed significant relationships wang et al 2018 also came to the same conclusion when they studied the coupling of ocean and atmosphere in northern china this may be due to the weakening of the links between enso and indian summer winds south asian heating and the asian mid latitude circulation after the late 1970 s which led to a weakening of the enso influence on dry and hot events in north eastern china the correlation results of pdo and sdhi show that the pdo values of the 115 stations showed a positive correlation with the sdhi indicating that the negative phase of pdo tends to trigger more cdhes in the inner mongolia region this is because of the possibility of not only a decrease in precipitation in northern china during negative pdo but also the formation of an anomalous anti cyclonic circulation due to the anomalous increase in north pacific sst during that period further strengthening of continental high pressure leads to weakening of the latitudinal westerly winds over northern china resulting in the formation of high temperature events that further exacerbate the formation of cdhes apurv et al 2019 have also proposed the positive phase of the pdo is also expected to reduce the severity of droughts in inner mongolia and south china the positive phase of pdo is also expected to reduce the severity of drought in inner mongolia and southern china wu et al 2021 pointed out that the negative phase of nao played a more inhibitory role in the precipitation situation in northern china in this study we also confirmed this phenomenon the effect of nao on cdhes in inner mongolia is greater when it is in the negative phase which is related to the positive correlation of nao with precipitation and the negative correlation with temperature in most regions of northern china sun 2012 sun and wang 2012 the negative phase of nao may lead to reduced summer precipitation in central east asia or northern china by generating a meridional circulation dipole pattern over east asia and the anomalous anti cyclonic circulation pattern caused by the latitudinal wave train may lead to high temperatures resulting in compound dry and hot conditions in the northern part of china the potential mechanism for this is a significant change in the nao pattern after the late 1970 s compared to the previous period with its southern centre shifting eastward this change can alter the latitudinal wave activity in eurasia resulting in a meridional dipole pattern over east asia which can impact factors such as water vapour conditions and total cloudiness over east asia thereby affecting the precipitation and solar radiation intensity indicators of the region wang et al 2018 li et al 2019 amo has been shown to modulate the east asia climate or monsoon system during summer mainly through a teleconnection wave train with alternating cyclones and anticyclones in the upper troposphere li et al 2017 the positive phase of the amo leads to more cdhes in the inner mongolia region this is consistent with the conclusion of hao et al 2020 when the amo shows a positive phase period a steady rossby wave originates in the western north atlantic and propagates eastward on two different paths affecting the regional atmospheric circulation in the process leading to an anomalous anti cyclonic centre an anomalous descending motion and a weakened upper level westerly jet stream in north eastern china these regional circulation pattern anomalies all create favourable conditions for decreased precipitation and increased temperatures hong et al 2020 li et al 2020a b zhang et al 2020 3 3 2 analysis of the contribution of large scale circulation indexes to the sdhi in section 2 3 1 the relationship between the four large scale circulation indexes and sdhi was spatially demonstrated we then quantified the relative importance of the four large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi by means of a stepwise multiple regression model this can also be called an overall analysis of the relationship between each circulation pattern by studying its contribution to the occurrence of cdhes in inner mongolia for the annual sdhi from 1981 to 2020 for the four large scale circulation model contribution analyses the four models lmg first genizi and car were selected for evaluation fig 9 the set of large scale circulation indexes within the multiple linear regression accounted for 43 39 of the annual sdhi variance in inner mongolia among the results obtained from the four models pdo and nao contributed more to sdhi changes than enso and amo indicating that pdo and nao have more significant effects on sdhi changes in inner mongolia the contribution ratio results for each pattern were greater than 14 for pdo and nao and between 11 03 and 19 53 for amo the contribution of enso to the variation in sdhi ranged from 0 01 to 1 6 which was the lowest contribution among the four large scale circulation indexes 3 3 3 wavelet analysis of large scale circulation indexes with sdhi it would be interesting to further explore the effects of the four large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi in inner mongolia both individually and under various combined scenarios therefore we examined the correlation between the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes based on the mwc and pwc methods fig 10 in fig 10 the black conical outline represents the local power which exceeds the 95 confidence level relative to the red noise and the lightly shaded area depicts the cone of influence coi the black arrow s direction indicates the relative phase relationship between sdhi and large scale circulation indexes the right phase arrow indicates the same phase the left phase arrow indicates the opposite phase and the legend indicates the correlation between sdhi and large scale circulation indexes baddoo et al 2015 guo et al 2020b fig 10 a d shows the partial wavelet coherence of the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes in inner mongolia for june july and august in the last 40 years the results in fig 10 a show the first significant resonance cycle of 3 5 months in the summer of 1990 for enso and sdhi a second significant resonance cycle of 6 7 months in the summer of 1991 1992 and the longest resonance cycle in 2013 july 2016 with a cumulative duration of about 6 8 months notably in addition to 2006 and 2013 there were also two short resonance cycles fig 10 b shows that sdhi and pdo presented significant resonance cycles of 3 6 months during july 1987 june 1993 and 4 5 months during june 2003 august 2004 as well as two resonance cycles lasting 2 3 months and 9 12 months respectively during 2006 2013 there were significant resonance cycles of 2 6 months between sdhi and nao during june 1988 june 1993 and 14 20 months during june 1986 august 1994 furthermore the phase angle changes indicated that nao and sdhi were positively correlated during this cycle fig 10 c the partial wavelet analysis results for sdhi and amo were not strongly continuous with a resonance cycle of 7 12 months during 2006 2020 but were strongly influenced by potential edge effects fig 10 d we applied mwc to study the combined effects of the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes in inner mongolia under various scenarios the results are shown in fig 10 e o in the case of two two unions the resonance of enso which was the least important of the four large scale circulation indexes was significantly enhanced with sdhi after the union with the other three indicators whereas the pdo nao and amo which were relatively more important increased significantly after the two two union the union of pdo and nao appeared more than 32 months in the last 40 years of the resonance period but there is also the problem that it was highly influenced by potential edge effects a significant resonance cycle of 7 14 months existed in 1987 2003 after the union of nao and amo when three or more large scale circulation indexes were combined it was found that the wavelet energy between the large scale circulation indexes and sdhi was significantly enhanced in the combined case and the discontinuous coherence within the 2 month cycle was prevalent the coherence band was relatively consistent in each combined case for the period of 1993 2006 4 discussion compound extreme events can cause irreversible and significant damage to human society and the natural environment in recent years the frequency and intensity of compound dry and hot events have been increasing in several regions worldwide wu et al 2020 hao et al 2021 historical events have shown that extreme compound events often cause more damage and more losses than a single hazard and are more likely to lead to a cascade of hazards or even a natech event barriopedro et al 2011 rippey 2015 pescaroli and alexander 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 therefore this study uses temperature and precipitation station data and a standardised method that is similar to spi to construct a standardised dry and hot index sdhi analyse the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of cdhes in inner mongolia and explore the relationship between it and four large scale circulation indexes compared to existing research this study not only makes up for the lack of description of compound dry and hot events in arid and semi arid areas but also uses a variety of time scale data and a comprehensive idea of combining linear and nonlinear methods to analyze the relationship between large scale circulation indicators and sdhi for explore the relationship between them at the same time considering the calculation speed and accuracy four models in the multivariate stepwise regression framework are selected to quantify the relative importance of large scale circulation pattern indicators affecting the change of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia which makes up for the shortcomings of existing studies that only focus on spatial analysis on the one hand the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia increased from 1981 to 2020 and was more significantly affected by high temperature conditions than drought conditions which is consistent with the study of hao et al 2018b the studies that have been performed also show that based on the most basic physical principles taking into account multiple influences such as energy humidity and wind speed droughts have not changed much over the last 60 years by conducting regional studies it was found that temperature fluctuations are also one of the main causes of drought variations although it has been questioned that short term temperature changes are only one type of environmental response to drought and not a factor that exacerbates drought you et al 2011 sheffield et al 2012 however the conclusion that the frequency of extreme heat events has increased significantly in the context of global warming has been widely accepted compared to drought events where there is still more controversy over whether the trend of exacerbation is significant seneviratne et al 2014 guo et al 2020c on the other hand guo et al 2020b showed that the intensity of heat waves in inner mongolia increased when the values of indicators representing enso and pdo increased this is especially so for the pdo indicator which had a more significant effect on heat wave events in inner mongolia this is consistent with the finding that more stations in central inner mongolia passed the 0 05 significance level test for the relationship between sdhi and enso and pdo compared to other regions in this study zhang et al 2020 found that pdo and amo influenced extreme heat events in northern china with amo being more significant this finding was also reflected in section 3 3 of this study of the four large scale circulation indexes used in this study enso had the least significant performance and lacked spatial regularity compared to the other three categories recent studies also found that in the northern parts of south america southern africa and southeast asia there is a close relationship between the occurrence of cdhes and enso but the effect of enso on compound dry and hot events is very limited in the chinese warm season mukherjee et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however the description of the compound dry and hot events in this study was based only on temperature and precipitation at the monthly scale and a compound dry and hot event index sdhi was derived to characterise extreme drought and high temperature events using a standardised model based on the spi index hao et al 2018b in the future we can add more variables to study the compound dry and hot events on more detailed time scales for example we can add the consideration of potential evapotranspiration in the characterisation of drought hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b and the use of a more accurate extreme hot index when describing temperature anomaly situations hao et al 2020 in this study we focused only on the response of compound dry and hot events to four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo but it has been demonstrated that the indian ocean dipole iod arctic oscillation ao initial pacific oscillation ipo and the east asian summer monsoon index easm also play a significant role in the occurrence of extreme precipitation and temperature events in northern china mao et al 2011 chen et al 2013 tong et al 2019 guo et al 2020c zhou et al 2020 moreover temperate cyclones anti cyclones influenced by the combination of atmospheric circulation patterns are important indicators of extreme weather generation in north eastern china cao et al 2018 deng et al 2018 the correlation analysis and significance test results indicate that the remote correlation between a single climate model pair and inland areas is only significant in a limited number of areas of inner mongolia thus the next step is to assess the joint influence of a variety of other circulation patterns under different combined scenarios in inner mongolia to further improve our understanding of the influence of cdhes in inland areas by large scale circulation indexes bothe et al 2010 shi et al 2017 tabari and willems 2018 5 conclusions this study combined the temperature and precipitation conditions in the inner mongolia region over the last 40 years it also constructed the index sdhi for monitoring compound dry and hot events in the region from two scales of drought and high temperature which performed well in describing extreme compound events in the inner mongolia region from 1981 to 2020 thereafter the characteristics of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia were portrayed in three capacities temporal spatial and frequency in addition we also studied the influence of four large scale circulation indexes on compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia during the summer the results showed the following 1 in terms of time the sdhi value in inner mongolia in the past 40 years has shown a significant decreasing trend at a rate of 0 04 year and the proportion of stations with different levels of dry and hot events every year has shown an increasing trend the rate of increase in the ratio of stations with abnormal dry and hot events was the highest at 0 24 year and the lowest rate was for moderate dry and hot events 0 09 year generally there was an overall trend of increasing severity of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia from 1981 to 2020 2 spatially the sdhi values of more than 97 of the stations showed a decreasing trend the spi values of more than half of the stations showed a decreasing trend and the sti values of 86 96 of the stations showed an increasing trend in terms of significance the decreasing trend of spi values was mostly insignificant whereas the increasing sti values of each station mostly showed a significant state which indicates that it is highly likely that the increase in the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia in recent years is dominated by high temperature events from the results of the frequency of cdhes before the 21st century mild and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia and the severity of dry and hot events was higher in the eastern region since the 21st century extreme and exceptional dry and hot events occurred frequently and the severity was higher in the western region than in the eastern region 3 exploration from a linear theoretical approach revealed that four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo show different characteristics in their influence on cdhes in inner mongolia the effect of enso on cdhes in inner mongolia was usually insignificant with 57 39 of stations showing a positive correlation between sdhi and enso whereas the rest showed a negative correlation when the pdo is in the negative phase it tends to bring cdhes to inner mongolia and such effects mainly occur in the central and western regions more than 90 of the stations were influenced by the negative phase of the nao and were more likely to trigger a cdhe the positive phase of the amo had an impact on the occurrence of dry and hot events at more than 95 of the stations with more than 80 of the stations having a significant impact the contribution of large scale circulation indexes was quantified in a stepwise multiple regression framework and the results of the four patterns corresponded well with enso having the lowest relative importance for sdhi changes and amo the highest 4 by using wavelet analysis in a nonlinear framework it was found that among the four large scale circulation indexes enso and sdhi had the lowest resonance and the worst continuity nao and pdo had relatively good resonance and the resonance between amo and sdhi was more influenced by the potential edge effect furthermore the continuity of the resonance cycle was found to be better and the coherence was noticeably enhanced after considering different joint cases of the four large scale circulation indexes credit authorship contribution statement yao kang writing original draft investigation enliang guo writing review editing supervision validation yongfang wang supervision

3030,in recent decades frequent compound dry and hot events cdhes have posed a great threat to humans and the ecological environment especially in inner mongolia which has typical arid and semi arid characteristics therefore while exploring the characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of the cdhes in inner mongolia and elucidating their teleconnections with large scale circulation indexes it can not only provide useful enlightenment for ecological protection but also provide more detailed information for understanding the corresponding details of cdhes with large scale circulation indexes in this study monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia for each summer from 1981 to 2020 were used to establish a standardised dry and hot index sdhi characterising the severity of extreme compound events of drought and high temperature in inner mongolia this data was also used to analyse the spatial and temporal characteristics of such compound events over the past 40 years thereafter pearson s correlation stepwise multiple regression models and multivariate wavelet analysis methods were used to assess the relationship between the atmospheric circulation index and sdhi in terms of linear non linear and different combinations of the four large scale circulation indexes the results show that sdhi performs well in the assessment of cdhes in inner mongolia and shows great similarities with historical records the overall trend of cdhes in inner mongolia over the past 40 years has intensified over time spatially abnormal and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia before the 21st century and the frequency of occurrence was higher in the eastern region than in the western region furthermore the severity of cdhes has increased significantly since the 21st century with severe and extreme dry and hot events occurring more frequently in the western region than in the eastern region the results of the correlation analysis show that among the four large scale circulation indexes the atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo has the greatest influence on the cdhes in inner mongolia when it is positive with the highest significance and when the pacific decadal oscillation pdo and north atlantic oscillation nao show negative phases they are more likely to cause dry and hot events in inner mongolia further where the number of stations negatively influenced by nao is higher the effect of el niño southern oscillation enso on dry and hot events is usually insignificant partial wavelet coherence pwc analysis suggests that the independent effects of circulation factors may be weaker but appear to be stronger due to their interdependence with other circulation patterns finally the multiple wavelet coherence mwc results show that the changes in sdhi values can be best explained by a combination of two or more factors keywords compound event climate change dry and hot teleconnection inner mongolia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in the context of global warming the current global average surface temperature is approximately 1 c higher than that during the industrialisation era leading to frequent extreme climate events among which heat waves and drought events have already had a serious impact on society and human life ye et al 2019 joshi et al 2020 leng et al 2020 yu and zhai 2020 xu et al 2021 it has been shown that the frequency and severity of global terrestrial droughts and high temperatures are increasing in addition the simultaneous occurrence of multiple compound effects has been observed in several regions of the globe for example both european and russian heat wave events in 2003 were accompanied by drought events horton et al 2016 hao et al 2018a which are compound dry and hot events the probability of compound extreme events has likely increased due to human induced climate change concurrent heat waves and droughts have become more frequent over the last century and this trend will continue with greater global warming high confidence zhou 2021 because the impact of compound dry and hot events is much larger than that of individual extreme events an integrated analysis of the characteristics of compound dry and hot events can provide more impactful information for mitigating global warming and maintaining ecological stability the definition of a compound event extreme given in the special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex is as follows seneviratne 2012 1 two or more extreme events occurring simultaneously 2 the occurrence of compounded extreme events that amplifies the impact of a single event 3 not an extreme event in itself but it is the combination that has an extreme impact in this way compound events often involve multiple variables furthermore because of the joint characterisation of these variables occurring at the same time compound dry and hot events usually exhibit scarce precipitation and abnormally high temperatures initial studies on compound dry and hot events have emerged globally in the past zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 hao et al 2018b and monitoring and forecasting systems for information on hot and dry conditions have been developed globally based on a variety of research concepts for example modelling using bivariate distributions of drought precipitation and high temperature temperature has been used to describe the occurrence of compound dry and hot events cong and brady 2012 zscheischler et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 quantified the occurrence of compound dry and hot events on a global scale by establishing a joint distribution function based on copula s principle and found that when summer rainfall and temperature are negatively correlated it results in a compound event wu et al 2019 explored the historical characteristics of compound extreme events under four combinations including dry warm dry cold wet warm and wet cold based on monthly precipitation and temperature observations in summer and winter in china from 1961 to 2014 in terms of indices hao et al 2018c hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b established standardised compound event indicators scei and a standardised dry and hot index sdhi based on the meta gaussian model and the concept of standardised precipitation index spi respectively these indicators were used to characterise the severity and spatial distribution of compound dry and hot events in southern africa and globally although there are studies analysing the characteristics and spatial distribution by formulating indicators there is still a lack of unified systems and indicators for the characterisation of cdhes furthermore these studies focus on large scale ranges or coastal areas leading to a lack of detailed studies of cdhes in arid and semi arid areas therefore in this study we used the sdhi to analyse the characteristics of compound dry and hot events in the inner mongolia autonomous region which is a typical arid and semi arid region as the impact of compound dry and hot events becomes greater it is crucial to understand the driving factors behind them based on the analysis of the characteristics of their spatiotemporal evolution to mitigate the adverse effects of dry and hot events alexander 2016 land atmosphere interactions feedbacks play an important role in the onset and evolution of the global warming of seasonal climates déry and wood 2005 trenberth and shea 2005 it has been shown that the variability of extreme climate events in the chinese region is closely related to the large scale circulation indexes tong et al 2006 feng et al 2011 of el niño southern oscillation enso pacific decadal oscillation pdo north atlantic oscillation nao and atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo these and other natural circulation patterns or large scale circulation indexes are important drivers of precipitation and high temperature variability in different regions of china sun 2012 liu et al 2014 ouyang et al 2014 luo and lau 2019 moreover these atmospheric circulation patterns on inter annual time scales influence precipitation and temperature in several regions especially in tropical and subtropical regions baxter and nigam 2015 however the mechanisms by which these large scale circulation indexes cause compound extreme events especially cdhes are unknown and the developed and improved wavelet transform analysis is considered an effective tool for probe multi scale responses torrence and compo 1998 grinsted et al 2004 in this study we chose multiple wavelet coherence mwc and partial wavelet coherence pwc methods to explore the distant relations between four large scale circulation indexes and sdhi the mwc was assigned to find the wavelet coherence for multiple independent time series on a dependent time series while the pwc was used to find the wavelet coherence between the two time series after removing the effect of its common dependence both methods show sufficient reliability in detecting periodic changes in geophysical signals along a sequence of time rigozo et al 2008 tan et al 2016 song et al 2020 moreover to further validate the influence of each large scale circulation pattern on sdhi changes a multivariate stepwise regression model was chosen to calculate the contribution of the large scale circulation indexes and quantify the distant correlation to obtain clearer and more credible results since the late 1990 s droughts and high temperatures have become more frequent severe widespread and longer lasting throughout china especially in the northern regions inner mongolia is a vast region with a complex and diverse climate and topography it is a transitional zone between the arid semi arid inland region of the northwest influenced by the asian monsoon and the humid semi humid region of the southeast coast hu et al 2015 it is both an important ecological barrier in the northern border areas of china and a sensitive area affected by global warming currently there are many studies on single extreme climate events in inner mongolia wang et al 2019 guo et al 2020a li et al 2020a b however studies on the characteristics of compound extreme weather events and the remote correlation with large scale circulation indexes are still lacking therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to construct a standardised dry heat index sdhi and analyse the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia and 2 explore the effects of four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo on cdhes using mwc pwc and multivariate stepwise regression models the results of this study can provide important information for understanding the climate change situation and achieving sustainable development in the region 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the inner mongolia autonomous region is located in the northern border area of china between 7 12 126 04 e and 37 24 53 23 n the total area of the region is 118 3 km2 which makes it the third largest province in china accounting for 12 3 of china s total land area it has a predominantly temperate continental monsoon climate with obvious regional differences an average annual temperature of 1 15 c and an average annual precipitation of 50 500 mm precipitation in the region decreases from northeast to southwest and shows an obvious gradient distribution pattern whereas the annual average temperature increases from northeast to southwest influenced by south easterly winds in the summer it easily forms a hot and rainy climate however in winter the climate of the region becomes dry and cold again due to the influence of the siberian mongolian high pressure wang et al 2019 the main types of landforms in inner mongolia include mountains hills and plateaus the average elevation is 1000 m and the terrain clearly undulates with a downward sloping trend from south to north and from west to east fig 1 topographic conditions indirectly affect the development and distribution of vegetation by influencing the redistribution of atmospheric circulation and surface water and heat conditions ultimately forming unique natural environmental conditions and vegetation 2 2 data sources 2 2 1 meteorological data in this study monthly temperature and precipitation data from 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia during the summers of 1981 2020 were selected these were obtained from the meteorological information center of the inner mongolia meteorological bureau as we focus on extreme dry and hot phenomena in terrestrial areas the aim is to emphasize cdhes zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 defined the warm season for each grid point on the global land area as the three hottest months in local temperature climatology therefore for each station we calculated three indicators spi sti and sdhi to characterise drought high temperature and compound hot and dry events this was performed on a station by station basis for the average precipitation and temperature in the three months of the year with the highest temperatures summer 2 2 2 indices of large scale circulation patterns in addition the indices of four large scale circulation indexes that have been shown to have a significant impact on the asian climate were selected for this study enso nao pdo and amo dittus et al 2018 wu et al 2019 hao et al 2021 this was done to investigate the potential influence of large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi in inner mongolia during summer these indices were obtained from the global climate observing system working group on surface pressure https www esrl noaa gov psd gcos wgsp timeseries the monthly values of these indices were used to represent the strengths of these modes of variability in this study enso is represented by the nino3 4 index which represents the global average of the ocean surface temperature sst in the regions between 170 w 120 w and 5 s 5 n 2 3 methods 2 3 1 construction of indices of dry and hot extreme events when describing a compound event it makes sense to indicate the severity of the event by normalising the variables zhang et al 2011 steinemann et al 2015 in this study rainfall p was used as a measure of the severity of drought events in the assessment of compound dry and hot events while higher temperature values t were used to indicate more severe hot events the method for assessing the severity x of a compound dry and hot event is x p t to study the state of drought and high temperature events when they occur simultaneously we first calculated the marginal probability distribution functions g1 p and g2 t for precipitation and temperature gringorten s empirical method was used to calculate the marginal probability distribution gringorten 1963 1 p i 0 44 n 0 12 where i is the rank and n is the length of observations next we defined x g1 p g2 t where lower x values indicate more severe compound dry and hot events and then normalized x based on the standardised precipitation index spi first we fitted the marginal cumulative distribution f and then performed normalization according to the standard normal distribution φ this index is referred to as the standardised dry heat index sdhi hao et al 2018b which can be expressed as 2 sdhi φ 1 f x this standardisation procedure has been applied to a variety of variables to derive extreme indices including the standardised temperature index sti in calculating the sdhi three marginal distribution functions need to be fitted i e g1 p g2 t and f a lower sdhi value indicates more severe compound dry and hot events as the sdhi is also calculated using a standardised approach that is similar to the spi the same grading approach as the spi is used for grading dry and hot events consequently the threshold values of 0 5 0 8 1 3 1 6 and 2 0 were chosen to define abnormal dry and hot events moderate dry and hot events severe dry and hot events extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events respectively hao et al 2018a in this manuscript we will also study the part of the compound dry and hot events sdhi 0 5 which is called no dry and hot events for easy reading we use the variable y to represent sdhi in the following equations 2 3 2 spatiotemporal variation analysis by combining the theil sen median trend analysis and the mann kendall test method to analyse the trend of long time series the resulting method does not require the data to obey a certain distribution pattern and is more resistant to data errors furthermore the results are more scientific and reliable than other research methods through the significance level test guo et al 2020b wang et al 2020 kang et al 2021 the theil sen median trend analysis is a non parametric statistical calculation method that is calculated as follows 3 β m e d i a n y j y i j i where yj and yi is the sdhi value in years i and j for each pixel respectively in this article 2020 j i 1981 β represents the median of the requested sequence β greater than 0 indicates an increasing trend of sdhi β less than 0 indicates a decreasing trend of sdhi and β equal to 0 indicates a stable trend of sdhi the mann kendall test is a non parametric statistical test that has been widely used to test the significance of trends in long time series data for the time series sdhii the mann kendall trend test combined with the theil sen median trend analysis in this study the significance test results of the mann kendall test value zc at a confidence level of 0 05 were classified as a significant change zc 1 96 and an insignificant change zc 1 96 2 3 3 pearson s correlation coefficient in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r was applied to explore the effects of four large scale circulation indexes on cdhes in inner mongolia pearson s correlations are the most frequently used method to measure correlation in statistics pearson 1929 zhu and yuan 2015 therefore we calculated the correlation coefficients and their p values between the sdhi and the data of the four large scale circulation models based on the sdhi for each summer month from 1981 to 2020 2 3 4 partial wavelet coherence the partial wavelet coherence was developed by mihanović et al 2009 on the basis of bwc and was further improved by hu and si 2021 the purpose of this manuscript is to use the concept of partial wavelet coherence analysis to understand the independent dependencies of each of our chosen four large scale circulation factors on sdhi it is used to obtain phase information by excluding multiple remaining variables the principle is similar to that of partial correlation that is the exploration of bivariate relationships from different scales and locations by eliminating the influence of other variables the principal calculation formula is as follows 4 r p y x 1 x 2 2 s t r y x 1 s t r y x 2 s t r y x 1 s t 2 1 r y x 2 s t 2 1 r x 2 x 1 s t 2 where r denotes the wavelet coherence between the two variables if x2 is 0 at a particular interval frequency point it means that it has no significant effect on the sequence y both p y x 1 x 2 2 s t and p y x 2 x 1 2 s t have significant bands implying that both time series x1 and x2 have a significant effect on the series y more details on partial wavelet coherence can be found the study done by ng and chan 2012 2 3 5 multiple wavelet coherence multiple wavelet coherence detects the relationship between multiple variables by constructing cross wavelet power spectra between multiple variables in this study mwc was used to study the combined effects of two or more of these four large scale circulation indexes on sdhi in inner mongolia the sdhi for june july and august within the last 40 years in inner mongolia was chosen as the response variable yt and two or more large scale circulation indexes were considered as predictor variables xt for a given scale s and period t it can be defined as hu and si 2016 lee et al 2016 5 rm 2 s t w y x s t w y x s t w x x s t w y y s t where is the matrix of the smoothed cross wavelet power between the sdhi and the four large scale circulation indexes is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power between the four large scale circulation indexes and is the matrix of the smoothed auto and cross wavelet power between the four large scale circulation indexes w y y s t is the matrix of the smoothed wavelet power of the sdhi and w y x s t is the complex conjugate of w y x s t 2 3 6 relative importance analysis stepwise multiple regression models were used to assess the relative importance of the four large scale circulation indexes on the inter annual variability of the summer sdhi in the inner mongolia region the determined regression and predictor are represented by equation 6 6 y i β 0 β 1 x i

coefficients βk k 0 p are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared unexplained parts if we denote the estimated coefficients as β k and the fitted response values as y i β 0 x i 1 β 1 x ip β p the coefficient of determination r2 can be written as 7 r 2 modelss totalss i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y 2 r2 measures the proportion of variation in y that is explained by the p regressors in the model where i 1 n yi represents the response variable the annual sdhi values in inner mongolia xi1 xip represents the control variables the annual intensity of enso pdo nao and amo large scale circulation indexes β1 βp represent coefficients of different control variables here representing the relative importance of each large scale circulation index with respect to the response variable sdhi β0 is a constant variable and ei represents the unexplained part to reduce the uncertainty of other factors or interactions between factors the relative importance of large scale circulation indexes for sdhi changes in our study we chose four models in a multiple regression framework including lmg lindeman 1980 first groemping 2006 genizi genizi 1993 and car zuber and strimmer 2011 this method can be implemented using the r package relaimpo groemping 2006 3 results 3 1 applicability analysis of sdhi 3 1 1 overall applicability to investigate the accuracy of the sdhi index for compound events in this study we used the standardised precipitation index spi and the standardised temperature index sti to define individual and compound dry and hot events and compared the results of the two methods to determine the accuracy of the sdhi index in identifying compound events according to the grading criteria of ksiksi and al blooshi 2019 we used spi 0 5 and sti 0 5 to define drought and high temperature conditions respectively when both conditions were satisfied at the same time we considered compound dry and hot events to be occurring if only one of the two events occurs or neither of them occurs the compound event was not considered to have occurred we compare the results of the above two methods in identifying compound dry and hot events fig 2 from the results it is clearly that when sdhi performed the identification of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia the accuracy of the 115 stations participating in the study was higher than 80 with the highest accuracy rate of 92 5 indicating that sdhi has a high applicability in inner mongolia these results demonstrate the feasibility of sdhi for compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia and reveal the level of applicability of this indicator in various regions of inner mongolia 3 1 2 regional applicability to further validate the ability of the sdhi to characterise drought and high temperature events hohhot city which had high accuracy in sdhi recognition and uniform distribution of meteorological stations was selected as the representative area the changes in the summer spi sti and sdhi in hohhot from 1981 to 2020 are shown in fig 3 usually when the spi value is low and the sti value is high simultaneously the sdhi value is low this is because relatively lower precipitation and higher temperatures will result in lower g1 p and higher g2 t marginal probability distributions in local precipitation and temperature leading to lower g1 p g2 t lower sdhi values for example the spi value in hohhot city in the summer of 1999 was the lowest in nearly 40 years and the sti value in the same period was also extremely high signalling the occurrence of severe hot and drought events happening at the same time the sdhi in the same period also reached the lowest in nearly 40 years reflecting the severity of the compound dry and hot events as these indicators are calculated based on empirical methods the extreme values of sdhi and spi in 1999 almost coincide because this was the most extreme year in the historical record for both drought and complex conditions guo et al 2020c cai et al 2021 the compound events that occurred in hohhot in 1999 are clearly shown in fig 3 the scatter plot of sti spi in hohhot city for the period of 1981 2020 fig 4 showed that the magnitude of the marker is indicated by the value of sdhi with low spi and high sti corresponding to negative values of sdhi for example the upper left quadrant represents an abnormally low spi value and an abnormally high sti value several points in the upper right quadrant with negative sdhi values correspond to positive spi and sti values this indicates that the spi values although not indicating drought conditions and the combined conditions of sti and spi still lead to cdhes it also reflects another interesting feature of the sdhi indicator when the independent events themselves might not satisfy the extreme conditions but the combined compound events do the sdhi can also be used to describe the extreme conditions the above validation results show that sdhi can be used as an indicator of the severity of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia 3 2 the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of compound dry and hot events based on sdhi 3 2 1 temporal variation in sdhi the trends of sdhi and its various levels in inner mongolia during the summers of 1981 2020 are shown in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 a the overall trend of sdhi values in this time period is decreasing year by year at a rate of 0 04 year with the lowest value occurring in 2010 indicating that the greatest severity of cdhes occurred in this year to study the severity of cdhes in depth the sdhi was graded according to the grading criteria of hao et al 2018b and the percentage of stations with each level of dry and hot events was counted year by year fig 5 b f the ratio of stations with abnormal dry and hot events increased at a rate of 0 24 year and fluctuated around 10 until 1997 there was a sudden change after 1997 and the maximum was reached in 2001 the ratio of stations with moderate dry and hot events increased at a rate of 0 22 year and the year with the highest number of stations with moderate dry and hot events was 2010 before 1999 the ratio of stations with severe dry and hot events in inner mongolia was less than 10 and the number of stations with severe dry and hot events started to increase in 1999 among which the number of stations with severe dry and hot events in 2007 and 2010 was much higher than that in other years approximately 20 87 and 18 26 of the total number of stations respectively there were great similarities in the trends of extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events over the last 40 years with the ratio of stations experiencing both extreme and exceptional dry and hot events below 10 before 2009 the maximum value was reached in 2010 due to the anti cyclonic circulation and the increase in potential height tong et al 2019 guo et al 2020a which making 2010 was the worst year for cdhes within the last 40 years overall it is seen that the ratio of stations with five levels of cdhes in inner mongolia showed an increasing trend from to 1981 2020 with the most significant increase in abnormal dry and hot events furthermore it can be clearly seen that the severity and frequency of cdhes in inner mongolia have increased since the 21st century 3 2 2 spatial variation in sdhi to further analyse the spatial variation patterns of the occurrence of compound dry and hot events in different months as well as their spatial responses to changes in drought and high temperature events the theil sen median trend analysis and mann kendall test were performed this was done for the three indices of spi sti and sdhi for june and august of each year from 1981 to 2020 fig 6 from the results it can be seen that the sdhi values of more than 97 of the 115 meteorological stations in inner mongolia showed a decreasing trend during 1981 2020 indicating an overall increase in the severity of dry and hot events in the inner mongolia region over the last 40 years among them 75 stations showed a significant decrease and the remaining stations that did not show a significant decrease were mainly located in alxa league erdos city chifeng city and tongliao city from the trend in spi changes 85 of the 115 stations in the region showed a decreasing trend indicating that the overall drought situation in inner mongolia has shown a worsening trend over the past 40 years of which 80 stations showed a non significant decreasing trend nevertheless 100 sti values out of 115 stations showed a significant increasing trend indicating a significant temperature increase in inner mongolia in the last 40 years furthermore combining the results of spi and sti trends it can be suggested that the increase in the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia in the last 40 years may be dominated by the factor of increasing temperature wu et al 2010 wu et al 2017 shi et al 2018 to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of compound events in inner mongolia this study included an analysis of the frequency of sdhi at each station in the study area over 40 years based on spatiotemporal analysis the severity of sdhi was classified into six levels abnormal dry and hot events moderate dry and hot events severe dry and hot events severe dry and hot events extreme dry and hot events and exceptional dry and hot events fig 7 from the results it can be seen that abnormal and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia before 2000 and the severity of cdhes was higher in the eastern region than in the western region since the 21st century the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia has increased and the severity in the western region began to be higher than that in the eastern region with the highest frequency of exceptional dry and hot events being seen in 2010 which was the most severe dry and hot situation in the past 40 years 3 3 correlation between large scale circulation indexes and sdhi in inner mongolia 3 3 1 pearson s correlation analysis of large scale circulation indexes with sdhi fig 8 shows the effects of four large scale circulation indexes based on pearson s correlation coefficient on the cdhes in inner mongolia the results were analysed for significance at the 0 05 confidence level from the results it can be seen that during the enso event 66 of the 115 stations in inner mongolia showed a positive correlation between sdhi and enso whereas the remaining 49 stations showed a negative correlation a few stations showed significant relationships wang et al 2018 also came to the same conclusion when they studied the coupling of ocean and atmosphere in northern china this may be due to the weakening of the links between enso and indian summer winds south asian heating and the asian mid latitude circulation after the late 1970 s which led to a weakening of the enso influence on dry and hot events in north eastern china the correlation results of pdo and sdhi show that the pdo values of the 115 stations showed a positive correlation with the sdhi indicating that the negative phase of pdo tends to trigger more cdhes in the inner mongolia region this is because of the possibility of not only a decrease in precipitation in northern china during negative pdo but also the formation of an anomalous anti cyclonic circulation due to the anomalous increase in north pacific sst during that period further strengthening of continental high pressure leads to weakening of the latitudinal westerly winds over northern china resulting in the formation of high temperature events that further exacerbate the formation of cdhes apurv et al 2019 have also proposed the positive phase of the pdo is also expected to reduce the severity of droughts in inner mongolia and south china the positive phase of pdo is also expected to reduce the severity of drought in inner mongolia and southern china wu et al 2021 pointed out that the negative phase of nao played a more inhibitory role in the precipitation situation in northern china in this study we also confirmed this phenomenon the effect of nao on cdhes in inner mongolia is greater when it is in the negative phase which is related to the positive correlation of nao with precipitation and the negative correlation with temperature in most regions of northern china sun 2012 sun and wang 2012 the negative phase of nao may lead to reduced summer precipitation in central east asia or northern china by generating a meridional circulation dipole pattern over east asia and the anomalous anti cyclonic circulation pattern caused by the latitudinal wave train may lead to high temperatures resulting in compound dry and hot conditions in the northern part of china the potential mechanism for this is a significant change in the nao pattern after the late 1970 s compared to the previous period with its southern centre shifting eastward this change can alter the latitudinal wave activity in eurasia resulting in a meridional dipole pattern over east asia which can impact factors such as water vapour conditions and total cloudiness over east asia thereby affecting the precipitation and solar radiation intensity indicators of the region wang et al 2018 li et al 2019 amo has been shown to modulate the east asia climate or monsoon system during summer mainly through a teleconnection wave train with alternating cyclones and anticyclones in the upper troposphere li et al 2017 the positive phase of the amo leads to more cdhes in the inner mongolia region this is consistent with the conclusion of hao et al 2020 when the amo shows a positive phase period a steady rossby wave originates in the western north atlantic and propagates eastward on two different paths affecting the regional atmospheric circulation in the process leading to an anomalous anti cyclonic centre an anomalous descending motion and a weakened upper level westerly jet stream in north eastern china these regional circulation pattern anomalies all create favourable conditions for decreased precipitation and increased temperatures hong et al 2020 li et al 2020a b zhang et al 2020 3 3 2 analysis of the contribution of large scale circulation indexes to the sdhi in section 2 3 1 the relationship between the four large scale circulation indexes and sdhi was spatially demonstrated we then quantified the relative importance of the four large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi by means of a stepwise multiple regression model this can also be called an overall analysis of the relationship between each circulation pattern by studying its contribution to the occurrence of cdhes in inner mongolia for the annual sdhi from 1981 to 2020 for the four large scale circulation model contribution analyses the four models lmg first genizi and car were selected for evaluation fig 9 the set of large scale circulation indexes within the multiple linear regression accounted for 43 39 of the annual sdhi variance in inner mongolia among the results obtained from the four models pdo and nao contributed more to sdhi changes than enso and amo indicating that pdo and nao have more significant effects on sdhi changes in inner mongolia the contribution ratio results for each pattern were greater than 14 for pdo and nao and between 11 03 and 19 53 for amo the contribution of enso to the variation in sdhi ranged from 0 01 to 1 6 which was the lowest contribution among the four large scale circulation indexes 3 3 3 wavelet analysis of large scale circulation indexes with sdhi it would be interesting to further explore the effects of the four large scale circulation indexes on the sdhi in inner mongolia both individually and under various combined scenarios therefore we examined the correlation between the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes based on the mwc and pwc methods fig 10 in fig 10 the black conical outline represents the local power which exceeds the 95 confidence level relative to the red noise and the lightly shaded area depicts the cone of influence coi the black arrow s direction indicates the relative phase relationship between sdhi and large scale circulation indexes the right phase arrow indicates the same phase the left phase arrow indicates the opposite phase and the legend indicates the correlation between sdhi and large scale circulation indexes baddoo et al 2015 guo et al 2020b fig 10 a d shows the partial wavelet coherence of the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes in inner mongolia for june july and august in the last 40 years the results in fig 10 a show the first significant resonance cycle of 3 5 months in the summer of 1990 for enso and sdhi a second significant resonance cycle of 6 7 months in the summer of 1991 1992 and the longest resonance cycle in 2013 july 2016 with a cumulative duration of about 6 8 months notably in addition to 2006 and 2013 there were also two short resonance cycles fig 10 b shows that sdhi and pdo presented significant resonance cycles of 3 6 months during july 1987 june 1993 and 4 5 months during june 2003 august 2004 as well as two resonance cycles lasting 2 3 months and 9 12 months respectively during 2006 2013 there were significant resonance cycles of 2 6 months between sdhi and nao during june 1988 june 1993 and 14 20 months during june 1986 august 1994 furthermore the phase angle changes indicated that nao and sdhi were positively correlated during this cycle fig 10 c the partial wavelet analysis results for sdhi and amo were not strongly continuous with a resonance cycle of 7 12 months during 2006 2020 but were strongly influenced by potential edge effects fig 10 d we applied mwc to study the combined effects of the sdhi and four large scale circulation indexes in inner mongolia under various scenarios the results are shown in fig 10 e o in the case of two two unions the resonance of enso which was the least important of the four large scale circulation indexes was significantly enhanced with sdhi after the union with the other three indicators whereas the pdo nao and amo which were relatively more important increased significantly after the two two union the union of pdo and nao appeared more than 32 months in the last 40 years of the resonance period but there is also the problem that it was highly influenced by potential edge effects a significant resonance cycle of 7 14 months existed in 1987 2003 after the union of nao and amo when three or more large scale circulation indexes were combined it was found that the wavelet energy between the large scale circulation indexes and sdhi was significantly enhanced in the combined case and the discontinuous coherence within the 2 month cycle was prevalent the coherence band was relatively consistent in each combined case for the period of 1993 2006 4 discussion compound extreme events can cause irreversible and significant damage to human society and the natural environment in recent years the frequency and intensity of compound dry and hot events have been increasing in several regions worldwide wu et al 2020 hao et al 2021 historical events have shown that extreme compound events often cause more damage and more losses than a single hazard and are more likely to lead to a cascade of hazards or even a natech event barriopedro et al 2011 rippey 2015 pescaroli and alexander 2018 ribeiro et al 2020 therefore this study uses temperature and precipitation station data and a standardised method that is similar to spi to construct a standardised dry and hot index sdhi analyse the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of cdhes in inner mongolia and explore the relationship between it and four large scale circulation indexes compared to existing research this study not only makes up for the lack of description of compound dry and hot events in arid and semi arid areas but also uses a variety of time scale data and a comprehensive idea of combining linear and nonlinear methods to analyze the relationship between large scale circulation indicators and sdhi for explore the relationship between them at the same time considering the calculation speed and accuracy four models in the multivariate stepwise regression framework are selected to quantify the relative importance of large scale circulation pattern indicators affecting the change of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia which makes up for the shortcomings of existing studies that only focus on spatial analysis on the one hand the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia increased from 1981 to 2020 and was more significantly affected by high temperature conditions than drought conditions which is consistent with the study of hao et al 2018b the studies that have been performed also show that based on the most basic physical principles taking into account multiple influences such as energy humidity and wind speed droughts have not changed much over the last 60 years by conducting regional studies it was found that temperature fluctuations are also one of the main causes of drought variations although it has been questioned that short term temperature changes are only one type of environmental response to drought and not a factor that exacerbates drought you et al 2011 sheffield et al 2012 however the conclusion that the frequency of extreme heat events has increased significantly in the context of global warming has been widely accepted compared to drought events where there is still more controversy over whether the trend of exacerbation is significant seneviratne et al 2014 guo et al 2020c on the other hand guo et al 2020b showed that the intensity of heat waves in inner mongolia increased when the values of indicators representing enso and pdo increased this is especially so for the pdo indicator which had a more significant effect on heat wave events in inner mongolia this is consistent with the finding that more stations in central inner mongolia passed the 0 05 significance level test for the relationship between sdhi and enso and pdo compared to other regions in this study zhang et al 2020 found that pdo and amo influenced extreme heat events in northern china with amo being more significant this finding was also reflected in section 3 3 of this study of the four large scale circulation indexes used in this study enso had the least significant performance and lacked spatial regularity compared to the other three categories recent studies also found that in the northern parts of south america southern africa and southeast asia there is a close relationship between the occurrence of cdhes and enso but the effect of enso on compound dry and hot events is very limited in the chinese warm season mukherjee et al 2020 wu et al 2021 however the description of the compound dry and hot events in this study was based only on temperature and precipitation at the monthly scale and a compound dry and hot event index sdhi was derived to characterise extreme drought and high temperature events using a standardised model based on the spi index hao et al 2018b in the future we can add more variables to study the compound dry and hot events on more detailed time scales for example we can add the consideration of potential evapotranspiration in the characterisation of drought hao et al 2019a hao et al 2019b and the use of a more accurate extreme hot index when describing temperature anomaly situations hao et al 2020 in this study we focused only on the response of compound dry and hot events to four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo but it has been demonstrated that the indian ocean dipole iod arctic oscillation ao initial pacific oscillation ipo and the east asian summer monsoon index easm also play a significant role in the occurrence of extreme precipitation and temperature events in northern china mao et al 2011 chen et al 2013 tong et al 2019 guo et al 2020c zhou et al 2020 moreover temperate cyclones anti cyclones influenced by the combination of atmospheric circulation patterns are important indicators of extreme weather generation in north eastern china cao et al 2018 deng et al 2018 the correlation analysis and significance test results indicate that the remote correlation between a single climate model pair and inland areas is only significant in a limited number of areas of inner mongolia thus the next step is to assess the joint influence of a variety of other circulation patterns under different combined scenarios in inner mongolia to further improve our understanding of the influence of cdhes in inland areas by large scale circulation indexes bothe et al 2010 shi et al 2017 tabari and willems 2018 5 conclusions this study combined the temperature and precipitation conditions in the inner mongolia region over the last 40 years it also constructed the index sdhi for monitoring compound dry and hot events in the region from two scales of drought and high temperature which performed well in describing extreme compound events in the inner mongolia region from 1981 to 2020 thereafter the characteristics of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia were portrayed in three capacities temporal spatial and frequency in addition we also studied the influence of four large scale circulation indexes on compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia during the summer the results showed the following 1 in terms of time the sdhi value in inner mongolia in the past 40 years has shown a significant decreasing trend at a rate of 0 04 year and the proportion of stations with different levels of dry and hot events every year has shown an increasing trend the rate of increase in the ratio of stations with abnormal dry and hot events was the highest at 0 24 year and the lowest rate was for moderate dry and hot events 0 09 year generally there was an overall trend of increasing severity of compound dry and hot events in inner mongolia from 1981 to 2020 2 spatially the sdhi values of more than 97 of the stations showed a decreasing trend the spi values of more than half of the stations showed a decreasing trend and the sti values of 86 96 of the stations showed an increasing trend in terms of significance the decreasing trend of spi values was mostly insignificant whereas the increasing sti values of each station mostly showed a significant state which indicates that it is highly likely that the increase in the severity of cdhes in inner mongolia in recent years is dominated by high temperature events from the results of the frequency of cdhes before the 21st century mild and moderate dry and hot events mainly occurred in inner mongolia and the severity of dry and hot events was higher in the eastern region since the 21st century extreme and exceptional dry and hot events occurred frequently and the severity was higher in the western region than in the eastern region 3 exploration from a linear theoretical approach revealed that four large scale circulation indexes enso pdo nao and amo show different characteristics in their influence on cdhes in inner mongolia the effect of enso on cdhes in inner mongolia was usually insignificant with 57 39 of stations showing a positive correlation between sdhi and enso whereas the rest showed a negative correlation when the pdo is in the negative phase it tends to bring cdhes to inner mongolia and such effects mainly occur in the central and western regions more than 90 of the stations were influenced by the negative phase of the nao and were more likely to trigger a cdhe the positive phase of the amo had an impact on the occurrence of dry and hot events at more than 95 of the stations with more than 80 of the stations having a significant impact the contribution of large scale circulation indexes was quantified in a stepwise multiple regression framework and the results of the four patterns corresponded well with enso having the lowest relative importance for sdhi changes and amo the highest 4 by using wavelet analysis in a nonlinear framework it was found that among the four large scale circulation indexes enso and sdhi had the lowest resonance and the worst continuity nao and pdo had relatively good resonance and the resonance between amo and sdhi was more influenced by the potential edge effect furthermore the continuity of the resonance cycle was found to be better and the coherence was noticeably enhanced after considering different joint cases of the four large scale circulation indexes credit authorship contribution statement yao kang writing original draft investigation enliang guo writing review editing supervision validation yongfang wang supervision

3031,turbidity current intrusion often occurs in canals approach channels and tributary areas of large reservoirs causing sedimentation problems in these environments many models and semi empirical equations have been proposed to calculate flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion under an assumption that the current front can keep propagating freely in the channel before dying out but the effect of the finite length of closed end channels has rarely been considered a self similar solution to the vertical two dimensional model for turbidity currents is used to obtain the equation of the maximum possible length for the intrusion of turbidity currents the maximum possible length is then used to modify an existing discharge equation for turbidity current intrusion in long channels and establish a more general calculation method that can be applied for intrusion in closed end channels data from two existing flume experiments are used to calibrate the derived equation of sediment transport rate for turbidity current intrusion field measurements obtained from several tributary mouths in the xiaolangdi reservoir are also used to calibrate the derived intrusion discharge equation the agreement between predictions and observations as well as the comparison between the proposed calculation method and the one before modification demonstrate that the intrusion discharge is not only determined by the depth of turbid water and sediment concentration at the inlet of the tributary channel but also influenced by the ratio of the real intrusion length

sediment particles 1 introduction turbidity current intrusion occurs in connected channels where the sediment laden flow in one channel usually the main channel intrudes into another channel with a relatively quiescent and sediment free water body due to the density difference and propagates in the lower layer the sediment carried by intruding turbidity currents usually causes sedimentation in canals approach channels harbor docks and tributary areas of large reservoirs gole et al 1973 lin mehta 1986 wang et al 2014 lin and mehta 1997 made an order of magnitude estimate of the contribution of tide and turbidity current intrusion to the amount of deposition within a tidal dock and found the latter plays a dominant role in reservoirs with tributary areas the sedimentation induced by turbidity current intrusion often forms a sandbar at the mouth of the tributary which blocks the water release from the tributary area to the main river fan morris 1992 for example the original storage capacity of the guanting reservoir was 2 27 109 m3 57 of which was distributed in one of the tributaries the weishui river the top elevation of the sandbar at the mouth of the weishui river had risen from 463 m in 1960 to 467 m in 1979 wang hu 2003 in the xiaolangdi reservoir the amount of deposition in its largest tributary of the zhenshui river reached 0 24 109 m3 and the sandbar at the tributary mouth was 5 78 m in height leaving an unavailable storage capacity of 0 23 109 m3 in the tributary wang et al 2014 generally speaking the phenomenon studied here belongs to a non constant volume viscous and particle driven gravity current in homogeneous ambient according to the classification by ungarish 2009 some similarities are shared by the phenomenon of the turbidity current intrusion and the arrested saline wedge grubert 1980 keulegan 1966 nakai arita 2002 in the case of a saline wedge a fresh water from upstream sources flowing out of the tributary channel is necessary to provide a pressure head and the interfacial shear force to balance the net horizontal pressure force towards the upstream of the tributary however the fresh water from upstream sources is not necessary in the case of turbidity current intrusion because a state of equilibrium can be attained as sediment free water is detrained from the lower layer bolla pittaluga et al 2018 and forms a reverse flow in the upper layer with flow continuity being maintained at each cross section along the length of the tributary channel toniolo et al 2007 assumed that the detrainment discharge is proportional to the settling velocity of sediment and fan 2011 established an empirical relationship between the detrainment discharge and the richardson number of the underflow but none of these relationships have been used in previous mathematical models for turbidity current intrusion xu et al 2020 the front speed of a turbidity current uf has frequently been studied benjamin 1968 huppert simpson 1980 meiburg kneller 2010 but less attention has been paid to turbidity current intrusion lin and mehta 1986 conducted an experimental study on turbidity current intrusion and found that the ratio of uf to a densimetric velocity u δ g h 0 δ ρ ρ m was a constant 0 43 during the initial stage of intrusion where g was the gravitational acceleration h 0 was the water depth at the entrance δ ρ was the density difference between turbid and clear waters and ρ m was the mean density between turbid and clear waters the front speed decreases as it propagates further into the tributary channel due to the settling of sediment lin and mehta 1986 also obtained an empirical relationship between u δ u f and the instantaneous intrusion length lt lin and mehta 1997 divided the propagating process after the initial stage into an inertia bouyance phase and a viscous force dominated phase and observed that the front speeds in these phases were in proportion to l t 1 2 and l t 4 respectively the turbidity current intrusion will develop into a steady state if the flow and sediment conditions in the main channel are kept steady and the spatial variation in flow velocity and sediment concentration along the tributary channel are still not well understood practically the water and sediment influxes at the tributary entrance are of more interest mcdowell 1971 proposed that the inflow velocity at the entrance in the lower layer is equal to g h 1 δ ρ ρ m where h 1 is the depth of lower layer at the entrance h 1 is a unknow variable so that the conclusion of mcdowell 1971 can not be used for prediction han 2003 derived a discharge equation for turbidity current intrusion in which the depth ratio h 1 h 0 is related to an energy loss coefficient the sediment transport rate str at the entrance in the lower layer is often estimated as the product of the discharge into the tributary and the sediment concentration at the entrance the vertical two dimensional 2d flow and sediment transport equations gao stenstrom 2018 van rijn 1986 wu 2007 are often used to describe the turbidity current intrusion and analytical solutions can be obtained with proper assumptions for example lin 1987 derived the equation for the longitudinal variation of mean sediment concentration and the flow velocity equations in the upper and lower layers by neglecting sediment diffusion in both the horizontal and vertical directions and momentum convection and diffusion in the horizontal direction the derivation of lin 1987 showed that the flow velocity of turbidity current intrusion can be expressed in a self similar form guetter and jain 1991 reduced the vertical 2d governing equations to a system of ordinary differential equations and found an analytical solution by performing integration over the water depth and using similarity profiles for concentration and velocity dou et al 2020 used a horizontal 2d morphodynamic model to simulate the evolution processes of tributary mouth sandbars in the xiaolangdi reservoir caused by turbidity current intrusion if the tributary channel is sufficiently long the sediment concentration will be zero when the front propagation terminates at a certain distance from the tributary entrance see fig 1 a which is called the equilibrium or arrested length l e the equilibrium length is different from the run out distance of the turbidity current generated by the release of a finite volume of a dense particle suspension dade huppert 1995 since the upstream boundary is closed in the latter situation mcdowell 1971 called the body of turbidity current a stationary sediment wedge and proposed the sediment flux from the outside water into the tributary can be roughly estimated as the product of the settling velocity of particles and the arrested wedge length the interference of gravity currents with the far end boundary is often assumed to be negligible in many theoretical models such as the box model and the lubrication theory formulation ungarish 2009 whereas it may play an important role in turbidity current intrusion if the tributary channel is shorter than l e the front will be reflected by the end wall and a front wave in the opposite direction will be generated in this case a steady state different from that in a long channel will be achieved with a larger depth of the underflow see fig 1b as it was observed in the experiment of lin and mehta 1986 however most existing equations for calculating the flow and sediment transport rates of turbidity current intrusion do not take into account the effect of limited channel length in this study a formula for the equilibrium length l e is derived from an analytical solution to a set of simplified vertical 2d flow and sediment transport equations proposed by guetter and jain 1991 with the influence of the relative depth of the lower layer to the total depth being explicitly expressed then we assume the intensity of intrusion is positively related to the ratio of the tributary length to the maximum possible value of l e and modified an existing method for predicting flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion in a sufficient long channel by introducing this ratio the model parameter in the proposed method is calibrated with data from flume experiments and field measurements in the xiaolangdi reservoir and the prediction accuracy is compared with that of an existing method the significant correlation is demonstrated between the relative intrusion length and the relative intensity of intrusion and a k fold cross validation is conducted with the aggregate data mixing the measurements in the flume experiments and the xiaolangdi reservoir to investigate the robustness of the proposed method 2 development of methodology 2 1 maximum possible intrusion length considering a tributary channel with a uniform width and horizontal bottom the vertical 2d equations for steady incompressible flow and sediment transport are adopted as the governing equations for turbidity current intrusion guetter jain 1991 which can be written as 1 u x v y 0 2 u u x v u y 1 ρ n p x 1 ρ n τ xy y 3 0 p y ρ g 4 u c x v c y y ε y c y ω c y where x and y are the coordinates along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively u and v are velocity components of the fluid phase in the x and y directions respectively p pressure τxy shear stress component applied to the face normal to the x direction ρn reference density of the turbid water which is chosen as the density at the downstream end g gravitational acceleration c volumetric sediment concentration εy mass diffusion coefficient ω is the settling velocity of sediment particles the first equation is the continuity equation for the fluid phase the second and third equations are the momentum equations for the fluid phase in the x and y directions respectively and the last one is the continuity equation for the sediment phase guetter and jain 1991 assumed that the vertical profiles for velocity sediment concentration and shear stress are self similar and defined the arbitrary functions for these profiles as 5 f η u u s h η c c n c b c n t η τ xy τ b where f η h η and t η are the normalized similarity profiles for velocity sediment concentration and shear stress respectively us water surface velocity cb the concentration

integration over the total depth h x on equations eqs 1 to 4 and substituting for u c and τxy from eq 5 guetter and jain 1991 obtained 6 c 0 d dx u s 2 h g σ c 1 d dx c b c n h 2 g 2 d dx h 2 τ b ρ n

water respectively and c 0 to c 5 and s are parameters related to the integrals of the functions of f η h η and t η and their expressions are given in appendix a according to the argument by macagno and rouse 1961 that the interface between the upper and lower layers is the plane of maximum shear stress in which the interfacial shear stress can be related to the bottom shear stress τb ρn is written as follows guetter jain 1991 9 τ b ρ n f u s 2 where f is a constant dependent on both the bottom friction factor and the velocity profile see appendix a for details the following normalized

water depth at the tributary inlet by substituting eqs 9 10 and 11 into eqs 6 to 8 and neglecting the inertia terms in eqs 6 and 8 guetter and jain 1991 obtained a reduced system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations in ϕ and θ the solution of these two equations is expressed by guetter jain 1991 12 ϕ 1 δ 1 1 θ n 3 1 3 γ 6 4 λ 13 θ δ 1 1 δ 1 1 θ n 3 1 3 γ 6 4 λ 3 4 3 θ n in which 14

the self similar profiles of the hydrodynamic factors or sediment concentration guetter and jain 1991 adopted a set of simple assumed self similar profiles with a strong hypothesis that the interface between the turbid and clear water layers is fixed at η 0 5 thus these parameters are treated as constants in their study however the vertical distributions of velocity and concentration in turbidity current intrusion could be influenced by the finite channel length it is assumed herein that the influence of the finite channel length could be reflected in the self similar profiles by an undetermined parameter of λ yi h where yi is the height of the interface between the turbid and clear water layers measured from the bottom thus the expressions of eq 5 are assumed as 16a f η 1 η λ a η λ 16b h η 1 η 1 λ 2 η λ 1 η λ 16c t η τ i τ b 1 η 1 λ η λ 1 1 λ τ i τ b 1 η η λ where τi is the shear stress at the interface the normalized velocity profile eq 16a should satisfy the continuity condiiton i e λ 1 f η d η 0 λ f η d η therefore the parameter a in eq 16a is determined as 17 a 1 λ λ using eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate c 2 c 4 s and f eq 15 finally turns into see appendix a for

at the tributary entrance and a particle diameter fig 2 shows the variations of p λ depending on λ where p λ increases and then decreases as λ increases the maximum value of p and the corresponding λ become larger as the ratio between the interfacial and bottom friction factors α 2 is smaller some existing flume experiments indicate that the mean value of α 2 is about 0 25 middleton 1966 zhang 1998 by taking α 2 as 0 25 it can be calculated that the maximum value of p is 0 674 at λ 0 625 therefore it can be inferred from eq 18 that the maximum possible intrusion length is 19 l max 2 696 2 σ g c b 0 h 0 3 ω 2 f 2 1 3 h 0 2 2 flow and sediment transport rates in the region near the tributary entrance the depth of the turbid flow in the main channel decreases to form the underflow in the tributary channel which is similar with the phenomenon of turbidity current plunge akiyama stefan 1984 parker toniolo 2007 xia et al 2017 combining the energy equation and momentum equation between the cross sections before and after plunging han 2003 derived the discharge formula for turbidity current intrusion which is written as 20 q 0 k δ t g 1 2 h 0 3 2 k 2 1 ξ 2 3 ξ 3 where q 0 is the intrusion discharge per unit width δ t c 0 ρ s ρ w c 0 ρ s 1 c 0 ρ w where c 0 is the depth averaged volumetric sediment concentration at the tributary inlet k is the discharge coefficient and ξ is the energy loss coefficient the influence factor of ξ is still not clear in practice k is calibrated for each area to be studied and its value shows large variance among different tributaries and even during different intrusion processes in the same tributary wang et al 2016 incorporated eq 20 into a numerical model coupling open channel flow and turbidity current and demonstrated that the turbidity current in the main river was weaken due to lateral intrusion but the predicted intrusion discharges were not directly verified letting dk d ξ 0 it can be found that the maximum of k is 0 439 at ξ 2 3 3 therefore it is assumed in the present study that the maximum possible intrusion discharge is 21 q max 0 439 δ t g 1 2 h 0 3 2 the actual intrusion discharge is predicted to be q max multiplied by a damping factor related to the ratio of the predicted intrusion length l to the maximum possible intrusion length which is written as 22 q 0 l l max α q max where α is a parameter to be calibrated the predicted intrusion length is defined as the minimum of l max and the tributary channel length l c i e 23 l min l max l c the above equation implies that the front of the underflow will keep advancing until it is blocked by the channel end or all the sediments settle out note that l tends to overestimate the real intrusion length and it is only used as an intermediate variable to construct the predictive equation for intrusion discharge when the interface elevation of the intruding current is unknown the str for turbidity current intrusion qs 0 is expressed as the product of the intrusion discharge and the depth averaged sediment concentration at the tributary inlet lin metha 1997 which is written as 24 q s 0 ρ s c 0 q 0 in summary eqs 19 and 21 24 consist the calculation procedure of flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion in closed end channels which of course are also applicable in the situation of sufficiently long channels 3 data source the data from two sets of flume experiments conducted by lin and metha 1986 and lin 1987 were used to evaluate the parameter α in eq 22 by comparing the measured and predicted strs these experiments were both conducted in t shaped flumes see fig 3 but with different flume sizes the first set was performed at the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station wes with a 9 1 m long 0 46 m deep and 0 23 m wide closed end channel orthogonally connected to a 100 m main channel with the same cross sectional geometry lin metha 1986 the second set was performed at the coastal engineering laboratory coel of the university of florida with a 14 7 m long 0 19 m deep and 0 1 m wide closed end channel orthogonally connected to a 4 26 m long 0 19 m deep and 0 16 m wide main channel lin 1987 the experimental procedures in the above experiments were similar where a steady turbid flow in the main channel was established with a gate at the tributary entrance closed and with the clear water inside the tributary channel the gate was then opened to allow the turbid water to intrude into the tributary channel along the lower layer the densimetric froude number of the turbidity current front in the coel experiments ranged between 0 35 and 1 50 and only two of those measured froude numbers were larger than 1 0 lin 1987 ellison and turner 1959 and princevac et al 2005 both found the ratio between basal and density interface drag was a function of the froude number according to the empirical evidence of wells and dorrell 2021 this ratio is at the order about 0 1 when the froude number is smaller than 1 0 therefore the interfacial drag due to the entrainment of ambient water is considerably small compared with the basal frictional drag the parameter α was also evaluated in the prototype environment by comparing the measured and predicted discharges of turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir the reservoir is located in the lower part of the middle yellow river in china which is a multipurpose project with the benefits on flood control sediment management water supply and power generation wang solymár 1997 there are 12 tributaries joining the main river in the reservoir area since the annual runoff of the tributaries are very small and the water storage in the tributary area comes from the ponding of the main river these tributaries can be treated as closed end side channels the storage capacity of the 12 tributaries occupies about 40 of the total storage capacity of the reservoir 12 65 109 m3 with the biggest one to have a storage capacity of 1 767 109 m3 wang et al 2016 the sedimentation in tributaries due to turbidity current intrusion causes storage loss that is hard to recover because the effects of sediment sluicing and drawdown flushing kondolf et al 2014 are highly dependent on the erosion intensity of floods from the main river therefore the tributary deposition has been a great concern of the reservoir managers and the yellow river conservancy commission had carried out several runs of field measurement on turbidity current intrusion around the tributary mouths of the yanxi river xiyang river zhenshui river and dayu river during the period 2003 to 2005 and 2010 the study area is shown in fig 4 with the tributaries of interest marked with red lines table 1 is a brief summary of the topographical characteristics of the four tributaries the storage capacity is measured under the designed normal water level of 275 m and the topography before the operation of the reservoir the width of the entrance is measured across the bottom of the tributary channel rather than the free surface because the intruding current propagates in the bottom layer 4 results and discussion according to lin and mehta 1986 a vertical circulation gyre often appeared at the tributary entrance due to flow shear between the main channel and the tributary which was highly turbulent and had considerable amount of vertical lateral and longitudinal mixing of the suspended sediment thus in the following calculations it is assumed that the vertical distribution of sediment concentration is almost uniform at the entrance of the tributary channel and cb 0 is replaced with c 0 when utilizing eq 19 the bottom friction factor f 2 in eq 19 is taken as 0 02 4 1 comparison with laboratory data a total of 27 tests were conducted in the two sets of experiments by lin and metha 1986 and lin 1987 of which 12 tests can be used to calculate the sediment transport rates from the measured data table 2 lists the experimental data from the 12 tests which were used for calibration and the calculated results using the proposed method with the calibrated parameter α in eq 22 the settling velocity of sediment was measured by settling column analysis and the measured str q s0 was calculated as the mass of the deposited sediment divided by the channel width and the duration of the test according to the calculated results there were 4 tests wes 13 coel 3 coel 7 and coel 8 in which the turbidity currents would stop propagating before reaching the closed end since l l max 1 and the development of intrusion length would be constrained by the limited channel length in the remaining 8 tests the correlation between l l max and q s0 qs max q s0 is the measured value and qs max ρ 0 c 0 q max is shown in fig 5 and the correlation coefficient is 0 82 if the four data points at l l max 1 are not considered the correlation coefficient can rise to 0 90 therefore it can be seen that a shorter channel length tends to reduce the str of turbidity current intrusion by dividing both sides of eq 22 by q max and taking their logarithm the parameter α is calibrated to be 1 143 by linear regression with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 64 achieved and the comparison between the calculated and measured str is shown in fig 6 the largest str in the coel tests is 134 times of the smallest value while the variation in the wes tests is much smaller two other methods are applied to calculate the str the first one is the equations proposed by han 2003 i e eqs 20 and 24 with the recommended coefficient of discharge of k 0 367 by han 2003 and also a recalibrated k 0 260 respectively the recommended k corresponds to ξ 0 80 and the recalibrated k corresponds to ξ 0 92 the second method proposed by lin 1987 uses the following equation 25 q s 0 β 2 g ρ s ρ w ρ w ρ s 1 2 h 0 c 0 3 2 lin 1987 used the experimental data from the wes and coel tests to evaluate the average value of h 0 in eq 25 and calibrate β which lead to the regression equation 26 q s 0 0 015 h 0 c 0 3 2 note that the units of qs 0 h 0 and c 0 in the above equation are g m2 min cm mg l the performances of the three methods are summarized in table 3 the statistics chosen for assessing the performances in table 3 are coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape and the intrusion length ratio ilr method refers to the method proposed in this study the three statistics of the ilr method are all better than those of the method of lin 1987 the r2 and rmse of the results from the equation of han 2003 are slightly better than those from the ilr method but the mape is much larger than that from the ilr method in addition the equation of han 2003 gives the worst prediction among the methods in table 3 in terms of mape after recalibration the equation of han 2003 achieved the highest r2 and lowest rmse values but the mape was still over two times of that from the ilr method the reason for this unbalanced performance of the equation of han 2003 on the three statistics is that the rmse and r2 are more sensitive to occasional large errors thompson 1990 if a non uniform distribution of sediment concentration at the inlet needs to be considered one could replace cb 0 with c 0 multiplied by a coefficient for non uniform concentration distribution larger than 1 and it can be expected that the calibrated α would be larger according to eqs 19 and 22 4 2 comparison with field observation as the flow pattern in the main river of the xiaolangdi reservoir is already stratified during the period of field survey h 0 in eq 21 should be interpreted as the depth of the turbidity current at the entrance which is calculated as the elevation difference between the vertical interface and the bottom since the elevation of the interface between the clear and turbid water varies across the river see fig 7 a the location of the interface along the primary sampling vertical the vertical capturing the maximum velocity is used to calculate h 0 the bottom elevation is determined at the place where the point velocity is zero the intrusion discharge is calculated as the sum of the discharge through each subsection which is calculated based on the vertical distribution of current velocity the discharge calculated in this way is divided by the width of the tributary entrance in order to compare it with the model prediction the distributions of current velocity along sampling verticals at different distances to the bank are shown in fig 7b the sediment concentration and median diameter d 50 of sediment at the entrance are taken as their mean value along the primary sampling vertical which are then used to calculate the settling velocity of sediment particles in turbid water with the equation by rowe 1987 examples of distributions of sediment concentration and median diameter are depicted in fig 7c and 7d along different verticals at a cross section located at the entrance of the zhenshui river an abrupt change of sediment concentration often appeared at the lowest point of the sampled concentration profile see fig 7c due to the existence of a soft mud layer near the bottom which made it difficult to determine the bed surface elevation for calculating c b0 the uncertainty of bed surface elevation has less impact on the evaluation of c 0 than it has on c b0 in this sense adopting c 0 to substitute c b0 has its own advantage a criterion of 3 kg m3 is adopted to determine the location of the interface between the ambient water and the underflow from the vertical distribution of sediment concentration the longitudinal profile of the tributary channel bed is characterized by a reach with nearly horizontal bed surface or gradually descending bed towards the upstream due to the development of a sandbar at the tributary mouth and a reach with the large slope of the original tributary channel the method to determine the tributary channel length l c is illustrated in fig 8 with the longitudinal profile of the zhenshui river measured in 2010 depicted firstly the elevation of the interface between clear and turbid water along the tributary channel is assumed to be constant as it is at the entrance with the intersection of the interface and the longitudinal profile being determined the constant interface elevation assumption had also been adopted in the study of ponded turbidity currents toniolo et al 2007 then l c is calculated as the distance from the intersection to the entrance of the tributary table 4 shows the field measured data around the four tributary entrances which were used to calibrate the proposed model and the calculated results the largest intrusion discharge record number 16 is 68 times of the smallest value record number 11 by comparing l max and l c it can be found that only in the zhenshui river see record number 16 and 19 21 in table 4 the intruding turbidity currents have the chance to propagate freely i e l c l max while the propagation of turbidity currents is constrained by the topography in the other three tributaries fig 9 is a histogram of the absolute percentage errors of the intrusion discharge per unit width from three different methods there are eight times the errors of the original method of han 2003 i e eq 20 with k 0 367 are over 200 of the measured values while the other two methods have not produced such large errors after recalibration the method of han 2003 with k 0 157 gives less predictions with errors larger than 120 but errors in the range of 30 to 120 appear more often the ilr method further reduces the frequency of error in the range of 60 to 120 compared with the han 2003 method after recalibration the correlation between l l max and q 0 q max is shown in fig 10 and the correlation coefficient is 0 74 therefore it can be seen that a shorter channel length tends to reduce the turbidity current intrusion discharge the ranges of l l max in the xiyang river and zhenshui river are much larger than they are in the other tributaries which is probably due to their longer channel lengths the parameter α in eq 22 is calibrated to be 0 458 fig 11 exhibits the comparison between the calculated and measured intrusion discharges in general the method of han 2003 has a strong tendency to overestimate the intrusion discharge as can be seen in fig 11a the two data points with measured q 0 3 14 and 4 08 m2 s are from the records number 17 and 16 of the zhenshui river with the corresponding h 0 changing from 7 81 to 3 30 m usually the intrusion discharge decreases as h 0 decreases although c 0 is also an influencing factor but these two data points show a contrary trend therefore all the three methods give poor predictions for these two observations the method of han 2003 after recalibration applies a 57 reduction to the results of the original method of han 2003 which makes a pronounced improvement in the range q 0 2 m2 s but the results of the ilr method are still closer to the y x line in the same range the intrusion discharges underestimated by the method of han 2003 are more severely underestimated after recalibration a statistical evaluation of the performance of the three methods is shown in table 5 the values of r2 for the three methods are all lower than those in the flume experiments in the former section the reason might be that the environment for turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir is much more complex than the rectangular flume however the proposed ilr method still outperformed the method of han 2003 in terms of the three statistics whether it is recalibrated or not the r2 value obtained from the method of han 2003 is negative which means the prediction is no better than just taking the mean value of the collected q 0 data 4 3 cross validation with all the data lin and mehta 1997 stated that the problem of scaling the results from the laboratory to the prototype is at least as challenging as that for non settling gravity flows investigated in the laboratory as can be seen from the results presented in the previous two sections the parameter α in the proposed method and k in the method of han 2003 are quite different when they are calibrated with laboratory and field data therefore it is important to investigate the performance of different methods on the whole data set the purpose is not to give a suggested parameter that can be applied in both laboratory and field situations but to shed light on the robustness of different methods for calculating flow and sediment transport rates the laboratory data from lin and mehta 1986 and lin 1987 and field data from the xiaolangdi reservoir are put together to form a data set of 38 observations then a sixfold cross validation burman 1989 deisenroth et al 2020 is conducted on these data using the proposed method and the method of han 2003 the variable to be predicted is reconstructed as y q 0 q max or q s0 ρ s c 0 q max so that the predictive accuracy of intrusion discharge and str can be compared for the proposed method the predictive equation is transformed into y l l max α for the method of han 2003 the equation turns into the easiest form for regression i e y k in which the relationship between k and k is simply written as k 0 439 k fig 12 shows the results of repeating the sixfold cross validation for 1000 times where the average rmse is used to represent the generalization error the average rmses of the han 2003 method and the ilr method vary between 0 36 0 63 and 0 29 0 50 respectively although the method of han 2003 occasionally performs better 58 out of 1000 times than the proposed ilr method the average rmse of the latter is at least 0 1 smaller than the former in most cases therefore the proposed method is more robust to a wide range of flow and sediment conditions as compared with the method of han 2003 4 4 model limitation and uncertainty analysis in order to solve the governing eqs 6 to 8 analytically an important assumption is that settling velocity and depth of turbidity current are constant within the intrusion length it is well known that the sediment concentration has a significant influence on the settling velocity wu 2007 as the sediment concentration decreases along the side channel the settling velocity in the turbidity current will not be constant in fact on the other hand although the longitudinal variation of the turbidity current depth was small in the experiments of lin 1987 the constant depth assumption is still lack of support from field observations in large tributaries in the deriving process from eq 15 to eq 18 a set of normalized profiles are specified for velocity concentration and shear stress however it is emphasized that the general solution i e eq 15 does not depend upon the assumed profiles although different forms of the vertical distributions of velocity and concentration for turbidity currents abad et al 2011 cantero chinchilla et al 2015 islam imran 2010 nourmohammadi et al 2011 have been proposed guetter and jain 1991 pointed out the particular results from eq 15 are not very sensitive to small changes in the profiles being adopted in order to evaluate the impact on the prediction results after adopting different vertical distribution of velocity and sediment concentration three kinds of combination of different expressions of f η and h η are proposed as follows type i uniform distribution in two layers for velocity parabolic and uniform distribution for sediment concentration in the upper and lower layer respectively linear distribution for shear stress type ii the velocity profile is parabolic in the upper layer and similar to a submerged plane wall jet in the lower layer the other distributions are the same with type i type iii the sediment concentration vanishes in the upper layer has a parabolic distribution in the lower layer the other distributions are the same with type ii type i combination eq 16 is the one used in previous sections of this paper the velocity profile in the lower layer in type ii was proposed by cantero chinchilla et al 2015 the modified expressions of f η and h η in type ii and iii can be found in appendix b table 6 shows the variation of the calibrated parameter α and model performance under type ii or iii combination compared with type i type ii and iii combination would lead to an increase and decrease of the calculated maximum possible intrusion length refer to appendix b for the proof respectively hence influencing the model parameter α the comparison in table shows that adopting complex description of the self similar profiles does not necessarily mean better prediction with the available laboratory and field data from the above sections the velocity and concentration profiles in type i achieved moderate prediction accuracy note that the parameter α 2 and f 2 in eq 18 are assigned with fixed values if they are also treated as parameters that need to be calibrated the difference of model performance among the three types of profile combination are expected to be further narrowed down as for the turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir the irregular cross sectional profiles of the tributaries and the angles between the main river and tributaries might have a great influence which are however not investigated in the present study the turbidity current events in the main river and tributaries in the xiaolangdi reservoir are unsteady processes however the proposed method and other existing analytical methods are all developed for the steady flow field which might be another major source of error in the attempt to predict flow and sediment transport rates in field conditions 5 conclusions many turbidity current intrusion processes happen in closed end channels but studies on turbidity currents seldom focus on the effect of limited channel length on their evolution the fundamental assumption for establishing the proposed method to calculate flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion is that existing equations for intrusion discharge only consider flow and sediment conditions around the tributary inlet which can be modified by introducing a damping factor related to the ratio between the channel length and the maximum possible intrusion length the maximum possible intrusion length is derived based an analytical solution to a set of vertical 2d governing equations for flow and sediment transport with self similar profiles adopted for vertical distributions of velocity sediment concentration and shear stress in stratified flows compared with existing methods the proposed one needs only two additional input the channel length and the settling velocity which is easy to obtain from the measured data the proposed method had an advantage to control the mape when used to calculate strs of turbidity current intrusion in the existing laboratory experiments when used to predict intrusion discharges in the xiaolangdi reservoir the proposed ilr method outperformed the existing method at all three statistics of r2 rmse and mape the significant correlation between the ilr and the relative intrusion intensity is discovered in both laboratory experiments and field observations the powers to the ilr are calibrated to be 1 143 and 0 458 in laboratory and field conditions respectively indicating the damping effect is probably greater in the former conditions the ilr method also improves the robustness of the existing method since it performs better in the cross validation with the mixed laboratory and field data future studies are essential to improve the proposed method to consider more complex topography around the confluence zone and along the tributary channel and the longitudinal variations of settling velocity and turbidity current depth the turbidity current discharges at the upstream and downstream cross sections of the tributary mouth along the main river and the intrusion discharge are often reported to be unbalanced in prototype observations therefore approaches to minimize the influence arising from the uncertainty of field measurements also need to be investigated the intrusion discharges of water and sediment can be viewed as additional lateral source terms of the governing equations for 1d numerical modelling of turbidity currents in the main river which can be expressed with the proposed equations however a criterion to determine whether the intrusion has reached the equilibrium state needs to be developed before numerical simulation of unsteady process can be achieved credit

jain 1991 in a recent study of cantero chinchilla et al 2015 a semi empirical velocity profile for the lower layer was proposed as b1 u u max 4 28 y z i 0 6 1 y z i 2 2 4 28 η λ 0 6 1 η λ 2 2 where u max is the maximum velocity in the lower layer this velocity profile is adopted in this section and the profile in the upper layer is assumed to be parabolic to satisfy a smooth transition between the two layers therefore the velocity profile along the whole water depth is constructed as b2 f η u u s 1 η 1 λ 2 1 η λ 4 28 u max u s η λ 0 6 1 η λ 2 2 η λ again from the continuity condition λ 1 f η d

1 η 1 λ 2 1 η λ 5 49 1 λ λ η λ 0 6 1 η λ 2 2 η λ the similarity profiles for sediment concentration and shear stress still adopt eq 16b and eq 16c then the expression for c 2 c 4 and c 11 can be obtained as b5 c 2 1 λ 0 25 λ 0 2 b6 c 4 0 537 1 λ b7 c 1 1 0 667 1 λ combing eq 9 with eq a3 and b7 yields b8 f 0 056 f 2 1 λ 2 λ 2 from eq 16c a2 a8 and b4 the expression of s is obtained b9 s 0 67 λ α 2 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 0 67 1 λ λ substituting the expression of c 2 c 4 f and s into eq 15 the normalized equilibrium intrusion length is written as b10 l e h 0 4 2 σ g c b 0 h 0 3 ω 2 f 2 1 3 p λ p λ 8

decreasing trend with increasing λ still hold in eq b10 the maximum value of p is 0 834 when α 2 is 0 25 which only leads to a slight change of the coefficient in eq 19 from 2 696 to 3 336 the sediment concentration profile h η can be replaced with one following the increasing trend towards the bed for example an alternative choice of h η can be constructed by using a parabolic distribution as b11 h η 0 η λ η λ 1 2 η λ by adopting eq b2 b11 and 16c for the self similar profiles for flow velocity sediment concentration and shear stress the normalized equilibrium intrusion length can be

eq 18 the maximum value of p is 0 311 when α 2 is 0 25 which only leads to the change of the coefficient in eq 19 from 2 696 to 1 244 
3031,turbidity current intrusion often occurs in canals approach channels and tributary areas of large reservoirs causing sedimentation problems in these environments many models and semi empirical equations have been proposed to calculate flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion under an assumption that the current front can keep propagating freely in the channel before dying out but the effect of the finite length of closed end channels has rarely been considered a self similar solution to the vertical two dimensional model for turbidity currents is used to obtain the equation of the maximum possible length for the intrusion of turbidity currents the maximum possible length is then used to modify an existing discharge equation for turbidity current intrusion in long channels and establish a more general calculation method that can be applied for intrusion in closed end channels data from two existing flume experiments are used to calibrate the derived equation of sediment transport rate for turbidity current intrusion field measurements obtained from several tributary mouths in the xiaolangdi reservoir are also used to calibrate the derived intrusion discharge equation the agreement between predictions and observations as well as the comparison between the proposed calculation method and the one before modification demonstrate that the intrusion discharge is not only determined by the depth of turbid water and sediment concentration at the inlet of the tributary channel but also influenced by the ratio of the real intrusion length

sediment particles 1 introduction turbidity current intrusion occurs in connected channels where the sediment laden flow in one channel usually the main channel intrudes into another channel with a relatively quiescent and sediment free water body due to the density difference and propagates in the lower layer the sediment carried by intruding turbidity currents usually causes sedimentation in canals approach channels harbor docks and tributary areas of large reservoirs gole et al 1973 lin mehta 1986 wang et al 2014 lin and mehta 1997 made an order of magnitude estimate of the contribution of tide and turbidity current intrusion to the amount of deposition within a tidal dock and found the latter plays a dominant role in reservoirs with tributary areas the sedimentation induced by turbidity current intrusion often forms a sandbar at the mouth of the tributary which blocks the water release from the tributary area to the main river fan morris 1992 for example the original storage capacity of the guanting reservoir was 2 27 109 m3 57 of which was distributed in one of the tributaries the weishui river the top elevation of the sandbar at the mouth of the weishui river had risen from 463 m in 1960 to 467 m in 1979 wang hu 2003 in the xiaolangdi reservoir the amount of deposition in its largest tributary of the zhenshui river reached 0 24 109 m3 and the sandbar at the tributary mouth was 5 78 m in height leaving an unavailable storage capacity of 0 23 109 m3 in the tributary wang et al 2014 generally speaking the phenomenon studied here belongs to a non constant volume viscous and particle driven gravity current in homogeneous ambient according to the classification by ungarish 2009 some similarities are shared by the phenomenon of the turbidity current intrusion and the arrested saline wedge grubert 1980 keulegan 1966 nakai arita 2002 in the case of a saline wedge a fresh water from upstream sources flowing out of the tributary channel is necessary to provide a pressure head and the interfacial shear force to balance the net horizontal pressure force towards the upstream of the tributary however the fresh water from upstream sources is not necessary in the case of turbidity current intrusion because a state of equilibrium can be attained as sediment free water is detrained from the lower layer bolla pittaluga et al 2018 and forms a reverse flow in the upper layer with flow continuity being maintained at each cross section along the length of the tributary channel toniolo et al 2007 assumed that the detrainment discharge is proportional to the settling velocity of sediment and fan 2011 established an empirical relationship between the detrainment discharge and the richardson number of the underflow but none of these relationships have been used in previous mathematical models for turbidity current intrusion xu et al 2020 the front speed of a turbidity current uf has frequently been studied benjamin 1968 huppert simpson 1980 meiburg kneller 2010 but less attention has been paid to turbidity current intrusion lin and mehta 1986 conducted an experimental study on turbidity current intrusion and found that the ratio of uf to a densimetric velocity u δ g h 0 δ ρ ρ m was a constant 0 43 during the initial stage of intrusion where g was the gravitational acceleration h 0 was the water depth at the entrance δ ρ was the density difference between turbid and clear waters and ρ m was the mean density between turbid and clear waters the front speed decreases as it propagates further into the tributary channel due to the settling of sediment lin and mehta 1986 also obtained an empirical relationship between u δ u f and the instantaneous intrusion length lt lin and mehta 1997 divided the propagating process after the initial stage into an inertia bouyance phase and a viscous force dominated phase and observed that the front speeds in these phases were in proportion to l t 1 2 and l t 4 respectively the turbidity current intrusion will develop into a steady state if the flow and sediment conditions in the main channel are kept steady and the spatial variation in flow velocity and sediment concentration along the tributary channel are still not well understood practically the water and sediment influxes at the tributary entrance are of more interest mcdowell 1971 proposed that the inflow velocity at the entrance in the lower layer is equal to g h 1 δ ρ ρ m where h 1 is the depth of lower layer at the entrance h 1 is a unknow variable so that the conclusion of mcdowell 1971 can not be used for prediction han 2003 derived a discharge equation for turbidity current intrusion in which the depth ratio h 1 h 0 is related to an energy loss coefficient the sediment transport rate str at the entrance in the lower layer is often estimated as the product of the discharge into the tributary and the sediment concentration at the entrance the vertical two dimensional 2d flow and sediment transport equations gao stenstrom 2018 van rijn 1986 wu 2007 are often used to describe the turbidity current intrusion and analytical solutions can be obtained with proper assumptions for example lin 1987 derived the equation for the longitudinal variation of mean sediment concentration and the flow velocity equations in the upper and lower layers by neglecting sediment diffusion in both the horizontal and vertical directions and momentum convection and diffusion in the horizontal direction the derivation of lin 1987 showed that the flow velocity of turbidity current intrusion can be expressed in a self similar form guetter and jain 1991 reduced the vertical 2d governing equations to a system of ordinary differential equations and found an analytical solution by performing integration over the water depth and using similarity profiles for concentration and velocity dou et al 2020 used a horizontal 2d morphodynamic model to simulate the evolution processes of tributary mouth sandbars in the xiaolangdi reservoir caused by turbidity current intrusion if the tributary channel is sufficiently long the sediment concentration will be zero when the front propagation terminates at a certain distance from the tributary entrance see fig 1 a which is called the equilibrium or arrested length l e the equilibrium length is different from the run out distance of the turbidity current generated by the release of a finite volume of a dense particle suspension dade huppert 1995 since the upstream boundary is closed in the latter situation mcdowell 1971 called the body of turbidity current a stationary sediment wedge and proposed the sediment flux from the outside water into the tributary can be roughly estimated as the product of the settling velocity of particles and the arrested wedge length the interference of gravity currents with the far end boundary is often assumed to be negligible in many theoretical models such as the box model and the lubrication theory formulation ungarish 2009 whereas it may play an important role in turbidity current intrusion if the tributary channel is shorter than l e the front will be reflected by the end wall and a front wave in the opposite direction will be generated in this case a steady state different from that in a long channel will be achieved with a larger depth of the underflow see fig 1b as it was observed in the experiment of lin and mehta 1986 however most existing equations for calculating the flow and sediment transport rates of turbidity current intrusion do not take into account the effect of limited channel length in this study a formula for the equilibrium length l e is derived from an analytical solution to a set of simplified vertical 2d flow and sediment transport equations proposed by guetter and jain 1991 with the influence of the relative depth of the lower layer to the total depth being explicitly expressed then we assume the intensity of intrusion is positively related to the ratio of the tributary length to the maximum possible value of l e and modified an existing method for predicting flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion in a sufficient long channel by introducing this ratio the model parameter in the proposed method is calibrated with data from flume experiments and field measurements in the xiaolangdi reservoir and the prediction accuracy is compared with that of an existing method the significant correlation is demonstrated between the relative intrusion length and the relative intensity of intrusion and a k fold cross validation is conducted with the aggregate data mixing the measurements in the flume experiments and the xiaolangdi reservoir to investigate the robustness of the proposed method 2 development of methodology 2 1 maximum possible intrusion length considering a tributary channel with a uniform width and horizontal bottom the vertical 2d equations for steady incompressible flow and sediment transport are adopted as the governing equations for turbidity current intrusion guetter jain 1991 which can be written as 1 u x v y 0 2 u u x v u y 1 ρ n p x 1 ρ n τ xy y 3 0 p y ρ g 4 u c x v c y y ε y c y ω c y where x and y are the coordinates along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively u and v are velocity components of the fluid phase in the x and y directions respectively p pressure τxy shear stress component applied to the face normal to the x direction ρn reference density of the turbid water which is chosen as the density at the downstream end g gravitational acceleration c volumetric sediment concentration εy mass diffusion coefficient ω is the settling velocity of sediment particles the first equation is the continuity equation for the fluid phase the second and third equations are the momentum equations for the fluid phase in the x and y directions respectively and the last one is the continuity equation for the sediment phase guetter and jain 1991 assumed that the vertical profiles for velocity sediment concentration and shear stress are self similar and defined the arbitrary functions for these profiles as 5 f η u u s h η c c n c b c n t η τ xy τ b where f η h η and t η are the normalized similarity profiles for velocity sediment concentration and shear stress respectively us water surface velocity cb the concentration at the bed cn the reference concentration at the downstream end τb the shear stress at the bed surface and η y h in which h is the total depth from the free surface to the bed by performing integration over the total depth h x on equations eqs 1 to 4 and substituting for u c and τxy from eq 5 guetter and jain 1991 obtained 6 c 0 d dx u s 2 h g σ c 1 d dx c b c n h 2 g 2 d dx h 2 τ b ρ n

water respectively and c 0 to c 5 and s are parameters related to the integrals of the functions of f η h η and t η and their expressions are given in appendix a according to the argument by macagno and rouse 1961 that the interface between the upper and lower layers is the plane of maximum shear stress in which the interfacial shear stress can be related to the bottom shear stress τb ρn is written as follows guetter jain 1991 9 τ b ρ n f u s 2 where f is a constant dependent on both the bottom friction factor and the velocity profile see appendix a for details the following normalized variables are introduced 10 ϕ u s σ g c b 0 h 0 θ c b c n c b 0 θ n c n c b 0 11 δ h h 0 λ x h 0 where cb 0 is the volumetric bottom sediment concentration at the tributary inlet and h 0 is the total water depth at the tributary inlet by substituting eqs 9 10 and 11 into eqs 6 to 8 and neglecting the inertia terms in eqs 6 and 8 guetter and jain 1991 obtained a reduced system of two nonlinear ordinary differential equations in ϕ and θ the solution of these two equations is expressed by guetter jain 1991 12 ϕ 1 δ 1 1 θ n 3 1 3 γ 6 4 λ 13 θ δ 1 1 δ 1 1 θ n 3 1 3 γ 6 4 λ 3 4 3 θ n in which 14

from eqs 13 and 14 it can be derived as follows 15 l e h 0 4 γ 6 δ 1 1 3 2 6 3 c 2 c 4 2 ω 2 s f σ g c b 0 h 0 1 3 in the right hand side of the above equation c 2 c 4 s and f are all determined by the self similar profiles of the hydrodynamic factors or sediment concentration guetter and jain 1991 adopted a set of simple assumed self similar profiles with a strong hypothesis that the interface between the turbid and clear water layers is fixed at η 0 5 thus these parameters are treated as constants in their study however the vertical distributions of velocity and concentration in turbidity current intrusion could be influenced by the finite channel length it is assumed herein that the influence of the finite channel length could be reflected in the self similar profiles by an undetermined parameter of λ yi h where yi is the height of the interface between the turbid and clear water layers measured from the bottom thus the expressions of eq 5 are assumed as 16a f η 1 η λ a η λ 16b h η 1 η 1 λ 2 η λ 1 η λ 16c t η τ i τ b 1 η 1 λ η λ 1 1 λ τ i τ b 1 η η λ where τi is the shear stress at the interface the normalized velocity profile eq 16a should satisfy the continuity condiiton i e λ 1 f η d η 0 λ f η d η therefore the parameter a in eq 16a is determined as 17 a 1 λ λ using eqs 16 and 17 to evaluate c 2 c 4 s and f eq 15 finally turns into see appendix a for details 18 l e h 0 4 2 σ g c b 0 h 0 3 ω 2 f 2 1 3 p λ p λ λ 3 1 λ 2 1 λ 2 α 2 2 λ 1 2 1 λ 3 1 3 it is now obvious that le h 0 is a function of λ under a given sediment concentration and water depth at the tributary entrance and a particle diameter fig 2 shows the variations of p λ depending on λ where p λ increases and then decreases as λ increases the maximum value of p and the corresponding λ become larger as the ratio between the interfacial and bottom friction factors α 2 is smaller some existing flume experiments indicate that the mean value of α 2 is about 0 25 middleton 1966 zhang 1998 by taking α 2 as 0 25 it can be calculated that the maximum value of p is 0 674 at λ 0 625 therefore it can be inferred from eq 18 that the maximum possible intrusion length is 19 l max 2 696 2 σ g c b 0 h 0 3 ω 2 f 2 1 3 h 0 2 2 flow and sediment transport rates in the region near the tributary entrance the depth of the turbid flow in the main channel decreases to form the underflow in the tributary channel which is similar with the phenomenon of turbidity current plunge akiyama stefan 1984 parker toniolo 2007 xia et al 2017 combining the energy equation and momentum equation between the cross sections before and after plunging han 2003 derived the discharge formula for turbidity current intrusion which is written as 20 q 0 k δ t g 1 2 h 0 3 2 k 2 1 ξ 2 3 ξ 3 where q 0 is the intrusion discharge per unit width δ t c 0 ρ s ρ w c 0 ρ s 1 c 0 ρ w where c 0 is the depth averaged volumetric sediment concentration at the tributary inlet k is the discharge coefficient and ξ is the energy loss coefficient the influence factor of ξ is still not clear in practice k is calibrated for each area to be studied and its value shows large variance among different tributaries and even during different intrusion processes in the same tributary wang et al 2016 incorporated eq 20 into a numerical model coupling open channel flow and turbidity current and demonstrated that the turbidity current in the main river was weaken due to lateral intrusion but the predicted intrusion discharges were not directly verified letting dk d ξ 0 it can be found that the maximum of k is 0 439 at ξ 2 3 3 therefore it is assumed in the present study that the maximum possible intrusion discharge is 21 q max 0 439 δ t g 1 2 h 0 3 2 the actual intrusion discharge is predicted to be q max multiplied by a damping factor related to the ratio of the predicted intrusion length l to the maximum possible intrusion length which is written as 22 q 0 l l max α q max where α is a parameter to be calibrated the predicted intrusion length is defined as the minimum of l max and the tributary channel length l c i e 23 l min l max l c the above equation implies that the front of the underflow will keep advancing until it is blocked by the channel end or all the sediments settle out note that l tends to overestimate the real intrusion length and it is only used as an intermediate variable to construct the predictive equation for intrusion discharge when the interface elevation of the intruding current is unknown the str for turbidity current intrusion qs 0 is expressed as the product of the intrusion discharge and the depth averaged sediment concentration at the tributary inlet lin metha 1997 which is written as 24 q s 0 ρ s c 0 q 0 in summary eqs 19 and 21 24 consist the calculation procedure of flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion in closed end channels which of course are also applicable in the situation of sufficiently long channels 3 data source the data from two sets of flume experiments conducted by lin and metha 1986 and lin 1987 were used to evaluate the parameter α in eq 22 by comparing the measured and predicted strs these experiments were both conducted in t shaped flumes see fig 3 but with different flume sizes the first set was performed at the u s army corps of engineers waterways experiment station wes with a 9 1 m long 0 46 m deep and 0 23 m wide closed end channel orthogonally connected to a 100 m main channel with the same cross sectional geometry lin metha 1986 the second set was performed at the coastal engineering laboratory coel of the university of florida with a 14 7 m long 0 19 m deep and 0 1 m wide closed end channel orthogonally connected to a 4 26 m long 0 19 m deep and 0 16 m wide main channel lin 1987 the experimental procedures in the above experiments were similar where a steady turbid flow in the main channel was established with a gate at the tributary entrance closed and with the clear water inside the tributary channel the gate was then opened to allow the turbid water to intrude into the tributary channel along the lower layer the densimetric froude number of the turbidity current front in the coel experiments ranged between 0 35 and 1 50 and only two of those measured froude numbers were larger than 1 0 lin 1987 ellison and turner 1959 and princevac et al 2005 both found the ratio between basal and density interface drag was a function of the froude number according to the empirical evidence of wells and dorrell 2021 this ratio is at the order about 0 1 when the froude number is smaller than 1 0 therefore the interfacial drag due to the entrainment of ambient water is considerably small compared with the basal frictional drag the parameter α was also evaluated in the prototype environment by comparing the measured and predicted discharges of turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir the reservoir is located in the lower part of the middle yellow river in china which is a multipurpose project with the benefits on flood control sediment management water supply and power generation wang solymár 1997 there are 12 tributaries joining the main river in the reservoir area since the annual runoff of the tributaries are very small and the water storage in the tributary area comes from the ponding of the main river these tributaries can be treated as closed end side channels the storage capacity of the 12 tributaries occupies about 40 of the total storage capacity of the reservoir 12 65 109 m3 with the biggest one to have a storage capacity of 1 767 109 m3 wang et al 2016 the sedimentation in tributaries due to turbidity current intrusion causes storage loss that is hard to recover because the effects of sediment sluicing and drawdown flushing kondolf et al 2014 are highly dependent on the erosion intensity of floods from the main river therefore the tributary deposition has been a great concern of the reservoir managers and the yellow river conservancy commission had carried out several runs of field measurement on turbidity current intrusion around the tributary mouths of the yanxi river xiyang river zhenshui river and dayu river during the period 2003 to 2005 and 2010 the study area is shown in fig 4 with the tributaries of interest marked with red lines table 1 is a brief summary of the topographical characteristics of the four tributaries the storage capacity is measured under the designed normal water level of 275 m and the topography before the operation of the reservoir the width of the entrance is measured across the bottom of the tributary channel rather than the free surface because the intruding current propagates in the bottom layer 4 results and discussion according to lin and mehta 1986 a vertical circulation gyre often appeared at the tributary entrance due to flow shear between the main channel and the tributary which was highly turbulent and had considerable amount of vertical lateral and longitudinal mixing of the suspended sediment thus in the following calculations it is assumed that the vertical distribution of sediment concentration is almost uniform at the entrance of the tributary channel and cb 0 is replaced with c 0 when utilizing eq 19 the bottom friction factor f 2 in eq 19 is taken as 0 02 4 1 comparison with laboratory data a total of 27 tests were conducted in the two sets of experiments by lin and metha 1986 and lin 1987 of which 12 tests can be used to calculate the sediment transport rates from the measured data table 2 lists the experimental data from the 12 tests which were used for calibration and the calculated results using the proposed method with the calibrated parameter α in eq 22 the settling velocity of sediment was measured by settling column analysis and the measured str q s0 was calculated as the mass of the deposited sediment divided by the channel width and the duration of the test according to the calculated results there were 4 tests wes 13 coel 3 coel 7 and coel 8 in which the turbidity currents would stop propagating before reaching the closed end since l l max 1 and the development of intrusion length would be constrained by the limited channel length in the remaining 8 tests the correlation between l l max and q s0 qs max q s0 is the measured value and qs max ρ 0 c 0 q max is shown in fig 5 and the correlation coefficient is 0 82 if the four data points at l l max 1 are not considered the correlation coefficient can rise to 0 90 therefore it can be seen that a shorter channel length tends to reduce the str of turbidity current intrusion by dividing both sides of eq 22 by q max and taking their logarithm the parameter α is calibrated to be 1 143 by linear regression with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 64 achieved and the comparison between the calculated and measured str is shown in fig 6 the largest str in the coel tests is 134 times of the smallest value while the variation in the wes tests is much smaller two other methods are applied to calculate the str the first one is the equations proposed by han 2003 i e eqs 20 and 24 with the recommended coefficient of discharge of k 0 367 by han 2003 and also a recalibrated k 0 260 respectively the recommended k corresponds to ξ 0 80 and the recalibrated k corresponds to ξ 0 92 the second method proposed by lin 1987 uses the following equation 25 q s 0 β 2 g ρ s ρ w ρ w ρ s 1 2 h 0 c 0 3 2 lin 1987 used the experimental data from the wes and coel tests to evaluate the average value of h 0 in eq 25 and calibrate β which lead to the regression equation 26 q s 0 0 015 h 0 c 0 3 2 note that the units of qs 0 h 0 and c 0 in the above equation are g m2 min cm mg l the performances of the three methods are summarized in table 3 the statistics chosen for assessing the performances in table 3 are coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape and the intrusion length ratio ilr method refers to the method proposed in this study the three statistics of the ilr method are all better than those of the method of lin 1987 the r2 and rmse of the results from the equation of han 2003 are slightly better than those from the ilr method but the mape is much larger than that from the ilr method in addition the equation of han 2003 gives the worst prediction among the methods in table 3 in terms of mape after recalibration the equation of han 2003 achieved the highest r2 and lowest rmse values but the mape was still over two times of that from the ilr method the reason for this unbalanced performance of the equation of han 2003 on the three statistics is that the rmse and r2 are more sensitive to occasional large errors thompson 1990 if a non uniform distribution of sediment concentration at the inlet needs to be considered one could replace cb 0 with c 0 multiplied by a coefficient for non uniform concentration distribution larger than 1 and it can be expected that the calibrated α would be larger according to eqs 19 and 22 4 2 comparison with field observation as the flow pattern in the main river of the xiaolangdi reservoir is already stratified during the period of field survey h 0 in eq 21 should be interpreted as the depth of the turbidity current at the entrance which is calculated as the elevation difference between the vertical interface and the bottom since the elevation of the interface between the clear and turbid water varies across the river see fig 7 a the location of the interface along the primary sampling vertical the vertical capturing the maximum velocity is used to calculate h 0 the bottom elevation is determined at the place where the point velocity is zero the intrusion discharge is calculated as the sum of the discharge through each subsection which is calculated based on the vertical distribution of current velocity the discharge calculated in this way is divided by the width of the tributary entrance in order to compare it with the model prediction the distributions of current velocity along sampling verticals at different distances to the bank are shown in fig 7b the sediment concentration and median diameter d 50 of sediment at the entrance are taken as their mean value along the primary sampling vertical which are then used to calculate the settling velocity of sediment particles in turbid water with the equation by rowe 1987 examples of distributions of sediment concentration and median diameter are depicted in fig 7c and 7d along different verticals at a cross section located at the entrance of the zhenshui river an abrupt change of sediment concentration often appeared at the lowest point of the sampled concentration profile see fig 7c due to the existence of a soft mud layer near the bottom which made it difficult to determine the bed surface elevation for calculating c b0 the uncertainty of bed surface elevation has less impact on the evaluation of c 0 than it has on c b0 in this sense adopting c 0 to substitute c b0 has its own advantage a criterion of 3 kg m3 is adopted to determine the location of the interface between the ambient water and the underflow from the vertical distribution of sediment concentration the longitudinal profile of the tributary channel bed is characterized by a reach with nearly horizontal bed surface or gradually descending bed towards the upstream due to the development of a sandbar at the tributary mouth and a reach with the large slope of the original tributary channel the method to determine the tributary channel length l c is illustrated in fig 8 with the longitudinal profile of the zhenshui river measured in 2010 depicted firstly the elevation of the interface between clear and turbid water along the tributary channel is assumed to be constant as it is at the entrance with the intersection of the interface and the longitudinal profile being determined the constant interface elevation assumption had also been adopted in the study of ponded turbidity currents toniolo et al 2007 then l c is calculated as the distance from the intersection to the entrance of the tributary table 4 shows the field measured data around the four tributary entrances which were used to calibrate the proposed model and the calculated results the largest intrusion discharge record number 16 is 68 times of the smallest value record number 11 by comparing l max and l c it can be found that only in the zhenshui river see record number 16 and 19 21 in table 4 the intruding turbidity currents have the chance to propagate freely i e l c l max while the propagation of turbidity currents is constrained by the topography in the other three tributaries fig 9 is a histogram of the absolute percentage errors of the intrusion discharge per unit width from three different methods there are eight times the errors of the original method of han 2003 i e eq 20 with k 0 367 are over 200 of the measured values while the other two methods have not produced such large errors after recalibration the method of han 2003 with k 0 157 gives less predictions with errors larger than 120 but errors in the range of 30 to 120 appear more often the ilr method further reduces the frequency of error in the range of 60 to 120 compared with the han 2003 method after recalibration the correlation between l l max and q 0 q max is shown in fig 10 and the correlation coefficient is 0 74 therefore it can be seen that a shorter channel length tends to reduce the turbidity current intrusion discharge the ranges of l l max in the xiyang river and zhenshui river are much larger than they are in the other tributaries which is probably due to their longer channel lengths the parameter α in eq 22 is calibrated to be 0 458 fig 11 exhibits the comparison between the calculated and measured intrusion discharges in general the method of han 2003 has a strong tendency to overestimate the intrusion discharge as can be seen in fig 11a the two data points with measured q 0 3 14 and 4 08 m2 s are from the records number 17 and 16 of the zhenshui river with the corresponding h 0 changing from 7 81 to 3 30 m usually the intrusion discharge decreases as h 0 decreases although c 0 is also an influencing factor but these two data points show a contrary trend therefore all the three methods give poor predictions for these two observations the method of han 2003 after recalibration applies a 57 reduction to the results of the original method of han 2003 which makes a pronounced improvement in the range q 0 2 m2 s but the results of the ilr method are still closer to the y x line in the same range the intrusion discharges underestimated by the method of han 2003 are more severely underestimated after recalibration a statistical evaluation of the performance of the three methods is shown in table 5 the values of r2 for the three methods are all lower than those in the flume experiments in the former section the reason might be that the environment for turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir is much more complex than the rectangular flume however the proposed ilr method still outperformed the method of han 2003 in terms of the three statistics whether it is recalibrated or not the r2 value obtained from the method of han 2003 is negative which means the prediction is no better than just taking the mean value of the collected q 0 data 4 3 cross validation with all the data lin and mehta 1997 stated that the problem of scaling the results from the laboratory to the prototype is at least as challenging as that for non settling gravity flows investigated in the laboratory as can be seen from the results presented in the previous two sections the parameter α in the proposed method and k in the method of han 2003 are quite different when they are calibrated with laboratory and field data therefore it is important to investigate the performance of different methods on the whole data set the purpose is not to give a suggested parameter that can be applied in both laboratory and field situations but to shed light on the robustness of different methods for calculating flow and sediment transport rates the laboratory data from lin and mehta 1986 and lin 1987 and field data from the xiaolangdi reservoir are put together to form a data set of 38 observations then a sixfold cross validation burman 1989 deisenroth et al 2020 is conducted on these data using the proposed method and the method of han 2003 the variable to be predicted is reconstructed as y q 0 q max or q s0 ρ s c 0 q max so that the predictive accuracy of intrusion discharge and str can be compared for the proposed method the predictive equation is transformed into y l l max α for the method of han 2003 the equation turns into the easiest form for regression i e y k in which the relationship between k and k is simply written as k 0 439 k fig 12 shows the results of repeating the sixfold cross validation for 1000 times where the average rmse is used to represent the generalization error the average rmses of the han 2003 method and the ilr method vary between 0 36 0 63 and 0 29 0 50 respectively although the method of han 2003 occasionally performs better 58 out of 1000 times than the proposed ilr method the average rmse of the latter is at least 0 1 smaller than the former in most cases therefore the proposed method is more robust to a wide range of flow and sediment conditions as compared with the method of han 2003 4 4 model limitation and uncertainty analysis in order to solve the governing eqs 6 to 8 analytically an important assumption is that settling velocity and depth of turbidity current are constant within the intrusion length it is well known that the sediment concentration has a significant influence on the settling velocity wu 2007 as the sediment concentration decreases along the side channel the settling velocity in the turbidity current will not be constant in fact on the other hand although the longitudinal variation of the turbidity current depth was small in the experiments of lin 1987 the constant depth assumption is still lack of support from field observations in large tributaries in the deriving process from eq 15 to eq 18 a set of normalized profiles are specified for velocity concentration and shear stress however it is emphasized that the general solution i e eq 15 does not depend upon the assumed profiles although different forms of the vertical distributions of velocity and concentration for turbidity currents abad et al 2011 cantero chinchilla et al 2015 islam imran 2010 nourmohammadi et al 2011 have been proposed guetter and jain 1991 pointed out the particular results from eq 15 are not very sensitive to small changes in the profiles being adopted in order to evaluate the impact on the prediction results after adopting different vertical distribution of velocity and sediment concentration three kinds of combination of different expressions of f η and h η are proposed as follows type i uniform distribution in two layers for velocity parabolic and uniform distribution for sediment concentration in the upper and lower layer respectively linear distribution for shear stress type ii the velocity profile is parabolic in the upper layer and similar to a submerged plane wall jet in the lower layer the other distributions are the same with type i type iii the sediment concentration vanishes in the upper layer has a parabolic distribution in the lower layer the other distributions are the same with type ii type i combination eq 16 is the one used in previous sections of this paper the velocity profile in the lower layer in type ii was proposed by cantero chinchilla et al 2015 the modified expressions of f η and h η in type ii and iii can be found in appendix b table 6 shows the variation of the calibrated parameter α and model performance under type ii or iii combination compared with type i type ii and iii combination would lead to an increase and decrease of the calculated maximum possible intrusion length refer to appendix b for the proof respectively hence influencing the model parameter α the comparison in table shows that adopting complex description of the self similar profiles does not necessarily mean better prediction with the available laboratory and field data from the above sections the velocity and concentration profiles in type i achieved moderate prediction accuracy note that the parameter α 2 and f 2 in eq 18 are assigned with fixed values if they are also treated as parameters that need to be calibrated the difference of model performance among the three types of profile combination are expected to be further narrowed down as for the turbidity current intrusion in the xiaolangdi reservoir the irregular cross sectional profiles of the tributaries and the angles between the main river and tributaries might have a great influence which are however not investigated in the present study the turbidity current events in the main river and tributaries in the xiaolangdi reservoir are unsteady processes however the proposed method and other existing analytical methods are all developed for the steady flow field which might be another major source of error in the attempt to predict flow and sediment transport rates in field conditions 5 conclusions many turbidity current intrusion processes happen in closed end channels but studies on turbidity currents seldom focus on the effect of limited channel length on their evolution the fundamental assumption for establishing the proposed method to calculate flow and sediment transport rates for turbidity current intrusion is that existing equations for intrusion discharge only consider flow and sediment conditions around the tributary inlet which can be modified by introducing a damping factor related to the ratio between the channel length and the maximum possible intrusion length the maximum possible intrusion length is derived based an analytical solution to a set of vertical 2d governing equations for flow and sediment transport with self similar profiles adopted for vertical distributions of velocity sediment concentration and shear stress in stratified flows compared with existing methods the proposed one needs only two additional input the channel length and the settling velocity which is easy to obtain from the measured data the proposed method had an advantage to control the mape when used to calculate strs of turbidity current intrusion in the existing laboratory experiments when used to predict intrusion discharges in the xiaolangdi reservoir the proposed ilr method outperformed the existing method at all three statistics of r2 rmse and mape the significant correlation between the ilr and the relative intrusion intensity is discovered in both laboratory experiments and field observations the powers to the ilr are calibrated to be 1 143 and 0 458 in laboratory and field conditions respectively indicating the damping effect is probably greater in the former conditions the ilr method also improves the robustness of the existing method since it performs better in the cross validation with the mixed laboratory and field data future studies are essential to improve the proposed method to consider more complex topography around the confluence zone and along the tributary channel and the longitudinal variations of settling velocity and turbidity current depth the turbidity current discharges at the upstream and downstream cross sections of the tributary mouth along the main river and the intrusion discharge are often reported to be unbalanced in prototype observations therefore approaches to minimize the influence arising from the uncertainty of field measurements also need to be investigated the intrusion discharges of water and sediment can be viewed as additional lateral source terms of the governing equations for 1d numerical modelling of turbidity currents in the main river which can be expressed with the proposed equations however a criterion to determine whether the intrusion has reached the equilibrium state needs to be developed before numerical simulation of unsteady process can be achieved credit

jain 1991 in a recent study of cantero chinchilla et al 2015 a semi empirical velocity profile for the lower layer was proposed as b1 u u max 4 28 y z i 0 6 1 y z i 2 2 4 28 η λ 0 6 1 η λ 2 2 where u max is the maximum velocity in the lower layer this velocity profile is adopted in this section and the profile in the upper layer is assumed to be parabolic to satisfy a smooth transition between the two layers therefore the velocity profile along the whole water depth is constructed as b2 f η u u s 1 η 1 λ 2 1 η λ 4 28 u max u s η λ 0 6 1 η λ 2 2 η λ again from the continuity condition λ 1 f η d

λ α 2 2 λ 1 1 λ 2 0 67 1 λ λ substituting the expression of c 2 c 4 f and s into eq 15 the normalized equilibrium intrusion length is written as b10 l e h 0 4 2 σ g c b 0 h 0 3 ω 2 f 2 1 3 p λ p λ 8

decreasing trend with increasing λ still hold in eq b10 the maximum value of p is 0 834 when α 2 is 0 25 which only leads to a slight change of the coefficient in eq 19 from 2 696 to 3 336 the sediment concentration profile h η can be replaced with one following the increasing trend towards the bed for example an alternative choice of h η can be constructed by using a parabolic distribution as b11 h η 0 η λ η λ 1 2 η λ by adopting eq b2 b11 and 16c for the self similar profiles for flow velocity sediment concentration and shear stress the normalized equilibrium intrusion length can be

eq 18 the maximum value of p is 0 311 when α 2 is 0 25 which only leads to the change of the coefficient in eq 19 from 2 696 to 1 244 
3032,river confluences are crucial parts of the river networks which connect different rivers and promote material exchange between them joining of two rivers would cause sharp shifts of flow dynamics and form confluence hydrodynamic zone chz with specific flow structure and biogeochemical processes however chzs are small areas compared with river networks whether and how the biogeochemical processes in chzs would influence the lower reaches and even the whole river networks remain unclear to address this gap the present study focused on the nitrogen dynamics in a river network consisting a series of confluences and combined molecular biological tools gene centric modelling approach and sourcetracker analysis to reveal the microorganisms induced nitrogen transformation processes in chzs and other normal hydrodynamic zones nhzs results illustrated that the enriched microbial species in chzs were associated with nitrogen transformation such as terrimonas and sphingobacterium which were reported to be vital participants in nitrate and nitrite reduction processes the reactions rates of different nitrogen transformation processes calculated based on functional genes abundances further revealed that n2 production rates were significantly higher in chzs than nhzs p 0 05 demonstrating chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network besides the specific microbial communities and stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chz would sustain in lower reaches sourcetracker analysis illustrated that microbial communities would exert significant influences on lower reaches and the influence scope was controlled by confluences characteristics such as flow ratio between tributary and main stream higher discharge ratio would increase the influence scope of microbial community in chz these results indicate that reasonable design of confluence characteristics can be applied as a critical engineering measure for the improvement of ecological health of river networks keywords river confluence microbial community nitrogen transformation processes confluence characteristic data availability data will be made

ruhi 2019 read et al 2015 river networks comprised by numerous interconnected rivers are the most common form of lotic environments they sculpt the continental surface terui et al 2018 widder et al 2014 confluences are crucial parts of the river networks which are the connection areas of different rivers and promote the material exchange of different rivers joining of two rivers would cause sharp shifts of flow dynamics and form confluence hydrodynamic zone chz with specific flow structure yuan et al 2022 the distinct hydrodynamic condition can influence horizontal and vertical water exchange transport of sediment and chemical materials and would eventually make a difference to biogeochemical processes in the chz hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a analysing the biogeochemical processes under the hydrodynamic context of chz and identifying their influences on the environmental quality of other normal hydrodynamic zones nhzs are essential for the evaluation and improvement of ecological status of whole river networks investigating the biogeochemical processes in chzs should rely on the understanding of hydrodynamic characteristics over the past several decades hydrodynamic condition in river confluences have always been a research hotspot best 1987 rhoads and johnson 2018 sukhodolov et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 with the basis of series of field observations and laboratory experiments flow structure at the chz is proved to typically include regions of 1 reduced velocities or flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner 2 flow deflection within the confluence 3 a shear layer between the confluent flows 4 flow separation next to the downstream junction corner 5 acceleration of flow as the flow enters the downstream channel and 6 flow recovery at the downstream end of the chz best 1987 yuan et al 2022 the distribution of these distinct hydrodynamic regions is controlled by several principal confluence characteristics such as junction angle the ratio of discharges or momentum and bed discordance best 1987 gualtieri et al 2019a guillen ludena et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 differences in confluence characteristics would also affect the transport of suspended solids best 1987 constantinescu et al 2011 gualtieri et al 2018 and even riverine organisms such as fish communities gualtieri et al 2019b gualtieri et al 2017 based on the understanding of flow structure and transport characteristics of suspended solids an increasing number of researches published in the past decade focused on the changing trends of chemical materials in chz to investigate the influences of confluence on water quality daesslé et al 2017 harris et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the majority of these researches focused on the distribution characteristics of chemical materials under the influence of flow structure in chz without considering the transformation processes however the transformation processes including chemical and biochemical reactions in overlying water and sediment could also be the key factor controlling the chemical concentrations li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 thus understanding the transformation processes of different chemical materials under the hydrodynamic characteristics of confluences is essential for the evaluation and protection of water environment in river networks nitrogen is an essential biogenic element for aquatic organisms and the nitrogen cycle is one of the most essential nutrient cycle in river ecosystems maavara et al 2020 smits et al 2019 meanwhile nitrogenous materials are the main factors contributing to eutrophication korppoo et al 2017 yi et al 2017 the transformation processes among different forms of nitrogen largely determines the degree of nitrogen pollution in rivers xin et al 2019 in river ecosystems microbial communities are major drivers of nitrogen transformation processes the metabolic processes of microbial communities determine the forms and concentrations of the nitrogenous materials wang et al 2019 xin et al 2019 meanwhile composition of microbial communities can be influenced by numerous environmental factors such as temperature ph chemical concentrations and hydrodynamic condition hui et al 2022 li et al 2020b martiny et al 2011 thus identifying how the flow structure in river confluences would alter microbial communities especially the functionally important species to nitrogen transformation and thereby quantifying its influence on nitrogen dynamics are vital for abating nitrogen pollution of river ecosystems with this purpose a series of researches have been conducted it has been demonstrated that the flow characteristics in chz especially the recirculating flow and low velocity would benefit the growth of microbial species participating nitrate and nitrite reduction the removal efficiency of nitrogenous materials would be increased by 40 than other areas of rivers and eventually promote chz as hotspot for nitrogen removal hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a however according to hydrodynamic definition chzs are small areas compared with river networks best 1987 it is not clear if the enhanced nitrogen removal processes would influence the nitrogen concentrations of whole river networks to which extent and whether the microbial communities and nitrogen removal processes would sustain in the lower reaches after chz to this end a river network comprised by multi confluences was selected as the research area in this study to identify 1 whether the stimulated nitrogen transformation processes commonly existed in different confluences 2 whether the specific microbial communities and stimulated nitrogen transformation processes in chz would sustain in lower reaches 3 how much impact would the nitrogen transformation processes in chz exert on lower reaches and which factors control such impact to answer these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing combining with gene centric modelling approach were applied to investigate the differences in microbial community and nitrogen transformation processes between chz and nhz besides sourcetracker analysis was conducted to identify whether the microbial community in chz would influence lower reaches the sourcetracker results were integrated with confluence characteristics to quantify the impacts of chz on lower reaches this study marks the first systematic work studying the influences of microbial community and biogeochemical processes in confluences on the whole river

sinks table s2 sourcetracker analysis was conducted using r package sourcetracker 1 0 1 and the parameters were set as default values rarefaction depth 100 burn in 100 restart 10 alpha 0 001 beta 0 01 for each confluence ten independent runs were conducted to reduce the analysis deviation and the averaged source proportions were considered as the final results besides the relative standard deviation rsd were analyzed to discuss the accuracy of the results one way analysis of variance anova was conducted at a 0 05 significance level using spss 6 0 to investigate differences between shannon index of microbial community in chz and nhz differences between reactions rates of aerobic and anerobic nitrogen transformation processes differences between production rates of no3 and n2 difference in change rates of no3 no2 nh4 n2 between chzs and nhzs differences in sourcetrcker results of varied sinks pearson analysis was conducted at a 0 05 significance level using r to investigate the correlations between results of sourcetrcker analysis and different confluence factors 2 5 structure of gene centric modelling approach gene centric modelling approach was used to calculate the reaction rates of different nitrogen transformation processes this method was first proposed by reed et al 2014 to investigate nitrogen dynamics in ocean oxygen minimum zones which is the modification of michaelis menten equation with the basis of functional genes abundances and chemical concentrations the modelling approach consists of two parts calculating the changing rats of genes abundances and chemicals concentrations respectively the changing rates of genes was defined as 1 γ j t γ j μ j f t s c s k s c s x k x k x c x λ γ j where γj is gene abundance genes per liter μj is the specific growth rate seconds 1 cs and cx are the concentration of reactant and inhibitor respectively molar ks and kx are the half saturation constant of reactant and inhibitor respectively molar λ is gene mortality rate constant seconds 1 the first term of right side is the rate of gene production rj which would be further used to calculate the changing rates of chemicals ft is the thermodynamic potential factor unitless which is calculated as 2 f t e δ g f δ ψ rt 1 1 where f is the faraday constant 96 485 kj v 1 and δψ is the electric potential across the membrane volts defined here as 120 mv larowe et al 2012 the changing rates of different chemical concentrations were calculated based on the dynamics of genes abundances 3 c s t j γ j s γ j e r j n j y where γj s is the stoichiometric coefficient of chemical material s in the reaction associated with gene j negative for reactant and positive for product γj e is the stoichiometric coefficient of the electron donor in the metabolism nj is the number of j genes in the unit weight of cells that contains this gene genes per gram y is biomass production rate which is modeled as a function of free energy yield roden and jin 2011 4 y 2 08 0 0211 δ g e where δge is the reaction energy yield per mole of electron donor kilojoules moles e donor 1 which is defined as 5 δ g δ g 0 r t l n q γ e δ g e where δg0 is the standard gibbs free energy of formation kilojoules at the appropriate temperature and pressure t is the temperature kelvin q is the reaction quotient unitless and r is the gas constant 8 314 kj kelvin 1 mole 1 five nitrogen transformation pathways were considered in this research namely sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction sonr aerobic ammonium oxidation aeao anaerobic ammonium oxidation anao nitrate reduction nar and nitrite reduction nir the chemical equations were listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamic characteristics of different confluences the measured main flow properties of the adcp transects just upstream of each confluence were listed in table 1 it can be seen that the hydrodynamic characteristics varied among different confluences especially the discharge ratio between the tributary and the main channel tributary discharge main channel discharge ranging from 0 212 to 0 810 varied hydrodynamic characteristics of upstream channels would shape significantly different flow structure in chzs and alter the distribution of different hydraulic regions the maps of the interpolated depth averaged velocities at different confluences are presented in fig 1b g the maps were obtained by kriging of the adcp data according to the distribution regularities of hydrodynamic regions demonstrated in the published studies best 1987 gualtieri et al 2018 yuan et al 2022 and the hydrodynamic characteristics of different confluences in the present research the approximate locations of those hydrodynamic regions were presented in fig 1 namely 1 flow stagnation zone 2 flow deflection zone 3 flow separation zone 4 maximum velocity zone and 5 beginning of zone of flow recovery besides 6 the end of chz where the flow velocities and directions became relatively uniform gualtieri et al 2018 was also presented to exhibit the extension of the chz the sampling points were further classified into chz and nhz according to their locations jr 2 jr 5 mx 3 mx 6 dy 2 dy 5 mz 3 mz 6 and yh 3 were in the scope of chzs and other points belonged to nhz fig 1a 3 2 comparison of microbial community in chz and nhz based on the classification of sampling points from chzs and nhzs a comparison of microbial community characteristics between these two regions was conducted at phylum level compositions of microbial communities in chz and nhz were similar which were both dominated by proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounting for over 90 of all detected phyla fig 2 a the shannon index at species level was further calculated to analyse the alpha diversity of microbial communities the results illustrated that there was no significant difference in shannon index between chz and nhz anova p 0 809 fig 2b indicating the alpha diversity of microbial community was similar furthermore nmds analysis at species level was conducted and there was still no significant distinction between chz and nhz which indicated that the microbial communities from chz and nhz cannot be clearly distinguished through the species composition fig 2c lefse analysis was further applied to determine highly differential taxonomy from phylum to order levels among samples in chz and nhz fig 3 the results illustrated that bacterial lineages enriched in nhz were mainly propionibacteriales from order to genus and γ proteobacteria mainly of genera curvibacter methyloparacoccus and fluviicoccus taxonomies enriched in chz consisted of blastocatellia from class to family and a number of genera including terrimonas sphingobacterium blautia roseomonas alsobacter desulfoprunum lautropia and some uncultured genera among the enriched taxonomies in chz terrimonas and sphingobacterium were reported to be vital participants in transformation of nitrogenous materials qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 especially the reduction processes of nitrate and nitrite which could probably contribute to more active nitrogen transformation processes in chz however the enriched taxonomies could hardly represent the functions of microbial community and cannot guarantee the occurrence of associated biogeochemical processes to this end abundances of functional genes and reaction rates of nitrogen transformation processes were further investigated 3 3 nitrogen transformation processes in chz and nhz it has been reported in previous researches that chz was hotspot for nitrogen transformation processes especially the nitrogen removal processes hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a besides the analysis of microbial community in this research also suggested that the enriched taxonomies in chz were associated with the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to further verify whether the stimulated nitrogen removal processes widely existed in chzs five nitrate and nitrite reduction pathways as well as the participated genes were quantitively investigated in five rivers respectively the reactions rates were calculated through gene centric models with the basis of genes abundances and chemical concentrations fig 4 the results illustrated that in all rivers the rates of aerobic reaction aeao were significantly lower than anaerobic reactions nar sonr nir and anao anova p 0 01 which was probably resulted from the low flow velocity fig 1 and low oxygen concentration in this area low flow velocity contributed to weak water air exchange which can inhibit the reoxygenation of water column and eventually limit the aerobic reactions gualtieri pulci doria 2012 wang et al 2021 besides nar and anao were the main pathways of nitrate and nitrite reduction respectively and the rates of nitrate reduction nar and sonr were higher than nitrite reduction nir and anao differences in rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction contributed to the decrease of no3 and the accumulation of no2 fig 5 the relatively lower rates of nir and anao inhibited the completely reduction of no3 to n2 thus the production rates of n2 were significantly lower than the reduction of no3 anova p 0 01 production of n2 represents the complete removal of nitrogenous materials from water arnon et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 these results signified that reduction of no2 was the rate limiting step governing nitrogen removal in the researched river networks significant differences in nitrogen transformation processes existed between chz and nhz the reaction rates of sonr and anao were significantly higher in chz than in nhz anova p 0 05 for both both of the genes nap and hzo mediating sonr and anao respectively were widely reported to exist in oceans and deep lakes since they are generated by microorganisms requiring low oxygen concentration and long generation time gihring et al 2010 marzocchi et al 2014 trimmer et al 2013 the convergence of two rivers with different flow directions at chz can significantly decrease the flow velocity and even form recirculating flow structure fig 1 leite ribeiro et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 which would significantly decrease oxygen concentration and increase hydraulic retention time gu et al 2012 stegen et al 2016 thus chzs can provide suitable context for the growth of microorganisms harbouring gene nap and hzo and eventually increase the reaction rates of sonr and anao moreover the change rates of different nitrogenous materials concentrations were compared between chz and nhz the results illustrated that there were no significant differences in change rates of no3 and no2 concentrations between chz and nhz anova p 0 291 for no3 and p 0 317 for no2 since they were mainly controlled by nar which maintained consistent in the whole river network however the decrease rates of nh4 and production rates of n2 were significantly higher in chz than in nhz anova p 0 05 for both mainly caused by the higher reaction rate of anao in chz the higher production rates of nitrogen illustrated that chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network 3 4 contributions of microbial community in chz on the river network the enhanced nitrogen removal processes are proved to widely exist in chzs of the researched river network it was mainly resulted from the specific hydrodynamic conditions and the distinct microbial communities formed under such context li et al 2020a however it has been demonstrated that the flow structure will recover to normal condition after chz best 1987 demonstrating that chzs will not influence the water flow of lower reaches fig 1 thus chzs can only alter the downstream nitrogen removal processes by directly transporting local microbial community to lower reaches to identify whether the microbial communities in chz would sustain in the lower reaches the bayesian based sourcetracker approach sourcetracker v1 0 1 program was applied to quantify the contributions of microbial communities in chz to other areas of the river network the researched river network consisted of six confluences the sourcetracker analysis was conducted in all of the confluence respectively the sampling points from upper reaches i e points upstream the chz and sampling points in the chz were treated as two sources sampling points from lower reaches i e points downstream chz were treated as sinks table s2 the jensen shannon divergence between any two sources were higher than 0 05 table s3 knights et al 2011 the averaged source proportional contributions and the rsd derived from ten independent runs with default parameters are summarized in table 2 the visual display of averaged source proportions was presented in fig 6 the results illustrated that all sinks consisted of microbial communities from unknown sources the proportions ranged from 8 47 to 47 25 which are probably caused by dispersal of microbial community from other potential sources not involved in this research such as sediment besides the rsd values were acceptable ranging from 1 42 to 23 11 and the mean values was 6 28 low rsd values suggested that the technical replicates through the multiple sourcetracker runs guaranteed the stability of the analysis results gu et al 2020 sun et al 2022 two sampling points with different distances to chz were set downstream each confluence and the results of sourcetracker illustrated that microbial communities from chz had significantly higher influence on closer sampling points than to farther points anova p 0 015 the contributions of microbial communities from upper reaches exhibited the opposite pattern microbial communities from chz were the dominant contributors accounting for the largest proportion to most of the sampling points closer to chz however with distances between chz and the sampling points increasing the contributions of chz microbial communities decreased instead microbial communities from upper reaches became the dominant contributors to sampling points farther from chz these results demonstrated that the microbial communities generated because of the distinct environmental factors in confluences not only existed in chz they can also exert influences on communities from lower reaches probably due to the convection and dispersal processes of water flow microorganisms in water can be free living bacterioplankton or associated with particulate matter or aggerates which will transport along with the water flow to downstream areas however with the distances increase the influences of microbial communities transported from chz would decline besides flow structure in lower reaches would recover back to normal characteristics similar with upper reaches before chz fig 1 which would generate microbial communities similar with upper reaches such a higher similarity would increase the proportions of upper reaches in soucrcetracker results thus the contributions of microbial communities from upper reaches increased and contributions of the chz declined quantifying such decline trend is essential for identifying the scope that microbial communities from chz would affect which would provide vital information for evaluating and regulating nitrogen transformation processes in river networks 3 5 quantifying the influence scope of microbial community in chz the correlations between results of sourcetracker analysis i e the contributions of microbial community from chz and upper reaches to lower reaches and distances between lower reaches and chz were analysed to identify the influence scope of microbial community in chz the contributions of microbial community from chz were negatively correlated with the distances between downstream sampling points and chz pearson p 0 015 fig 7 a while the contributions of upper reaches exhibited the opposite trend pearson p 0 2 fig 7b however correlation between distances and contribution of upper reaches was not significant suggesting that distance between chz and downstream sampling points was the only factor governing the contributions of chz and upper reaches as demonstrated in the previous researches the stimulated nitrogen transformation processes mainly existed in the flow separation zone of chz hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a the flow separation zone is characterized by the recirculating flow which is beneficial for the growth of microorganisms mediating the nitrogen removal processes it is reasonable to hypothesise that there existed correlations between the size of flow separation zone and the contributions of microbial community from chz the size of flow separation zone is mainly controlled by confluence characteristics such as confluence angle and discharge ratio between tributary and main stream gualtieri et al 2019a guillen ludena et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 in the researched river network discharge ratio should be the main factor influencing flow separation zone since the confluence angles were all close to 90 larger flow separation zone would benefit the growth of function microorganisms and the nitrogen removal processes thus higher discharge ratios tributary discharge main stream discharge could probably increase the contributions of the chz microbial communities to lower reaches to this end the correlations between discharge ratios and the contributions of chz and upper reaches were analysed with the basis of flow discharge data measured by adcp there existed significant positive correlation between the contributions of chz and the discharge ratios pearson p 0 048 fig 7c and significant negative correlation between contributions of upper reaches and discharge ratios pearson p 0 025 fig 7d these results verified pervious hypothesis indicating higher discharge ratio can increase influences of chz and decrease influences of upper reaches on lower reaches it is reasonable to considered that the combination of discharge ratios and distances between chz and downstream sampling points could better explain the changing trend of contributions thus the specific value of distance and discharge ratio distance discharge ratio d qr was set as the integrated factor and its correlation with contributions of different sources were further analysed the correlation analyses illustrated that both the contributions of chz and upper reaches were significantly correlated with the value of d r pearson p 0 05 for both suggesting the distance modified by discharge ratio to a large degree determined the contributions of microbial community from chz and upper reaches to the sampling points in lower reaches fig 7e f the fitted equations illustrated that the microbial community from chz were the dominant source when the d r value of downstream sampling point is lower than 1695 the distances between chz and the farthest sampling point dominated by chz can be considered as the influence scope of microbial community in chz thus the influence scope of microbial community would increase with the discharge ratio between tributary and main stream and it can be calculated as 1695 discharge ratio in this research area 4 conclusion in summary this research concentrated on a river network containing a series of confluences and investigated the characteristics of microbial communities and nitrogen transformation processes in both chz and nhz though general analyses of microbial community revealed that there existed no significant difference in the microbial community between chz and nhz lefse analysis exhibited that the enriched taxonomies in chz containing species associated with nitrate and nitrite reduction processes the reactions rates of different nitrogen transformation processes calculated through gene centric modelling approach further demonstrated that n2 production rates were significantly higher in chzs than nhzs signifying chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network the sourcetracker analysis was further conducted to investigate whether the stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chz would sustain in the lower reaches the results illustrated that microbial communities would exert significant influences on lower reaches and the influence scope was controlled by confluences characteristics such as discharge ratio between tributary and main stream higher discharge ratio would increase the influence scope of microbial community in chz results of this research can provide vital information for the designation and construction of river connection engineering traditional river connection engineering mostly concentrated on the improvement of river connectivity through creating the interconnections of different rivers while the influences on river ecology are always overlooked with the integration of results in this research the stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chzs and its sustaining effects could be applied in designing river connection engineering through proper settings of confluence characteristics such as connection angle and flow discharge ratio between main stream and tributary the river connectivity and the maximization of nitrogen removal can be obtained at the same time which would be beneficial

3032,river confluences are crucial parts of the river networks which connect different rivers and promote material exchange between them joining of two rivers would cause sharp shifts of flow dynamics and form confluence hydrodynamic zone chz with specific flow structure and biogeochemical processes however chzs are small areas compared with river networks whether and how the biogeochemical processes in chzs would influence the lower reaches and even the whole river networks remain unclear to address this gap the present study focused on the nitrogen dynamics in a river network consisting a series of confluences and combined molecular biological tools gene centric modelling approach and sourcetracker analysis to reveal the microorganisms induced nitrogen transformation processes in chzs and other normal hydrodynamic zones nhzs results illustrated that the enriched microbial species in chzs were associated with nitrogen transformation such as terrimonas and sphingobacterium which were reported to be vital participants in nitrate and nitrite reduction processes the reactions rates of different nitrogen transformation processes calculated based on functional genes abundances further revealed that n2 production rates were significantly higher in chzs than nhzs p 0 05 demonstrating chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network besides the specific microbial communities and stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chz would sustain in lower reaches sourcetracker analysis illustrated that microbial communities would exert significant influences on lower reaches and the influence scope was controlled by confluences characteristics such as flow ratio between tributary and main stream higher discharge ratio would increase the influence scope of microbial community in chz these results indicate that reasonable design of confluence characteristics can be applied as a critical engineering measure for the improvement of ecological health of river networks keywords river confluence microbial community nitrogen transformation processes confluence characteristic data availability data will be made

ruhi 2019 read et al 2015 river networks comprised by numerous interconnected rivers are the most common form of lotic environments they sculpt the continental surface terui et al 2018 widder et al 2014 confluences are crucial parts of the river networks which are the connection areas of different rivers and promote the material exchange of different rivers joining of two rivers would cause sharp shifts of flow dynamics and form confluence hydrodynamic zone chz with specific flow structure yuan et al 2022 the distinct hydrodynamic condition can influence horizontal and vertical water exchange transport of sediment and chemical materials and would eventually make a difference to biogeochemical processes in the chz hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a analysing the biogeochemical processes under the hydrodynamic context of chz and identifying their influences on the environmental quality of other normal hydrodynamic zones nhzs are essential for the evaluation and improvement of ecological status of whole river networks investigating the biogeochemical processes in chzs should rely on the understanding of hydrodynamic characteristics over the past several decades hydrodynamic condition in river confluences have always been a research hotspot best 1987 rhoads and johnson 2018 sukhodolov et al 2017 yuan et al 2017 yuan et al 2021 with the basis of series of field observations and laboratory experiments flow structure at the chz is proved to typically include regions of 1 reduced velocities or flow stagnation near the upstream junction corner 2 flow deflection within the confluence 3 a shear layer between the confluent flows 4 flow separation next to the downstream junction corner 5 acceleration of flow as the flow enters the downstream channel and 6 flow recovery at the downstream end of the chz best 1987 yuan et al 2022 the distribution of these distinct hydrodynamic regions is controlled by several principal confluence characteristics such as junction angle the ratio of discharges or momentum and bed discordance best 1987 gualtieri et al 2019a guillen ludena et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 differences in confluence characteristics would also affect the transport of suspended solids best 1987 constantinescu et al 2011 gualtieri et al 2018 and even riverine organisms such as fish communities gualtieri et al 2019b gualtieri et al 2017 based on the understanding of flow structure and transport characteristics of suspended solids an increasing number of researches published in the past decade focused on the changing trends of chemical materials in chz to investigate the influences of confluence on water quality daesslé et al 2017 harris et al 2018 tang et al 2017 the majority of these researches focused on the distribution characteristics of chemical materials under the influence of flow structure in chz without considering the transformation processes however the transformation processes including chemical and biochemical reactions in overlying water and sediment could also be the key factor controlling the chemical concentrations li et al 2017 louca et al 2016 reed et al 2014 thus understanding the transformation processes of different chemical materials under the hydrodynamic characteristics of confluences is essential for the evaluation and protection of water environment in river networks nitrogen is an essential biogenic element for aquatic organisms and the nitrogen cycle is one of the most essential nutrient cycle in river ecosystems maavara et al 2020 smits et al 2019 meanwhile nitrogenous materials are the main factors contributing to eutrophication korppoo et al 2017 yi et al 2017 the transformation processes among different forms of nitrogen largely determines the degree of nitrogen pollution in rivers xin et al 2019 in river ecosystems microbial communities are major drivers of nitrogen transformation processes the metabolic processes of microbial communities determine the forms and concentrations of the nitrogenous materials wang et al 2019 xin et al 2019 meanwhile composition of microbial communities can be influenced by numerous environmental factors such as temperature ph chemical concentrations and hydrodynamic condition hui et al 2022 li et al 2020b martiny et al 2011 thus identifying how the flow structure in river confluences would alter microbial communities especially the functionally important species to nitrogen transformation and thereby quantifying its influence on nitrogen dynamics are vital for abating nitrogen pollution of river ecosystems with this purpose a series of researches have been conducted it has been demonstrated that the flow characteristics in chz especially the recirculating flow and low velocity would benefit the growth of microbial species participating nitrate and nitrite reduction the removal efficiency of nitrogenous materials would be increased by 40 than other areas of rivers and eventually promote chz as hotspot for nitrogen removal hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a however according to hydrodynamic definition chzs are small areas compared with river networks best 1987 it is not clear if the enhanced nitrogen removal processes would influence the nitrogen concentrations of whole river networks to which extent and whether the microbial communities and nitrogen removal processes would sustain in the lower reaches after chz to this end a river network comprised by multi confluences was selected as the research area in this study to identify 1 whether the stimulated nitrogen transformation processes commonly existed in different confluences 2 whether the specific microbial communities and stimulated nitrogen transformation processes in chz would sustain in lower reaches 3 how much impact would the nitrogen transformation processes in chz exert on lower reaches and which factors control such impact to answer these questions next generation 16s rrna gene sequencing combining with gene centric modelling approach were applied to investigate the differences in microbial community and nitrogen transformation processes between chz and nhz besides sourcetracker analysis was conducted to identify whether the microbial community in chz would influence lower reaches the sourcetracker results were integrated with confluence characteristics to quantify the impacts of chz on lower reaches this study marks the first systematic work studying the influences of microbial community and biogeochemical processes in confluences on the whole river network the obtained results can provide vital information for optimizing river connection engineering to guarantee both river connection and river ecological health 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample

deviation rsd were analyzed to discuss the accuracy of the results one way analysis of variance anova was conducted at a 0 05 significance level using spss 6 0 to investigate differences between shannon index of microbial community in chz and nhz differences between reactions rates of aerobic and anerobic nitrogen transformation processes differences between production rates of no3 and n2 difference in change rates of no3 no2 nh4 n2 between chzs and nhzs differences in sourcetrcker results of varied sinks pearson analysis was conducted at a 0 05 significance level using r to investigate the correlations between results of sourcetrcker analysis and different confluence factors 2 5 structure of gene centric modelling approach gene centric modelling approach was used to calculate the reaction rates of different nitrogen transformation processes this method was first proposed by reed et al 2014 to investigate nitrogen dynamics in ocean oxygen minimum zones which is the modification of michaelis menten equation with the basis of functional genes abundances and chemical concentrations the modelling approach consists of two parts calculating the changing rats of genes abundances and chemicals concentrations respectively the changing rates of genes was defined as 1 γ j t γ j μ j f t s c s k s c s x k x k x c x λ γ j where γj is gene abundance genes per liter μj is the specific growth rate seconds 1 cs and cx are the concentration of reactant and inhibitor respectively molar ks and kx are the half saturation constant of reactant and inhibitor respectively molar λ is gene mortality rate constant seconds 1 the first term of right side is the rate of gene production rj which would be further used to calculate the changing rates of chemicals ft is the thermodynamic potential factor unitless which is calculated as 2 f t e δ g f δ ψ rt 1 1 where f is the faraday constant 96 485 kj v 1 and δψ is the electric potential across the membrane volts defined here as 120 mv larowe et al 2012 the changing rates of different chemical concentrations were calculated based on the dynamics of genes abundances 3 c s t j γ j s γ j e r j n j y where γj s is the stoichiometric coefficient of chemical material s in the reaction associated with gene j negative for reactant and positive for product γj e is the stoichiometric coefficient of the electron donor in the metabolism nj is the number of j genes in the unit weight of cells that contains this gene genes per gram y is biomass production rate which is modeled as a function of free energy yield roden and jin 2011 4 y 2 08 0 0211 δ g e where δge is the reaction energy yield per mole of electron donor kilojoules moles e donor 1 which is defined as 5 δ g δ g 0 r t l n q γ e δ g e where δg0 is the standard gibbs free energy of formation kilojoules at the appropriate temperature and pressure t is the temperature kelvin q is the reaction quotient unitless and r is the gas constant 8 314 kj kelvin 1 mole 1 five nitrogen transformation pathways were considered in this research namely sulfide oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction sonr aerobic ammonium oxidation aeao anaerobic ammonium oxidation anao nitrate reduction nar and nitrite reduction nir the chemical equations were listed in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrodynamic characteristics of different confluences the measured main flow properties of the adcp transects just upstream of each confluence were listed in table 1 it can be seen that the hydrodynamic characteristics varied among different confluences especially the discharge ratio between the tributary and the main channel tributary discharge main channel discharge ranging from 0 212 to 0 810 varied hydrodynamic characteristics of upstream channels would shape significantly different flow structure in chzs and alter the distribution of different hydraulic regions the maps of the interpolated depth averaged velocities at different confluences are presented in fig 1b g the maps were obtained by kriging of the adcp data according to the distribution regularities of hydrodynamic regions demonstrated in the published studies best 1987 gualtieri et al 2018 yuan et al 2022 and the hydrodynamic characteristics of different confluences in the present research the approximate locations of those hydrodynamic regions were presented in fig 1 namely 1 flow stagnation zone 2 flow deflection zone 3 flow separation zone 4 maximum velocity zone and 5 beginning of zone of flow recovery besides 6 the end of chz where the flow velocities and directions became relatively uniform gualtieri et al 2018 was also presented to exhibit the extension of the chz the sampling points were further classified into chz and nhz according to their locations jr 2 jr 5 mx 3 mx 6 dy 2 dy 5 mz 3 mz 6 and yh 3 were in the scope of chzs and other points belonged to nhz fig 1a 3 2 comparison of microbial community in chz and nhz based on the classification of sampling points from chzs and nhzs a comparison of microbial community characteristics between these two regions was conducted at phylum level compositions of microbial communities in chz and nhz were similar which were both dominated by proteobacteria actinobacteria bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and firmicutes accounting for over 90 of all detected phyla fig 2 a the shannon index at species level was further calculated to analyse the alpha diversity of microbial communities the results illustrated that there was no significant difference in shannon index between chz and nhz anova p 0 809 fig 2b indicating the alpha diversity of microbial community was similar furthermore nmds analysis at species level was conducted and there was still no significant distinction between chz and nhz which indicated that the microbial communities from chz and nhz cannot be clearly distinguished through the species composition fig 2c lefse analysis was further applied to determine highly differential taxonomy from phylum to order levels among samples in chz and nhz fig 3 the results illustrated that bacterial lineages enriched in nhz were mainly propionibacteriales from order to genus and γ proteobacteria mainly of genera curvibacter methyloparacoccus and fluviicoccus taxonomies enriched in chz consisted of blastocatellia from class to family and a number of genera including terrimonas sphingobacterium blautia roseomonas alsobacter desulfoprunum lautropia and some uncultured genera among the enriched taxonomies in chz terrimonas and sphingobacterium were reported to be vital participants in transformation of nitrogenous materials qiu et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 especially the reduction processes of nitrate and nitrite which could probably contribute to more active nitrogen transformation processes in chz however the enriched taxonomies could hardly represent the functions of microbial community and cannot guarantee the occurrence of associated biogeochemical processes to this end abundances of functional genes and reaction rates of nitrogen transformation processes were further investigated 3 3 nitrogen transformation processes in chz and nhz it has been reported in previous researches that chz was hotspot for nitrogen transformation processes especially the nitrogen removal processes hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a besides the analysis of microbial community in this research also suggested that the enriched taxonomies in chz were associated with the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to further verify whether the stimulated nitrogen removal processes widely existed in chzs five nitrate and nitrite reduction pathways as well as the participated genes were quantitively investigated in five rivers respectively the reactions rates were calculated through gene centric models with the basis of genes abundances and chemical concentrations fig 4 the results illustrated that in all rivers the rates of aerobic reaction aeao were significantly lower than anaerobic reactions nar sonr nir and anao anova p 0 01 which was probably resulted from the low flow velocity fig 1 and low oxygen concentration in this area low flow velocity contributed to weak water air exchange which can inhibit the reoxygenation of water column and eventually limit the aerobic reactions gualtieri pulci doria 2012 wang et al 2021 besides nar and anao were the main pathways of nitrate and nitrite reduction respectively and the rates of nitrate reduction nar and sonr were higher than nitrite reduction nir and anao differences in rates of nitrate and nitrite reduction contributed to the decrease of no3 and the accumulation of no2 fig 5 the relatively lower rates of nir and anao inhibited the completely reduction of no3 to n2 thus the production rates of n2 were significantly lower than the reduction of no3 anova p 0 01 production of n2 represents the complete removal of nitrogenous materials from water arnon et al 2007 zhang et al 2021 these results signified that reduction of no2 was the rate limiting step governing nitrogen removal in the researched river networks significant differences in nitrogen transformation processes existed between chz and nhz the reaction rates of sonr and anao were significantly higher in chz than in nhz anova p 0 05 for both both of the genes nap and hzo mediating sonr and anao respectively were widely reported to exist in oceans and deep lakes since they are generated by microorganisms requiring low oxygen concentration and long generation time gihring et al 2010 marzocchi et al 2014 trimmer et al 2013 the convergence of two rivers with different flow directions at chz can significantly decrease the flow velocity and even form recirculating flow structure fig 1 leite ribeiro et al 2012 yuan et al 2017 which would significantly decrease oxygen concentration and increase hydraulic retention time gu et al 2012 stegen et al 2016 thus chzs can provide suitable context for the growth of microorganisms harbouring gene nap and hzo and eventually increase the reaction rates of sonr and anao moreover the change rates of different nitrogenous materials concentrations were compared between chz and nhz the results illustrated that there were no significant differences in change rates of no3 and no2 concentrations between chz and nhz anova p 0 291 for no3 and p 0 317 for no2 since they were mainly controlled by nar which maintained consistent in the whole river network however the decrease rates of nh4 and production rates of n2 were significantly higher in chz than in nhz anova p 0 05 for both mainly caused by the higher reaction rate of anao in chz the higher production rates of nitrogen illustrated that chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network 3 4 contributions of microbial community in chz on the river network the enhanced nitrogen removal processes are proved to widely exist in chzs of the researched river network it was mainly resulted from the specific hydrodynamic conditions and the distinct microbial communities formed under such context li et al 2020a however it has been demonstrated that the flow structure will recover to normal condition after chz best 1987 demonstrating that chzs will not influence the water flow of lower reaches fig 1 thus chzs can only alter the downstream nitrogen removal processes by directly transporting local microbial community to lower reaches to identify whether the microbial communities in chz would sustain in the lower reaches the bayesian based sourcetracker approach sourcetracker v1 0 1 program was applied to quantify the contributions of microbial communities in chz to other areas of the river network the researched river network consisted of six confluences the sourcetracker analysis was conducted in all of the confluence respectively the sampling points from upper reaches i e points upstream the chz and sampling points in the chz were treated as two sources sampling points from lower reaches i e points downstream chz were treated as sinks table s2 the jensen shannon divergence between any two sources were higher than 0 05 table s3 knights et al 2011 the averaged source proportional contributions and the rsd derived from ten independent runs with default parameters are summarized in table 2 the visual display of averaged source proportions was presented in fig 6 the results illustrated that all sinks consisted of microbial communities from unknown sources the proportions ranged from 8 47 to 47 25 which are probably caused by dispersal of microbial community from other potential sources not involved in this research such as sediment besides the rsd values were acceptable ranging from 1 42 to 23 11 and the mean values was 6 28 low rsd values suggested that the technical replicates through the multiple sourcetracker runs guaranteed the stability of the analysis results gu et al 2020 sun et al 2022 two sampling points with different distances to chz were set downstream each confluence and the results of sourcetracker illustrated that microbial communities from chz had significantly higher influence on closer sampling points than to farther points anova p 0 015 the contributions of microbial communities from upper reaches exhibited the opposite pattern microbial communities from chz were the dominant contributors accounting for the largest proportion to most of the sampling points closer to chz however with distances between chz and the sampling points increasing the contributions of chz microbial communities decreased instead microbial communities from upper reaches became the dominant contributors to sampling points farther from chz these results demonstrated that the microbial communities generated because of the distinct environmental factors in confluences not only existed in chz they can also exert influences on communities from lower reaches probably due to the convection and dispersal processes of water flow microorganisms in water can be free living bacterioplankton or associated with particulate matter or aggerates which will transport along with the water flow to downstream areas however with the distances increase the influences of microbial communities transported from chz would decline besides flow structure in lower reaches would recover back to normal characteristics similar with upper reaches before chz fig 1 which would generate microbial communities similar with upper reaches such a higher similarity would increase the proportions of upper reaches in soucrcetracker results thus the contributions of microbial communities from upper reaches increased and contributions of the chz declined quantifying such decline trend is essential for identifying the scope that microbial communities from chz would affect which would provide vital information for evaluating and regulating nitrogen transformation processes in river networks 3 5 quantifying the influence scope of microbial community in chz the correlations between results of sourcetracker analysis i e the contributions of microbial community from chz and upper reaches to lower reaches and distances between lower reaches and chz were analysed to identify the influence scope of microbial community in chz the contributions of microbial community from chz were negatively correlated with the distances between downstream sampling points and chz pearson p 0 015 fig 7 a while the contributions of upper reaches exhibited the opposite trend pearson p 0 2 fig 7b however correlation between distances and contribution of upper reaches was not significant suggesting that distance between chz and downstream sampling points was the only factor governing the contributions of chz and upper reaches as demonstrated in the previous researches the stimulated nitrogen transformation processes mainly existed in the flow separation zone of chz hui et al 2021 li et al 2020a the flow separation zone is characterized by the recirculating flow which is beneficial for the growth of microorganisms mediating the nitrogen removal processes it is reasonable to hypothesise that there existed correlations between the size of flow separation zone and the contributions of microbial community from chz the size of flow separation zone is mainly controlled by confluence characteristics such as confluence angle and discharge ratio between tributary and main stream gualtieri et al 2019a guillen ludena et al 2016 sukhodolov and sukhodolova 2019 in the researched river network discharge ratio should be the main factor influencing flow separation zone since the confluence angles were all close to 90 larger flow separation zone would benefit the growth of function microorganisms and the nitrogen removal processes thus higher discharge ratios tributary discharge main stream discharge could probably increase the contributions of the chz microbial communities to lower reaches to this end the correlations between discharge ratios and the contributions of chz and upper reaches were analysed with the basis of flow discharge data measured by adcp there existed significant positive correlation between the contributions of chz and the discharge ratios pearson p 0 048 fig 7c and significant negative correlation between contributions of upper reaches and discharge ratios pearson p 0 025 fig 7d these results verified pervious hypothesis indicating higher discharge ratio can increase influences of chz and decrease influences of upper reaches on lower reaches it is reasonable to considered that the combination of discharge ratios and distances between chz and downstream sampling points could better explain the changing trend of contributions thus the specific value of distance and discharge ratio distance discharge ratio d qr was set as the integrated factor and its correlation with contributions of different sources were further analysed the correlation analyses illustrated that both the contributions of chz and upper reaches were significantly correlated with the value of d r pearson p 0 05 for both suggesting the distance modified by discharge ratio to a large degree determined the contributions of microbial community from chz and upper reaches to the sampling points in lower reaches fig 7e f the fitted equations illustrated that the microbial community from chz were the dominant source when the d r value of downstream sampling point is lower than 1695 the distances between chz and the farthest sampling point dominated by chz can be considered as the influence scope of microbial community in chz thus the influence scope of microbial community would increase with the discharge ratio between tributary and main stream and it can be calculated as 1695 discharge ratio in this research area 4 conclusion in summary this research concentrated on a river network containing a series of confluences and investigated the characteristics of microbial communities and nitrogen transformation processes in both chz and nhz though general analyses of microbial community revealed that there existed no significant difference in the microbial community between chz and nhz lefse analysis exhibited that the enriched taxonomies in chz containing species associated with nitrate and nitrite reduction processes the reactions rates of different nitrogen transformation processes calculated through gene centric modelling approach further demonstrated that n2 production rates were significantly higher in chzs than nhzs signifying chzs were the hotspots for nitrogen removal in the researched river network the sourcetracker analysis was further conducted to investigate whether the stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chz would sustain in the lower reaches the results illustrated that microbial communities would exert significant influences on lower reaches and the influence scope was controlled by confluences characteristics such as discharge ratio between tributary and main stream higher discharge ratio would increase the influence scope of microbial community in chz results of this research can provide vital information for the designation and construction of river connection engineering traditional river connection engineering mostly concentrated on the improvement of river connectivity through creating the interconnections of different rivers while the influences on river ecology are always overlooked with the integration of results in this research the stimulated nitrogen removal processes in chzs and its sustaining effects could be applied in designing river connection engineering through proper settings of confluence characteristics such as connection angle and flow discharge ratio between main stream and tributary the river connectivity and the maximization of nitrogen removal can be obtained at the same time which would be beneficial

3033,urbanization if not properly managed can lead to stream channel degradation termed urban stream syndrome uss however the effects of different levels of urbanization and thresholds for degradation are not well understood the uss is characterized by increased frequency and magnitude of flood flows increased rates of channel erosion and degradation of aquatic habitat in this study changes over time in flow duration curves fdc and sediment rating curves src and resulting changes in sediment and phosphorus loads in watersheds undergoing various levels of urbanization were examined as candidate indices for detecting the presence of uss we observed that watersheds undergoing urbanization show substantial shifts in the fdc causing a notable increase over the whole range of stream flows and tilt in the src raising the exponent and decreasing the scalar coefficient the scalar coefficient in the src correlates with the percentage of the catchment area with exposed soils available for erosion which decreases notably due to urbanization and the exponent of the src increases in concert with increases in impervious cover changes in the exponent of the src associated with increased urbanization in the watershed provide an additional diagnostic tool for identification of watercourses prone to developing urban stream syndrome the combined effects of increased peak flows and the increase in the exponent of the src magnify the contribution of flood flows to the annual sediment and phosphorous loads in urbanizing watersheds the study findings support the hypothesis that destabilized stream channels subjected to uss from increased stormflow have a significant non point source of sediments and phosphorus from within the stream corridor in addition to off channel upland urban area sources keywords urbanization flow duration curve sediment rating curve land use urban stream syndrome sediment load phosphorous load data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction altered hydrological flows from urbanizing watersheds can cause a range of deleterious effects on aquatic life that may manifest into what is commonly referred to as the urban stream syndrome paul and meyer 2001 russell et al 2020 walsh et al 2005 the common symptoms of the syndrome include flashy hydrology increased rates of erosion degradation of the natural alluvium in the stream and reduction in aquatic habitat quality russell et al 2017 compiled results from 21 studies of agricultural watersheds and 13 studies of urban watersheds annual suspended sediment loads from rural watersheds had a median value of 90 tonnes km2 while urban watersheds had a median annual load of 240 tonnes km2 about three times larger than rural watersheds they found that sediment yields are likely to increase in urbanizing watersheds with an initial increase attributed to construction activities followed by a decline to rates that still exceed background conditions once full urban land cover is established development of urban stream syndrome occurs against a longer term backdrop of climate change and its effects on stream hydrology in this study we investigate the effects of urban development on several watercourses in the greater toronto area and lake simcoe watershed in ontario canada taking into account possible effects of climate change a special focus of the study is on investigating possible sources for the observed persisting increase in sediment yield from urbanized watersheds 1 1 effects of urbanization on urban stream channels the effects of urbanization on urban stream channels have been considered from multiple perspectives geomorphological effects result from changed stream hydrology and include channel enlargement and disruption of the sediment balance wolman 1967 noted changes in sediment yield of approximately 160 times between agricultural land uses and exposed construction site sources in the maryland piedmont area other studies reported increases in channel cross section catastrophic channel incision high nutrient loads legacy pollutants and substrate degradation booth 1990 walsh et al 2005 russell et al 2017 the focus of many geomorphologic studies has been on bedload russell et al 2017 annable et al 2012 while fewer studies have focused on the effects of urbanization on erosion and transport of suspended sediment and associated contaminants ampomah et al 2020 booth 1990 chin 2006 other studies have focused on the ecological effects of urbanization on stream health including nutrient transport storage and cycling withers and jarvie 2008 walsh et al 2005 these studies demonstrate the range of physical watercourse and water quality effects that may occur if suitable planning and mitigation are not incorporated into urban development 1 2 physical effects of urbanization on hydrology a shift in land use from wetlands and vegetation to impervious surfaces significantly transforms downstream hydrology in a watershed chithra et al 2015 li et al 2016 song et al 2020 many researchers have noticed stream degradation effects begin to occur when urbanization results in impervious cover exceeding approximately 10 in a watershed jenning and jarnigan 2002 wang et al 2001 bledsoe and watson 2001 land use changes to impervious surfaces reduce the infiltration capacity and significantly increase stormwater runoff while reducing groundwater recharge chithra et al 2015 jang et al 2021 demonstrated that the surface runoff rate is an effective indicator of land development impact on stream water quality escalated concentrations of suspended sediments and associated phosphorous contribute to altered hydrological processes channel adaptation and harmed biotic life within urban streams nguyen et al 2019 song et al 2020 wheeler et al 2005 a simple quantitative method to predict the effects of urbanization on hydrological flow distributions in receiving watercourses represents a research gap 1 3 impact of phosphorous on streams phosphorous p or total phosphorous tp is typically the limiting nutrient for algal growth and eutrophication of receiving watercourses controlling p loading to receiving watercourses is the overarching purpose of this study phosphorous may be present in dissolved and particulate forms affecting bioavailability mobility and removal strategies søberg et al 2020 increased phosphorous levels associated with high sediment load due to urbanization are concerning for the receiving watercourses health excess algal growth due to heightened phosphorous loads evokes risks of eutrophication a process that disturbs ecosystems conley et al 2009 duan et al 2012 salerno et al 2018 ghane et al 2016 pemberton 1990 duan et al 2012 showed that phosphorous loads were significantly greater in urban land use over agricultural uses additionally peak total phosphorous concentrations at peak discharge times were correlated with increased urban runoff during storm events pemberton 1990 lammers and bledsoe 2017 completed a review of selected studies including ten watersheds in the united states with land uses including agriculture and pasture from vermont to iowa and urban land uses in the chesapeake bay watershed they found that phosphorous content in bank materials ranged from 168 to 958 mg kg of sediment representing a significant potential source of p loading to receiving waterbodies they concluded that of the strategies they studied bank stabilization has the greatest potential to reduce phosphorous loading in unstable streams in the study area high quality hydrological flow data are typically collected and maintained by the federal water survey of canada wsc a division of environment canada at some wsc stations suspended solids data have also been collected at various times however the bulk of the water quality information used in this study was sourced from the province of ontario s provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn hydrological and water quality data were and augmented by information collected by the lake simcoe region conservation authority in addition to mitigating phosphorous before initiation of runoff and discharge to surface waters a quantitative method to quantify potential stream corridor sources of phosphorous load for planning purposes remains a research gap 1 4 sediment yield from stream channel erosion the importance of stream bank erosion as a source of sediment and associated contaminants has been recognized in recent research walter et al 2007 simon and klimetz 2008 hawley et al 2020 palmer et al 2014 completed a streambank erosion rate study in walnut creek iowa usa and found that the total basin sediment export attributed to streambank erosion ranged from 23 to 53 other authors have noted the importance of including streambank erosion sources when evaluating catchment scale suspended sediment and p loads fox et al 2016 peacher et al 2018 purvis et al 2016 previous studies have established that despite significant variability streams in urbanizing watersheds typically experience an increase in sediment yield from bank material sources devereux et al 2010 allmendinger et al 2007 nelson and booth 2002 gellis et al 2017 annable et al 2012 investigated quasi equilibrium conditions and the effects of urbanization on gravel bed urban streams in southern ontario their study focused on differences in bedload transport between urbanized and rural settings in the study area the findings demonstrated the significant changes in hydrology and the frequency of bank full flow events still they noted that the urbanizing creeks were not dissimilar to rural streams concerning bedload and channel morphology despite experiencing significantly more frequent bankfull flow and floodplain connection events papangelakis et al 2019 contrasted three southern ontario case studies in areas around the greater toronto area ontario with a history of recent glaciation the rivers were classified as semi alluvial with thin layers of alluvium overlying glaciolacustrine parent materials the paper investigated the effects of urbanization on bedload with and without traditional stormwater management in this setting and concluded that the speed of bedload displacement was increased in the urban stream without swm because of more frequent floods for the urban channel with swm peak flows were controlled however extended duration of event hydrographs resulted in a net reduction of bed material variability and increased cross section vaughan et al 2017 completed a study in minnesota usa on near channel versus watershed controls on src using random forest modeling and found that the exponent of the src is affected by near channel morphology while the scalar and low to a medium flow range of the src is most affected by watershed controls fisher et al 2021 completed a similar study along california s north coast they found that timber harvest activity in the watershed significantly affected src offset scalar while tectonic uplift affected src slope exponent a quantitative analysis of the effects of urbanization on the src represents a data gap and is investigated in this study by comparing fitted src scalar and exponent values for watersheds with a recent history of urban development 1 5 potential effects of climate change on urbanizing streams global climate change is a major contributing factor that may alter precipitation hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 2007 nguyen et al 2019 steele dunne et al 2008 and has occurred in parallel with urbanization processes in the study area in particular the occurrence of mid winter melt events changes in snowpack accumulation and intense rainfall events all have the potential to affect flow distributions in the study area zadeh et al 2020 completed a detailed analysis of trends in flood magnitude and frequency for hydrometric stations with a long period of record in canada s regional hydrometric basin network rhbn they observed significant decreasing trends in southern ontario over the period of 1967 to 2016 and a no significant trend over the period of 1987 to 2016 zadeh et al 2020 the frequency of peak flows over threshold followed a statistically significant increasing trend in southern ontario over the period of 1957 to 2015 and no significant trend over the period of 1987 to 2016 the magnitude of peak flows in southern ontario has not increased during recent decades but the frequency of peak flows has increased zadeh et al 2020 1 6 research gaps as discussed above previous studies have not presented a consistent picture of how urbanization affects suspended sediment regimes and the changes in the primary source of sediment and phosphorous loads in among the watersheds they studied in rural areas the primary source of suspended sediment load is from effectively unlimited depths of soil exposed to the erosive forces of rain and overland flow in urbanized areas this source is reduced by developing impervious surfaces which accumulate sediment during dry periods in watersheds that have experienced significant urbanization the combined effects of increased peak flows and the changes in the sediment rating curve may result in greater emphasis on the contribution of flood flows to the annual suspended sediment and phosphorous loads this study highlights the gaps in our knowledge on adverse effects of urbanization on stream hydrology and investigates the effects of urbanization on flow regime and the corresponding effects on suspended sediment load in several urbanizing watersheds a simple quantitative method to predict the effects of urbanization on hydrological flow distributions in receiving watercourses represents a research gap to address this gap we seek to answer the question of how the fdc is affected by different levels of urbanization in addition a method to quantify potential stream corridor sources of sediment and phosphorous load as well as the effects of urbanization on the src for planning purposes remain as research gaps to address these gaps we attempt to answer the question of how the src is affected by urbanization and what are the implications of urbanization induced changes in the fdc and src on overall tss and tp loads this study hypothesizes that in watersheds that have experienced significant urbanization the combined effects of increased peak flows and the changes in the sediment rating curve result in greater emphasis on the contribution of moderate to high flows to the annual suspended sediment and phosphorous loads the study focuses on urbanizing watersheds in ontario canada we compared the relative contribution of sediment and total phosphorous tp loads from rural watersheds to those from urban watersheds during pre and post urbanization periods flow sediment and phosphorous data collected in the field and assembled from provincial and federal government sources are used to support the analysis 2 methodology the following sections present the data sources and methods uses to assess and characterize hydrological flow data sediment rating curve analysis trends in the data in urbanizing watersheds and the contribution of riverine sediment loads to total phosphorous loading 2 1 data sources data used in this study were collected in the field and from existing sources including the ontario provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn provincial stream water quality monitoring network 2021 the water survey of canada wsc water survey of canada 2021 lake simcoe region conservation authority lsrca 2021a b and the toronto and region conservation authority trca an obstacle to detailed analysis of the key factors involved in tss and tp movement in urban streams is the lack of continuous measurement of tss concentrations due to the costs involved in establishing and operating water quality monitoring programs after collection of field and publicly available data in the study area eleven watersheds were selected for analysis as described in the following sections for some of the watersheds sufficient data were available to analyse changes in flow distributions but not corresponding changes in tss and tp loading the subject watersheds are shown on fig 1 and summarized in table 1 the highland creek mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and the rouge river are part of the lake ontario catchment area drain parts of the greater toronto area southwards to the lake and have varying but significant levels of urbanization in their catchment areas the holland river east branch east holland river schomberg river pefferlaw brook beaver river kettleby creek and tannery creek are part of the lake simcoe watershed as shown in table 1 seven watercourses were used to assess the effects of urbanization on the fdc these seven watercourses either have significant levels of urbanization in the watershed or in the case of kettleby and tannery creeks allowed for a side by side comparison of fdc information for similar sized watersheds with differing levels of urban development eight watersheds including three largely undeveloped one partially developed and four developed watersheds were used to evaluate the effects of urbanization on the src as shown in table 1 finally the relationship between total phosphorous tp and total suspended solids tss in the water column was investigated using four watercourses for which a significant record of water quality and flow data were available and collected in close proximity to each other six 6 of these subject watercourses were included in our previous study mackenzie et al 2022 which used machine learning to develop and test regime channel conditions in the schomberg river pefferlaw brook and beaver river that were found to be within the regime while the holland river east branch was identified as being in transition and highland creek and etobicoke creek were found to be out of regime using the model mackenzie et al 2022 investigated the stability index the ratio of specific stream power to regime specific stream power ω ω as an indicator of regime conditions and as an early detection method for identifying streams at risk of developing urban stream syndrome they found that streams with a ω ω value ranging up to approximately 1 0 were generally stable and within regime streams with a ω ω significantly exceeding 1 0 showed significant evidence of instability including active bank erosion minimal alluvium and degraded water quality mackenzie et al 2022 the percent impervious cover pic for each of the analysed watersheds was estimated using land use summaries from the ontario flow assessment tool ofat and typical pic values for residential commercial industrial and institutional development bedient and huber 1988 where a detailed breakdown of the different types of urban development was not available the distribution for urban land uses of similar age in the study area was adopted from the gis analysis completed by betts et al 2014 historical pic was assessed using the fraction of each watershed in urban land use as identified using historical google earth imagery it was assumed that the relationship between pic and percentage urban land use identified using gis analysis of current conditions betts et al 2014 bedient and huber 1988 remains applicable to the early stage urbanization scenario 2 2 flow duration curve analysis where sufficiently long records of flow existed comparisons were made for individual watersheds for pre development and post development period that differed in their level of urbanization post development periods were further classified into early stage 10 to 50 urban land use and late stage greater than 50 urban land use in this study we used flow duration curves fdc to assess the flow regime in the subject watercourses fdcs present the cumulative probability of exceedance for any observed flow rate rosburg et al 2017 vogel and fennessey 1994 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the range of observed daily flow data was plotted on the vertical axis against the probability of exceedance on the horizontal axis using the weibull plotting position approach leong and yokoo 2021 completed a comprehensive review of over 200 publications using fdc during the period of 2010 to 2020 in their review leong and yokoo identified the types and typical applications of fdc as well as commenting on the applicability and transferability of fdc between watercourses leong and yokoo identified a need for a general framework for process based modelling using fdc to allow for comparisons between fdcs it is convenient to normalize the flow data by drainage area for this reason the fdcs were normalized by dividing discharge by the contributing drainage area l s 1 km 2 in addition if the flow data fit a lognormal probability distribution function as shown in equation 1 the fdc may be represented by two parameters allowing basic comparisons of the overall shape and range of the data between watercourses 1 f x e x p 1 2 ln x μ σ 2 x σ 2 π where x a random variable greater than zero µ the location parameter and σ the scale parameter 2 3 sediment rating curve analysis sediment rating curves src are a common way to relate total suspended sediment tss load and instantaneous flow rate in the absence of continuous measurement of tss loading ampomah et al 2020 stang et al 2016 efthimiou 2019 heng and suetsugi 2014 heng and suetsugi 2015 isik 2013 farnsworth and warrick 2007 fisher et al 2021 gray 2018 syvitski et al 2000 syvitski and millman 2007 warrick et al 2013 warrick 2015 ellison et al 2014 and were used to assess tss load in the current study warrick 2015 provides a comprehensive discussion of the use of srcs for trend analysis of suspended sediment discharge along with the various form srcs may take where sufficient data exist srcs provide a convenient method of quantifying sediment load in a stream in some cases src may be limited by the amount of data data collection methods sufficient high flow events in the data record seasonal changes in sediment source availability the length of intervals between sampled sediment mobilization events and the duration of events and hysteresis effects warrick et al 2015 srcs for watersheds in our case studies with varying degrees of urbanization were developed to examine suspended sediment behavior against instantaneous flow rate as the watersheds being compared consist of different catchment areas geographic precipitation patterns and land use regimes it is necessary to normalize the data units of volumetric flow rate l s 1 km 2 and sediment load kg day 1 km 2 are used to compare the behavior of each watershed in this study suspended sediment loads were found to be a power function of flow rate at the time of sampling as shown in equation 2 2 tssload s c a l a r f l o w exponent 2 4 time trends in fdc and src to assess time trends in fdc and src we selected pre development flow periods to be similar for all the studied watercourses but note that the level of urban development during the pre urbanization periods was not zero in any of the urbanized watersheds studied trends in the fdc and src parameters were assessed and related to pic 2 5 comparison of two adjacent watersheds with differing levels of urbanization in addition to the pre and post development comparisons described in the urbanizing watersheds described above two creeks in the lake simcoe watershed with similar drainage areas and physiography were compared based on a common contemporary flow record for 2010 to 2019 the kettleby and tannery creek sub watersheds are adjacent and located in the southern part of the lake simcoe watershed as shown in fig 1 the kettleby and tannery creek watersheds are in the same hydrometeorological setting but have different land uses 2 6 phosphorous and sediment relationship p concentration data are increasingly available from published sources lake simcoe region conservation authority lsrca 2021a ontario provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn however total suspended solids tss data are still more commonly available and p concentrations are highly correlated with tss concentrations in watercourses the tss concentration data available from the pwqmn for several watercourses in the study area were used to investigate the relationship between p and tss concentrations in river water to allow estimates of p concentrations and loading to be completed in watercourses where tss but not p concentration data are available the tp to tss concentration relationship was evaluated over the available range of the data allowing inferences to be made about the proportion of tp associated with tss over a range of flow rates 3 results the results of the analyses described above are presented in the following sections on flow duration curve analysis sediment rating curve analysis time trends and phosphorous and sediment relationships 3 1 flow duration curve analysis table 2 provides a summary of hydrological characteristics of the study watercourses for pre and post urbanization or early and later urbanization periods for each watercourse the fdcs are represented by log normal distribution µ and σ parameter for both pre development and post development periods the percent urbanization was estimated for the analyzed watersheds using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat accessed 2021 and google earth pro google accessed 2021 a comparison of fdcs for the periods of 1968 to 1988 and 1998 to 2018 in mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and rouge river is shown on fig 2 3 2 sediment rating curve analysis table 3 provides a summary of water quality characteristics for the same early and later stage urbanization periods as those used for fdc assessment a comparison of the srcs for three dominantly rural and three urbanized watersheds is presented on fig 3 3 3 time trends in fdc and src table 2 and 3 include watercourses for which a long and complete period of record suitable for developing both fdcs and srcs for periods separated by at least two decades with notable changes in the level of urbanization in southern ontario are available the fdc data are represented by log normal distribution location and scale parameters for each watershed and development period similarly the power function srcs are represented by scalar coefficient and exponent parameters for each watershed and development period 3 4 phosphorous and sediment relationship a comparison between suspended sediment and phosphorous concentration data is presented on fig 4 the illustrated relationship allows p loading to be estimated from estimates of tss as described in the discussion section of this article 4 discussion we investigated the effects of urbanization on flow and sediment regimes by comparing the flow duration curve and the sediment rating curve characteristics presented in tables 2 and 3 for the pre and post urbanization periods pic was used as the independent variable to quantify the level of urban development changes to catchment hydrology resulting from removal of vegetation hardening of surfaces and direct connection of impervious areas to drainage networks are generally recognized to result in increases in total annual water balance increases in peak runoff flow rates and decreases in base flows in addition to the hardening of surfaces which discourages infiltration and encourages rapid runoff event effects urbanization also reduces near ground surface storage of water which may cause significant reductions in annual evaporation losses and hence increases in total water balance water budget effects these findings are discussed in more detail in the following sections on the effects of urbanization on fdc and src p and sediment relationships in the water column results from a paired watershed comparison showing differing characteristics of an urbanized versus a rural watershed and the net effects of urbanization on sediment and phosphorous loading from watercourses 4 1 effect of urbanization on flow duration curves a review of the data summarized in table 2 shows that the normalized mean daily discharge tends to increase with increasing pic this finding is consistent with observed increases in fdc shown on fig 2 and is attributed to reduced storage in the watershed increased runoff from impervious surfaces and increased connectivity of impervious areas to the drainage network this observation illustrates a key risk factor for channel stability i e the challenge of passing significantly larger post urbanization flows through a channel with a cross section adapted over centuries or millennia to a much smaller range of pre development flows a comparison of fdcs for the periods of 1968 to 1988 and 1998 to 2018 in mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and rouge river is shown in fig 2 the fdc for mimico creek and don river did not change significantly between the two time periods while the level of urbanization increased by only 10 for both watersheds in contrast the fdcs for etobicoke creek and rouge river show an increase across the whole range of flows between the two periods corresponding with an increase in the level of urbanization from approximately 30 to 60 and 10 to 50 respectively this comparison suggests that the effects of climate change in the absence of substantial change in the level of urbanization were less significant than the effects of increases in urbanization in this study area over the relatively short time period considered our results show that there were relatively small changes in fdcs in the absence of significant land use change over recent decades this result is consistent with the findings of zadeh et al 2020 findings on flood magnitude and frequency in southern ontario while not the focus of this study it follows that any future climate change induced increases in flow distribution will likely cause similar changes to suspended sediment load as those caused by urbanization related increases in flow distribution 4 2 effect of urbanization on sediment rating curves fig 3 presents the srcs of three dominantly rural and three urbanized watersheds the exponent of the src for the rural watersheds is lower than the exponent of the src for the urbanized watersheds additionally the scalar of the src is significantly larger in magnitude in predominately rural watersheds compared to the urbanized watersheds changes in the scalar coefficient of the src are indicative of a reduction in readily available sediment sources associated with agriculture and are attributed to increases in impervious cover in urbanizing watersheds rural areas with areas of exposed soil but with limited overland flow connectivity have in general lower suspended sediment loads than urban areas with a high proportion of impermeable area and good flow path connectivity for overland flow russell et al 2017 this is observed despite suspended sediments loads from impermeable surfaces being limited by dry weather accumulation rates liu et al 2018 wicke et al 2012 increases in the exponent slope of the src are indicative of an increase in riverbank and floodplain sources of sediment and represent an additional diagnostic tool for identifying watercourses that are at risk of developing urban channel syndrome in addition to upland sources the current study findings provide support for an important additional non point source of sediments from within the stream corridor in destabilized stream channels subjected to increased flow distributions as discussed by lammers and bledsoe 2017 2019 the findings are consistent with the findings of vaughan et al 2017 and illustrate a significant management opportunity watershed sources are reduced with urbanization as impervious areas are introduced but increases in the fdc and the exponent of the src continue to mobilize and transport sediment in river corridors asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 note that the src may change shape scalar coefficient and exponent with the passage of time changes in land use and availability of sediment sources at low flow conditions ampomah et al s 2020 data from the cuyuhoga river in ohio usa showed similar trends in the relationship between annual suspended sediment load and annual streamflow for three periods of development an initial period 1951 to 1983 with approximately 25 urbanization and a subsequent period 1988 to 2000 with increasing levels of urbanization and a final period 2001 to 2011 with approximately 50 of the watershed urbanized a review of the src parameters presented in table 3 shows that the exponent of the src tends to increase with increasing pic this finding is consistent with similar studies e g warrick and rubin 2007 asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 and suggests a decrease in the availability of sediment sources in the watershed along with increasing importance of within stream sources particularly at high flow conditions the increase in src with increasing pic is typically coincident with a decrease in the scalar coefficient of the src in stream channels cut through erodible materials without the protection armouring alluvium or riparian vegetation watercourses may become unstable and active erosion of the riverbanks may become a significant source of tss load 4 3 phosphorous and sediment relationship the comparison between suspended sediment and phosphorous concentration data fig 4 shows a strong correlation between the two variables the power function trendlines have an exponent less than one indicating downward concavity which is attributed to increases in tss suspended particle size distribution at increasing concentrations caused by increasing streamflow rates at low flow rates the tss size distribution is expected to be predominantly fine grained silt and finer particle sizes while at higher flow rates the tss size regime is increasingly expected to include larger particles fine sand and larger particle sizes as the flow competency increases p concentration correlation with tss concentration depends strongly on p adsorbing to tss particles although significant storm events will mobilize larger sized sediment particles in the watercourse the relative increase in phosphorous content is not expected to be as large as the tss increases due to the relationship shown on fig 4 knowledge of the shape of this relationship is necessary to estimate p loading from tss loading data 4 4 rural watersheds a summary of fdc and src characteristics as well as calculated estimates of tss and tp load are presented in tables 2 and 3 as a result of the small level of pic in the schomberg river watershed the fdc src mean discharge and q2 did not change substantially during this period and the tss and tp load remained relatively constant between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 similarly the value of ω ω for the schomberg river did not changed substantially between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 as a result of the small level of pid in the beaver river watershed the fdc and src did not change substantially during this period the mean annual flow decreased and q2 increased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 a change we attribute to improvements in the monitoring station installation and changes in weather patterns during this period the estimated tss and tp load increased in concert with the changes in the fdc and q2 the value of ω ω for the beaver river remained approximately constant at 1 4 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 pefferlaw brook drains a rural watershed with primarily agricultural land uses urban development in the watershed is not substantial and the src fig 3 is consistent with other rural watercourses beaver river and schomberg river in the study area 4 5 urban and urbanizing watersheds as a result of urban development in the east holland watershed between the 1996 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 periods the mean daily discharge fdc and exponent of the src increased while the scalar coefficient of the src decreased as a result of these changes the tss and tp loads decreased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for the holland river east branch changed from 5 3 to 6 9 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 indicating an increase in the level of instability as described in mackenzie et al 2022 this assessment is consistent with the authors recent observations of bank erosion in some of the tributaries of the holland river east branch as a result of urban development in the rouge river watershed between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the mean daily discharge fdc and exponent of the src were observed to increase while the scalar coefficient of the src decreased the tss and tp loads decreased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the src of rouge river pwqmn station id 06009701102 over a period where the area of urban land use increased from approximately 10 1968 1988 to 50 1998 2018 is shown fig 5 the normalized by drainage area tss and tp loads show more complicated responses to increasing pic there is an initial and significant increase in both tss and tp loads with increases in pic below pic values of approximately 5 tss and tp load remain elevated but relatively constant over the range of pic valued from approximately 5 to 25 based on limited site specific high load data for highland creek tp and tss load increase substantially again for values of pic greater than approximately 25 indicating that the watercourse is in a significantly degraded state and is actively eroding its bed and banks a finding that is confirmed by field observations of eroding banks in highland creek and a history of channel stability interventions papangelakis et al 2019 studied three watercourses in similar settings to the watercourses in the current study area greater toronto area and found that urban streams had more frequent bed material mobilization events the changes in the src associated with an increased level of urbanization follow the general trend explained previously the exponent increases from 1 42 to 2 22 and the scalar decreases from 0 88 to 0 07 a similar trend is also observed for the etobicoke creek fig 6 as a result of continuing urbanization in the etobicoke creek watershed between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the mean daily discharge q2 fdc and both the scalar coefficient and exponent of the src increased as a result of these changes the tss and tp loads both increased significantly between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for etobicoke creek changed from 6 0 to 10 5 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 there are extensive existing channel stabilization and armouring works along the main channel of the creek indicating its history of erosion and flooding issues the observed behavior can be attributed to a decrease and change in watershed sediment sources paired with mobilized sediment within the stream leading to a shifted sediment load hence an increased exponent and decreased scalar the sediment load experienced during the post development period only surpasses the pre development period at higher flows occurring approximately at 30 l s 1 km 2 and beyond as flow rates of that magnitude are only reached during major flood events it is imperative to note that in attempts to reduce sediment and associated phosphorous load lids targeted to treat infrequent peak flows during large events will be most beneficial don river and mimico creek both drain urbanized catchments in the greater toronto area however the level of urbanization did not change substantially between the two analysis periods presented in tables 2 and 3 review of figs 2 and 3 show that the fdc did not change substantially for either of these watercourses between the two analysis periods fig 2 however the exponent of the src fig 3 is elevated approximately equal to 2 compared to the exponent of the src for rural watercourses the effect of land use change including urbanization on both the fdc and src are well documented e g leong and yokoo 2021 asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 the fdc increased in the study area as a result of urbanization and associated increases in the percent of impervious cover pic while the scalar coefficient of the src may decrease substantially as pic increases and immobilizes watershed sediment sources typical of rural and agricultural land uses these results are generally consistent with the findings of other researchers russell et al 2017 2018 vaughan 2017 but the magnitude and direction of changes may be different at times depending on the relative erodibility of agricultural soils and river corridor sediments in the pre development scenario the intensity of construction activities at the time of assessment and the implantation of swm practices the net effect of these sometimes opposite effects of urbanization on src scalar coefficients and the fdc can only be assessed by considering the annual tss load and the volume weighted tss concentration in annual streamflow as a result of continuing urbanization in the highland creek watershed between the periods of 1956 to 1976 and 1998 to 2018 the pic increased from 25 to 45 table 2 fig 7 shows a large shift in the flow regime suggesting that the increase in impervious cover increased discharge rates during rainfall events and caused a reduction in watershed storage and evaporation losses fig 7 also presents the mean annual flow from 1960 to 2020 despite the mean annual precipitation remaining constant over this period the mean annual flow in highland creek is seen to increase the most indicative rise in mean annual flow occurred over the period 1960 1980 where the flow approximately doubled as the level of urbanization rose by approximately 15 this further suggests the altered hydrological flows are dominated by the effects of urbanization over climate change over the relatively short time period considered the pic increased from approximately 25 to 45 between the period of 1956 to 1976 and 1998 to 2018 as a result of urban development as a result of this change the mean daily discharge q2 fdc table 2 and both the scalar coefficient and exponent of the src increased substantially table 3 as a result of these changes the tss load increased by approximately two orders of magnitude and the tp load increased by approximately one order of magnitude between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for highland creek changed from approximately 13 8 to 22 6 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 indicating that the watercourse was not in regime during either of these periods is already experiencing the effects of urban stream syndrome and is at risk of further degradation without additional intervention to stabilize the channel and correct the fdc a result confirmed by field observations of substantial areas of eroding banks 4 6 two adjacent watersheds tannery kettleby creeks kettleby and tannery creek drain adjacent watersheds with similar drainage areas in a similar hydrometeorological setting but with different land uses for these two watersheds continuous flow data were only available for a recent period of time for which we assumed land use was relatively static the comparison of flow data from these two watersheds offers an alternate evaluation of the effects of urbanization on fdc from the before and after comparisons presented in previous sections the fdcs shown in fig 8 displays the predictable shift in hydrological flows between the rural kettleby creek and urbanizing tannery creek watersheds the fdcs are observed to cross with frequent low flow being higher in the rural watercourse compared to the urbanizing watercourse however the most notable differences are for the median to low frequency high flows which are substantially larger in the urban watershed suggesting both a significant increase in the annual water balance and peak runoff events with a current approximate difference of 50 urbanization between the watersheds the causes of the increased flows are evident the larger surface area of impervious cover in the tannery creek watershed decreases the infiltration capacity and exacerbates the runoff effects during rainfall events for a common and recent period of record the test and control comparison between the adjacent tannery and kettleby creeks further suggests that the effects of increased urbanization outweigh the effects of climate change on fdcs over the shorter period of urbanization in the study area 4 7 effects of urbanization on sediment and phosphorus loads mean daily volume weighted average concentrations of tss and tp for the pre and post development periods are summarized in table 3 volume weighted average concentrations reflect the skewed distribution of flow and loads wherein a large fraction of the annual load is transported in a small fraction of days with high flows the volume weighted concentrations were calculated by dividing the normalized by drainage area total annual load by the normalized mean daily flow in the watercourse a review of the results shows that volume weighted tss and tp concentrations increase substantially with increasing pic this finding illustrates the difficulty of assessing the significance of effects on loading when comparing discrete sample results often collected on fair weather days to concentration objectives this difficulty is exacerbated by the relatively short duration of high flow events and low probability of collecting a representative range of discrete samples in any given year 5 conclusions unmitigated urbanization can cause substantial increases in the flow regime as evidenced by a comparison of fdcs and srcs for the case study watersheds before and following significant increases in the percent impervious cover in these watersheds comparison of fdcs for etobicoke creek and rouge river for early and late stage urbanization periods shows a notable increase across the whole range of flows between the two periods the changes to the src generally include an increase in the exponent slope in log log domain of the src and a decrease in the scalar coefficient the decrease in the scalar coefficient of the src is attributed to the immobilization of watershed sources of sediments when hardened urban surfaces replace rural land uses and the exposed soil is covered the increase in the exponent with increases in the level of urbanization and pic is attributed in part to the increased frequency of flood events causing erosion of the streambed and banks a result that is generally consistent with papangelakis et al s 2019 findings the combined effect of increases in the peak flows and in the exponent of the src is to significantly increase the contribution of the flood flows to the annual sediment and phosphorous loads in urbanizing watersheds in addition sources of soil erosion and sediment load which become limited by impervious cover in the catchment tend to shift from the upland areas to streambed and bank erosion sources the combined effects of increases in fdc decreases in the scalar coefficient of the src and increases in the exponent of the src illustrate the complex effects of urbanization on tss and tp load in urban streams furthermore time weighted average tss and tp concentrations do not provide a complete picture of the potential effects of urbanization on tss and tp load more robust assessments of tss and sediment load should consider continuous or more frequent water quality monitoring assessment of concentrations over the full range of flows and consideration of volume weighted average concentrations the methods used in this study provide a quantitative way to estimate the effects of urbanization on stream flow distribution fdc src and sediment and phosphorous loading based on the percent of impervious cover in urbanizing areas the quantitative changes in the fdc and srcs are specific to the current study area and watersheds however the investigative methods used can be applied to other study areas urban stormwater management systems can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization on streamflow and sediment regimes systems that prioritize storage infiltration and evapotranspiration should be included to in an attempt to prevent significant deviation of the water budget from pre development conditions additionally in efforts to reduce the component of the annual sediment load mobilized by larger flood flows streambed and bank stabilization as well as stormwater management systems that provide significant control of peak flows during large storm events will prove to be most beneficial further research is required to identify cost effective systems to restore the health of the ecosystem of urbanizing streams while not the focus of this study any climate change induced increases in fdc has the potential to cause similar changes in suspended sediment load to those caused by urbanization related increases in fdc for existing urbanized areas where lid retrofit opportunities are limited stream rehabilitation measures to bring the channel morphology into a new balance i e regime conditions should be supported however stream restoration efforts and catchment lid retrofit projects should be done with a holistic treatment train design approach targeting a cost optimized solution for sustainable development with the protection of the ecosystem health of urban streams in

3033,urbanization if not properly managed can lead to stream channel degradation termed urban stream syndrome uss however the effects of different levels of urbanization and thresholds for degradation are not well understood the uss is characterized by increased frequency and magnitude of flood flows increased rates of channel erosion and degradation of aquatic habitat in this study changes over time in flow duration curves fdc and sediment rating curves src and resulting changes in sediment and phosphorus loads in watersheds undergoing various levels of urbanization were examined as candidate indices for detecting the presence of uss we observed that watersheds undergoing urbanization show substantial shifts in the fdc causing a notable increase over the whole range of stream flows and tilt in the src raising the exponent and decreasing the scalar coefficient the scalar coefficient in the src correlates with the percentage of the catchment area with exposed soils available for erosion which decreases notably due to urbanization and the exponent of the src increases in concert with increases in impervious cover changes in the exponent of the src associated with increased urbanization in the watershed provide an additional diagnostic tool for identification of watercourses prone to developing urban stream syndrome the combined effects of increased peak flows and the increase in the exponent of the src magnify the contribution of flood flows to the annual sediment and phosphorous loads in urbanizing watersheds the study findings support the hypothesis that destabilized stream channels subjected to uss from increased stormflow have a significant non point source of sediments and phosphorus from within the stream corridor in addition to off channel upland urban area sources keywords urbanization flow duration curve sediment rating curve land use urban stream syndrome sediment load phosphorous load data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction altered hydrological flows from urbanizing watersheds can cause a range of deleterious effects on aquatic life that may manifest into what is commonly referred to as the urban stream syndrome paul and meyer 2001 russell et al 2020 walsh et al 2005 the common symptoms of the syndrome include flashy hydrology increased rates of erosion degradation of the natural alluvium in the stream and reduction in aquatic habitat quality russell et al 2017 compiled results from 21 studies of agricultural watersheds and 13 studies of urban watersheds annual suspended sediment loads from rural watersheds had a median value of 90 tonnes km2 while urban watersheds had a median annual load of 240 tonnes km2 about three times larger than rural watersheds they found that sediment yields are likely to increase in urbanizing watersheds with an initial increase attributed to construction activities followed by a decline to rates that still exceed background conditions once full urban land cover is established development of urban stream syndrome occurs against a longer term backdrop of climate change and its effects on stream hydrology in this study we investigate the effects of urban development on several watercourses in the greater toronto area and lake simcoe watershed in ontario canada taking into account possible effects of climate change a special focus of the study is on investigating possible sources for the observed persisting increase in sediment yield from urbanized watersheds 1 1 effects of urbanization on urban stream channels the effects of urbanization on urban stream channels have been considered from multiple perspectives geomorphological effects result from changed stream hydrology and include channel enlargement and disruption of the sediment balance wolman 1967 noted changes in sediment yield of approximately 160 times between agricultural land uses and exposed construction site sources in the maryland piedmont area other studies reported increases in channel cross section catastrophic channel incision high nutrient loads legacy pollutants and substrate degradation booth 1990 walsh et al 2005 russell et al 2017 the focus of many geomorphologic studies has been on bedload russell et al 2017 annable et al 2012 while fewer studies have focused on the effects of urbanization on erosion and transport of suspended sediment and associated contaminants ampomah et al 2020 booth 1990 chin 2006 other studies have focused on the ecological effects of urbanization on stream health including nutrient transport storage and cycling withers and jarvie 2008 walsh et al 2005 these studies demonstrate the range of physical watercourse and water quality effects that may occur if suitable planning and mitigation are not incorporated into urban development 1 2 physical effects of urbanization on hydrology a shift in land use from wetlands and vegetation to impervious surfaces significantly transforms downstream hydrology in a watershed chithra et al 2015 li et al 2016 song et al 2020 many researchers have noticed stream degradation effects begin to occur when urbanization results in impervious cover exceeding approximately 10 in a watershed jenning and jarnigan 2002 wang et al 2001 bledsoe and watson 2001 land use changes to impervious surfaces reduce the infiltration capacity and significantly increase stormwater runoff while reducing groundwater recharge chithra et al 2015 jang et al 2021 demonstrated that the surface runoff rate is an effective indicator of land development impact on stream water quality escalated concentrations of suspended sediments and associated phosphorous contribute to altered hydrological processes channel adaptation and harmed biotic life within urban streams nguyen et al 2019 song et al 2020 wheeler et al 2005 a simple quantitative method to predict the effects of urbanization on hydrological flow distributions in receiving watercourses represents a research gap 1 3 impact of phosphorous on streams phosphorous p or total phosphorous tp is typically the limiting nutrient for algal growth and eutrophication of receiving watercourses controlling p loading to receiving watercourses is the overarching purpose of this study phosphorous may be present in dissolved and particulate forms affecting bioavailability mobility and removal strategies søberg et al 2020 increased phosphorous levels associated with high sediment load due to urbanization are concerning for the receiving watercourses health excess algal growth due to heightened phosphorous loads evokes risks of eutrophication a process that disturbs ecosystems conley et al 2009 duan et al 2012 salerno et al 2018 ghane et al 2016 pemberton 1990 duan et al 2012 showed that phosphorous loads were significantly greater in urban land use over agricultural uses additionally peak total phosphorous concentrations at peak discharge times were correlated with increased urban runoff during storm events pemberton 1990 lammers and bledsoe 2017 completed a review of selected studies including ten watersheds in the united states with land uses including agriculture and pasture from vermont to iowa and urban land uses in the chesapeake bay watershed they found that phosphorous content in bank materials ranged from 168 to 958 mg kg of sediment representing a significant potential source of p loading to receiving waterbodies they concluded that of the strategies they studied bank stabilization has the greatest potential to reduce phosphorous loading in unstable streams in the study area high quality hydrological flow data are typically collected and maintained by the federal water survey of canada wsc a division of environment canada at some wsc stations suspended solids data have also been collected at various times however the bulk of the water quality information used in this study was sourced from the province of ontario s provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn hydrological and water quality data were and augmented by information collected by the lake simcoe region conservation authority in addition to mitigating phosphorous before initiation of runoff and discharge to surface waters a quantitative method to quantify potential stream corridor sources of phosphorous load for planning purposes remains a research gap 1 4 sediment yield from stream channel erosion the importance of stream bank erosion as a source of sediment and associated contaminants has been recognized in recent research walter et al 2007 simon and klimetz 2008 hawley et al 2020 palmer et al 2014 completed a streambank erosion rate study in walnut creek iowa usa and found that the total basin sediment export attributed to streambank erosion ranged from 23 to 53 other authors have noted the importance of including streambank erosion sources when evaluating catchment scale suspended sediment and p loads fox et al 2016 peacher et al 2018 purvis et al 2016 previous studies have established that despite significant variability streams in urbanizing watersheds typically experience an increase in sediment yield from bank material sources devereux et al 2010 allmendinger et al 2007 nelson and booth 2002 gellis et al 2017 annable et al 2012 investigated quasi equilibrium conditions and the effects of urbanization on gravel bed urban streams in southern ontario their study focused on differences in bedload transport between urbanized and rural settings in the study area the findings demonstrated the significant changes in hydrology and the frequency of bank full flow events still they noted that the urbanizing creeks were not dissimilar to rural streams concerning bedload and channel morphology despite experiencing significantly more frequent bankfull flow and floodplain connection events papangelakis et al 2019 contrasted three southern ontario case studies in areas around the greater toronto area ontario with a history of recent glaciation the rivers were classified as semi alluvial with thin layers of alluvium overlying glaciolacustrine parent materials the paper investigated the effects of urbanization on bedload with and without traditional stormwater management in this setting and concluded that the speed of bedload displacement was increased in the urban stream without swm because of more frequent floods for the urban channel with swm peak flows were controlled however extended duration of event hydrographs resulted in a net reduction of bed material variability and increased cross section vaughan et al 2017 completed a study in minnesota usa on near channel versus watershed controls on src using random forest modeling and found that the exponent of the src is affected by near channel morphology while the scalar and low to a medium flow range of the src is most affected by watershed controls fisher et al 2021 completed a similar study along california s north coast they found that timber harvest activity in the watershed significantly affected src offset scalar while tectonic uplift affected src slope exponent a quantitative analysis of the effects of urbanization on the src represents a data gap and is investigated in this study by comparing fitted src scalar and exponent values for watersheds with a recent history of urban development 1 5 potential effects of climate change on urbanizing streams global climate change is a major contributing factor that may alter precipitation hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 2007 nguyen et al 2019 steele dunne et al 2008 and has occurred in parallel with urbanization processes in the study area in particular the occurrence of mid winter melt events changes in snowpack accumulation and intense rainfall events all have the potential to affect flow distributions in the study area zadeh et al 2020 completed a detailed analysis of trends in flood magnitude and frequency for hydrometric stations with a long period of record in canada s regional hydrometric basin network rhbn they observed significant decreasing trends in southern ontario over the period of 1967 to 2016 and a no significant trend over the period of 1987 to 2016 zadeh et al 2020 the frequency of peak flows over threshold followed a statistically significant increasing trend in southern ontario over the period of 1957 to 2015 and no significant trend over the period of 1987 to 2016 the magnitude of peak flows in southern ontario has not increased during recent decades but the frequency of peak flows has increased zadeh et al 2020 1 6 research gaps as discussed above previous studies have not presented a consistent picture of how urbanization affects suspended sediment regimes and the changes in the primary source of sediment and phosphorous loads in among the watersheds they studied in rural areas the primary source of suspended sediment load is from effectively unlimited depths of soil exposed to the erosive forces of rain and overland flow in urbanized areas this source is reduced by developing impervious surfaces which accumulate sediment during dry periods in watersheds that have experienced significant urbanization the combined effects of increased peak flows and the changes in the sediment rating curve may result in greater emphasis on the contribution of flood flows to the annual suspended sediment and phosphorous loads this study highlights the gaps in our knowledge on adverse effects of urbanization on stream hydrology and investigates the effects of urbanization on flow regime and the corresponding effects on suspended sediment load in several urbanizing watersheds a simple quantitative method to predict the effects of urbanization on hydrological flow distributions in receiving watercourses represents a research gap to address this gap we seek to answer the question of how the fdc is affected by different levels of urbanization in addition a method to quantify potential stream corridor sources of sediment and phosphorous load as well as the effects of urbanization on the src for planning purposes remain as research gaps to address these gaps we attempt to answer the question of how the src is affected by urbanization and what are the implications of urbanization induced changes in the fdc and src on overall tss and tp loads this study hypothesizes that in watersheds that have experienced significant urbanization the combined effects of increased peak flows and the changes in the sediment rating curve result in greater emphasis on the contribution of moderate to high flows to the annual suspended sediment and phosphorous loads the study focuses on urbanizing watersheds in ontario canada we compared the relative contribution of sediment and total phosphorous tp loads from rural watersheds to those from urban watersheds during pre and post urbanization periods flow sediment and phosphorous data collected in the field and assembled from provincial and federal government sources are used to support the analysis 2 methodology the following sections present the data sources and methods uses to assess and characterize hydrological flow data sediment rating curve analysis trends in the data in urbanizing watersheds and the contribution of riverine sediment loads to total phosphorous loading 2 1 data sources data used in this study were collected in the field and from existing sources including the ontario provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn provincial stream water quality monitoring network 2021 the water survey of canada wsc water survey of canada 2021 lake simcoe region conservation authority lsrca 2021a b and the toronto and region conservation authority trca an obstacle to detailed analysis of the key factors involved in tss and tp movement in urban streams is the lack of continuous measurement of tss concentrations due to the costs involved in establishing and operating water quality monitoring programs after collection of field and publicly available data in the study area eleven watersheds were selected for analysis as described in the following sections for some of the watersheds sufficient data were available to analyse changes in flow distributions but not corresponding changes in tss and tp loading the subject watersheds are shown on fig 1 and summarized in table 1 the highland creek mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and the rouge river are part of the lake ontario catchment area drain parts of the greater toronto area southwards to the lake and have varying but significant levels of urbanization in their catchment areas the holland river east branch east holland river schomberg river pefferlaw brook beaver river kettleby creek and tannery creek are part of the lake simcoe watershed as shown in table 1 seven watercourses were used to assess the effects of urbanization on the fdc these seven watercourses either have significant levels of urbanization in the watershed or in the case of kettleby and tannery creeks allowed for a side by side comparison of fdc information for similar sized watersheds with differing levels of urban development eight watersheds including three largely undeveloped one partially developed and four developed watersheds were used to evaluate the effects of urbanization on the src as shown in table 1 finally the relationship between total phosphorous tp and total suspended solids tss in the water column was investigated using four watercourses for which a significant record of water quality and flow data were available and collected in close proximity to each other six 6 of these subject watercourses were included in our previous study mackenzie et al 2022 which used machine learning to develop and test regime channel conditions in the schomberg river pefferlaw brook and beaver river that were found to be within the regime while the holland river east branch was identified as being in transition and highland creek and etobicoke creek were found to be out of regime using the model mackenzie et al 2022 investigated the stability index the ratio of specific stream power to regime specific stream power ω ω as an indicator of regime conditions and as an early detection method for identifying streams at risk of developing urban stream syndrome they found that streams with a ω ω value ranging up to approximately 1 0 were generally stable and within regime streams with a ω ω significantly exceeding 1 0 showed significant evidence of instability including active bank erosion minimal alluvium and degraded water quality mackenzie et al 2022 the percent impervious cover pic for each of the analysed watersheds was estimated using land use summaries from the ontario flow assessment tool ofat and typical pic values for residential commercial industrial and institutional development bedient and huber 1988 where a detailed breakdown of the different types of urban development was not available the distribution for urban land uses of similar age in the study area was adopted from the gis analysis completed by betts et al 2014 historical pic was assessed using the fraction of each watershed in urban land use as identified using historical google earth imagery it was assumed that the relationship between pic and percentage urban land use identified using gis analysis of current conditions betts et al 2014 bedient and huber 1988 remains applicable to the early stage urbanization scenario 2 2 flow duration curve analysis where sufficiently long records of flow existed comparisons were made for individual watersheds for pre development and post development period that differed in their level of urbanization post development periods were further classified into early stage 10 to 50 urban land use and late stage greater than 50 urban land use in this study we used flow duration curves fdc to assess the flow regime in the subject watercourses fdcs present the cumulative probability of exceedance for any observed flow rate rosburg et al 2017 vogel and fennessey 1994 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the range of observed daily flow data was plotted on the vertical axis against the probability of exceedance on the horizontal axis using the weibull plotting position approach leong and yokoo 2021 completed a comprehensive review of over 200 publications using fdc during the period of 2010 to 2020 in their review leong and yokoo identified the types and typical applications of fdc as well as commenting on the applicability and transferability of fdc between watercourses leong and yokoo identified a need for a general framework for process based modelling using fdc to allow for comparisons between fdcs it is convenient to normalize the flow data by drainage area for this reason the fdcs were normalized by dividing discharge by the contributing drainage area l s 1 km 2 in addition if the flow data fit a lognormal probability distribution function as shown in equation 1 the fdc may be represented by two parameters allowing basic comparisons of the overall shape and range of the data between watercourses 1 f x e x p 1 2 ln x μ σ 2 x σ 2 π where x a random variable greater than zero µ the location parameter and σ the scale parameter 2 3 sediment rating curve analysis sediment rating curves src are a common way to relate total suspended sediment tss load and instantaneous flow rate in the absence of continuous measurement of tss loading ampomah et al 2020 stang et al 2016 efthimiou 2019 heng and suetsugi 2014 heng and suetsugi 2015 isik 2013 farnsworth and warrick 2007 fisher et al 2021 gray 2018 syvitski et al 2000 syvitski and millman 2007 warrick et al 2013 warrick 2015 ellison et al 2014 and were used to assess tss load in the current study warrick 2015 provides a comprehensive discussion of the use of srcs for trend analysis of suspended sediment discharge along with the various form srcs may take where sufficient data exist srcs provide a convenient method of quantifying sediment load in a stream in some cases src may be limited by the amount of data data collection methods sufficient high flow events in the data record seasonal changes in sediment source availability the length of intervals between sampled sediment mobilization events and the duration of events and hysteresis effects warrick et al 2015 srcs for watersheds in our case studies with varying degrees of urbanization were developed to examine suspended sediment behavior against instantaneous flow rate as the watersheds being compared consist of different catchment areas geographic precipitation patterns and land use regimes it is necessary to normalize the data units of volumetric flow rate l s 1 km 2 and sediment load kg day 1 km 2 are used to compare the behavior of each watershed in this study suspended sediment loads were found to be a power function of flow rate at the time of sampling as shown in equation 2 2 tssload s c a l a r f l o w exponent 2 4 time trends in fdc and src to assess time trends in fdc and src we selected pre development flow periods to be similar for all the studied watercourses but note that the level of urban development during the pre urbanization periods was not zero in any of the urbanized watersheds studied trends in the fdc and src parameters were assessed and related to pic 2 5 comparison of two adjacent watersheds with differing levels of urbanization in addition to the pre and post development comparisons described in the urbanizing watersheds described above two creeks in the lake simcoe watershed with similar drainage areas and physiography were compared based on a common contemporary flow record for 2010 to 2019 the kettleby and tannery creek sub watersheds are adjacent and located in the southern part of the lake simcoe watershed as shown in fig 1 the kettleby and tannery creek watersheds are in the same hydrometeorological setting but have different land uses 2 6 phosphorous and sediment relationship p concentration data are increasingly available from published sources lake simcoe region conservation authority lsrca 2021a ontario provincial water quality monitoring network pwqmn however total suspended solids tss data are still more commonly available and p concentrations are highly correlated with tss concentrations in watercourses the tss concentration data available from the pwqmn for several watercourses in the study area were used to investigate the relationship between p and tss concentrations in river water to allow estimates of p concentrations and loading to be completed in watercourses where tss but not p concentration data are available the tp to tss concentration relationship was evaluated over the available range of the data allowing inferences to be made about the proportion of tp associated with tss over a range of flow rates 3 results the results of the analyses described above are presented in the following sections on flow duration curve analysis sediment rating curve analysis time trends and phosphorous and sediment relationships 3 1 flow duration curve analysis table 2 provides a summary of hydrological characteristics of the study watercourses for pre and post urbanization or early and later urbanization periods for each watercourse the fdcs are represented by log normal distribution µ and σ parameter for both pre development and post development periods the percent urbanization was estimated for the analyzed watersheds using the ontario flow assessment tool ofat accessed 2021 and google earth pro google accessed 2021 a comparison of fdcs for the periods of 1968 to 1988 and 1998 to 2018 in mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and rouge river is shown on fig 2 3 2 sediment rating curve analysis table 3 provides a summary of water quality characteristics for the same early and later stage urbanization periods as those used for fdc assessment a comparison of the srcs for three dominantly rural and three urbanized watersheds is presented on fig 3 3 3 time trends in fdc and src table 2 and 3 include watercourses for which a long and complete period of record suitable for developing both fdcs and srcs for periods separated by at least two decades with notable changes in the level of urbanization in southern ontario are available the fdc data are represented by log normal distribution location and scale parameters for each watershed and development period similarly the power function srcs are represented by scalar coefficient and exponent parameters for each watershed and development period 3 4 phosphorous and sediment relationship a comparison between suspended sediment and phosphorous concentration data is presented on fig 4 the illustrated relationship allows p loading to be estimated from estimates of tss as described in the discussion section of this article 4 discussion we investigated the effects of urbanization on flow and sediment regimes by comparing the flow duration curve and the sediment rating curve characteristics presented in tables 2 and 3 for the pre and post urbanization periods pic was used as the independent variable to quantify the level of urban development changes to catchment hydrology resulting from removal of vegetation hardening of surfaces and direct connection of impervious areas to drainage networks are generally recognized to result in increases in total annual water balance increases in peak runoff flow rates and decreases in base flows in addition to the hardening of surfaces which discourages infiltration and encourages rapid runoff event effects urbanization also reduces near ground surface storage of water which may cause significant reductions in annual evaporation losses and hence increases in total water balance water budget effects these findings are discussed in more detail in the following sections on the effects of urbanization on fdc and src p and sediment relationships in the water column results from a paired watershed comparison showing differing characteristics of an urbanized versus a rural watershed and the net effects of urbanization on sediment and phosphorous loading from watercourses 4 1 effect of urbanization on flow duration curves a review of the data summarized in table 2 shows that the normalized mean daily discharge tends to increase with increasing pic this finding is consistent with observed increases in fdc shown on fig 2 and is attributed to reduced storage in the watershed increased runoff from impervious surfaces and increased connectivity of impervious areas to the drainage network this observation illustrates a key risk factor for channel stability i e the challenge of passing significantly larger post urbanization flows through a channel with a cross section adapted over centuries or millennia to a much smaller range of pre development flows a comparison of fdcs for the periods of 1968 to 1988 and 1998 to 2018 in mimico creek don river etobicoke creek and rouge river is shown in fig 2 the fdc for mimico creek and don river did not change significantly between the two time periods while the level of urbanization increased by only 10 for both watersheds in contrast the fdcs for etobicoke creek and rouge river show an increase across the whole range of flows between the two periods corresponding with an increase in the level of urbanization from approximately 30 to 60 and 10 to 50 respectively this comparison suggests that the effects of climate change in the absence of substantial change in the level of urbanization were less significant than the effects of increases in urbanization in this study area over the relatively short time period considered our results show that there were relatively small changes in fdcs in the absence of significant land use change over recent decades this result is consistent with the findings of zadeh et al 2020 findings on flood magnitude and frequency in southern ontario while not the focus of this study it follows that any future climate change induced increases in flow distribution will likely cause similar changes to suspended sediment load as those caused by urbanization related increases in flow distribution 4 2 effect of urbanization on sediment rating curves fig 3 presents the srcs of three dominantly rural and three urbanized watersheds the exponent of the src for the rural watersheds is lower than the exponent of the src for the urbanized watersheds additionally the scalar of the src is significantly larger in magnitude in predominately rural watersheds compared to the urbanized watersheds changes in the scalar coefficient of the src are indicative of a reduction in readily available sediment sources associated with agriculture and are attributed to increases in impervious cover in urbanizing watersheds rural areas with areas of exposed soil but with limited overland flow connectivity have in general lower suspended sediment loads than urban areas with a high proportion of impermeable area and good flow path connectivity for overland flow russell et al 2017 this is observed despite suspended sediments loads from impermeable surfaces being limited by dry weather accumulation rates liu et al 2018 wicke et al 2012 increases in the exponent slope of the src are indicative of an increase in riverbank and floodplain sources of sediment and represent an additional diagnostic tool for identifying watercourses that are at risk of developing urban channel syndrome in addition to upland sources the current study findings provide support for an important additional non point source of sediments from within the stream corridor in destabilized stream channels subjected to increased flow distributions as discussed by lammers and bledsoe 2017 2019 the findings are consistent with the findings of vaughan et al 2017 and illustrate a significant management opportunity watershed sources are reduced with urbanization as impervious areas are introduced but increases in the fdc and the exponent of the src continue to mobilize and transport sediment in river corridors asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 note that the src may change shape scalar coefficient and exponent with the passage of time changes in land use and availability of sediment sources at low flow conditions ampomah et al s 2020 data from the cuyuhoga river in ohio usa showed similar trends in the relationship between annual suspended sediment load and annual streamflow for three periods of development an initial period 1951 to 1983 with approximately 25 urbanization and a subsequent period 1988 to 2000 with increasing levels of urbanization and a final period 2001 to 2011 with approximately 50 of the watershed urbanized a review of the src parameters presented in table 3 shows that the exponent of the src tends to increase with increasing pic this finding is consistent with similar studies e g warrick and rubin 2007 asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 and suggests a decrease in the availability of sediment sources in the watershed along with increasing importance of within stream sources particularly at high flow conditions the increase in src with increasing pic is typically coincident with a decrease in the scalar coefficient of the src in stream channels cut through erodible materials without the protection armouring alluvium or riparian vegetation watercourses may become unstable and active erosion of the riverbanks may become a significant source of tss load 4 3 phosphorous and sediment relationship the comparison between suspended sediment and phosphorous concentration data fig 4 shows a strong correlation between the two variables the power function trendlines have an exponent less than one indicating downward concavity which is attributed to increases in tss suspended particle size distribution at increasing concentrations caused by increasing streamflow rates at low flow rates the tss size distribution is expected to be predominantly fine grained silt and finer particle sizes while at higher flow rates the tss size regime is increasingly expected to include larger particles fine sand and larger particle sizes as the flow competency increases p concentration correlation with tss concentration depends strongly on p adsorbing to tss particles although significant storm events will mobilize larger sized sediment particles in the watercourse the relative increase in phosphorous content is not expected to be as large as the tss increases due to the relationship shown on fig 4 knowledge of the shape of this relationship is necessary to estimate p loading from tss loading data 4 4 rural watersheds a summary of fdc and src characteristics as well as calculated estimates of tss and tp load are presented in tables 2 and 3 as a result of the small level of pic in the schomberg river watershed the fdc src mean discharge and q2 did not change substantially during this period and the tss and tp load remained relatively constant between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 similarly the value of ω ω for the schomberg river did not changed substantially between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 as a result of the small level of pid in the beaver river watershed the fdc and src did not change substantially during this period the mean annual flow decreased and q2 increased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 a change we attribute to improvements in the monitoring station installation and changes in weather patterns during this period the estimated tss and tp load increased in concert with the changes in the fdc and q2 the value of ω ω for the beaver river remained approximately constant at 1 4 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 pefferlaw brook drains a rural watershed with primarily agricultural land uses urban development in the watershed is not substantial and the src fig 3 is consistent with other rural watercourses beaver river and schomberg river in the study area 4 5 urban and urbanizing watersheds as a result of urban development in the east holland watershed between the 1996 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 periods the mean daily discharge fdc and exponent of the src increased while the scalar coefficient of the src decreased as a result of these changes the tss and tp loads decreased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for the holland river east branch changed from 5 3 to 6 9 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 indicating an increase in the level of instability as described in mackenzie et al 2022 this assessment is consistent with the authors recent observations of bank erosion in some of the tributaries of the holland river east branch as a result of urban development in the rouge river watershed between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the mean daily discharge fdc and exponent of the src were observed to increase while the scalar coefficient of the src decreased the tss and tp loads decreased between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the src of rouge river pwqmn station id 06009701102 over a period where the area of urban land use increased from approximately 10 1968 1988 to 50 1998 2018 is shown fig 5 the normalized by drainage area tss and tp loads show more complicated responses to increasing pic there is an initial and significant increase in both tss and tp loads with increases in pic below pic values of approximately 5 tss and tp load remain elevated but relatively constant over the range of pic valued from approximately 5 to 25 based on limited site specific high load data for highland creek tp and tss load increase substantially again for values of pic greater than approximately 25 indicating that the watercourse is in a significantly degraded state and is actively eroding its bed and banks a finding that is confirmed by field observations of eroding banks in highland creek and a history of channel stability interventions papangelakis et al 2019 studied three watercourses in similar settings to the watercourses in the current study area greater toronto area and found that urban streams had more frequent bed material mobilization events the changes in the src associated with an increased level of urbanization follow the general trend explained previously the exponent increases from 1 42 to 2 22 and the scalar decreases from 0 88 to 0 07 a similar trend is also observed for the etobicoke creek fig 6 as a result of continuing urbanization in the etobicoke creek watershed between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the mean daily discharge q2 fdc and both the scalar coefficient and exponent of the src increased as a result of these changes the tss and tp loads both increased significantly between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for etobicoke creek changed from 6 0 to 10 5 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 there are extensive existing channel stabilization and armouring works along the main channel of the creek indicating its history of erosion and flooding issues the observed behavior can be attributed to a decrease and change in watershed sediment sources paired with mobilized sediment within the stream leading to a shifted sediment load hence an increased exponent and decreased scalar the sediment load experienced during the post development period only surpasses the pre development period at higher flows occurring approximately at 30 l s 1 km 2 and beyond as flow rates of that magnitude are only reached during major flood events it is imperative to note that in attempts to reduce sediment and associated phosphorous load lids targeted to treat infrequent peak flows during large events will be most beneficial don river and mimico creek both drain urbanized catchments in the greater toronto area however the level of urbanization did not change substantially between the two analysis periods presented in tables 2 and 3 review of figs 2 and 3 show that the fdc did not change substantially for either of these watercourses between the two analysis periods fig 2 however the exponent of the src fig 3 is elevated approximately equal to 2 compared to the exponent of the src for rural watercourses the effect of land use change including urbanization on both the fdc and src are well documented e g leong and yokoo 2021 asselman 2000 ahn and steinschneider 2019 wang et al 2019 the fdc increased in the study area as a result of urbanization and associated increases in the percent of impervious cover pic while the scalar coefficient of the src may decrease substantially as pic increases and immobilizes watershed sediment sources typical of rural and agricultural land uses these results are generally consistent with the findings of other researchers russell et al 2017 2018 vaughan 2017 but the magnitude and direction of changes may be different at times depending on the relative erodibility of agricultural soils and river corridor sediments in the pre development scenario the intensity of construction activities at the time of assessment and the implantation of swm practices the net effect of these sometimes opposite effects of urbanization on src scalar coefficients and the fdc can only be assessed by considering the annual tss load and the volume weighted tss concentration in annual streamflow as a result of continuing urbanization in the highland creek watershed between the periods of 1956 to 1976 and 1998 to 2018 the pic increased from 25 to 45 table 2 fig 7 shows a large shift in the flow regime suggesting that the increase in impervious cover increased discharge rates during rainfall events and caused a reduction in watershed storage and evaporation losses fig 7 also presents the mean annual flow from 1960 to 2020 despite the mean annual precipitation remaining constant over this period the mean annual flow in highland creek is seen to increase the most indicative rise in mean annual flow occurred over the period 1960 1980 where the flow approximately doubled as the level of urbanization rose by approximately 15 this further suggests the altered hydrological flows are dominated by the effects of urbanization over climate change over the relatively short time period considered the pic increased from approximately 25 to 45 between the period of 1956 to 1976 and 1998 to 2018 as a result of urban development as a result of this change the mean daily discharge q2 fdc table 2 and both the scalar coefficient and exponent of the src increased substantially table 3 as a result of these changes the tss load increased by approximately two orders of magnitude and the tp load increased by approximately one order of magnitude between the period of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 the value of ω ω for highland creek changed from approximately 13 8 to 22 6 between the periods of 1966 to 1986 and 1998 to 2018 indicating that the watercourse was not in regime during either of these periods is already experiencing the effects of urban stream syndrome and is at risk of further degradation without additional intervention to stabilize the channel and correct the fdc a result confirmed by field observations of substantial areas of eroding banks 4 6 two adjacent watersheds tannery kettleby creeks kettleby and tannery creek drain adjacent watersheds with similar drainage areas in a similar hydrometeorological setting but with different land uses for these two watersheds continuous flow data were only available for a recent period of time for which we assumed land use was relatively static the comparison of flow data from these two watersheds offers an alternate evaluation of the effects of urbanization on fdc from the before and after comparisons presented in previous sections the fdcs shown in fig 8 displays the predictable shift in hydrological flows between the rural kettleby creek and urbanizing tannery creek watersheds the fdcs are observed to cross with frequent low flow being higher in the rural watercourse compared to the urbanizing watercourse however the most notable differences are for the median to low frequency high flows which are substantially larger in the urban watershed suggesting both a significant increase in the annual water balance and peak runoff events with a current approximate difference of 50 urbanization between the watersheds the causes of the increased flows are evident the larger surface area of impervious cover in the tannery creek watershed decreases the infiltration capacity and exacerbates the runoff effects during rainfall events for a common and recent period of record the test and control comparison between the adjacent tannery and kettleby creeks further suggests that the effects of increased urbanization outweigh the effects of climate change on fdcs over the shorter period of urbanization in the study area 4 7 effects of urbanization on sediment and phosphorus loads mean daily volume weighted average concentrations of tss and tp for the pre and post development periods are summarized in table 3 volume weighted average concentrations reflect the skewed distribution of flow and loads wherein a large fraction of the annual load is transported in a small fraction of days with high flows the volume weighted concentrations were calculated by dividing the normalized by drainage area total annual load by the normalized mean daily flow in the watercourse a review of the results shows that volume weighted tss and tp concentrations increase substantially with increasing pic this finding illustrates the difficulty of assessing the significance of effects on loading when comparing discrete sample results often collected on fair weather days to concentration objectives this difficulty is exacerbated by the relatively short duration of high flow events and low probability of collecting a representative range of discrete samples in any given year 5 conclusions unmitigated urbanization can cause substantial increases in the flow regime as evidenced by a comparison of fdcs and srcs for the case study watersheds before and following significant increases in the percent impervious cover in these watersheds comparison of fdcs for etobicoke creek and rouge river for early and late stage urbanization periods shows a notable increase across the whole range of flows between the two periods the changes to the src generally include an increase in the exponent slope in log log domain of the src and a decrease in the scalar coefficient the decrease in the scalar coefficient of the src is attributed to the immobilization of watershed sources of sediments when hardened urban surfaces replace rural land uses and the exposed soil is covered the increase in the exponent with increases in the level of urbanization and pic is attributed in part to the increased frequency of flood events causing erosion of the streambed and banks a result that is generally consistent with papangelakis et al s 2019 findings the combined effect of increases in the peak flows and in the exponent of the src is to significantly increase the contribution of the flood flows to the annual sediment and phosphorous loads in urbanizing watersheds in addition sources of soil erosion and sediment load which become limited by impervious cover in the catchment tend to shift from the upland areas to streambed and bank erosion sources the combined effects of increases in fdc decreases in the scalar coefficient of the src and increases in the exponent of the src illustrate the complex effects of urbanization on tss and tp load in urban streams furthermore time weighted average tss and tp concentrations do not provide a complete picture of the potential effects of urbanization on tss and tp load more robust assessments of tss and sediment load should consider continuous or more frequent water quality monitoring assessment of concentrations over the full range of flows and consideration of volume weighted average concentrations the methods used in this study provide a quantitative way to estimate the effects of urbanization on stream flow distribution fdc src and sediment and phosphorous loading based on the percent of impervious cover in urbanizing areas the quantitative changes in the fdc and srcs are specific to the current study area and watersheds however the investigative methods used can be applied to other study areas urban stormwater management systems can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization on streamflow and sediment regimes systems that prioritize storage infiltration and evapotranspiration should be included to in an attempt to prevent significant deviation of the water budget from pre development conditions additionally in efforts to reduce the component of the annual sediment load mobilized by larger flood flows streambed and bank stabilization as well as stormwater management systems that provide significant control of peak flows during large storm events will prove to be most beneficial further research is required to identify cost effective systems to restore the health of the ecosystem of urbanizing streams while not the focus of this study any climate change induced increases in fdc has the potential to cause similar changes in suspended sediment load to those caused by urbanization related increases in fdc for existing urbanized areas where lid retrofit opportunities are limited stream rehabilitation measures to bring the channel morphology into a new balance i e regime conditions should be supported however stream restoration efforts and catchment lid retrofit projects should be done with a holistic treatment train design approach targeting a cost optimized solution for sustainable development with the protection of the ecosystem health of urban streams in

3034,lumped parameter modeling approach has been widely applied in karst hydrology for among other applications groundwater availability assessment in a context of global change nonetheless such approach generally does not account for land cover land use lclu and its impacts on recharge processes then considering a semi distributed recharge constitutes a relevant approach to capture the impacts of lclu on flow dynamics but also introduce more complexity in the modeling approach the present study consists of a multiple hydrological model calibration to assess the implication of considering a semi distributed recharge in a lumped parameter model and focuses on the uncertainty originating by the model structure the modeling results are discussed to evaluate the trade off between hydrological model complexity and hydrological model performance the study focuses on forest dominated karst areas with three karst catchments kerschbaum lower austria baget french pyrenees and oeillal southern france considering a semi distributed recharge gives better performance for both kerschbaum and oeillal catchments hydrological models while no improvement is obtained for baget catchment systematic consideration of lclu is thus not necessarily worthwhile in karst environmen ts as it can bring contradictory results in terms of hydrological model performance keywords karst hydrology lumped parameter modeling land cover land use recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one quarter of the world s population depends on freshwater from karst aquifers ford and williams 2013 ensuring a sustainable karst freshwater supply constitutes a major challenge in a context of increasing imbalance between freshwater supply capacity and the needs of a growing population stefano et al 2012 wada et al 2016 moreover both climate change and anthropogenic pressures including an increase in water abstraction or changes in land cover and land use lclu may have a strong impact on the future availability of karst water resources gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 a decreasing karst groundwater availability has already been observed in various regions around the world such as in the mediterranean area charlier et al 2015 fiorillo and guadagno 2012 garcía ruiz et al 2011 smiatek et al 2013 north america loáiciga et al 2000 and asia guo et al 2005 hao et al 2009 ma et al 2004 wu et al 2017 moreover many studies have investigated the potential evolution of karst groundwater resources under various climate change assumptions brenner et al 2018 chen et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 nerantzaki et al 2020 or various future anthropogenic scenarios andreas hartmann et al 2012 sivelle et al 2021 nonetheless only a few studies consider the impact of lclu changes such as urban area expansion or vegetation adaption to climate change in the assessment of global change impacts on karst groundwater sarrazin et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 highlighted on a global scale that vegetation in the karst regions can be more sensitive to changes in precipitation regimes than to temperature ellison et al 2012 stated that forest water interactions play a crucial role in supplying the atmospheric moisture that becomes precipitation in the hydrologic cycle and so forest may have a noticeable influence on the rainfall regime on a large scale also forest coverage around the world is in evolution with an estimated loss of around 2 3 million kilometers square and a gain of around 0 8 million kilometers square from 2000 to 2012 hansen et al 2013 under changing climatic conditions the vegetation can show an adaption and consequently modify the land atmosphere exchanges bussotti et al 2014 klausmeyer et al 2009 llorens and domingo 2007 which could at the end cause a modification in the recharge processes tramblay et al 2020 finally lclu changes may constitute a first order factor in the evolution of groundwater resources since they may strongly impact the recharge processes the assessment and prediction of the effects of lclu changes on groundwater resources require information on the heterogeneities of the recharge processes and thus the implementation of hydrological models that include a distributed or semi distributed recharge one common approach for hydrodynamic modeling in karst systems consists of considering different combinations of the dominant flow components as distinct conceptual buckets bittner et al 2018 butscher and huggenberger 2008 fleury et al 2007 guinot et al 2015 mazzilli et al 2019 tritz et al 2011 such a model can be useful for the long term assessment of the flow dynamics and groundwater resources evolution sivelle et al 2019 highlighted a decrease of more than 10 in the water level during spring periods since the 1960 s on aliou and baget karst systems in the french pyrenees hartmann et al 2012 show that the discharge could decrease by 30 by the end of the 21st century at the faria spring in palestine nerantzaki and nikolaidis 2020 highlighted an increased dryness in terms of frequency duration and intensity for three mediterranean karst springs located in greece sivelle et al 2021 proposed a methodology to assess the relative impact of climate changes and anthropogenic forcing on spring discharge and highlighted climate change as the main factor causing a decrease in the predicted oeillaĺs spring discharge in southern france in these former studies the proposed conceptual lumped parameters models consider homogeneous recharge processes at the catchment scale depending on land use heterogeneities in soil properties heterogeneities in climate inputs e g convective events altitudinal gradient and catchment size it can be of interest to consider a semi distributed recharge as shown in former studies bittner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2012 ollivier et al 2020 the first purpose of this study is to investigate how considering a semi distributed recharge depending on lclu affects the flow dynamics of a lumped parameter model and more especially the infiltration toward the saturated zone the second purpose is to identify the appropriate levels of model complexity that allows obtaining the best performance in terms of spring discharge simulations for that purpose the study will focus on forest dominated karst areas to avoid bias due to significant differences in terms of the dominant type of lclu in the recharge area therefore three karst catchments characterized by recharge areas lower than 50 km2 were chosen to run a multi model calibration considering different levels of complexity in the upper level of the model i e the compartment can be subject to evapotranspiration and so reproduce the land atmosphere exchanges also the evapotranspiration is supposed independent of the lclu to avoid uncertainties related to the estimation method as well as the introduction of cultural coefficient in this way the study is more related to the impact of model structure rather than input uncertainty 2 study sites and data fig 1 shows the location and the land use for the three selected catchments kerschbaum bittner et al 2018 oeillal spring sivelle et al 2021 sivelle and jourde 2020 and baget sivelle et al 2019 to avoid misinterpretations due to significant differences in terms of dominant land use the study focuses on forest dominated karst areas table 1 summarizes the main characteristic of the three catchments in terms of climate geology lithology and lclu the kerschbaum spring is located 10 km south of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs lower austria its recharge area covers approximately 2 5 km2 and is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 8 c and annual precipitation of 1405 mm 2001 2014 the small scale recharge area is predominantly covered by beech forests and parts of it by dolomite quarries table 1 with a mean annual discharge of 34 l s 1 the kerschbaum spring is part of the regional water supply and shows a response time to rainfall events of 1 day bittner et al 2021 the recharge area belongs to the eastern foothills of the northern calcareous alps and consists of a sequence of dolomitic basement rocks which result in a deep karstified groundwater system despite the well connected network of conduits the recharge area does not present significant sinkholes and the recharge processes can be assumed to be mainly diffusive bittner et al 2018 the oeillal spring is located north of the city of narbonne southern france and drains water from the limestone terrain of the fonfroide monredon massif the main aquifer in the area runs within the calcareous formation and fed the oeillal spring which is located in the western part of the narbonne sigean sedimentary basin and rises at four spring pools in the northern part of the area there is also an alluvial aquifer which is contained in the quaternary formation of the aude river s terrace the recharge area covers around 43 2 km2 with a potential additional 10 km2 contributing zone sivelle and jourde 2020 and is characterized by a mediterranean climate with a mean annual temperature of 14 7 c and annual precipitations of 570 mm 1980 2020 the mean annual discharge is estimated to be around 0 14 m3 s the baget catchment is located 10 km southwest of the city of saint girons french pyrenees its recharge area covers approximately 13 2 km2 and is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 11 8 c and annual precipitation of 1000 mm 1970 2020 the mean annual discharge is estimated to be around 0 45 m3 s the karstified part of the basin is characterized by metamorphic jurassic to cretaceous dolomites limestones and calcareous marls these formations deep 70 to 90 southwards under the slaty albian cenomanian ballongue flysch that constitutes the southern boundary of the catchment the contact between karstified formation and non karstifiable rocks give the west east direction of the main drainage system the northern limit of the baget drainage basin consists of a secondary fault from the north pyrenean fault the alas fault both kerschbaum and oeillal catchment are impacted by the presence of quarries and oeillal catchment is also impacted by the presence of urban areas the baget catchment differs from other catchments due to the presence of non karstic impluvium that represent 20 of the total recharge area this part of the watershed consists of the slaty albian cenomanian ballongue flysch considered an impervious formation the orientation of the main drainage system in the area is given by the contact between the ballongue flysch and the karstified part of the basin in the west east direction debroas 2009 sivelle et al 2020 this part of the watershed contributes to the spring discharge through surface runoff rather than infiltration in the main aquifer the three selected catchments are characterized by a small recharge area 50 km2 and with a lclu dominated by forest that represents 96 of the total recharge area for kerschbaum 62 7 of the total recharge area for oeillal and 72 of the total recharge area for baget fig 1 the catchments are chosen based on their dominant lclu and their comparable size of recharge areas to avoid bias related to lclu and scale effects regarding kerschbaum and baget the two systems show similar catchment size and land cover characteristics but different geological and climate properties the kerschbaum springshed is a dolostone karst system with a mean annual temperature of 8 c on the contrary the geology of baget is dominated by limestones and the climate is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 12 2 c moreover the kerschbaum and baget springs have a mean discharge of 34 and 450 l s 1 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological models 3 1 1 semi distributed recharge in lumped parameter modeling a semi distributed recharge can be implemented in lumped parameter model at the catchment scale employing two distinct approaches which consist of either increasing the model complexity and so adding more parameters or considering distributed meteorological data precipitation land surface temperature evapotranspiration as input in the model such approaches have proved their efficiency in improving karst aquifers hydrological modeling ollivier et al 2020 propose the karamel model with several lumped model units running in parallel the structure of the model is based on a three compartments model the upper compartment collects precipitation hosts evapotranspiration and governs infiltration toward a slow discharge compartment m and a rapid discharge compartment c the outlet discharge consists of the sum of discharge from the slow and rapid compartments such model structure is widely used in karst hydrology baudement et al 2017 moussu 2012 pinault et al 2001 schmidt et al 2014 the modeling is performed over the fontaine de vaucluse aquifer southern france showing a large watershed area about 1600 km2 the model structure allows accounting for both slow matrix flows and fast conduit flows fleury et al 2007 mazzilli et al 2019 considering there is no exchange between these two flow components although exchanges flow can be observed in the non saturated zone dal soglio et al 2020 the input data consists of gridded data set with a spatial resolution of several kilometers that cannot be considered as valuable input for hydrological modeling on karst aquifers with recharge areas lower than 50 km2 such an approach allows to better assess the recharge distribution with heterogeneities due to environmental factors such as geology lclu or even meteorological forcing precipitation evapotranspiration in large karst catchments such as fontaine de vaucluse the recharge distribution explains a large part of the discharge variation at the outlet ollivier et al 2020 another approach relies on the introduction of hydrotopes which were considered in the lukars model bittner et al 2018 each hydrotope is characterized by land use and soil type and conceptually represents the vadose zone the model structure consists of a compartment contributing to the recharge of the saturated zone including also a loss function flowing to secondary springs and a hysteresis function tritz et al 2011 flowing directly to the spring in the lukars model each hydrotope is exposed to effective precipitation depending on interception evapotranspiration and when applicable snow processes the hydrotopes consist of several lumped parameter models running in parallel in a similar way as the karamel model ollivier et al 2020 each hydrotope contributes to recharge loss and fast flow depending on their relative area their distance from the spring as well as the land use and soil properties the use of such hydrotopes relies on the assumption of a hydrophysical uniqueness of each hydrotope bittner et al 2018 3 1 2 model structures two lumped parameters models are implemented in this study to account for a different conceptualization of the flow processes the first model corresponds to the original lukars model bittner et al 2018 and the second model corresponds to a coupled model with the concept of hydrotopes implemented in the lukars model in the upper level of a model structure with two interconnected compartments in the lower level of the model structure as proposed in the karstmod modeling platform mazzilli et al 2019 a detailed description of lukars and karstmod and their underlying equations are provided in appendix a and appendix b respectively fig 2 summarizes the different model structures for each catchment concerning both the upper and lower level of the model structures and a description of the associated parameters is given in table 2 in this study the different configurations in the upper level are tested considering 1 up to 4 hydrotopes bringing also more uncertain parameters for the model calibration conversely the lower level is chosen for each catchment based on former studies for oeillal sivelle et al 2021 kerschbaum bittner et al 2018 and baget sivelle et al 2019 the present study focuses on the characterization of the infiltration processes through two fluxes denoted qis and qhy that flow from the upper level toward a compartment in the lower level or directly to the spring fig 2 in this study the original linear baseflow storage from bittner et al 2018 is referred to as a compartment with linear discharge law for notation consistency with the use of coupled lukars and karstmod model structures also this compartment is denoted m fig 2 and represent the baseflow as suggested in the original karstmod model baudement et al 2017 mazzilli et al 2019 sivelle et al 2019 in this study the lower level in the model structure for kerschbaum corresponds to a compartment with linear discharge law implemented in the original lukars model bittner et al 2018 whereas a model structure considering matrix conduit exchanges in the lower level is applied within the baget catchment sivelle et al 2019 concerning the oeillal spring a threshold effect in lower level of the model structure i e compartment with linear discharge law allows reproducing the change in flow dynamics during the period of low water table elevation sivelle et al 2021 the upper level of the model structure consists of four lumped model units running in parallel denoted hydrotopes characterized by different land uses and soil types it conceptually represents the vadose zone compartment higher level with the continuum soil epikarst infiltration zone a hydrotope is analogous to a bucket that has three discharge components with different flow directions 1 the quickflow component qhy l3 t 1 is characterized with a hysteresis function tritz et al 2011 and is directly transferred to the spring outlet 2 the secondary spring discharge qsec l3 t 1 is transferred out of the system and do not contribute to the spring discharge or the lower compartment recharge and 3 the recharge qis l3 t 1 is transferred to the lower compartment the lower level of the model structure in the lukars model consists of one compartment with linear discharge law the recharge of the compartment consists of the sum of the intra storage flow qis from each hydrotope the outlet discharge of the lower compartment is transferred to the spring the total spring discharge consists of the sum of the fluxes flowing from the compartment with linear discharge law qms l3 t 1 and the fluxes from the hydrotopes qhy l3 t 1 with a hysteretic behavior concerning the coupled lukars karstmod model the lower level of the model structure consists of two interconnected compartments denoted m representative of slow linear flow dynamics that mainly occurs in the matrix and c representative of quick non linear flow dynamics that may occur in conduits and or unclogged fractures then compartment m corresponds to the capacitive function of the aquifer whereas compartment c is more related to the transmissive function of the aquifer both m and c can be filled with water flow from the upper compartment which are the intra storage flow qis and the quick flow component qhy the flow partition is made through a portioning coefficient for both qis flowing to m or to c and qhy flowing to c or to the spring one should note that the original karstmod modeling platform also implemented such flow partition from the compartment in the upper level to the different compartment of the lower level the difference for the coupled lukars karstmod model relies on the use of several buckets running in parallel rather than a single bucket with different discharge coefficients toward the bucket in the lower level of the model such conceptualization brings more complexity to the model structure and increases the number of uncertain parameters for the model calibration finally the two proposed models fig 2 consist of modular bucket style model of lumped parameters that enable to build of interconnected compartments depending on different levels of complexity in both upper and lower levels of the models in this study it should be noticed that hydrotopes can be activated deactivated depending on the levels of complexity considered in the upper level of the model to run the fluxes contributing either to the recharge of the lower level or directly to the spring discharge so the number of hydrotopes varies depending on how the heterogeneity in the upper level is considered table 2 summarizes the model structures in terms of flow conceptualization in the upper and lower level of the model for the three catchments 3 1 3 model calibration the hydrological models were implemented in the python environment summerfield 2010 while the parameter estimation was performed using a particle swarm optimization pso procedure eberhart and kennedy 1995 implemented in the pyswarm package lee 2014 this approach leads to the definition of a unique optimal parameter set for each model configuration and therefore this study does not address parametric uncertainty and model equifinality since the study focuses on the uncertainty originating by the model structure the data set for the calibration and validation of the hydrological model depends on the available data and the calibration procedure is performed on the same time intervals considered in the former studies to avoid bias due to the calibration period on the parameter estimation mazzilli et al 2012 the calibration is made on a period of 1 year for the kerschbaum spring 18 months for the oeillal spring and 10 years for the baget the calibration and validation periods are presented in table 3 the calibration is made on a period where the required data are available on a daily time step regarding the oeillal spring validation data consists of sparse temporal discharge time series measured before installation of probes for continuous hourly measurement sivelle and jourde 2020 also adding be in a weighted function with kge was required to give more importance of the water balance in the calibration procedure and to better reproduce the significant flow decrease during the summer period 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 model evaluation using performance criteria the metrics used for hydrologic model calibration and evaluation are mainly based on the comparison between observed and simulated streamflow according to hauduc et al 2015 model errors can be calculated in different ways and expressed as performance criteria allowing to evaluate model performance numerically several studies have proposed number of performance criteria bennett et al 2013 ferreira et al 2020 hauduc et al 2015 jackson et al 2019 to assess different aspects of the model performance it is recommended to adopt a multi objective model evaluation with a combination of different performance criteria huo and liu 2020 monteil et al 2020 in this paper the hydrological models are evaluated with some performance criteria widely used in karst hydrology the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the non parametric kling gupta efficiency kgenp pool et al 2018 to evaluate the model performance in terms of volume of transit the modified balance error be perrin et al 2001 and the volumetric error ve criss and winston 2008 are also considered the correlation coefficient of pearson rp as well as spearman rs are also considered then hydrological model evaluation is performed using an ensemble of 7 performance criteria allowing to account with different aspect of the model performance for more information the reader may refer to some literature review bennett et al 2013 ferreira et al 2020 jackson et al 2019 given that the model structures are characterized by a different number of parameters the akaike informative coefficient aic is computed such as aic 2 k nln rss where k is the number of model parameters n the number of observations and rss is the sum of the squared residuals the aic penalizes the model structures with large number of parameters and gives information on how the performance may evolve with the number of uncertain parameters the various performance criteria are plotted according to a radar chart which consists of a polygon where the position of each point from the center gives the value of the performance criteria one should note that all the performance criteria used in this study are given with a perfect model fitting when the value is equal to 1 then plotting several models in the same radar plot allows a quick comparison of the model performance according to the various criteria 3 2 2 model evaluation using time series analysis in karst hydrology the auto correlation function acf is frequently used to characterize the temporal structure of hydrological signals under the linear stationary hypothesis labat et al 2000a larocque et al 1998 mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 mangin 1984 proposed to determine the memory effect of karst aquifers as the lag time value where the acf of the spring discharge time series reaches the value of 0 2 this approach is commonly used to characterize hydrodynamics in karst aquifers lorette et al 2018 sivelle and jourde 2020 in addition the cross correlation function ccf between rainfall and spring discharge provides an approximation of the impulse response mangin 1984 when assuming the rainfall consists of a random process white noise also it describes the capacity of a system to transform the rainfall into discharge the higher the ccf peak the more the system acts as a piston moreover the lag time for the occurrence of the maximum value in ccf corresponds to the time of response due to high heterogeneities in karst aquifers the response time can be dependent on the seasonal variability in rainfall intensity delbart et al 2014 both memory effects and response time can be dependent on the sampling frequency of the rainfall discharge time series sivelle and jourde 2020 because of the occurrence of several processes with characteristic time covering several orders of magnitudes blöschl and sivapalan 1995 lumped parameter modeling can show bias such as underestimation of the memory effect and overestimation of ccf peak sivelle 2019 and may testify the importance of considering low frequencies component in the simulated impulse response since the high frequencies processes appear to be predominant such time series analysis can provide information about the hydrological model performance in addition to the performance evaluation through numerical performance criteria such as nse kge or kgenp in addition the wavelet multiresolution analysis mra is applied to project the spring discharge time series on an orthogonal basis of wavelet and scale functions labat et al 2000b mallat 1989 the basis is generated from a filter band following a dyadic scale the projection allows building for each level of this scale the component of the signal that explains the variability at this scale the decomposition is orthogonal and therefore the sum of all components details and residue or smooth give back the initial signal for a deeper hydrological model evaluation sivelle 2019 runs mra on both observed and simulated spring discharge time series and calculate the goodness of fit with the nse criteria for each scale application on highly karstified watersheds such as aliou and baget karst systems shows the weakness of a daily rainfall discharge model for the high frequency scale 8 days and for the 8 months scale scale 256 days such an approach can be useful to evaluate hydrological model performances in addition to acf and ccf since it gives a deeper description of the model bias indeed since the usual performance criteria consider the mean errors it does not capture how the model errors can be structured in time and frequency and so how the model can be biased in forecasting purposes 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological models calibration and validation the calibrated model parameters set for lukars model on baget oeillal and kerschbaum catchments are reported in table 4 whereas the performance criteria for both the calibration and the validation periods are shown in fig 3 the performance criteria are color scaled from red for bad values to blue for good values where the closer the value to 1 the better the fit between observed and simulated spring discharge the simulated spring hydrographs are reported in fig 4 and the radar chart for model performance evaluation are given in fig 5 the lukars model shows quite satisfactorily performance criteria for both kerschbaum and oeillal and provides lower performance criteria on the baget catchment in comparison the coupled lukars karstmod model provides higher performance criteria values although it appears to be quite close to the performance criteria with the karstmod model sivelle et al 2019 where nse 0 59 be 0 94 and kge 0 61 within the same calibration period the first lukars application on the kerschbaum catchment counts 4 hydrotopes and shows satisfactorily performance criteria bittner et al 2018 here the lukars model application with a lower number of hydrotopes shows lower performance criteria values but is still quite satisfactorily indeed the lk 01 and lk 04 model structures show tiny close be and ve values conversely other performance criteria show significant differences when the model structure considers at least two hydrotopes in the upper level both lk 03 and lk 04 outperforms with the nse kgenp r s and r p and share close performance thus a comparison of the different combinations of hydrotopes may allow assessing the trade off between model complexity i e number of calibration parameters and the model performance analysis of the simulated spring hydrograph fig 4 shows that whatever the number of active hydrotopes the lukars model allows capturing the complete spring hydrograph in a quite satisfactorily way moreover increasing the number of hydrotopes allows to better capture the recession part indeed the lk 01 model structure shows an important misfit during recession periods with a quite permanent offset while the recession dynamics appears to well reproduced and underestimates the flood peaks lk 02 model structure produces a better fit for the recession periods but overestimates the flood peaks fig 4 finally lk 03 and lk 04 model structures seem to provide a satisfactorily fit during both flood and recession periods of the spring hydrograph all lk model structures show very good be and ve errors and both lk 03 and lk 04 model structure outperforms other lk model structures considering most of the performance criteria fig 5 the aic shows a lower value when considering the lk 03 model structure within the calibration period compared with the other lk model structures then the model performance increase does not compensate for the introduction of additional parameters for kerschbaum when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 nonetheless a higher number of hydrotopes gives higher performance for both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 considering the nse criteria one should note a significant decrease in the performance criteria between calibration and validation periods whereas the other criteria show quite satisfactorily agreement it may testify significant errors on flood peaks estimation within the validation period while the model correctly reproduces water balance ve and be and correlation r p and r s concerning the oeillal spring s catchment the total landcover consists of four types of land use i quarries covering 2 of the total area ii urban areas covering 4 5 of the total area iii vineyards and agricultural plots covering 30 8 of the total area and iv forests and natural plots covering 62 7 of the total area fig 1 the first lukars application within the oeillal spring s catchment consists of two hydrotopes that represent an impervious zone quarries and urban area and an infiltration zone sivelle et al 2021 here the lk 03 model structure is introduced to consider different lclu in the infiltration zone with a distinction between wine yard and agricultural plots covering 30 8 of the total recharge area and forest covering 62 7 of the total recharge area in a general way the different lk model structures shows close performance considering kge be ve and r p whereas lk 02 model structure outperforms considering the kgenp thus the different lk model structures gives satisfactorily results for the different performance criteria although some minor changes can be observed within the different lk model structures elsewhere the model structures include a threshold effect in the lower compartment with linear discharge law where all lk 01 lk 02 and lk 03 model structures show quite similar values for both the height of the threshold mmin around 2 to 5 mm and the discharge parameter for the upper fluxes out of the compartment kms top around 0 008 mm day 1 conversely hydrotope 2 and hydrotope 3 within the lk 03 model structure shows contrasted discharge coefficient values for the fast flow going directly to the spring with hyd2 khy around 224 m mm 1 day 1 and hyd3 khy around 740 m mm 1 day 1 the discharge coefficient for the slow flow going to the lower level of the model structure also shows contrasted values with hyd2 kis around 0 29 m mm 1 day 1 and hyd3 is around 0 04 m mm 1 day 1 it testifies that the lk model whatever the number of active hydrotopes allows to capture the slow recession dynamics of the karst system associated with the oeillal s spring then considering a different number of hydrotopes only affects the flow dynamics from the upper to the lower level and allow to correctly reproduce the spring hydrographs fig 4 the aic criteria show the lower value for the lk 01 within the calibration period fig 3 it may call into question the interest of considering a pseudo distributed recharge for calibration purpose only the decrease of the performance criteria within the validation period might be the consequence of the sparse temporal resolution of discharge time series during the validation period i e monthly gauging indeed such discrepancy in performance criteria between periods with continuous monitoring and period with sparse temporal measurement was already experienced in the former study sivelle and jourde 2020 nonetheless the lk 03 model structure shows higher performance criteria within the validation period considering the baget catchment sivelle et al 2019 proposed a conceptualization of the hydrodynamic behavior based on the karstmod model mazzilli et al 2019 without any consideration for lclu and so considers a homogeneous recharge at the catchment scale to assess the impact of considering a semi distributed recharge in the model structure the original compartment e is replaced by the lukars model conceptualization with 4 hydrotopes within the upper level of the model structure the model then corresponds to the coupled lukars and karstmod model fig 2 denoted lk km as a comparison the classical lukars model denoted lk is also calibrated considering 1 up to 4 hydrotopes the lk 01 and lk 02 model structures show poor performance criteria regarding the nse and kge both lower than 0 5 which is also significantly lower than the performance observed with the original karstmod model where nse 0 59 and kge 0 61 sivelle et al 2019 the lk 03 and lk 04 model structures show performance criteria closer to the original karstmod model although the value for both nse and kge is still lower analyses of the simulated spring hydrograph together with the observed one fig 4 show that increasing the number of hydrotopes leads to dramatically underestimating the discharge peaks whereas all the lk model structures with 1 up to 4 hydrotopes provides quite comparable flow dynamics during recession periods in a general way one should note a spring discharge overestimation during significant recession periods such as july to september 1971 with both lk and lk km models also the lk km model simulates higher discharges during floods which is following the model structure that includes a compartment with nonlinear discharge law in the lower level of the model structure contrary to the lk model structures that consider one compartment with linear discharge law considering the lk 03 model structure hyd3 kis is around 1 mm day 1 whereas concerning lk 04 model structure both hyd3 kis and hyd4 kis are also around 1 mm day 1 then the introduction of a fourth hydrotopes when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 model structure does not allow to differentiate the dynamics for the intra storage fluxes from the upper level to the lower level moreover hyd2 kis is still in the same range of values when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 model structures with a value around 7 6 mm day 1 and 7 2 mm day 1 respectively it might show that the recharge dynamic from hydrotope 2 corresponding to poor vegetation cover is well contrasted with the hydrotopes 3 and 4 corresponding to agricultural plots and forests respectively conversely hydrotopes 3 and 4 cannot be separated in terms of recharge dynamics and brings back into question the assumption of hydrophysical uniqueness as well as the need of considering an additional hydrotope in the model structure finally both lk and lk km models within the baget catchment provide contradictory results with the above application within the kerschbaum and the oeillal spring catchments indeed a higher number of hydrotopes do not necessarily provide a better model performance criterion fig 3 and fig 5 also the aic criteria confirms such analysis since the lower value concerns the model structure with 1 hydrotope for lk model and with 2 hydrotopes for lk km model and so the gain in model performance does not compensate for the penalization due to the introduction of additional parameters also such observations within the calibration periods are consistent with the performance criteria calculated within the validation periods for which the lowest aic values are obtained for lk with 1 hydrotope and lk km with 2 hydrotopes as observed within the calibration period 4 2 model evaluation using time series analysis 4 2 1 autocorrelation and crosscorrelation function analysis the acf is calculated on both observed and simulated spring discharges within the different model structures for the three karst catchments fig 6 the acf calculated on observed and simulated spring discharges for the oeillal spring with the lk model structures look very closely the memory effect appears to be well estimated at around 80 to 90 days conversely the acf calculated on simulated discharge for kerschbaum seems to systematically underestimate the memory effect of 40 days the second peak for a lag value around 65 days appears to be reproduced by the lk models although the peak appears less frankly with the lk 01 model structure concerning the baget catchment the lk models generally estimate very poorly the memory effect of 17 days indeed lk 01 and lk 02 model structures provide a lower value around 9 days whereas lk 03 and lk 04 model structures overestimate the memory effect all the more with the lk 04 model structure that gives a memory effect of around 45 days the lk km models provide an underestimation of the memory effect although the higher the number of hydrotopes the closer the acf on simulated discharge to acf on observed discharge one should note that such misfit considering the acf was already investigated within the baget catchment considering daily rainfall discharge lumped parameter modeling sivelle 2019 due to a short response time that may require a higher sampling frequency labat et al 2000a in the same way ccf is calculated between rainfall and both observed and simulated spring discharge within the different model structures for the three karst catchments fig 7 concerning the oeillal spring ccf based on observed and simulated discharge appears very close when considering lk 03 model structure then the impulse response of the karst system with a slow recession dynamic appears well reproduced with both the lk 02 and lk 03 model structures whereas the lk 01 model structure fails to reproduce the quick time of response concerning kerschbaum the lk 02 model structure seems to overestimate the ccf peak amplitude and to under estimate the persistence of correlation for lag values larger than 10 days also the second peak around 65 days is well reproduced although the lk 01 model structure gives a lower ccf peak amplitude such a second peak in the rainfall discharge ccf can be the consequence of the existence of the slow flow dynamics which may have a delayed contribution with an important response time such observation can be consistent with the lithology of the kerschbaum catchment dominated by dolostones and a low value of the discharge coefficient for the compartment with linear law with an order of magnitude of 10 4 m day 1 this value is in contrast with values around 10 2 m day 1 for both baget and oeillal dominated by limestones then the lk models allow capturing both short term and mid term responses although the short term response with lk 04 model structure appears delayed within the baget catchment both lk and lk km models seem to overestimate the ccf peak value although the lk 04 and lk 04 km model structure show lower peak value of the ccf and so closer to the ccf based on observed data such overestimation of the ccf peak was already observed with the karstmod model sivelle 2019 4 2 2 orthogonal wavelet decomposition application of orthogonal wavelet decomposition on both observed and simulated spring discharges allows to calculate the performance criteria according to a dyadic scale fig 8 and to evaluate the model performance across different temporal scales here the performance criteria consist of the bunded version of the nse criteria mathevet et al 2006 denoted nse c2m it allows to reduce the amplitude of variation between 1 and 1 one should note that the bounded version of nse criteria keeps the same meaning with a comparison of the model errors with a naïve predictor i e the mean of the observed spring discharge time series where positive values mean the model is a better predictor and a nse c2m value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit between the model prediction and the observation fig 9 shows the performance criteria i e the bounded version of nse as a function of the scale concerning the kerschbaum catchment both le lk 03 and lk 04 seems to outperforms for the various scales excepted for the 16 days scale where all the lk model structures gives lower nse c2m values considering the periods larger than 32 days the lk 02 lk 03 and lk 04 models shows close performance larger than the lk 01 model structure concerning the oeillal spring lk 02 and lk 03 model structures outperform the lk 01 model structure for the scales from 2 days to 128 days whereas as considering the larger periods all lk model structures show quite close performance also all the lk model structures show poor performance criteria for the high frequency periods lower than 8 days whereas the low frequencies period larger than 64 days give much higher nse c2m values due to the slow recession dynamics of the oeillal spring system and the important contribution of the lower compartments in the spring discharge it is difficult to well capture the fast flow dynamics this is also observed with the rainfall discharge ccf that shows a low peak value and testify of an important smoothing effect operated by the karst system such results may testify to the importance of considering several flow dynamics from the non saturated zone to the capacitive function of the aquifer then since most of the effective rainfall flows toward the lower level of the model structure fig 2 a suitable characterization of the recharge toward the capacitive function of the aquifer may constitute an important step for the assessment of groundwater resource variability concerning the baget system all the lk model structures present close performance criteria for the temporal scale above 128 days whereas the performance for the smaller scale can show a significant difference this may indicate that for a reactive karst system such as baget the high frequency processes can be better reproduced by considering homogeneous recharge at the catchment scale indeed increasing the number of hydrotopes seems to degrade the performance criteria for periods lower than 100 days this is observed when the lower level is supposed to be a compartment with linear discharge law and so the saturated zone consists of a unique flow dynamic over the baget area former studies have shown the existence of a well developed drainage system mangin 1975 marsaud 1996 with efficient quick flow evidenced by artificial tracer tests labat and mangin 2015 sivelle and labat 2019 and highlighted the interest of considering two flow dynamics with exchange flow sivelle et al 2019 then considering a lower level of the model structure with a more complex structure highlight that whatever the number of hydrotopes the model performance is comparable scale by scale in the end increasing the number of hydrotopes does not bring better performance either in the high frequency or the low frequencies 4 3 effect of hydrotopes on hydrodynamics to quantify the impact of considering a different number of hydrotopes on the flow dynamics the monthly mean intra storage flow qis discharge from the hydrotopes in the upper level to the lower level of the model structure considered as a proxy of the recharge is calculated within the month of the year fig 10 it gives an overview of how the recharge may occur along with the hydrologic cycle due to the bad performance of the modeling approach within the baget karst system the analysis is made only within the kerschbaum spring and the oeillal s spring where considering several hydrotopes helped improving the hydrological model performance to perform a preliminary assessment of the influence of parametric uncertainties the estimation of the mean qis is made on the 0 99 percentile ensemble of simulated hydrographs using the latin hypercube sampling lhs procedure implemented in the safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 then the simulation with the highest objective function is reported in solid line while the confidence interval is given through a colored envelope fig 10 the simulated spring hydrograph is given within the calibration period while the recharge is estimated on periods of 10 years considering the hydrological model can be used out of calibration periods due to acceptable performance within the validation period fig 3 the estimation is made on the 2010 2020 periods for oeillal and 2006 2016 periods for kerschbaum kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchments show very different pattern in the proxy of recharge along the hydrological cycle indeed qis appears quite constant along with the month of the year on kerschbaum while qis shows significant temporal variation with period of important recharge during spring and autumn and low recharge during the summer period such discrepancy is a consequence of the exposition to different climate which is warm moderate regional climate for kerschbaum against mediterranean climate for the oeillal s spring catchment within the oeillal s spring the regime of recharge follow the main mediterranean precipitation pattern with two rainy seasons in spring and autumn periods the analyse show that for both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchment the confidence interval on the variation of qis along with the month of the year appears to reduce when considering a higher number of hydrotope such results are consistent with the analysis of the estimated parameters table 4 indeed for both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchment the parameter values related to the lower compartment appears well constrained whatever the number of hydrotopes in the upper part of the model structure then considering infiltration heterogeneities through a semi distributed model seems to better capture the infiltration processes from the upper level to the lower level compartments on both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring karst systems 5 conclusion this study investigated how considering lclu and thus a semi distributed recharge impacts the performance of a lumped parameter hydrological model as well as the recharge dynamics in forest dominated karst system the model performances are compared using numerical performance criteria time series analysis i e auto correlation analysis cross correlation analysis and wavelet multiresolution analysis and analysis of the simulated recharge dynamics considering a semi distributed recharge gives better performance for both kerschbaum and oeillal catchments hydrological models while no improvement is obtained for baget catchment kerschbaum and oeillal karst springs are characterized by slower recession dynamics than the baget spring the results within the baget catchment show that considering a more complex conceptualization of recharge processes does not bring better hydrological model performance the baget is characterized by a high degree of karstification an important spring discharge variability as well as an important role of matrix conduit exchanges the heterogeneities in recharge processes are difficult to capture considering a daily lumped parameter hydrological model a deeper investigation considering a higher frequency base might be needed to better assess the impact of lclu on recharge processes also considering a semi distributed recharge seems to reduce the uncertainty in the quantification of the internal fluxes flowing from the upper level to the lower level of the model structure the main results of the study consist of a first step in the assessment of the trade off between hydrological model complexity and hydrological model performance in a framework of lumped parameter modeling dedicated to karst hydrology systematic consideration of lclu is thus not necessarily worthwhile in karst environments as it can bring contradictory results in terms of hydrological model performance further work should investigate both structural and parametric uncertainties related to the inclusion of lclu in lumped parameter modeling in karst hydrology since lclu changes mays have strong impact on recharge processes as well as strong implications on groundwater vulnerability credit

hydrotope specific quickflow occurring in preferential flow paths e g subsurface conduits the quickflow bypasses the baseflow storage b and is directly transferred to the spring outlet the quickflow

the specific discharge parameter for the quickflow of a hydrotope and l hyd i l is the mean distance of hydrotope i to the adjacent spring thus accounting for the relative location of the same

3034,lumped parameter modeling approach has been widely applied in karst hydrology for among other applications groundwater availability assessment in a context of global change nonetheless such approach generally does not account for land cover land use lclu and its impacts on recharge processes then considering a semi distributed recharge constitutes a relevant approach to capture the impacts of lclu on flow dynamics but also introduce more complexity in the modeling approach the present study consists of a multiple hydrological model calibration to assess the implication of considering a semi distributed recharge in a lumped parameter model and focuses on the uncertainty originating by the model structure the modeling results are discussed to evaluate the trade off between hydrological model complexity and hydrological model performance the study focuses on forest dominated karst areas with three karst catchments kerschbaum lower austria baget french pyrenees and oeillal southern france considering a semi distributed recharge gives better performance for both kerschbaum and oeillal catchments hydrological models while no improvement is obtained for baget catchment systematic consideration of lclu is thus not necessarily worthwhile in karst environmen ts as it can bring contradictory results in terms of hydrological model performance keywords karst hydrology lumped parameter modeling land cover land use recharge data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction one quarter of the world s population depends on freshwater from karst aquifers ford and williams 2013 ensuring a sustainable karst freshwater supply constitutes a major challenge in a context of increasing imbalance between freshwater supply capacity and the needs of a growing population stefano et al 2012 wada et al 2016 moreover both climate change and anthropogenic pressures including an increase in water abstraction or changes in land cover and land use lclu may have a strong impact on the future availability of karst water resources gleeson et al 2012 taylor et al 2013 a decreasing karst groundwater availability has already been observed in various regions around the world such as in the mediterranean area charlier et al 2015 fiorillo and guadagno 2012 garcía ruiz et al 2011 smiatek et al 2013 north america loáiciga et al 2000 and asia guo et al 2005 hao et al 2009 ma et al 2004 wu et al 2017 moreover many studies have investigated the potential evolution of karst groundwater resources under various climate change assumptions brenner et al 2018 chen et al 2018 doummar et al 2018 nerantzaki et al 2020 or various future anthropogenic scenarios andreas hartmann et al 2012 sivelle et al 2021 nonetheless only a few studies consider the impact of lclu changes such as urban area expansion or vegetation adaption to climate change in the assessment of global change impacts on karst groundwater sarrazin et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 highlighted on a global scale that vegetation in the karst regions can be more sensitive to changes in precipitation regimes than to temperature ellison et al 2012 stated that forest water interactions play a crucial role in supplying the atmospheric moisture that becomes precipitation in the hydrologic cycle and so forest may have a noticeable influence on the rainfall regime on a large scale also forest coverage around the world is in evolution with an estimated loss of around 2 3 million kilometers square and a gain of around 0 8 million kilometers square from 2000 to 2012 hansen et al 2013 under changing climatic conditions the vegetation can show an adaption and consequently modify the land atmosphere exchanges bussotti et al 2014 klausmeyer et al 2009 llorens and domingo 2007 which could at the end cause a modification in the recharge processes tramblay et al 2020 finally lclu changes may constitute a first order factor in the evolution of groundwater resources since they may strongly impact the recharge processes the assessment and prediction of the effects of lclu changes on groundwater resources require information on the heterogeneities of the recharge processes and thus the implementation of hydrological models that include a distributed or semi distributed recharge one common approach for hydrodynamic modeling in karst systems consists of considering different combinations of the dominant flow components as distinct conceptual buckets bittner et al 2018 butscher and huggenberger 2008 fleury et al 2007 guinot et al 2015 mazzilli et al 2019 tritz et al 2011 such a model can be useful for the long term assessment of the flow dynamics and groundwater resources evolution sivelle et al 2019 highlighted a decrease of more than 10 in the water level during spring periods since the 1960 s on aliou and baget karst systems in the french pyrenees hartmann et al 2012 show that the discharge could decrease by 30 by the end of the 21st century at the faria spring in palestine nerantzaki and nikolaidis 2020 highlighted an increased dryness in terms of frequency duration and intensity for three mediterranean karst springs located in greece sivelle et al 2021 proposed a methodology to assess the relative impact of climate changes and anthropogenic forcing on spring discharge and highlighted climate change as the main factor causing a decrease in the predicted oeillaĺs spring discharge in southern france in these former studies the proposed conceptual lumped parameters models consider homogeneous recharge processes at the catchment scale depending on land use heterogeneities in soil properties heterogeneities in climate inputs e g convective events altitudinal gradient and catchment size it can be of interest to consider a semi distributed recharge as shown in former studies bittner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2012 ollivier et al 2020 the first purpose of this study is to investigate how considering a semi distributed recharge depending on lclu affects the flow dynamics of a lumped parameter model and more especially the infiltration toward the saturated zone the second purpose is to identify the appropriate levels of model complexity that allows obtaining the best performance in terms of spring discharge simulations for that purpose the study will focus on forest dominated karst areas to avoid bias due to significant differences in terms of the dominant type of lclu in the recharge area therefore three karst catchments characterized by recharge areas lower than 50 km2 were chosen to run a multi model calibration considering different levels of complexity in the upper level of the model i e the compartment can be subject to evapotranspiration and so reproduce the land atmosphere exchanges also the evapotranspiration is supposed independent of the lclu to avoid uncertainties related to the estimation method as well as the introduction of cultural coefficient in this way the study is more related to the impact of model structure rather than input uncertainty 2 study sites and data fig 1 shows the location and the land use for the three selected catchments kerschbaum bittner et al 2018 oeillal spring sivelle et al 2021 sivelle and jourde 2020 and baget sivelle et al 2019 to avoid misinterpretations due to significant differences in terms of dominant land use the study focuses on forest dominated karst areas table 1 summarizes the main characteristic of the three catchments in terms of climate geology lithology and lclu the kerschbaum spring is located 10 km south of the city of waidhofen a d ybbs lower austria its recharge area covers approximately 2 5 km2 and is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 8 c and annual precipitation of 1405 mm 2001 2014 the small scale recharge area is predominantly covered by beech forests and parts of it by dolomite quarries table 1 with a mean annual discharge of 34 l s 1 the kerschbaum spring is part of the regional water supply and shows a response time to rainfall events of 1 day bittner et al 2021 the recharge area belongs to the eastern foothills of the northern calcareous alps and consists of a sequence of dolomitic basement rocks which result in a deep karstified groundwater system despite the well connected network of conduits the recharge area does not present significant sinkholes and the recharge processes can be assumed to be mainly diffusive bittner et al 2018 the oeillal spring is located north of the city of narbonne southern france and drains water from the limestone terrain of the fonfroide monredon massif the main aquifer in the area runs within the calcareous formation and fed the oeillal spring which is located in the western part of the narbonne sigean sedimentary basin and rises at four spring pools in the northern part of the area there is also an alluvial aquifer which is contained in the quaternary formation of the aude river s terrace the recharge area covers around 43 2 km2 with a potential additional 10 km2 contributing zone sivelle and jourde 2020 and is characterized by a mediterranean climate with a mean annual temperature of 14 7 c and annual precipitations of 570 mm 1980 2020 the mean annual discharge is estimated to be around 0 14 m3 s the baget catchment is located 10 km southwest of the city of saint girons french pyrenees its recharge area covers approximately 13 2 km2 and is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 11 8 c and annual precipitation of 1000 mm 1970 2020 the mean annual discharge is estimated to be around 0 45 m3 s the karstified part of the basin is characterized by metamorphic jurassic to cretaceous dolomites limestones and calcareous marls these formations deep 70 to 90 southwards under the slaty albian cenomanian ballongue flysch that constitutes the southern boundary of the catchment the contact between karstified formation and non karstifiable rocks give the west east direction of the main drainage system the northern limit of the baget drainage basin consists of a secondary fault from the north pyrenean fault the alas fault both kerschbaum and oeillal catchment are impacted by the presence of quarries and oeillal catchment is also impacted by the presence of urban areas the baget catchment differs from other catchments due to the presence of non karstic impluvium that represent 20 of the total recharge area this part of the watershed consists of the slaty albian cenomanian ballongue flysch considered an impervious formation the orientation of the main drainage system in the area is given by the contact between the ballongue flysch and the karstified part of the basin in the west east direction debroas 2009 sivelle et al 2020 this part of the watershed contributes to the spring discharge through surface runoff rather than infiltration in the main aquifer the three selected catchments are characterized by a small recharge area 50 km2 and with a lclu dominated by forest that represents 96 of the total recharge area for kerschbaum 62 7 of the total recharge area for oeillal and 72 of the total recharge area for baget fig 1 the catchments are chosen based on their dominant lclu and their comparable size of recharge areas to avoid bias related to lclu and scale effects regarding kerschbaum and baget the two systems show similar catchment size and land cover characteristics but different geological and climate properties the kerschbaum springshed is a dolostone karst system with a mean annual temperature of 8 c on the contrary the geology of baget is dominated by limestones and the climate is characterized by a mean annual temperature of 12 2 c moreover the kerschbaum and baget springs have a mean discharge of 34 and 450 l s 1 respectively 3 methodology 3 1 hydrological models 3 1 1 semi distributed recharge in lumped parameter modeling a semi distributed recharge can be implemented in lumped parameter model at the catchment scale employing two distinct approaches which consist of either increasing the model complexity and so adding more parameters or considering distributed meteorological data precipitation land surface temperature evapotranspiration as input in the model such approaches have proved their efficiency in improving karst aquifers hydrological modeling ollivier et al 2020 propose the karamel model with several lumped model units running in parallel the structure of the model is based on a three compartments model the upper compartment collects precipitation hosts evapotranspiration and governs infiltration toward a slow discharge compartment m and a rapid discharge compartment c the outlet discharge consists of the sum of discharge from the slow and rapid compartments such model structure is widely used in karst hydrology baudement et al 2017 moussu 2012 pinault et al 2001 schmidt et al 2014 the modeling is performed over the fontaine de vaucluse aquifer southern france showing a large watershed area about 1600 km2 the model structure allows accounting for both slow matrix flows and fast conduit flows fleury et al 2007 mazzilli et al 2019 considering there is no exchange between these two flow components although exchanges flow can be observed in the non saturated zone dal soglio et al 2020 the input data consists of gridded data set with a spatial resolution of several kilometers that cannot be considered as valuable input for hydrological modeling on karst aquifers with recharge areas lower than 50 km2 such an approach allows to better assess the recharge distribution with heterogeneities due to environmental factors such as geology lclu or even meteorological forcing precipitation evapotranspiration in large karst catchments such as fontaine de vaucluse the recharge distribution explains a large part of the discharge variation at the outlet ollivier et al 2020 another approach relies on the introduction of hydrotopes which were considered in the lukars model bittner et al 2018 each hydrotope is characterized by land use and soil type and conceptually represents the vadose zone the model structure consists of a compartment contributing to the recharge of the saturated zone including also a loss function flowing to secondary springs and a hysteresis function tritz et al 2011 flowing directly to the spring in the lukars model each hydrotope is exposed to effective precipitation depending on interception evapotranspiration and when applicable snow processes the hydrotopes consist of several lumped parameter models running in parallel in a similar way as the karamel model ollivier et al 2020 each hydrotope contributes to recharge loss and fast flow depending on their relative area their distance from the spring as well as the land use and soil properties the use of such hydrotopes relies on the assumption of a hydrophysical uniqueness of each hydrotope bittner et al 2018 3 1 2 model structures two lumped parameters models are implemented in this study to account for a different conceptualization of the flow processes the first model corresponds to the original lukars model bittner et al 2018 and the second model corresponds to a coupled model with the concept of hydrotopes implemented in the lukars model in the upper level of a model structure with two interconnected compartments in the lower level of the model structure as proposed in the karstmod modeling platform mazzilli et al 2019 a detailed description of lukars and karstmod and their underlying equations are provided in appendix a and appendix b respectively fig 2 summarizes the different model structures for each catchment concerning both the upper and lower level of the model structures and a description of the associated parameters is given in table 2 in this study the different configurations in the upper level are tested considering 1 up to 4 hydrotopes bringing also more uncertain parameters for the model calibration conversely the lower level is chosen for each catchment based on former studies for oeillal sivelle et al 2021 kerschbaum bittner et al 2018 and baget sivelle et al 2019 the present study focuses on the characterization of the infiltration processes through two fluxes denoted qis and qhy that flow from the upper level toward a compartment in the lower level or directly to the spring fig 2 in this study the original linear baseflow storage from bittner et al 2018 is referred to as a compartment with linear discharge law for notation consistency with the use of coupled lukars and karstmod model structures also this compartment is denoted m fig 2 and represent the baseflow as suggested in the original karstmod model baudement et al 2017 mazzilli et al 2019 sivelle et al 2019 in this study the lower level in the model structure for kerschbaum corresponds to a compartment with linear discharge law implemented in the original lukars model bittner et al 2018 whereas a model structure considering matrix conduit exchanges in the lower level is applied within the baget catchment sivelle et al 2019 concerning the oeillal spring a threshold effect in lower level of the model structure i e compartment with linear discharge law allows reproducing the change in flow dynamics during the period of low water table elevation sivelle et al 2021 the upper level of the model structure consists of four lumped model units running in parallel denoted hydrotopes characterized by different land uses and soil types it conceptually represents the vadose zone compartment higher level with the continuum soil epikarst infiltration zone a hydrotope is analogous to a bucket that has three discharge components with different flow directions 1 the quickflow component qhy l3 t 1 is characterized with a hysteresis function tritz et al 2011 and is directly transferred to the spring outlet 2 the secondary spring discharge qsec l3 t 1 is transferred out of the system and do not contribute to the spring discharge or the lower compartment recharge and 3 the recharge qis l3 t 1 is transferred to the lower compartment the lower level of the model structure in the lukars model consists of one compartment with linear discharge law the recharge of the compartment consists of the sum of the intra storage flow qis from each hydrotope the outlet discharge of the lower compartment is transferred to the spring the total spring discharge consists of the sum of the fluxes flowing from the compartment with linear discharge law qms l3 t 1 and the fluxes from the hydrotopes qhy l3 t 1 with a hysteretic behavior concerning the coupled lukars karstmod model the lower level of the model structure consists of two interconnected compartments denoted m representative of slow linear flow dynamics that mainly occurs in the matrix and c representative of quick non linear flow dynamics that may occur in conduits and or unclogged fractures then compartment m corresponds to the capacitive function of the aquifer whereas compartment c is more related to the transmissive function of the aquifer both m and c can be filled with water flow from the upper compartment which are the intra storage flow qis and the quick flow component qhy the flow partition is made through a portioning coefficient for both qis flowing to m or to c and qhy flowing to c or to the spring one should note that the original karstmod modeling platform also implemented such flow partition from the compartment in the upper level to the different compartment of the lower level the difference for the coupled lukars karstmod model relies on the use of several buckets running in parallel rather than a single bucket with different discharge coefficients toward the bucket in the lower level of the model such conceptualization brings more complexity to the model structure and increases the number of uncertain parameters for the model calibration finally the two proposed models fig 2 consist of modular bucket style model of lumped parameters that enable to build of interconnected compartments depending on different levels of complexity in both upper and lower levels of the models in this study it should be noticed that hydrotopes can be activated deactivated depending on the levels of complexity considered in the upper level of the model to run the fluxes contributing either to the recharge of the lower level or directly to the spring discharge so the number of hydrotopes varies depending on how the heterogeneity in the upper level is considered table 2 summarizes the model structures in terms of flow conceptualization in the upper and lower level of the model for the three catchments 3 1 3 model calibration the hydrological models were implemented in the python environment summerfield 2010 while the parameter estimation was performed using a particle swarm optimization pso procedure eberhart and kennedy 1995 implemented in the pyswarm package lee 2014 this approach leads to the definition of a unique optimal parameter set for each model configuration and therefore this study does not address parametric uncertainty and model equifinality since the study focuses on the uncertainty originating by the model structure the data set for the calibration and validation of the hydrological model depends on the available data and the calibration procedure is performed on the same time intervals considered in the former studies to avoid bias due to the calibration period on the parameter estimation mazzilli et al 2012 the calibration is made on a period of 1 year for the kerschbaum spring 18 months for the oeillal spring and 10 years for the baget the calibration and validation periods are presented in table 3 the calibration is made on a period where the required data are available on a daily time step regarding the oeillal spring validation data consists of sparse temporal discharge time series measured before installation of probes for continuous hourly measurement sivelle and jourde 2020 also adding be in a weighted function with kge was required to give more importance of the water balance in the calibration procedure and to better reproduce the significant flow decrease during the summer period 3 2 model evaluation 3 2 1 model evaluation using performance criteria the metrics used for hydrologic model calibration and evaluation are mainly based on the comparison between observed and simulated streamflow according to hauduc et al 2015 model errors can be calculated in different ways and expressed as performance criteria allowing to evaluate model performance numerically several studies have proposed number of performance criteria bennett et al 2013 ferreira et al 2020 hauduc et al 2015 jackson et al 2019 to assess different aspects of the model performance it is recommended to adopt a multi objective model evaluation with a combination of different performance criteria huo and liu 2020 monteil et al 2020 in this paper the hydrological models are evaluated with some performance criteria widely used in karst hydrology the nash sutcliff efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 the non parametric kling gupta efficiency kgenp pool et al 2018 to evaluate the model performance in terms of volume of transit the modified balance error be perrin et al 2001 and the volumetric error ve criss and winston 2008 are also considered the correlation coefficient of pearson rp as well as spearman rs are also considered then hydrological model evaluation is performed using an ensemble of 7 performance criteria allowing to account with different aspect of the model performance for more information the reader may refer to some literature review bennett et al 2013 ferreira et al 2020 jackson et al 2019 given that the model structures are characterized by a different number of parameters the akaike informative coefficient aic is computed such as aic 2 k nln rss where k is the number of model parameters n the number of observations and rss is the sum of the squared residuals the aic penalizes the model structures with large number of parameters and gives information on how the performance may evolve with the number of uncertain parameters the various performance criteria are plotted according to a radar chart which consists of a polygon where the position of each point from the center gives the value of the performance criteria one should note that all the performance criteria used in this study are given with a perfect model fitting when the value is equal to 1 then plotting several models in the same radar plot allows a quick comparison of the model performance according to the various criteria 3 2 2 model evaluation using time series analysis in karst hydrology the auto correlation function acf is frequently used to characterize the temporal structure of hydrological signals under the linear stationary hypothesis labat et al 2000a larocque et al 1998 mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 mangin 1984 proposed to determine the memory effect of karst aquifers as the lag time value where the acf of the spring discharge time series reaches the value of 0 2 this approach is commonly used to characterize hydrodynamics in karst aquifers lorette et al 2018 sivelle and jourde 2020 in addition the cross correlation function ccf between rainfall and spring discharge provides an approximation of the impulse response mangin 1984 when assuming the rainfall consists of a random process white noise also it describes the capacity of a system to transform the rainfall into discharge the higher the ccf peak the more the system acts as a piston moreover the lag time for the occurrence of the maximum value in ccf corresponds to the time of response due to high heterogeneities in karst aquifers the response time can be dependent on the seasonal variability in rainfall intensity delbart et al 2014 both memory effects and response time can be dependent on the sampling frequency of the rainfall discharge time series sivelle and jourde 2020 because of the occurrence of several processes with characteristic time covering several orders of magnitudes blöschl and sivapalan 1995 lumped parameter modeling can show bias such as underestimation of the memory effect and overestimation of ccf peak sivelle 2019 and may testify the importance of considering low frequencies component in the simulated impulse response since the high frequencies processes appear to be predominant such time series analysis can provide information about the hydrological model performance in addition to the performance evaluation through numerical performance criteria such as nse kge or kgenp in addition the wavelet multiresolution analysis mra is applied to project the spring discharge time series on an orthogonal basis of wavelet and scale functions labat et al 2000b mallat 1989 the basis is generated from a filter band following a dyadic scale the projection allows building for each level of this scale the component of the signal that explains the variability at this scale the decomposition is orthogonal and therefore the sum of all components details and residue or smooth give back the initial signal for a deeper hydrological model evaluation sivelle 2019 runs mra on both observed and simulated spring discharge time series and calculate the goodness of fit with the nse criteria for each scale application on highly karstified watersheds such as aliou and baget karst systems shows the weakness of a daily rainfall discharge model for the high frequency scale 8 days and for the 8 months scale scale 256 days such an approach can be useful to evaluate hydrological model performances in addition to acf and ccf since it gives a deeper description of the model bias indeed since the usual performance criteria consider the mean errors it does not capture how the model errors can be structured in time and frequency and so how the model can be biased in forecasting purposes 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrological models calibration and validation the calibrated model parameters set for lukars model on baget oeillal and kerschbaum catchments are reported in table 4 whereas the performance criteria for both the calibration and the validation periods are shown in fig 3 the performance criteria are color scaled from red for bad values to blue for good values where the closer the value to 1 the better the fit between observed and simulated spring discharge the simulated spring hydrographs are reported in fig 4 and the radar chart for model performance evaluation are given in fig 5 the lukars model shows quite satisfactorily performance criteria for both kerschbaum and oeillal and provides lower performance criteria on the baget catchment in comparison the coupled lukars karstmod model provides higher performance criteria values although it appears to be quite close to the performance criteria with the karstmod model sivelle et al 2019 where nse 0 59 be 0 94 and kge 0 61 within the same calibration period the first lukars application on the kerschbaum catchment counts 4 hydrotopes and shows satisfactorily performance criteria bittner et al 2018 here the lukars model application with a lower number of hydrotopes shows lower performance criteria values but is still quite satisfactorily indeed the lk 01 and lk 04 model structures show tiny close be and ve values conversely other performance criteria show significant differences when the model structure considers at least two hydrotopes in the upper level both lk 03 and lk 04 outperforms with the nse kgenp r s and r p and share close performance thus a comparison of the different combinations of hydrotopes may allow assessing the trade off between model complexity i e number of calibration parameters and the model performance analysis of the simulated spring hydrograph fig 4 shows that whatever the number of active hydrotopes the lukars model allows capturing the complete spring hydrograph in a quite satisfactorily way moreover increasing the number of hydrotopes allows to better capture the recession part indeed the lk 01 model structure shows an important misfit during recession periods with a quite permanent offset while the recession dynamics appears to well reproduced and underestimates the flood peaks lk 02 model structure produces a better fit for the recession periods but overestimates the flood peaks fig 4 finally lk 03 and lk 04 model structures seem to provide a satisfactorily fit during both flood and recession periods of the spring hydrograph all lk model structures show very good be and ve errors and both lk 03 and lk 04 model structure outperforms other lk model structures considering most of the performance criteria fig 5 the aic shows a lower value when considering the lk 03 model structure within the calibration period compared with the other lk model structures then the model performance increase does not compensate for the introduction of additional parameters for kerschbaum when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 nonetheless a higher number of hydrotopes gives higher performance for both the calibration and validation periods fig 3 considering the nse criteria one should note a significant decrease in the performance criteria between calibration and validation periods whereas the other criteria show quite satisfactorily agreement it may testify significant errors on flood peaks estimation within the validation period while the model correctly reproduces water balance ve and be and correlation r p and r s concerning the oeillal spring s catchment the total landcover consists of four types of land use i quarries covering 2 of the total area ii urban areas covering 4 5 of the total area iii vineyards and agricultural plots covering 30 8 of the total area and iv forests and natural plots covering 62 7 of the total area fig 1 the first lukars application within the oeillal spring s catchment consists of two hydrotopes that represent an impervious zone quarries and urban area and an infiltration zone sivelle et al 2021 here the lk 03 model structure is introduced to consider different lclu in the infiltration zone with a distinction between wine yard and agricultural plots covering 30 8 of the total recharge area and forest covering 62 7 of the total recharge area in a general way the different lk model structures shows close performance considering kge be ve and r p whereas lk 02 model structure outperforms considering the kgenp thus the different lk model structures gives satisfactorily results for the different performance criteria although some minor changes can be observed within the different lk model structures elsewhere the model structures include a threshold effect in the lower compartment with linear discharge law where all lk 01 lk 02 and lk 03 model structures show quite similar values for both the height of the threshold mmin around 2 to 5 mm and the discharge parameter for the upper fluxes out of the compartment kms top around 0 008 mm day 1 conversely hydrotope 2 and hydrotope 3 within the lk 03 model structure shows contrasted discharge coefficient values for the fast flow going directly to the spring with hyd2 khy around 224 m mm 1 day 1 and hyd3 khy around 740 m mm 1 day 1 the discharge coefficient for the slow flow going to the lower level of the model structure also shows contrasted values with hyd2 kis around 0 29 m mm 1 day 1 and hyd3 is around 0 04 m mm 1 day 1 it testifies that the lk model whatever the number of active hydrotopes allows to capture the slow recession dynamics of the karst system associated with the oeillal s spring then considering a different number of hydrotopes only affects the flow dynamics from the upper to the lower level and allow to correctly reproduce the spring hydrographs fig 4 the aic criteria show the lower value for the lk 01 within the calibration period fig 3 it may call into question the interest of considering a pseudo distributed recharge for calibration purpose only the decrease of the performance criteria within the validation period might be the consequence of the sparse temporal resolution of discharge time series during the validation period i e monthly gauging indeed such discrepancy in performance criteria between periods with continuous monitoring and period with sparse temporal measurement was already experienced in the former study sivelle and jourde 2020 nonetheless the lk 03 model structure shows higher performance criteria within the validation period considering the baget catchment sivelle et al 2019 proposed a conceptualization of the hydrodynamic behavior based on the karstmod model mazzilli et al 2019 without any consideration for lclu and so considers a homogeneous recharge at the catchment scale to assess the impact of considering a semi distributed recharge in the model structure the original compartment e is replaced by the lukars model conceptualization with 4 hydrotopes within the upper level of the model structure the model then corresponds to the coupled lukars and karstmod model fig 2 denoted lk km as a comparison the classical lukars model denoted lk is also calibrated considering 1 up to 4 hydrotopes the lk 01 and lk 02 model structures show poor performance criteria regarding the nse and kge both lower than 0 5 which is also significantly lower than the performance observed with the original karstmod model where nse 0 59 and kge 0 61 sivelle et al 2019 the lk 03 and lk 04 model structures show performance criteria closer to the original karstmod model although the value for both nse and kge is still lower analyses of the simulated spring hydrograph together with the observed one fig 4 show that increasing the number of hydrotopes leads to dramatically underestimating the discharge peaks whereas all the lk model structures with 1 up to 4 hydrotopes provides quite comparable flow dynamics during recession periods in a general way one should note a spring discharge overestimation during significant recession periods such as july to september 1971 with both lk and lk km models also the lk km model simulates higher discharges during floods which is following the model structure that includes a compartment with nonlinear discharge law in the lower level of the model structure contrary to the lk model structures that consider one compartment with linear discharge law considering the lk 03 model structure hyd3 kis is around 1 mm day 1 whereas concerning lk 04 model structure both hyd3 kis and hyd4 kis are also around 1 mm day 1 then the introduction of a fourth hydrotopes when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 model structure does not allow to differentiate the dynamics for the intra storage fluxes from the upper level to the lower level moreover hyd2 kis is still in the same range of values when moving from lk 03 to lk 04 model structures with a value around 7 6 mm day 1 and 7 2 mm day 1 respectively it might show that the recharge dynamic from hydrotope 2 corresponding to poor vegetation cover is well contrasted with the hydrotopes 3 and 4 corresponding to agricultural plots and forests respectively conversely hydrotopes 3 and 4 cannot be separated in terms of recharge dynamics and brings back into question the assumption of hydrophysical uniqueness as well as the need of considering an additional hydrotope in the model structure finally both lk and lk km models within the baget catchment provide contradictory results with the above application within the kerschbaum and the oeillal spring catchments indeed a higher number of hydrotopes do not necessarily provide a better model performance criterion fig 3 and fig 5 also the aic criteria confirms such analysis since the lower value concerns the model structure with 1 hydrotope for lk model and with 2 hydrotopes for lk km model and so the gain in model performance does not compensate for the penalization due to the introduction of additional parameters also such observations within the calibration periods are consistent with the performance criteria calculated within the validation periods for which the lowest aic values are obtained for lk with 1 hydrotope and lk km with 2 hydrotopes as observed within the calibration period 4 2 model evaluation using time series analysis 4 2 1 autocorrelation and crosscorrelation function analysis the acf is calculated on both observed and simulated spring discharges within the different model structures for the three karst catchments fig 6 the acf calculated on observed and simulated spring discharges for the oeillal spring with the lk model structures look very closely the memory effect appears to be well estimated at around 80 to 90 days conversely the acf calculated on simulated discharge for kerschbaum seems to systematically underestimate the memory effect of 40 days the second peak for a lag value around 65 days appears to be reproduced by the lk models although the peak appears less frankly with the lk 01 model structure concerning the baget catchment the lk models generally estimate very poorly the memory effect of 17 days indeed lk 01 and lk 02 model structures provide a lower value around 9 days whereas lk 03 and lk 04 model structures overestimate the memory effect all the more with the lk 04 model structure that gives a memory effect of around 45 days the lk km models provide an underestimation of the memory effect although the higher the number of hydrotopes the closer the acf on simulated discharge to acf on observed discharge one should note that such misfit considering the acf was already investigated within the baget catchment considering daily rainfall discharge lumped parameter modeling sivelle 2019 due to a short response time that may require a higher sampling frequency labat et al 2000a in the same way ccf is calculated between rainfall and both observed and simulated spring discharge within the different model structures for the three karst catchments fig 7 concerning the oeillal spring ccf based on observed and simulated discharge appears very close when considering lk 03 model structure then the impulse response of the karst system with a slow recession dynamic appears well reproduced with both the lk 02 and lk 03 model structures whereas the lk 01 model structure fails to reproduce the quick time of response concerning kerschbaum the lk 02 model structure seems to overestimate the ccf peak amplitude and to under estimate the persistence of correlation for lag values larger than 10 days also the second peak around 65 days is well reproduced although the lk 01 model structure gives a lower ccf peak amplitude such a second peak in the rainfall discharge ccf can be the consequence of the existence of the slow flow dynamics which may have a delayed contribution with an important response time such observation can be consistent with the lithology of the kerschbaum catchment dominated by dolostones and a low value of the discharge coefficient for the compartment with linear law with an order of magnitude of 10 4 m day 1 this value is in contrast with values around 10 2 m day 1 for both baget and oeillal dominated by limestones then the lk models allow capturing both short term and mid term responses although the short term response with lk 04 model structure appears delayed within the baget catchment both lk and lk km models seem to overestimate the ccf peak value although the lk 04 and lk 04 km model structure show lower peak value of the ccf and so closer to the ccf based on observed data such overestimation of the ccf peak was already observed with the karstmod model sivelle 2019 4 2 2 orthogonal wavelet decomposition application of orthogonal wavelet decomposition on both observed and simulated spring discharges allows to calculate the performance criteria according to a dyadic scale fig 8 and to evaluate the model performance across different temporal scales here the performance criteria consist of the bunded version of the nse criteria mathevet et al 2006 denoted nse c2m it allows to reduce the amplitude of variation between 1 and 1 one should note that the bounded version of nse criteria keeps the same meaning with a comparison of the model errors with a naïve predictor i e the mean of the observed spring discharge time series where positive values mean the model is a better predictor and a nse c2m value of 1 corresponds to a perfect fit between the model prediction and the observation fig 9 shows the performance criteria i e the bounded version of nse as a function of the scale concerning the kerschbaum catchment both le lk 03 and lk 04 seems to outperforms for the various scales excepted for the 16 days scale where all the lk model structures gives lower nse c2m values considering the periods larger than 32 days the lk 02 lk 03 and lk 04 models shows close performance larger than the lk 01 model structure concerning the oeillal spring lk 02 and lk 03 model structures outperform the lk 01 model structure for the scales from 2 days to 128 days whereas as considering the larger periods all lk model structures show quite close performance also all the lk model structures show poor performance criteria for the high frequency periods lower than 8 days whereas the low frequencies period larger than 64 days give much higher nse c2m values due to the slow recession dynamics of the oeillal spring system and the important contribution of the lower compartments in the spring discharge it is difficult to well capture the fast flow dynamics this is also observed with the rainfall discharge ccf that shows a low peak value and testify of an important smoothing effect operated by the karst system such results may testify to the importance of considering several flow dynamics from the non saturated zone to the capacitive function of the aquifer then since most of the effective rainfall flows toward the lower level of the model structure fig 2 a suitable characterization of the recharge toward the capacitive function of the aquifer may constitute an important step for the assessment of groundwater resource variability concerning the baget system all the lk model structures present close performance criteria for the temporal scale above 128 days whereas the performance for the smaller scale can show a significant difference this may indicate that for a reactive karst system such as baget the high frequency processes can be better reproduced by considering homogeneous recharge at the catchment scale indeed increasing the number of hydrotopes seems to degrade the performance criteria for periods lower than 100 days this is observed when the lower level is supposed to be a compartment with linear discharge law and so the saturated zone consists of a unique flow dynamic over the baget area former studies have shown the existence of a well developed drainage system mangin 1975 marsaud 1996 with efficient quick flow evidenced by artificial tracer tests labat and mangin 2015 sivelle and labat 2019 and highlighted the interest of considering two flow dynamics with exchange flow sivelle et al 2019 then considering a lower level of the model structure with a more complex structure highlight that whatever the number of hydrotopes the model performance is comparable scale by scale in the end increasing the number of hydrotopes does not bring better performance either in the high frequency or the low frequencies 4 3 effect of hydrotopes on hydrodynamics to quantify the impact of considering a different number of hydrotopes on the flow dynamics the monthly mean intra storage flow qis discharge from the hydrotopes in the upper level to the lower level of the model structure considered as a proxy of the recharge is calculated within the month of the year fig 10 it gives an overview of how the recharge may occur along with the hydrologic cycle due to the bad performance of the modeling approach within the baget karst system the analysis is made only within the kerschbaum spring and the oeillal s spring where considering several hydrotopes helped improving the hydrological model performance to perform a preliminary assessment of the influence of parametric uncertainties the estimation of the mean qis is made on the 0 99 percentile ensemble of simulated hydrographs using the latin hypercube sampling lhs procedure implemented in the safe toolbox pianosi et al 2015 then the simulation with the highest objective function is reported in solid line while the confidence interval is given through a colored envelope fig 10 the simulated spring hydrograph is given within the calibration period while the recharge is estimated on periods of 10 years considering the hydrological model can be used out of calibration periods due to acceptable performance within the validation period fig 3 the estimation is made on the 2010 2020 periods for oeillal and 2006 2016 periods for kerschbaum kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchments show very different pattern in the proxy of recharge along the hydrological cycle indeed qis appears quite constant along with the month of the year on kerschbaum while qis shows significant temporal variation with period of important recharge during spring and autumn and low recharge during the summer period such discrepancy is a consequence of the exposition to different climate which is warm moderate regional climate for kerschbaum against mediterranean climate for the oeillal s spring catchment within the oeillal s spring the regime of recharge follow the main mediterranean precipitation pattern with two rainy seasons in spring and autumn periods the analyse show that for both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchment the confidence interval on the variation of qis along with the month of the year appears to reduce when considering a higher number of hydrotope such results are consistent with the analysis of the estimated parameters table 4 indeed for both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring catchment the parameter values related to the lower compartment appears well constrained whatever the number of hydrotopes in the upper part of the model structure then considering infiltration heterogeneities through a semi distributed model seems to better capture the infiltration processes from the upper level to the lower level compartments on both kerschbaum and oeillal s spring karst systems 5 conclusion this study investigated how considering lclu and thus a semi distributed recharge impacts the performance of a lumped parameter hydrological model as well as the recharge dynamics in forest dominated karst system the model performances are compared using numerical performance criteria time series analysis i e auto correlation analysis cross correlation analysis and wavelet multiresolution analysis and analysis of the simulated recharge dynamics considering a semi distributed recharge gives better performance for both kerschbaum and oeillal catchments hydrological models while no improvement is obtained for baget catchment kerschbaum and oeillal karst springs are characterized by slower recession dynamics than the baget spring the results within the baget catchment show that considering a more complex conceptualization of recharge processes does not bring better hydrological model performance the baget is characterized by a high degree of karstification an important spring discharge variability as well as an important role of matrix conduit exchanges the heterogeneities in recharge processes are difficult to capture considering a daily lumped parameter hydrological model a deeper investigation considering a higher frequency base might be needed to better assess the impact of lclu on recharge processes also considering a semi distributed recharge seems to reduce the uncertainty in the quantification of the internal fluxes flowing from the upper level to the lower level of the model structure the main results of the study consist of a first step in the assessment of the trade off between hydrological model complexity and hydrological model performance in a framework of lumped parameter modeling dedicated to karst hydrology systematic consideration of lclu is thus not necessarily worthwhile in karst environments as it can bring contradictory results in terms of hydrological model performance further work should investigate both structural and parametric uncertainties related to the inclusion of lclu in lumped parameter modeling in karst hydrology since lclu changes mays have strong impact on recharge processes as well as strong implications on groundwater vulnerability credit

water level l in hydrotope i s i is the hydrotope specific sink and source term as a mass balance of precipitation evapotranspiration and interception then evapotranspiration is considered using the formula from oudin et al 2005 q hyd i l3t 1 represents the quickflow component e g conduit flow q sec i l2t 1 refers to the secondary spring discharge and q is i l2t 1 is the groundwater recharge the
