3475,soil moisture sm is the most direct and important source of crop water requirement the change in sm levels and the maize water requirement mwr will under the influence of climate change lead to changes in the areas that are suitable for maize cultivation in northeast china nec to quantitatively investigate these changes the study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in the sm and mwr in nec from 1961 to 2010 using global land data assimilation system gldas sm products meteorological data and land use data the following conclusions were reached 1 in the past 50 years there has been an obvious trend of soil drying in nec and the equivalent water thickness at the depth of 0 200 cm has decreased by 71 06 mm 12 78 which is more serious in agricultural areas 77 09 mm 13 86 2 from 1961 to 2010 the air temperature in nec increased by about 1 8 c in 50 years 3 the shortage in maize water calculated by sm and mwr showed that areas unsuitable for maize cultivation increased by approximately 66 250 km2 an area close to one third of the dry farmland area in nec and 4 the slightly decreased precipitation and increased air temperature were the major driving factors for the decrease in the suitable maize cultivation area if the maize was planted in unsuitable areas for a long time it may lead to excessive use of groundwater and surface water therefore these results provide a base for decision making regarding adjustments to the cultivation structure in nec keywords suitable cultivation area soil moisture gldas crop water requirement northeast china 1 introduction climate change and its impacts on soil moisture and crop production are major conditions that will have to be managed worldwide in the twenty first century hansen et al 2010 ortiz bobea et al 2021 climate change refers to the change of temperature and precipitation which leads to the change of the suitable areas for vegetation cultivation in china the air temperature increased by about 1 2 from 1960 to 2006 ding et al 2007 wei and chen 2009 with higher warming rates in the north than in the south the greatest rate of warming occurred in northeast china nec at a trend of 0 36 per decade fang et al 2018 piao et al 2010 such pronounced warming would enhance evapotranspiration and increase the shortage of crop water and some studies proved that increased temperature and decreased precipitation also have a negative impact on sm level and crop production butler and huybers 2015 lobell et al 2011 2013 rigden et al 2020 in china warming is believed to be harmful to rain fed crops and maize yields showed a negative response to rising temperatures during the period 1979 2002 lesk et al 2021 tao et al 2008 furthermore atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd is a critical variable in determining plant photosynthesis rising air temperature increase saturated water vapor pressure which will drive an increase in vpd if the actual atmospheric water vapor content does not increase by exactly the same amount as saturated vapor pressure yuan et al 2019 nec is home to the jilin maize belt one of the three famous golden maize belts in the world the maize cultivation area in nec exceed 1 3 of the total cultivation area in china meanwhile more than 90 of the maize in nec is rain fed meaning that precipitation is the main source of root water uptake national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 yang et al 2015 the soil organic content soil moisture and climatic conditions in nec have been highly suitable as maize growing regions over the past few decades however given the impact of climate change some regions may no longer be suitable several studies have investigated the distribution patterns of spring maize in nec based on the main climatic factors that affect crop growth i e temperature precipitation light and humidity index fraga et al 2016 mcdonald et al 2009 in these studies the climate indicators were classified using cluster analysis followed by weighted analysis to determine the climate suitable area zhao et al 2015 furthermore previous studies have only determined the suitability of maize cultivation by focusing mainly on the water balance theory allen et al 1998 referred that the irrigation water requirement basically represents the difference between effective rainfall and crop water requirements pang et al 2015 analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of water shortage based on effective precipitation and crop water requirement in sichuan province china in addition bokke and shoro 2020 determined the area of the water shortage and the amount of irrigation water required based on the water balance theory however calculating effective rainfall is a complex process because it requires consideration of runoff leakage and crop interception dastane 1974 delgoda et al 2015 liu et al 1998 the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and the complexity of terrain may lead to errors in the calculation of effective rainfall therefore it is more direct to do this by evaluating root zone soil moisture rzsm and crop water requirements rzsm is the result of the combined effects of precipitation temperature evaporation and runoff and is vital for plant growth timm et al 2011 xu et al 2019 in this study there is a hypothesis that the soil moisture in 0 to 200 cm can be used to sustain crop growth we use the difference between rzsm and mwr to build an index and then evaluate whether the region is short of water and the change of water deficient region based on the index therefore we can quantitatively evaluate whether the region was still suitable for maize cultivation from 1961 to 2010 with the development of remote sensing observation and data assimilation technology rzsm and evapotranspiration can be obtained over a wide spatial range and long periods of time delgoda et al 2015 at present soil moisture profile information can be derived by modeling approaches using either climate models or land surface models lsm there are several such modeling systems and reanalysis products which can produce operational spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture data sets such as the north american land data assimilation system luo et al 2003 the gldas rodell et al 2004 the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim re analysis dee et al 2011 and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications rienecker et al 2011 the gldas is a global high resolution offline terrestrial modeling system incorporating ground and satellite observations bi et al 2016 currently the remote sensing imageries of time series are able to monitor the crop evapotranspiration across the growing season calera et al 2017 mu et al 2007 developed a global remote sensing evapotranspiration algorithm based on modis and global meteorology data moreover based on the remote sensing data multispectral hyperspectral imageries regression relationship with vegetation indices was used to estimate crop yield and leaf area index karthikeyan et al 2020 based on the standard climatic data measured by meteorological station the crop water requirement can be calculated by reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient method and the method is called fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the method overcomes the shortcomings of the previous fao penman method and provides values that are more consistent with actual crop water use data worldwide allen et al 1998 shi et al 2008 the primary goal of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of declining rzsm on the areas suitable for maize cultivation in nec against the background of climate change and then rzsm and crop water requirements can be used to calculate shortage of crop water thereby facilitating the development of management strategies the remainder of this paper are organized as follows material and methods is introduced in section 2 section 3 provides a detailed description of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the rzsm mwr and water shortage details the mwr calculated for the entire growing season and evaluates whether the rzsm meet the requirements for maize growth it also describes the characteristics of the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation and air temperature finally section 4presents the results of the correlation analysis between water deficiency and precipitation air temperature and it provides a scientific basis for the selection of crop regions and agricultural water management in nec 2 material and methods 2 1 study area northeast china nec located at 115 135 e 38 55 n in china comprised heilongjiang province hlj jilin province jl liaoning province ln and four areas of the inner

evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture products in gldas can be provided with good quality in nec chen et al 2013 li 2018 mo et al 2015 moiwo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 for comparative analysis with land cover dataset and crop water requirement a resampling to 25 km was performed on gldas soil moisture therefore gldas soil moisture data products were used for analysis in this study in addition the data was downloaded from https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas the unit of the gldas product soil moisture precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff was kg m2 to facilitate subsequent analyses the units of the data were converted to depth content mm and volume content cm3 cm3 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological information center http data cma cn data cdcdetail datacode surf cli chn mul mon html and included monthly mean maximum minimum temperature mean wind speed sunshine percentage mean relative humidity precipitation and mean water vapor pressure here we used data from 78 meteorological stations in nec from 1961 to 2010 the distribution of meteorological stations is shown in fig 1 the meteorological data are mainly used in the penman monteith equation to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration and subsequently crop water requirement 2 2 3 harmonized world soil database the world soil database harmonized world soil database version 1 1 hwsd has been constructed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao and the vienna international institute of applied systems iiasa the data of china spatial resolution of 1 km were provided by the nanjing soil research institute in the second national land survey the dataset provides information on soil types as well as soil physical and chemical properties 0 100 cm shi et al 2004 he et al 2016 http westdc westgis ac cn use of a standardized structure allows linkage of the attribute data with gis to display or query the composition in terms of soil units and the characterization of selected soil parameters water storage capacity salinity textural class and granulometry the percentage of sand and clay in this dataset is mainly used for gldas soil moisture preprocess 2 2 4 land cover in this study the land cover dataset was used to determine the dry farmland area and the spatial resolution was 1 km the dataset was downloaded from the resource and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in order to facilitate the analysis the land cover classes were grouped into main seven classes related to dry farmland paddy land forest land grassland urban land water body and unused land moreover after grouping into seven classes a resampling 25 km was performed on the land cover dataset in this way the spatial resolution of the land cover dataset was equal to gldas soil moisture in nec the dry farmland crops were mainly maize and soybean and the cultivation was intercropping zhang et al 2020 furthermore maize and soybean production in 2018 was 84 4 and 7 6 million tons respectively wang et al 2020 the total maize area accounts for 9 8 106 ha whereas the soybean area accounts 4 0 106 ha national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 because of the larger proportion of the maize cultivation area than soybean in nec the 25 km dry farmland pixels were assumed as the maize cultivation area 2 3 methods the gldas soil moisture product used in this study were calculated from noah model the noah model has been used operationally in national centers for environmental prediction ncep models since 1996 and it continues to benefit from a steady progression of improvements in the noah model the prognostic equation for the volumetric soil moisture content θ is 1 θ t z d θ z k z f θ where both the soil diffusivity d and hydraulic conductivity k are function of θ and f θ represents source and sink i e precipitation and evaporation for soil moisture the soil water diffusivity d is given by d k ψ θ wherein ψ is the soil tension function k and ψ are computed by k ks θ θs 2b 3 and ψ ψs θ θs b where b is a curve fitting parameter ks ψs and b depend on soil type

conductivity of the i th soil layer after integration k z 3 is the moisture loss due to gravitational percolation through the bottom of the third layer also named subsurface runoff or drainage chen and dudhia 2001 for the soil model to capture the daily weekly and seasonal evolution of soil moisture and also to mitigate the possible truncation error in discretization we use four soil layers and the thickness of each layer from the ground surface to the bottom are 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m respectively gldas soil moisture was derived based on noah model and the forcing data soil properties and vegetation data were used in the model many studies have proved that gldas products were reliable although the above equations were used in the noah model we did not perform the model instead we used the gldas soil moisture products 2 3 1 calculation of crop water requirement the crop coefficient approach was widely used for the calculation of crop water requirement and for areas with long precipitation or irrigation time intervals the single crop coefficient method was generally selected the single crop coefficient kc combines soil evaporation and crop transpiration making the calculation simple and accurate abdullah et al 2015 based on the evapotranspiration computed from the penman monteith equation crop water requirement was calculated by single crop coefficient method combined with reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 5 et c k c et 0 where etc represents the crop water requirement mm d 1 et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 and kc represents the crop coefficient here we calculated mwr under the standard growth of maize based on meteorological data based on the fao 56 manual the crop coefficient of maize in the standard environment follows the principles an air humidity of 45 a wind speed of 2 m s an environment suitable for crop growth no pests good agricultural management and configuration the mwr was calculated based on the weather station in order to analyze the change of the planting area the mwr of the whole nec was generated by the kriging interpolation method kriging takes advantage of both distance and geometry and minimizes the difference between the estimate and the true value rossi et al 1994 there are 88 stations in northeast china considering the integrity of data and the uniformity of station spatial distribution we deleted the stations with incomplete data therefore we used data from 78 meteorological stations in nec from 1961 to 2010 2 3 1 1 calculation of reference evapotranspiration based on penman monteith equation the penman monteith equation was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration for each meteorological station it was the standard method adopted by fao allen et al 1998 and widely used in different environmental and climatic conditions without local calibration and its accuracy has been confirmed by lysimeter in various climatic environments feng et al 2017 the penman monteith equation is as follows 6 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux density w m 2 which is negligible and for the vegetation growth area and long calculation time intervals the value can be set as 0 t is the daily average air temperature at the height of 2 m u 2 is the wind speed m s 1 at the height of 2 m es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea refers to the actual water vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the water vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the humidity calculation constant kpa e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd vpd describes the difference between the water vapor pressure at saturation and the actual water vapor pressure for a given temperature is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants yuan et al 2019 2 3 1 2 crop coefficient localization based on climatic factors according to the fao 56 manual and the growth stage of maize in nec the crop coefficient was established combined with previously obtained data and the climatic characteristics the entire maize growing season was divided into four periods initial stage may growing stage june stable stage july and august and later stage september allen et al 1998 for different climatic conditions the crop coefficient of the stable period and the later period can be adjusted according to eq 7 7 k c kc tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where kc represents the adjusted localization crop coefficient kc tab represents the reference value provided in fao 56 rh min represents the minimum relative humidity of air u 2 is the same as eq 6 and h represents crop height m 2 3 2 calculation of crop water shortage based on water balance principle based on previous experiments and model simulation the maize root depth in nec was mainly concentrated in 0 200 cm liu 2016 in this study there is an assumption that the soil moisture at the depth of 0 200 cm is available for crop growth in general the main factors affecting sm in nec are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff and water exchange at the bottom of the root layer was simplified to zero therefore the farmland water balance equation is 8 δ w w 2 w 1 p e t r where p et and r represent the precipitation mm evapotranspiration mm and runoff mm respectively of the current month w1 is the soil moisture content in the initial state mm and the initial state of soil moisture is the state prior to the growing season w2 is the soil moisture content in the end state mm and δ w is the change in soil moisture over time mm the available soil moisture in the root zone was calculated according to eq 9 9 aw w 4 i 5 9 p i i 5 9 et i i 5 9 r i where aw is the available soil moisture in the root zone mm w4 is the soil moisture content prior to the growing season that is the initial state mm and subscript i is the corresponding month of the growing season which is from may to september in this study based on the four layers of sm we calculated the sum of the rzsm in the growing season and similarly the sum of mwr in the growing season was calculated each year from 1961 to 2010 next the difference between maize water requirement and 0 200 cm rzsm in the growing season was calculated and then the spatial distribution of maize water shortage in nec was obtained 10 ws et c a w where ws represents the water shortage during the growing season of maize in nec a positive ws value indicates a lack of soil moisture and a negative value indicates that there is a surplus of rzsm dastane 1974 pang et al 2015 the sm for the 0 200 cm layer from 1961 to 1970 were subtracted from the mwr pixel by pixel equation 10 and the water shortage of the maize growing season in the 1960 s were obtained fig 4 a the rzsm and mwr from 2001 to 2010 performed the same analysis method with 1960 s fig 4 b according to the spatial distribution of maize water shortage throughout the growing season the isoline were drawn the 0 mm line was reserved and other isoline were hidden 2 3 3 calculation of the change rate slope the change rate referred as s refers to the trend of a variable over time including soil moisture temperature and precipitation facilitating the establishment of a linear regression relationship between the variable and time pang et al 2015 based on this theory the change rate can be estimated as 11 s n i 1 n t i y i i 1 n t i i 1 n y i n i 1 n t i 2 i 1 n t i 2 where s is the linear regression slope of variable y that is the change rate slope n is the number of total years of y ti is the number of years from 1 to n and yi is the value of y in the i th year if s is a positive value the trend of variable y is increasing in this time period with negative values the opposite is the case 2 3 4 statistical analysis a statistical analysis provides a mechanism for making quantitative decisions about a process or processes the intent is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a conjecture or hypothesis about the process the conjecture is called the null hypothesis nayak and hazra 2011 in this study we set the significance level to 5 a test of significance is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a claim also called a hypothesis the truth of which is being assessed the significance level is the level at which it can be accepted if a given event is statistically significant this is also termed as p value in the case when the p value is smaller than or equal to significance level α the null hypothesis should be rejected and an alternative hypothesis is supposed to be accepted or assumed as true 12 z x μ 0 σ n where z is the test statistic n is the sample size σ is the deviation in the population μ 0 is the population mean x is the sample mean based on the normal distribution the probability of test statistics z is calculated and compared with α to make a decision in order to evaluate the performance of the water content rzsm mwr and ws the pearson correlation r was computed the formula is listed below 13 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the i th value y i is the fitted value and the overbar denotes average 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of rzsm during 1961 2010 to investigate the change characteristics of rzsm over time in nec the spatial average soil moisture at 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm were calculated for all 25 25 km pixels from 1961 to 2010 and the change rate of soil moisture in each layer was calculated based on eq 11 combined with the change rate and thickness of each layer the reduction of sm in the four layers over a period of 50 years were calculated table 1 table 1 showed that there was a downward trend of spatial average sm in each layer the decrease in sm was lowest in the top layer with the reduction of 2 23 mm table 1 the third layer showed the most dramatic decline in sm the sm of each layer in the dry farmland showed a downward trend over 50 years 1961 2010 and its decrease rate is greater than that of nec table 1 from 1961 to 2010 the soil moisture in four layers decreased by 71 06 mm in nec while dry farmland decreased by 77 09 mm table 1 four layers of gldas soil moisture products were summed to calculate the pixel by pixel rzsm change rate for the whole season may september and its spatial distribution was plotted fig 2 the change rate of rzsm from 1961 to 2010 mostly passed the significance test confidence interval is 95 fig 2 the change rate was mostly between 2 65 and 1 20 mm year mainly the central part of heilongjiang the central and western parts of jilin the western part of liaoning and the southern part of inner mongolia in addition most of the dry farmland crops were located in the middle of nec among them jilin province is the main area of maize cultivation and rzsm in the central and western part of jilin province shows a significant downward trend 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of maize water requirement mwr during 1961 2010 trend analysis was performed for each pixel to obtain the change rate slope based on the method in section 3 2 fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of the change rate for mwr from northwest to southeast the change rate of mwr changed from positive to negative fig 3 an increased mwr was mainly found in non maize cultivation areas while decreases were observed in maize cultivation areas for the entire nec the mwr in inner mongolia showed an upward trend while that in liaoning province showed a downward trend the central and western parts of jilin province and the southwest part of heilongjiang province also showed a downward trend in jilin province the change rate mainly varied between 1 02 and 0 mm year 3 3 spatial distribution of maize water shortages in nec for the periods 1961 1970 and 2001 2010 the water shortage and the position of the 0 mm boundary in the maize cultivation area in these two decades were analyzed figure 4 showed that the red line represents the boundary line with a water shortage of 0 mm the western side of the red line represents the water shortage area and the eastern side represents the area without water shortage the water shortage area of maize in nec from 1961 to 1970 was mainly located in inner mongolia and liaoning province fig 4 a at the same time there were no water shortages at heilongjiang and jilin provinces in the 1960 s a comparison of fig 4 a and b illustrates that the boundary moved eastward and northward in fig 4 c the range of maize water shortage expanded from inner mongolia to the east gradually expending to western jilin southwestern heilongjiang and western liaoning province in addition the maximum water shortage in fig 4 a is 225 mm and the surplus moisture is 340 mm while the maximum water shortage in fig 4 b is 366 mm and the surplus moisture reduced to 272 mm in the entire nec the area of maize water shortage in the first decade of the 21st century increased significantly compared with the 1960 s furthermore some water scarce pixels appeared in the eastern part of heilongjiang province from 2001 to 2010 reflecting the spatial difference in rzsm based on the area of water deficit in maize growing season we calculated the water deficit area of maize growth in different periods 1961 1970 and 2001 2010 and the results were shown in table 2 the water shortage areas of the four provinces have increased with a total area of 66 250 km2 which is close to one third of the cultivation area of dry farmland in nec table 2 among them heilongjiang province accounted for 35 42 of the increased area followed by jilin province accounting for 28 12 of the total increased area the northward expansion of the 0 mm boundary mainly in inner mongolia and the eastward movement mainly in heilongjiang and jilin province fig 4 c then we analyzed the change of rzsm mwr and maize water shortage of all dry farmland pixels in the middle of the two boundaries fig 5 sm in the middle area the dry farmland between the two boundaries showed a significant downward trend while the mwr and water shortage showed the opposite trend fig 5 although the rzsm showed a significant downward trend in 50 years the change trend of mwr was not significant and led to the complex change of water shortage this led us to infer that the area suitable for maize cultivation decreased greatly from the 1960s to the 2000s due to the declining of sm 4 discussion against the background of climate change the environmental factors that affect crop growth were analyzed previous studies have evaluated the suitability distributions of maize at higher latitudes davis et al 1996 liu et al 2013 in this study the rzsm declined in all layers which is in agreement with previous findings moiwo et al 2012 in addition the northward extension and eastward migration in previous studies were consistent with the boundary migration in this study which also confirmed the reliability of the water shortage boundary yuan et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 4 1 influence of meteorological factors on sm the factors affecting sm include precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff in nec while the factors affecting evapotranspiration include air temperature vapor pressure deficit wind and solar radiation then we discussed the contribution of precipitation and mwr to sm in nec based on the 50 years data of each pixel the effects of precipitation and mwr on sm were analyzed and their contribution rates to sm change was quantified fig 6 showed that the contribution of precipitation change to the decrease of sm was positive and the mean value was 0 60 while the contribution factor of mwr on sm was only 0 14 the results showed that the change of precipitation contributed more to the decrease of soil moisture in order to find the reasons for the suitable cultivation area change for maize growth we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of precipitation and air temperature in nec during the maize growing season over a period of 50 years 1961 2010 and calculated the long term change rate figure 7 a showed the spatial distribution of the precipitation change rate from 1961 to 2010 in general the precipitation showed a decreasing trend but the dropping rate was weak and the trend was consistent with the results of previous studies fang et al 2018 yuan et al 2012 some areas north and southeast of nec showed a weak upward trend 0 0 5 mm year but the area was mainly forest in most areas of heilongjiang province and in the west and south of inner mongolia precipitation showed a downward trend overall the area of precipitation increase was less than the area of decrease and the increase rate was less than the decrease rate so the precipitation in nec decrease slightly fig 7 c d rainfall may be separated into components runoff infiltration interception rainfall that is caught on the plant surfaces and evapotranspiration et ali and mubarak 2017 in contrast the change rate of temperature showed a significant upward trend in nec fig 7 b the air temperature in nec increased by 0 013 0 038 c per year and increased by 0 65 1 9 c throughout the 50 years the western part showed a stronger warming trend than the eastern part in nec this phenomenon was in agreement with previous findings liu et al 2016 piao et al 2010 for the rain fed agriculture in nec the correlation coefficient between precipitation air temperature and sm was plotted in fig 8 the precipitation and sm were significantly positively correlated correlation coefficient between 0 38 and 0 81 indicated that precipitation directly affects sm fig 8 a although precipitation had a significant impact on sm there was no significant increase or decrease trend of precipitation in nec from 1961 to 2010 on the contrary for most of the study area air temperature and sm were negatively correlated changes in air temperature had a certain impact on crop transpiration and surface evaporation and these factors guide water vapor exchange air temperature evapotranspiration and sm have complex feedback effect the increased temperature and slightly decreased precipitation lead to the decline of sm and the result was consistent with previous research huang et al 2015 the correlation coefficient between air temperature and sm was mainly in 0 6 0 less than the correlation between precipitation and sm the correlation proved that sm as a parameter directly involved in the evaluation of maize growth and water shortage is a reliable factor because of the warming climate the lack of sm may become the main factor constraining agricultural production in the future in addition to the influence of air temperature on mwr vpd has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought induced plant mortality yuan et al 2019 based on meteorological data we analyzed the spatial distribution of vpd may september change rate in 50 years fig 9 the vpd change rate of each pixel in nec showed an upward trend and the slope gradually decreased from northeast to southwest fig 9 vpd gradually increased from east to west in nec fig 9 at the same time it can be found that the boundary in fig 4 was similar to the change of vpd previous studies have proved that the increasing vpd notably affects vegetation growth and vegetation productivity fletcher et al 2007 konings et al 2017 the changes of vpd and soil moisture provide the basis for the change of boundary in the results which proves the reliability of the research results 4 2 analysis of soil characteristics in nec soil characteristics affected soil moisture distribution and soil water holding capacity the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties caused errors in the simulation of soil moisture by the richard equation therefore we analyzed the correlation between soil texture and the change rate of rzsm fig 10 figure 10 showed that there is a good relationship between soil texture and the change rate of rzsm moreover soil texture affected the distribution of soil moisture areas with large spatial differences in soil properties resampling may lead to errors in the calculation of soil moisture previous studies proved that soil with a high percentage of sand are generally well drained clay and silt have good water holding ability patel et al 2021 in addition soil characteristics played an important role in the calculation of hydrological model such as the calculation of soil hydraulic parameters and soil tension furthermore in the dry farmland sm in the fourth layer showed a slight drop table 1 which was mainly due to the weak impact of precipitation and the sparse root of maize the main reason for this phenomenon was that grassland and saline soil in western jilin drag down the soil moisture level of the whole nec in addition to increased air temperature and slightly decreased precipitation sm will be influenced by surface leakage runoff and irrigation furthermore with the development of economic and increase of population increasingly large amounts of water are used for domestic and industry under the lead of the market groundwater is used to irrigate paddy fields in some regions of nec further decreasing sm liu et al 2005 and previous studies have proved that the groundwater in nec showed a downward trend from 2003 to 2014 liu et al 2021 yi et al 2016 in fact the rzsm 0 200 cm can not be fully utilized by maize but the results also play an important role in agricultural water resources management and the reality may be more severe considering the planting advantages of maize this study assumes that the dry farmland pixel is planted with maize based on this assumption if the pixel is planted with maize its suitability can be evaluated if the proportion of maize is small this study can provide planting suggestions on whether it is suitable for maize in this pixel furthermore all dry farmlands were assumed to be maize which led to errors in the evaluation of unsuitable areas we resampled the land cover and although the kriging method has advantages there is still an overestimation of maize area based on the biological characteristics of maize and the characteristics of agricultural climate resources reasonable adjustment of the maize cultivation layout can optimize water use the move of the boundary line fig 4 quantitatively describes the change of the suitable cultivation area and provides basis for the maize cultivation layout and food security in the context of climate warming 5 conclusions this research established a way to find the migration trend of the suitable cultivation areas for maize production using a multicriteria analysis integrated with land surface model penman monteith model and soil water balance theory in order to analyze the effect of declining sm on maize cultivation area this work calculated the change of the rzsm and mwr in 50 years the following conclusions were obtained 1 over the past 50 years 1961 2010 the area of maize water shortage increased approximately 66 250 km2 in nec and accounting for about one third of its dry farmland area and the main reason is the reduction of rzsm 2 the rzsm 0 200 cm depth decreased by 71 06 mm in 50 years for the entire nec and the severe decline was mainly located in the central of nec which was distributed from southwest to northeast through comparisons of time series soil moisture with precipitation and temperature the reason for the decrease of soil moisture may be attributed to slightly reduced precipitation and significantly increased air temperature based on our results the air temperature in nec increased by about 1 8 c in 50 years 1961 2010 although this study analyzed the effect of declining soil moisture on maize cultivation area more precision maize cultivation information and better land cover data were needed in the future with improved data accuracy the determination of suitable maize cultivation areas will be more precise the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

3475,soil moisture sm is the most direct and important source of crop water requirement the change in sm levels and the maize water requirement mwr will under the influence of climate change lead to changes in the areas that are suitable for maize cultivation in northeast china nec to quantitatively investigate these changes the study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in the sm and mwr in nec from 1961 to 2010 using global land data assimilation system gldas sm products meteorological data and land use data the following conclusions were reached 1 in the past 50 years there has been an obvious trend of soil drying in nec and the equivalent water thickness at the depth of 0 200 cm has decreased by 71 06 mm 12 78 which is more serious in agricultural areas 77 09 mm 13 86 2 from 1961 to 2010 the air temperature in nec increased by about 1 8 c in 50 years 3 the shortage in maize water calculated by sm and mwr showed that areas unsuitable for maize cultivation increased by approximately 66 250 km2 an area close to one third of the dry farmland area in nec and 4 the slightly decreased precipitation and increased air temperature were the major driving factors for the decrease in the suitable maize cultivation area if the maize was planted in unsuitable areas for a long time it may lead to excessive use of groundwater and surface water therefore these results provide a base for decision making regarding adjustments to the cultivation structure in nec keywords suitable cultivation area soil moisture gldas crop water requirement northeast china 1 introduction climate change and its impacts on soil moisture and crop production are major conditions that will have to be managed worldwide in the twenty first century hansen et al 2010 ortiz bobea et al 2021 climate change refers to the change of temperature and precipitation which leads to the change of the suitable areas for vegetation cultivation in china the air temperature increased by about 1 2 from 1960 to 2006 ding et al 2007 wei and chen 2009 with higher warming rates in the north than in the south the greatest rate of warming occurred in northeast china nec at a trend of 0 36 per decade fang et al 2018 piao et al 2010 such pronounced warming would enhance evapotranspiration and increase the shortage of crop water and some studies proved that increased temperature and decreased precipitation also have a negative impact on sm level and crop production butler and huybers 2015 lobell et al 2011 2013 rigden et al 2020 in china warming is believed to be harmful to rain fed crops and maize yields showed a negative response to rising temperatures during the period 1979 2002 lesk et al 2021 tao et al 2008 furthermore atmospheric vapor pressure deficit vpd is a critical variable in determining plant photosynthesis rising air temperature increase saturated water vapor pressure which will drive an increase in vpd if the actual atmospheric water vapor content does not increase by exactly the same amount as saturated vapor pressure yuan et al 2019 nec is home to the jilin maize belt one of the three famous golden maize belts in the world the maize cultivation area in nec exceed 1 3 of the total cultivation area in china meanwhile more than 90 of the maize in nec is rain fed meaning that precipitation is the main source of root water uptake national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 yang et al 2015 the soil organic content soil moisture and climatic conditions in nec have been highly suitable as maize growing regions over the past few decades however given the impact of climate change some regions may no longer be suitable several studies have investigated the distribution patterns of spring maize in nec based on the main climatic factors that affect crop growth i e temperature precipitation light and humidity index fraga et al 2016 mcdonald et al 2009 in these studies the climate indicators were classified using cluster analysis followed by weighted analysis to determine the climate suitable area zhao et al 2015 furthermore previous studies have only determined the suitability of maize cultivation by focusing mainly on the water balance theory allen et al 1998 referred that the irrigation water requirement basically represents the difference between effective rainfall and crop water requirements pang et al 2015 analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of water shortage based on effective precipitation and crop water requirement in sichuan province china in addition bokke and shoro 2020 determined the area of the water shortage and the amount of irrigation water required based on the water balance theory however calculating effective rainfall is a complex process because it requires consideration of runoff leakage and crop interception dastane 1974 delgoda et al 2015 liu et al 1998 the spatial heterogeneity of precipitation and the complexity of terrain may lead to errors in the calculation of effective rainfall therefore it is more direct to do this by evaluating root zone soil moisture rzsm and crop water requirements rzsm is the result of the combined effects of precipitation temperature evaporation and runoff and is vital for plant growth timm et al 2011 xu et al 2019 in this study there is a hypothesis that the soil moisture in 0 to 200 cm can be used to sustain crop growth we use the difference between rzsm and mwr to build an index and then evaluate whether the region is short of water and the change of water deficient region based on the index therefore we can quantitatively evaluate whether the region was still suitable for maize cultivation from 1961 to 2010 with the development of remote sensing observation and data assimilation technology rzsm and evapotranspiration can be obtained over a wide spatial range and long periods of time delgoda et al 2015 at present soil moisture profile information can be derived by modeling approaches using either climate models or land surface models lsm there are several such modeling systems and reanalysis products which can produce operational spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture data sets such as the north american land data assimilation system luo et al 2003 the gldas rodell et al 2004 the european center for medium range weather forecasts interim re analysis dee et al 2011 and the national aeronautics and space administration nasa modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications rienecker et al 2011 the gldas is a global high resolution offline terrestrial modeling system incorporating ground and satellite observations bi et al 2016 currently the remote sensing imageries of time series are able to monitor the crop evapotranspiration across the growing season calera et al 2017 mu et al 2007 developed a global remote sensing evapotranspiration algorithm based on modis and global meteorology data moreover based on the remote sensing data multispectral hyperspectral imageries regression relationship with vegetation indices was used to estimate crop yield and leaf area index karthikeyan et al 2020 based on the standard climatic data measured by meteorological station the crop water requirement can be calculated by reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient method and the method is called fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the method overcomes the shortcomings of the previous fao penman method and provides values that are more consistent with actual crop water use data worldwide allen et al 1998 shi et al 2008 the primary goal of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of declining rzsm on the areas suitable for maize cultivation in nec against the background of climate change and then rzsm and crop water requirements can be used to calculate shortage of crop water thereby facilitating the development of management strategies the remainder of this paper are organized as follows material and methods is introduced in section 2 section 3 provides a detailed description of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the rzsm mwr and water shortage details the mwr calculated for the entire growing season and evaluates whether the rzsm meet the requirements for maize growth it also describes the characteristics of the spatiotemporal variation of precipitation and air temperature finally section 4presents the results of the correlation analysis between water deficiency and precipitation air temperature and it provides a scientific basis for the selection of crop regions and agricultural water management in nec 2

evapotranspiration runoff and soil moisture products in gldas can be provided with good quality in nec chen et al 2013 li 2018 mo et al 2015 moiwo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 for comparative analysis with land cover dataset and crop water requirement a resampling to 25 km was performed on gldas soil moisture therefore gldas soil moisture data products were used for analysis in this study in addition the data was downloaded from https ldas gsfc nasa gov gldas the unit of the gldas product soil moisture precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff was kg m2 to facilitate subsequent analyses the units of the data were converted to depth content mm and volume content cm3 cm3 2 2 2 meteorological data meteorological data were obtained from the national meteorological information center http

water vapor pressure here we used data from 78 meteorological stations in nec from 1961 to 2010 the distribution of meteorological stations is shown in fig 1 the meteorological data are mainly used in the penman monteith equation to calculate reference crop evapotranspiration and subsequently crop water requirement 2 2 3 harmonized world soil database the world soil database harmonized world soil database version 1 1 hwsd has been constructed by the united nations food and agriculture organization fao and the vienna international institute of applied systems iiasa the data of china spatial resolution of 1 km were provided by the nanjing soil research institute in the second national land survey the dataset provides information on soil types as well as soil physical and chemical properties 0 100 cm shi et al 2004 he et al 2016 http westdc westgis ac cn use of a standardized structure allows linkage of the attribute data with gis to display or query the composition in terms of soil units and the characterization of selected soil parameters water storage capacity salinity textural class and granulometry the percentage of sand and clay in this dataset is mainly used for gldas soil moisture preprocess 2 2 4 land cover in this study the land cover dataset was used to determine the dry farmland area and the spatial resolution was 1 km the dataset was downloaded from the resource and environment science data center of the chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn in order to facilitate the analysis the land cover classes were grouped into main seven classes related to dry farmland paddy land forest land grassland urban land water body and unused land moreover after grouping into seven classes a resampling 25 km was performed on the land cover dataset in this way the spatial resolution of the land cover dataset was equal to gldas soil moisture in nec the dry farmland crops were mainly maize and soybean and the cultivation was intercropping zhang et al 2020 furthermore maize and soybean production in 2018 was 84 4 and 7 6 million tons respectively wang et al 2020 the total maize area accounts for 9 8 106 ha whereas the soybean area accounts 4 0 106 ha national bureau of statistics of china nbsc 2011 because of the larger proportion of the maize cultivation area than soybean in nec the 25 km dry farmland pixels were assumed as the maize cultivation area 2 3 methods the gldas soil moisture product used in this study were calculated from noah model the noah model has been used operationally in national centers for environmental prediction ncep models since 1996 and it continues to benefit from a steady progression of improvements in the noah model the prognostic equation for the volumetric soil moisture content θ is 1 θ t z d θ z k z f θ where both the soil diffusivity d and hydraulic conductivity k are function of θ and f θ represents source and sink i e precipitation and evaporation for soil moisture the soil water diffusivity d is given by d k ψ θ wherein ψ is the soil tension function k and ψ are computed by k ks θ θs 2b 3 and ψ ψs θ θs b where b is a curve fitting parameter ks ψs and b depend on soil type

and dudhia 2001 for the soil model to capture the daily weekly and seasonal evolution of soil moisture and also to mitigate the possible truncation error in discretization we use four soil layers and the thickness of each layer from the ground surface to the bottom are 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m respectively gldas soil moisture was derived based on noah model and the forcing data soil properties and vegetation data were used in the model many studies have proved that gldas products were reliable although the above equations were used in the noah model we did not perform the model instead we used the gldas soil moisture products 2 3 1 calculation of crop water requirement the crop coefficient approach was widely used for the calculation of crop water requirement and for areas with long precipitation or irrigation time intervals the single crop coefficient method was generally selected the single crop coefficient kc combines soil evaporation and crop transpiration making the calculation simple and accurate abdullah et al 2015 based on the evapotranspiration computed from the penman monteith equation crop water requirement was calculated by single crop coefficient method combined with reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 5 et c k c et 0 where etc represents the crop water requirement mm d 1 et0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration mm d 1 and kc represents the crop coefficient here we calculated mwr under the standard growth of maize based on meteorological data based on the fao 56 manual the crop coefficient of maize in the standard environment follows the principles an air humidity of 45 a wind speed of 2 m s an environment suitable for crop growth no pests good agricultural management and configuration the mwr was calculated based on the weather station in order to analyze the change of the planting area the mwr of the whole nec was generated by the kriging interpolation method kriging takes advantage of both distance and geometry and minimizes the difference between the estimate and the true value rossi et al 1994 there are 88 stations in northeast china considering the integrity of data and the uniformity of station spatial distribution we deleted the stations with incomplete data therefore we used data from 78 meteorological stations in nec from 1961 to 2010 2 3 1 1 calculation of reference evapotranspiration based on penman monteith equation the penman monteith equation was used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration for each meteorological station it was the standard method adopted by fao allen et al 1998 and widely used in different environmental and climatic conditions without local calibration and its accuracy has been confirmed by lysimeter in various climatic environments feng et al 2017 the penman monteith equation is as follows 6 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation w m 2 g is the soil heat flux density w m 2 which is negligible and for the vegetation growth area and long calculation time intervals the value can be set as 0 t is the daily average air temperature at the height of 2 m u 2 is the wind speed m s 1 at the height of 2 m es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea refers to the actual water vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the water vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the humidity calculation constant kpa e s e a is the vapor pressure deficit vpd vpd describes the difference between the water vapor pressure at saturation and the actual water vapor pressure for a given temperature is an important driver of atmospheric water demand for plants yuan et al 2019 2 3 1 2 crop coefficient localization based on climatic factors according to the fao 56 manual and the growth stage of maize in nec the crop coefficient was established combined with previously obtained data and the climatic characteristics the entire maize growing season was divided into four periods initial stage may growing stage june stable stage july and august and later stage september allen et al 1998 for different climatic conditions the crop coefficient of the stable period and the later period can be adjusted according to eq 7 7 k c kc tab 0 04 u 2 2 0 04 rh min 45 h 3 0 3 where kc represents the adjusted localization crop coefficient kc tab represents the reference value provided in fao 56 rh min represents the minimum relative humidity of air u 2 is the same as eq 6 and h represents crop height m 2 3 2 calculation of crop water shortage based on water balance principle based on previous experiments and model simulation the maize root depth in nec was mainly concentrated in 0 200 cm liu 2016 in this study there is an assumption that the soil moisture at the depth of 0 200 cm is available for crop growth in general the main factors affecting sm in nec are precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff and water exchange at the bottom of the root layer was simplified to zero therefore the farmland water balance equation is 8 δ w w 2 w 1 p e t r where p et and r represent the precipitation mm evapotranspiration mm and runoff mm respectively of the current month w1 is the soil moisture content in the initial state mm and the initial state of soil moisture is the state prior to the growing season w2 is the soil moisture content in the end state mm and δ w is the change in soil moisture over time mm the available soil moisture in the root zone was calculated according to eq 9 9 aw w 4 i 5 9 p i i 5 9 et i i 5 9 r i where aw is the available soil moisture in the root zone mm w4 is the soil moisture content prior to the growing season that is the initial state mm and subscript i is the corresponding month of the growing season which is from may to september in this study based on the four layers of sm we calculated the sum of the rzsm in the growing season and similarly the sum of mwr in the growing season was calculated each year from 1961 to 2010 next the difference between maize water requirement and 0 200 cm rzsm in the growing season was calculated and then the spatial distribution of maize water shortage in nec was obtained 10 ws et c a w where ws represents the water shortage during the growing season of maize in nec a positive ws value indicates a lack of soil moisture and a negative value indicates that there is a surplus of rzsm dastane 1974 pang et al 2015 the sm for the 0 200 cm layer from 1961 to 1970 were subtracted from the mwr pixel by pixel equation 10 and the water shortage of the maize growing season in the 1960 s were obtained fig 4 a the rzsm and mwr from 2001 to 2010 performed the same analysis method with 1960 s fig 4 b according to the spatial distribution of maize water shortage throughout the growing season the isoline were drawn the 0 mm line was reserved and other isoline were hidden 2 3 3 calculation of the change rate slope the change rate referred as s refers to the trend of a variable over time including soil moisture temperature and precipitation facilitating the establishment of a linear regression relationship between the variable and time pang et al 2015 based on this theory the change rate can be estimated as 11 s n i 1 n t i y i i 1 n t i i 1 n y i n i 1 n t i 2 i 1 n t i 2 where s is the linear regression slope of variable y that is the change rate slope n is the number of total years of y ti is the number of years from 1 to n and yi is the value of y in the i th year if s is a positive value the trend of variable y is increasing in this time period with negative values the opposite is the case 2 3 4 statistical analysis a statistical analysis provides a mechanism for making quantitative decisions about a process or processes the intent is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a conjecture or hypothesis about the process the conjecture is called the null hypothesis nayak and hazra 2011 in this study we set the significance level to 5 a test of significance is a formal procedure for comparing observed data with a claim also called a hypothesis the truth of which is being assessed the significance level is the level at which it can be accepted if a given event is statistically significant this is also termed as p value in the case when the p value is smaller than or equal to significance level α the null hypothesis should be rejected and an alternative hypothesis is supposed to be accepted or assumed as true 12 z x μ 0 σ n where z is the test statistic n is the sample size σ is the deviation in the population μ 0 is the population mean x is the sample mean based on the normal distribution the probability of test statistics z is calculated and compared with α to make a decision in order to evaluate the performance of the water content rzsm mwr and ws the pearson correlation r was computed the formula is listed below 13 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i is the i th value y i is the fitted value and the overbar denotes average 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal characteristics of rzsm during 1961 2010 to investigate the change characteristics of rzsm over time in nec the spatial average soil moisture at 0 10 10 40 40 100 and 100 200 cm were calculated for all 25 25 km pixels from 1961 to 2010 and the change rate of soil moisture in each layer was calculated based on eq 11 combined with the change rate and thickness of each layer the reduction of sm in the four layers over a period of 50 years were calculated table 1 table 1 showed that there was a downward trend of spatial average sm in each layer the decrease in sm was lowest in the top layer with the reduction of 2 23 mm table 1 the third layer showed the most dramatic decline in sm the sm of each layer in the dry farmland showed a downward trend over 50 years 1961 2010 and its decrease rate is greater than that of nec table 1 from 1961 to 2010 the soil moisture in four layers decreased by 71 06 mm in nec while dry farmland decreased by 77 09 mm table 1 four layers of gldas soil moisture products were summed to calculate the pixel by pixel rzsm change rate for the whole season may september and its spatial distribution was plotted fig 2 the change rate of rzsm from 1961 to 2010 mostly passed the significance test confidence interval is 95 fig 2 the change rate was mostly between 2 65 and 1 20 mm year mainly the central part of heilongjiang the central and western parts of jilin the western part of liaoning and the southern part of inner mongolia in addition most of the dry farmland crops were located in the middle of nec among them jilin province is the main area of maize cultivation and rzsm in the central and western part of jilin province shows a significant downward trend 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution of maize water requirement mwr during 1961 2010 trend analysis was performed for each pixel to obtain the change rate slope based on the method in section 3 2 fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of the change rate for mwr from northwest to southeast the change rate of mwr changed from positive to negative fig 3 an increased mwr was mainly found in non maize cultivation areas while decreases were observed in maize cultivation areas for the entire nec the mwr in inner mongolia showed an upward trend while that in liaoning province showed a downward trend the central and western parts of jilin province and the southwest part of heilongjiang province also showed a downward trend in jilin province the change rate mainly varied between 1 02 and 0 mm year 3 3 spatial distribution of maize water shortages in nec for the periods 1961 1970 and 2001 2010 the water shortage and the position of the 0 mm boundary in the maize cultivation area in these two decades were analyzed figure 4 showed that the red line represents the boundary line with a water shortage of 0 mm the western side of the red line represents the water shortage area and the eastern side represents the area without water shortage the water shortage area of maize in nec from 1961 to 1970 was mainly located in inner mongolia and liaoning province fig 4 a at the same time there were no water shortages at heilongjiang and jilin provinces in the 1960 s a comparison of fig 4 a and b illustrates that the boundary moved eastward and northward in fig 4 c the range of maize water shortage expanded from inner mongolia to the east gradually expending to western jilin southwestern heilongjiang and western liaoning province in addition the maximum water shortage in fig 4 a is 225 mm and the surplus moisture is 340 mm while the maximum water shortage in fig 4 b is 366 mm and the surplus moisture reduced to 272 mm in the entire nec the area of maize water shortage in the first decade of the 21st century increased significantly compared with the 1960 s furthermore some water scarce pixels appeared in the eastern part of heilongjiang province from 2001 to 2010 reflecting the spatial difference in rzsm based on the area of water deficit in maize growing season we calculated the water deficit area of maize growth in different periods 1961 1970 and 2001 2010 and the results were shown in table 2 the water shortage areas of the four provinces have increased with a total area of 66 250 km2 which is close to one third of the cultivation area of dry farmland in nec table 2 among them heilongjiang province accounted for 35 42 of the increased area followed by jilin province accounting for 28 12 of the total increased area the northward expansion of the 0 mm boundary mainly in inner mongolia and the eastward movement mainly in heilongjiang and jilin province fig 4 c then we analyzed the change of rzsm mwr and maize water shortage of all dry farmland pixels in the middle of the two boundaries fig 5 sm in the middle area the dry farmland between the two boundaries showed a significant downward trend while the mwr and water shortage showed the opposite trend fig 5 although the rzsm showed a significant downward trend in 50 years the change trend of mwr was not significant and led to the complex change of water shortage this led us to infer that the area suitable for maize cultivation decreased greatly from the 1960s to the 2000s due to the declining of sm 4 discussion against the background of climate change the environmental factors that affect crop growth were analyzed previous studies have evaluated the suitability distributions of maize at higher latitudes davis et al 1996 liu et al 2013 in this study the rzsm declined in all layers which is in agreement with previous findings moiwo et al 2012 in addition the northward extension and eastward migration in previous studies were consistent with the boundary migration in this study which also confirmed the reliability of the water shortage boundary yuan et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 4 1 influence of meteorological factors on sm the factors affecting sm include precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff in nec while the factors affecting evapotranspiration include air temperature vapor pressure deficit wind and solar radiation then we discussed the contribution of precipitation and mwr to sm in nec based on the 50 years data of each pixel the effects of precipitation and mwr on sm were analyzed and their contribution rates to sm change was quantified fig 6 showed that the contribution of precipitation change to the decrease of sm was positive and the mean value was 0 60 while the contribution factor of mwr on sm was only 0 14 the results showed that the change of precipitation contributed more to the decrease of soil moisture in order to find the reasons for the suitable cultivation area change for maize growth we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of precipitation and air temperature in nec during the maize growing season over a period of 50 years 1961 2010 and calculated the long term change rate figure 7 a showed the spatial distribution of the precipitation change rate from 1961 to 2010 in general the precipitation showed a decreasing trend but the dropping rate was weak and the trend was consistent with the results of previous studies fang et al 2018 yuan et al 2012 some areas north and southeast of nec showed a weak upward trend 0 0 5 mm year but the area was mainly forest in most areas of heilongjiang province and in the west and south of inner mongolia precipitation showed a downward trend overall the area of precipitation increase was less than the area of decrease and the increase rate was less than the decrease rate so the precipitation in nec decrease slightly fig 7 c d rainfall may be separated into components runoff infiltration interception rainfall that is caught on the plant surfaces and evapotranspiration et ali and mubarak 2017 in contrast the change rate of temperature showed a significant upward trend in nec fig 7 b the air temperature in nec increased by 0 013 0 038 c per year and increased by 0 65 1 9 c throughout the 50 years the western part showed a stronger warming trend than the eastern part in nec this phenomenon was in agreement with previous findings liu et al 2016 piao et al 2010 for the rain fed agriculture in nec the correlation coefficient between precipitation air temperature and sm was plotted in fig 8 the precipitation and sm were significantly positively correlated correlation coefficient between 0 38 and 0 81 indicated that precipitation directly affects sm fig 8 a although precipitation had a significant impact on sm there was no significant increase or decrease trend of precipitation in nec from 1961 to 2010 on the contrary for most of the study area air temperature and sm were negatively correlated changes in air temperature had a certain impact on crop transpiration and surface evaporation and these factors guide water vapor exchange air temperature evapotranspiration and sm have complex feedback effect the increased temperature and slightly decreased precipitation lead to the decline of sm and the result was consistent with previous research huang et al 2015 the correlation coefficient between air temperature and sm was mainly in 0 6 0 less than the correlation between precipitation and sm the correlation proved that sm as a parameter directly involved in the evaluation of maize growth and water shortage is a reliable factor because of the warming climate the lack of sm may become the main factor constraining agricultural production in the future in addition to the influence of air temperature on mwr vpd has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought induced plant mortality yuan et al 2019 based on meteorological data we analyzed the spatial distribution of vpd may september change rate in 50 years fig 9 the vpd change rate of each pixel in nec showed an upward trend and the slope gradually decreased from northeast to southwest fig 9 vpd gradually increased from east to west in nec fig 9 at the same time it can be found that the boundary in fig 4 was similar to the change of vpd previous studies have proved that the increasing vpd notably affects vegetation growth and vegetation productivity fletcher et al 2007 konings et al 2017 the changes of vpd and soil moisture provide the basis for the change of boundary in the results which proves the reliability of the research results 4 2 analysis of soil characteristics in nec soil characteristics affected soil moisture distribution and soil water holding capacity the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties caused errors in the simulation of soil moisture by the richard equation therefore we analyzed the correlation between soil texture and the change rate of rzsm fig 10 figure 10 showed that there is a good relationship between soil texture and the change rate of rzsm moreover soil texture affected the distribution of soil moisture areas with large spatial differences in soil properties resampling may lead to errors in the calculation of soil moisture previous studies proved that soil with a high percentage of sand are generally well drained clay and silt have good water holding ability patel et al 2021 in addition soil characteristics played an important role in the calculation of hydrological model such as the calculation of soil hydraulic parameters and soil tension furthermore in the dry farmland sm in the fourth layer showed a slight drop table 1 which was mainly due to the weak impact of precipitation and the sparse root of maize the main reason for this phenomenon was that grassland and saline soil in western jilin drag down the soil moisture level of the whole nec in addition to increased air temperature and slightly decreased precipitation sm will be influenced by surface leakage runoff and irrigation furthermore with the development of economic and increase of population increasingly large amounts of water are used for domestic and industry under the lead of the market groundwater is used to irrigate paddy fields in some regions of nec further decreasing sm liu et al 2005 and previous studies have proved that the groundwater in nec showed a downward trend from 2003 to 2014 liu et al 2021 yi et al 2016 in fact the rzsm 0 200 cm can not be fully utilized by maize but the results also play an important role in agricultural water resources management and the reality may be more severe considering the planting advantages of maize this study assumes that the dry farmland pixel is planted with maize based on this assumption if the pixel is planted with maize its suitability can be evaluated if the proportion of maize is small this study can provide planting suggestions on whether it is suitable for maize in this pixel furthermore all dry farmlands were assumed to be maize which led to errors in the evaluation of unsuitable areas we resampled the land cover and although the kriging method has advantages there is still an overestimation of maize area based on the biological characteristics of maize and the characteristics of agricultural climate resources reasonable adjustment of the maize cultivation layout can optimize water use the move of the boundary line fig 4 quantitatively describes the change of the suitable cultivation area and provides basis for the maize cultivation layout and food security in the context of climate warming 5 conclusions this research established a way to find the migration trend of the suitable cultivation areas for maize production using a multicriteria analysis integrated with land surface model penman monteith model and soil water balance theory in order to analyze the effect of declining sm on maize cultivation area this work calculated the change of the rzsm and mwr in 50 years the following conclusions were obtained 1 over the past 50 years 1961 2010 the area of maize water shortage increased approximately 66 250 km2 in nec and accounting for about one third of its dry farmland area and the main reason is the reduction of rzsm 2 the rzsm 0 200 cm depth decreased by 71 06 mm in 50 years for the entire nec and the severe decline was mainly located in the central of nec which was distributed from southwest to northeast through comparisons of time series soil moisture with precipitation and temperature the reason for the decrease of soil moisture may be attributed to slightly reduced precipitation and significantly increased air temperature based on our results the air temperature in nec increased by about 1 8 c in 50 years 1961 2010 although this study analyzed the effect of declining soil moisture on maize cultivation area more precision maize cultivation information and better land cover data were needed in the future with improved data accuracy the determination of suitable maize cultivation areas will be more precise the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

3476,the partitioning of bulk precipitation pr in forest ecosystems and its chemical composition depends on both meteorological factors such as precipitation amount and intensity evaporation rate and wind speed and stand structural factors such as stand density canopy structure bark texture and spatiotemporal distribution and density of foliage we analysed fluxes of water and element contained therein of a mature european beech fagus sylvatica l forest stand on sandy soils in northeastern germany we applied a radially symmetrical setup within a stem distance gradient to measure stand precipitation sp with its components of throughfall tf and stemflow sf as well as to measure soil moisture the chemical composition of the soil solution the soil chemistry and the fine root distribution the chemical analysis of the constituents covered the macroelements ca mg k na al fe mn si s p the cations and anions nh4 no3 cl so4 2 and a few heavy metals cu pb zn with an average pr of 620 mm a 1 the partitioning resulted in 79 tf 6 sf and 15 canopy interception tf volume increased with distance to stem during summer but decreased during winter clear spatial gradients with increasing concentrations from pr to different classes of tf as the distance from the trunk decreased to sf were observed for nearly all elements the contact of precipitation with leaves and the canopy structures alters the chemical composition of tf and sf by transferring elements from dry deposition or leaching of intracellular materials from the canopy and leads to the input of larger amounts of macroelements and heavy metals with the sp into the soil spatial patterns of canopy structures thus affect the spatial variation of tf and its constituents which also affects the spatial

integral part of environmental monitoring in forest ecosystems as it represents the water reaching the soil surface it results from bulk precipitation pr minus canopy interception and therefore depends on the interaction of many complex variables including meteorological conditions seasonality species specific traits and canopy structure levia and frost 2003 sadeghi et al 2020 partitioning pr first gained worldwide attention over a hundred years ago friesen and van stan 2019 hoppe 1896 horton 1919 in forests some precipitation reaches the soil through canopy gaps as free tf without contact to vegetation the other parts of precipitation with contact to the canopy may be intercepted building a short term water storage pool from which the three main water fluxes canopy interception tf and sf arise under certain conditions water can also be absorbed by leaves and bark aubrey 2020 berry et al 2019 van stan et al 2021 both meteorological factors and the canopy structure of forests affect rainfall partitioning meteorological factors include rainfall amount and intensity the evaporation rate and wind speed variables of forest canopy structure imply stand density species composition leaf traits spatial distribution and density of foliage branch architecture bark texture and the phenophase of deciduous trees andré et al 2011 sadeghi et al 2020 spatiotemporal variability of tf and its relation to forest structural variables have been reported for many tree species of various leaf traits and seasonal patterns chang and matzner 2000a kowalska et al 2016

loustau et al 1992 van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001a van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001b vrugt et al 2003 recent investigations documented correlations between sf volume and canopy structural traits like bark texture diameter at breast height dbh and the height to width ratio of the as an indicator of the canopy geometry jiang et al 2021 tonello et al 2021b van stan et al 2021 which might affect the tf due to lateral transport of precipitation under certain conditions epiphytes grow on tree trunks that are supplied with water and nutrients by the stemflow the presence of epiphytes can substantially enhance interception and increases the effect of forest canopy structure on the vertical and horizontal redistribution of precipitation by modifying water and nutrient availability spatially and temporally mendieta leiva et al 2020 in central europe european beech fagus sylvatica l as a deciduous tree species builds a particularly funnel shaped crown caused by steeply inclined branches and twigs in combination with a very smooth bark enhancing the lateral transport of precipitation water that is directed towards the centre of the tree andré et al 2011 frischbier and wagner 2015 schwärzel et al 2012 staelens et al 2006b voigt 1960b this lateral transport results in modified tf rates at the centre of the tree and distinct occurrence of sf european beech has one of the highest sf rates for incident rainfall for any tree species in central europe ranging from 3 to 25 germer et al 2012 in contrast for other tree species e g norway spruce precipitation water is often directed to the distant crown edge beier et al 1993 whelan et al 1998 or no stem distance gradient has been observed as for example in scots pine kowalska et al 2016 the precipitation moistens the leaves and the wooden plant parts which may affect the chemical composition of water by transferring elements from dry deposition facilitating the leaching of intracellular materials from the canopy or triggering the net uptake or release of solutes from insects and epiphytic organisms mcdowell et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 nutrient contents of pr tf and sf have to be analysed in order to estimate processes of the ecosystem internal nutrient cycle such as canopy leaching and absorption and to enable a calculation of the total deposition the spatial and temporal variability of tf solute inputs and its chemical constitution in forest ecosystems are the result of several meteorological and canopy structural factors levia and frost 2006 van stan et al 2020 the element concentrations of the air and the weather conditions as well as structures of the plant surfaces all determine the deposition process erisman and draaijers 2003 precipitation water can react with the surface of leaves and branches and lead to absorption and leaching especially in deciduous trees the alternation between leafy and leafless periods as well as accretion and resorption of elements in the canopy can additionally contribute to temporal variability because dry deposition and canopy exchange during the leafed period exceed those of the leafless period andré et al 2008 berger et al 2008 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006a staelens et al 2007 turpault et al 2021 voigt 1960a the spatial distribution of leaf area seems to be one of the most important impact factors determining the spatial variability of tf chemistry in a vertical analysis within beech and spruce canopies an increase in element concentrations could be attributed to dry deposition and canopy leaching adriaenssens et al 2012 the double funnelling effect of beech trees generates sf due to its canopy structure directing water and nutrients to the inner part of the heart shaped root system johnson and lehmann 2006 köstler et al 1968 schwärzel et al 2012 this may have a considerable effect on plant productivity and yield because of its capacity to direct nutrients to biogeochemically active areas van stan et al 2016 on the other hand high input rates of acids and heavy metals have also been reported this may have a major impact on soil chemistry at least in polluted regions chang and matzner 2000a falkengren grerup 1989 glavac et al 1985 jochheim 1985 jochheim and schäfer 1988 kazda and glatzel 1984 koenies 1985 which in turn could potentially inhibit fine root growth braun et al 2005 even if the deposition load has decreased over the last few decades türtscher et al 2017 those altered chemical soil conditions can in turn affect the turnover processes of the carbon and nitrogen budget of the soil chang and matzner 2000b schäfer 1988 as a result of soil acidification changes in ground vegetation were found around the stem base area with higher abundances of acidophytes andersson 1991 bruelheide and udelhoven 2005 falkengren grerup 1989 jochheim 1985 the spatial distribution of tf within a forest and of sf in the centre of the tree and the effects of these on soil hydrology may also affect the spatial fine root distribution using results from a sitka spruce forest ford and deans 1978 reported that the spatial pattern of tf paralleled the distribution of fine roots in the soil in a spatially stratified study of sf and tf a short term influence on soil moisture was detected but this disappeared after a few hours to a few days and reverted to soil moisture conditions determined by soil structure metzger et al 2017 the aim of this study was to identify the spatial patterns of water and element fluxes with sf and tf under canopies of a beech forest ecosystem and the impact of those spatial patterns on the soil hydrology and fine root distribution as well as on chemical soil conditions our study does not focus on the phenomenon of stemflow but rather on the spatial distribution of throughfall within a stem distance gradient while extreme weather related events can have a major impact on material flows in the short term these are put into perspective in the long term it was not the aim of this study to examine such individual events or to determine long term trends we hypothesised that 1 structural factors of beech trees cause lateral transport of precipitation resulting in high stemflow proportions and radially symmetrical distribution of throughfall 2 canopy structure of beech trees cause different levels of contact of precipitation with the plant surfaces and create stem distance gradients of element concentrations and fluxes 3 the spatial distribution of stemflow and throughfall volume and its mineral element content influences the distribution of fine roots and 4 the chemical constitution of stemflow and troughfall affects the soil chemistry 2 material and methods we investigated a mature european beech fagus sylvatica l forest

scots pine forest pinus sylvestris l so a mixed forest of beech and pine developed thereafter from 1985 to 1988 the upper pine layer of the mixed forest stand was cut stepwise and a pure beech forest developed the last improvement felling before starting investigations occurred in 1997 canopy coverage rose from 80 to 98 during the investigation period due to omitted thinning the herb layer of

profiles is given in table 1 and table 2 our study region is characterised by medium values for atmospheric input wellbrock et al 2005 according to a classification of deposition types that is typical for a wide range of forest sites from southwestern to northeastern germany meteorological data were sampled in the beech forest under the closed canopy and simultaneously by a weather station at an open field at a distance of 0 8 km from the beech stand for precipitation and solar radiation additional measurements of pr for gap filling were taken in a forest aisle at a distance of 0 5 km from the beech stand for the analysis of water and element fluxes within the forest stand we applied a radially symmetrical setup to determine soil moisture stemflow and throughfall soil solution and soil chemistry fig 2 the stem and canopy structural traits of the sampled trees were listed intable 3 tf was collected weekly using 15 deposition samplers each with a sampling area of 314 cm2 rs200 ums munich at 2 m height the volume of the samples was weighed for calculation of water and element fluxes twelve of these samplers were arranged at different stem distances 0 5 1 5 2 5 m under the canopy of four trees and three additional samplers were arranged in canopy gaps sf was collected using collars constructed of polyurethane foam where the contact surfaces with water were lined with paraffin to ensure chemically inert behaviour sf volume was measured continuously at one stem tree 49 with a tipping bucket rain gauge as well as from four trees weekly by sampling the water in barrels and measuring the filling height after collection of samples all samplers were brushed and cleaned with distilled water for the next collection period all trees with sf and tf measurements belonged to the co dominant tree layer the sf in mm was calculated by multiplying the sf volume per tree l by the number of trees per ha ha 1 divided by 10 000 to convert the related area from ha to m2 to calculate the shares of area of infiltrating sp the following assumptions were made the samplers at the distances 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m from the stem centre were assumed to represent the area between the stem centre to 1 m 1 to 2 m and 2 to 3 5 m respectively representing a share of 6 7 20 4 and 56 0 of the forest area the deposition sampler under the canopy gaps represented the remaining 16 9 to calculate the water flux including element fluxes with tf for the entire forest stand the flux of each stem distance category was area weighted to relate sf to an area we distinguish sff which is related to the entire forest area from sfi which is related to an assumed infiltrating area of 0 3 m2 per tree very close to the stem with 216 trees ha 1 this amounts to 64 8 m2 ha 1 or 0 648 of the total forest area the sf infiltration area partly overlaps with the innermost circle of the tf infiltration area analysis of soil water content took place hourly at different distances to the stem 0 5 1 5 2 5 m of one stem at 0 2 0 7 2 5 and 5 0 m soil depths using ml2 thetaprobes delta t devices ltd cambridge uk soil solutions were sampled using borosilicate suction probes ecotech bonn gmbh from 0 2 0 7 2 5 and 5 0 m soil depths at different distances from two stems 0 5 1 5 2 5 m two replicates per tree depth and distance the samples were collected by applying a suction of 30 kpa at 0 2 and 0 7 cm and 35 kpa at 2 5 m for the 0 2 m soil depth the soil solution was sampled in glass bottles for soil depths 0 2 m the soil solutions were stored within the shafts of the suction probes soil solutions were collected fortnightly and the four samples per soil depth and stem distance were bulked for chemical analysis when recording the spatial rooting intensity we deviated from the general sampling design of the radial symmetric set up in contrast root penetration was examined along a 3 8 m long and 1 8 m deep wall of a soil pit lachmann 2002 the profile wall was roughened and divided into a grid of 10x10 cm squares the number of visible root tips differentiated into coarse and fine roots diameter 2 mm 2 mm was counted for each of these 684 squares fine root density as a number of fine root tips per dm2 was averaged for four soil layers 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 1 2 m and 1 2 1 8 m the soil pit was located in the influence area of three beech trees for which the horizontal distance to each root examination plot was determined the diameter at breast height dbh of these beech trees was 48 7 cm 36 3 cm and 21 3 cm to quantify the overall influence of these three trees on the root examination point the tree distances were averaged weighted with the tree dimension this approach assumes that the contribution that a tree makes to the local rooting intensity is proportional to the tree dimension and inversely proportional to the tree distance according to hornschuch 2009 the basal area ba of the trees at a height of 1 30 m was used as an expression of the tree dimension and the weighted horizontal tree distance dwm for each root examination point was calculated as follows d wm d 1 ba 1 d 2 ba 2 d 3 ba 3 ba 1 ba 2 ba 3 pr tf sf and soil solution were analysed for concentrations of macroelements and heavy metals at the central ecological laboratory of the eberswalde university for sustainable development water samples of pr tf sf and soil solution were collected largely according to the methods of the icp forests manual clarke et al 2021 nieminen et al 2016 water samples were filtered black band filter in the field before transport to laboratory and stored at 18 c until analysis for the chemical analysis the samples were thawed and membrane filtrated 0 45 µm the preparation and chemical analysis of the water samples were conducted according to the rules of the icp forests manual könig et al 2005 the chemical analysis of ca mg k na al fe mn si s p cu pb and zn was conducted by applying atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes ions of nh4 no3 cl so4 2 were analysed using ion chromatography alkalinity was determined by titration and conductivity by conductometry the ph value was measured using a ph electrode to calculate the element fluxes with precipitation it was necessary to fill measurement gaps of water fluxes or element concentrations gaps in tf and sf measurements were filled using data from continuously sampled tf of a rain gauge or as a substitute the pr of weather stations gaps in the time series of element concentration were filled using the nearest neighbour analysis procedure knn of ibm spss 27 using the amount of precipitation the month and the year as covariates in contrast to calculate and statistically test temporal and spatial distribution of element concentrations we did not fill the gaps and used only measured samples the total deposition of macroelements was calculated following the model described in draaijers and erisman 1995 for more information on the water and macroelement budget of the experimental site we refer to our previous papers jochheim et al 2007 sommer et al 2013 for statistical analyses of seasonal differences we grouped the monthly analysed water samples of all years into four seasons spring months 3 5 summer 6 8 autumn 9 11 and winter 12 2 statistical tests to determine the significance of element concentrations as well as water and element fluxes were conducted using non parametric tests nptests of ibm spss 27 we employed the kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 to compare parameter differences between seasons to test the significance of related samples e g the differences of element concentrations between different distances from the stem we applied friedman s two way analysis of variance by ranks for related samples friedman 1937 friedman 1939 3 results 3 1 precipitation and spatial pattern of stand precipitation pr over the investigation period averaged 620 mm a 1 ranging between 415 mma 1 in 2018 and 849 mm a 1 in 2007 a plurality of 35 fell during the summer months followed by 24 in winter 23 in autumn and finally 18 in spring fig 3 tf and sf contributed 489 and 35 mma 1 to sp which is 79 and 6 of pr respectively canopy interception as the difference between pr and sp was calculated to be 95 mm a 1 or 15 of pr the seasonal pattern of tf was similar to pr with the highest rates in summer and the lowest rates in spring at all trunk distances in contrast the highest sf rates see table 4 were found in winter with 7 6 of total pr followed by summer and the lowest in autumn and spring percentages of sf rates ranged between 7 6 in winter and 4 8 in summer tf volume increased with distance from the stem during the summer months fig 4 table 4 at the closest distance 0 5 m from the trunk tf was on average 15 lower compared to the highest distance under a canopy gap at distances of 1 5 and 2 5 m the difference decreased to 10 and 6 respectively we observed a contrasting gradient during the winter months where tf decreased with distance from the trunk at a distance of 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m tf was 19 16 12 higher than under the canopy gap only weak or non significant trends in spatial distribution of tf were detected during spring and autumn see supplement 2 3 2 chemical conditions of precipitation and stand precipitation water 3 2 1 element concentrations clear spatial gradients with increasing concentrations from pr to tf to sf emerged for nearly all elements the trends of increasing enrichment factors ef were also clear across the four different tf classes at different stem distances as the distance from the trunk decreased fig 5 shows k mg n nh4 and na concentrations averaged over the whole investigation period as examples the elements differed in their enrichment factors which were calculated as the concentration in the sp fractions related to the concentration in pr table 5 elements with the highest ef were mn k mg and p followed by a group of elements with moderate ef cl s h ca no3 cu na si al the lowest ef were found for fe n nh4 zn and pb these relations held for nearly all seasons with only a few exceptions see supplement 1 for p n nh4 n no3 and zn the concentrations in sf water were lower during wintertime and in some cases also during spring mg ca mn and p showed similar spatial patterns but in contrast the concentrations in sf fell in summer and autumn below those of tf in the innermost circle mean ph values in pr were 5 87 0 69 those in tf range were between 5 77 and 5 86 with a very low stem distance gradient only the sf had marginally but significantly lower ph values of 5 71 the observations on conductivity and alkalinity complete the picture as higher ion concentrations cause high conductivity and alkalinity 3 2 2 element fluxes chemical elements reacted differently within the types of sp compared to pr element flux is the result of the concentrations of a given element multiplied by the water flux which is reduced in tf compared to pr as a result the enrichment factors of element fluxes are usually lower than those of element concentrations the fluxes of some elements mn k p mg si are considerably higher in sp than in pr table 6 table 7 examples in fig 6 these elements show mean efsp of 2 a second group of elements cl ca s cu na n no3 h al with efsp values between 1 2 and 2 carry moderately higher masses in tf and a third group of elements fe n nh4 zn pb transport similar or even lower quantities with sp under canopy gaps than with pr most element fluxes showed a strong gradient within the different tf infiltrating areas from the canopy gap towards the stem table 6 this could be found for all seasons see supplement 2 exceptions were h n nh4 and n no3 where significant differences could only be validated between tfgap and the other tf infiltrating areas but not between 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m stem distance the fluxes at tf0 5m are about twice as much as those at tfgap table 6 however for some elements na h n nh4 n no3 p pb the ratio tf0 5m to tfgap was lower than 1 7 for elements with concentrations that increased as the distance from the trunk decreased the proportions in the fluxes increased relative to the percentage of the area around the tree table 7 thus 8 5 of the k from the tf entered the innermost circle of 1 m radius even though the share of the area was only 6 7 element fluxes with stemflow contributed between 5 and 15 to total sp if the sf of e g k with 2 34 kg ha 1 a 1 is examined in light of the small infiltration area of 0 3 m2 per tree it results in a very intense k input of 361 kg ha 1 a 1 3 3 soil hydrology to evaluate the effect of the spatial distribution of tf and sf on soil water contents we assessed the seasonal dynamics of measured soil moisture within a stem distance gradient to this end we calculated the monthly averages of soil water content swc within every hydrological year 1 nov 31 oct we compared the annual differences between the minimum and maximum values of these monthly mean swc within the stem distance gradient the results from the 0 2 m soil depth show lower annual swc dynamics close to the stem than those at 1 5 m and 2 5 m distances fig 7 in contrast in deeper soil layers 0 7 m depth we found higher annual swc dynamics close to the stem than farther from it 3 4 fine roots the dependence of the rooting intensity number of fine root tips per dm2 on the profile wall in the soil depths 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 1 2 m and 1 2 1 8 m on the stem distance was initially examined individually for the three beech trees in the vicinity of the soil pit linear regression between the tree distance and the fine root sum only leads to low coefficients of determination and are usually not significant the specific relationship between the tree distance and the fine root density on the other hand can be well fitted with a quadratic function maximum coefficient of determination 0 81 with the exception of the soil depth 1 2 1 8 m the relationships between rooting intensity and the respective distance to the three trees are significant at a depth of 1 2 1 8 m there are no significant relationships for any of the trees the different dependencies of fine root density on the stem distance in the individual soil depths can also be seen when the mean distance of all trees weighted with the trees basal area are used instance of the distance to the single trees fig 8 in the upper soil depth 0 0 3 m a maximum of fine root density is reached on average at a distance of about 2 5 m from the stem bases fine root density decreases towards the stem base as well as towards the canopy gap the opposite is the case at a depth of 0 3 0 6 m and with a tendency also at 0 6 1 2 m here the rooting intensity increases sharply towards the stem base on the one hand and also from a stem distance 3 m on the other the latter is also the case at a depth of 0 6 1 2 m in the lowest soil depth investigated 1 2 1 8 m there is no significant dependence of fine root density on the stem distance 3 5 chemical soil conditions the elements reaching the soil with sp are subject to reactions with plant roots and the soil matrix during transport through the soil to estimate the impact of the sp chemistry on soil solution we evaluated the soil solution of topsoil regarding their stem distance gradient fig 9 table 8 data for the soil solution chemistry of deeper soil depths within the stem distance gradient are given in the supplement 3 some elements k p n nh4 n no3 alkalinity showed drastically factor 0 2 0 6 lower concentrations in 0 2 m soil solution compared to tf mn cu pb and conductivity remained almost unchanged factor 1 0 1 3 whereas others mg ca h cl s so4 showed slightly higher factor 1 4 2 7 moderately higher na fe zn factors 3 5 or extremely higher concentrations al si factors 35 and 86 compared to tf we distinguished four groups of elements within the stem distance gradient at 0 2 m soil depth the first group na mg cl doc alkalinity showed a minimum close to the stem and a maximum distant from the stem fig 9 table 8 the second group ca al si zn conductivity had a minimum proximal to the stem but a maximum in the middle of the canopy at 1 5 m stem distance the third group mn k showed a minimum at 2 5 m distance and increased as it approached the stem note that for k the median decreased as stem distance increased fig 9 whereas the mean values of k showed a maximum at 1 5 m stem distance due to a large number of extreme values table 8 for the element concentrations in the fourth group no significant differences between the three stem distances were found the trends in the stem distance gradient existed during all seasons supplement 3 statistically significant correlations between element concentrations in stemflow and throughfall on one hand and those in the soil solution of topsoil at the corresponding stem distance on the other with similar concentration ranges were found for cl so4 mn and zn the coefficients of determination r2 ranged between 0 054 and 0 180 and were usually highest for cl and mn between sf or tf0 5m and soil solution at 50 cm stem distance p 0 001 for so4 and zn between sf and soil solution p 0 001 and for so4 and zn between tf0 5m and soil solution p 0 01 parallel seasonal dynamics with maximum concentrations in winter and minimum concentrations in summer were observed for cl mn and zn in both the stand precipitation and the soil solution the correlations for so4 between sf or tf and soil solution is based on other seasonal dynamics in contrast to the soil solution the chemical conditions of the soil matrix such as ph cation exchange capacity and base saturation did not show clear trends across the stem distance gradient data not shown the spatial variation within the stem distance gradient corresponded to the spatial variation of the entire sample plot 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of stand precipitation the results of our study have confirmed many investigations concerning the partitioning of precipitation by european beech with its contributions to canopy interception tf and sf particularly under meteorological conditions comparable to our investigations meesenburg et al 2009 müller 2019 peck and mayer 1996 russ et al 2016 staelens et al 2006b staelens et al 2008 our study mainly focused on the spatial variability of sp within a stem distance gradient under the canopy of a beech stand while the importance of the sf of beech trees is well known from many studies far fewer studies on the spatial variability of tf exist to our surprise our results showed spatial gradients of tf volume but they differed depending on the season while in summer the tf near the trunk was 15 lower than under the crown gap in winter it was 19 higher near the trunk fig 4 table 4 in this context it should be noted that lateral shifts of sp caused by wind hörmann et al 1996 as well as by tree swaying can blur the definition of the measurement positions of tf this explains why precipitation in gaps has at least partial contact with leaves before it reaches the ground and does not equal that of pr in the transitional phases of spring and autumn the gradients were not or only slightly pronounced table 4 it can be assumed that the canopy parts close to the trunk have a higher canopy density with a higher leaf area index lai adriaenssens et al 2012 fleck 2001 and higher canopy interception than those at the crown edge frischbier et al 2019 staelens et al 2006b staelens et al 2008 the distribution of tf has even been proposed as a method to calculate the spatial distribution of lai frischbier et al 2019 our results for stem distance as a determining variable for tf volume during the summer months correspond with those of other investigations frischbier and wagner 2015 herwitz 1987 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006b which calculated lateral flow vis à vis the relative crown radius position of the measurement points and observed that the highest discharge amounts were at positions below the inner part of the beech crown during the winter months however this gradient reverses the lack of foliage and the associated canopy interception are two possible causes what remains is the funnel effect caused by the crown shape of the beech with its distal obliquely upward pointing branches frischbier and wagner 2015 schwärzel et al 2012 this effect causes precipitation water to be directed towards the centre of the trunk herwitz 1986 levia and frost 2006 in extreme cases water can then be passed on to the trunk forming the distinctive sf of the beech alternatively it can drip off before reaching the trunk on rough surfaces of branches and twigs already in the canopy which leads to a tf that increases as distance to the stem decreases in the leafless period this effect outweighs the more pronounced canopy interception close to the trunk which can only take place on branches and twigs in winter another process is precipitation transported horizontally by wind and broken by the branch structures or the combing out of cloud and fog droplets burkard et al 2003 erisman and draaijers 2003 gautam et al 2017 katata 2014 köhler et al 2015 this also takes place mainly in the leafless period due to weather conditions precipitation here is also transported towards the crown centre and trunk a similar variation of tf according to foliage condition was demonstrated by staelens et al 2006b in a beech forest where tf during the growing season was negatively correlated with canopy cover and branch cover whereas branch cover did not correlate during defoliated periods the proportion of sf in our study was quantified between 4 8 in summer and 7 6 in winter this is at the lower end of what has been found in other studies of european beech exhibiting between 10 and 16 for three german beech forest sites meesenburg et al 2009 and between 3 and 25 in a pan european literature review germer et al 2012 and within a global synthesis over several biomes and climates sadeghi et al 2020 though the intensity of individual events is probably more decisive than the annual sums of precipitation berger et al 2008 the sf proportion also corresponds to the picture of other studies with regard to the canopy height width relation sadeghi et al 2020 which was determined here at 1 9 table 3 the relatively low pr of 620 mm a 1 have been suspected as possible causes for low sf fractions voss et al 2016 since the bark of sampled trees was classified as smooth to very smooth in our investigation table 3 this is not a possible further cause for the low sf shares indeed an evaluation with our data set yielded a positive correlation between pr during summer and the share of sf mean pr 71 6 mm a 1 mean sf 4 85 sf 0 0279 pr 1 97 r2 0 555 investigations in regions with similarly low annual precipitation came to comparable sf proportions chang and matzner 2000a russ et al 2017 the seasonal differences found here are also consistent with other studies levia and germer 2015 sf averaging 6 7 of the total sp infiltrates a small not exactly definable area the infiltration area of sf was reported to vary over a wide range from 0 04 to 11 8 m2 tree 1 and depends on several factors such as tree anatomy and dimension precipitation intensity and duration hydraulic conductivity and slope inclination herwitz 1986 van stan and allen 2020 for european beech this area has been estimated to range from 0 02 m2 tischer et al 2020a to 0 25 m2 schwärzel et al 2012 to 1 m2 chang and matzner 2000a jochheim and schäfer 1988 assuming that sf infiltrates into the soil close to the trunk into macropores caused by coarse roots schwärzel et al 2012 an infiltration area of the order of the basal area of each tree plus the stem base swelling could be estimated at 0 3 m2 per tree the innermost circle with a radius of 1 m around the trunk covering 7 of the forest area accounts for 6 2 of the total sp while the dominant tf fraction 52 6 infiltrates 56 of the annular area between 2 and 3 5 m stem distance thus the importance of the areas close to the trunk for the water balance of the entire stand is of subordinate importance although clear gradients of tf volumes in the stem distance gradient have been found however smaller surface units such as the sf infiltration area and the inner ring around the trunk become more important for other research if the element fluxes are considered 4 2 the chemical composition of precipitation and stand precipitation the second aspect concerned the question of whether the reaction of sp with the leaves the bark of twigs and branches of the canopy as well as the stem would be reflected in a stem distance gradient of concentrations and fluxes of elements the pronounced accumulation of many elements in sf and their effects on soil chemical conditions have been widely documented germer et al 2012 levia and frost 2003 levia and germer 2015 but few studies have addressed the question of concentration gradients in tf in stem distance gradients within forests our findings support the presence and range of enrichment factors for nearly all elements in the tf and especially in the sf compared to pr table 5 as described in other studies adriaenssens et al 2012 andré et al 2008 berger et al 2008 chang and matzner 2000a levia et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 meesenburg et al 2009 nihlgård 1970 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006a b 2007 2008 talkner et al 2010 turpault et al 2021 our investigation confirmed the gradations of enrichment factors found in these publicationsfor macroelements table 5 with mn k and mg having the highest enrichment factors the high concentrations of these elements in the sf and tf were mainly caused by canopy leaching while the elements with lower enrichment factors are increasingly derived from dry deposition the element concentrations determined here in precipitation and throughfall do not deviate fundamentally from the wide concentration ranges determined in tropical rainforests zimmermann et al 2007 but were considerably lower than in various forests in the cerrado brasil which is located in close proximity to industrial areas surrounded by eucalyptus sp and sugarcane plantations with the latter being regularly burned tonello et al 2021a comparing leaching of nutrients from deciduous tree species to those from coniferous tree species provides an inconsistent picture aubrey 2020 canopy leaching found to be higher for deciduous trees than for coniferous adriaenssens et al 2012 whereas others found the opposite result berger et al 2008 evergreen coniferous tree species seem to be more affected by dry deposited pollutants than deciduous trees which only offer a smaller receptor surface over the winter de schrijver et al 2007 but even within the four different classes of tf increasing concentrations were detected for most elements since the stem was approximated table 5 exceptions with no or only weakly pronounced spatial gradients were the elements h nh4 no3 and pb in the sf element concentrations once again increased significantly compared to the tf with the exception of zn table 5 the results support similar findings on varying nutrient fluxes in the stem distance gradient adriaenssens et al 2012 in contrast to a study by chang and matzner 2000a which found only small concentration differences between standard and proximal tf obviously the different contact intensity of the precipitation water with the leaves twigs and branches caused the distribution patterns of element concentrations and fluxes in sp in the stem distance gradient due to the presumably higher lai and stem area index sai at the centre of the trees fleck 2001 or the higher coverage of the ground area close to the trunk with leafy crown parts compared to more distant areas there are more pronounced deposition and canopy leaching processes which have been detected in both horizontal and vertical concentration gradients under the canopy of beech trees adriaenssens et al 2012 staelens et al 2006a found that the spatial heterogeneity of ion deposition under beech trees was significantly affected by leaves in the growing period and by branches in non foliated conditions combining the element concentrations with the water flux enabled to obtain gradients of the element fluxes however these were mainly determined by the element concentration since the mean annual water fluxes varied little table 6 this led to higher element fluxes in the proximal stem area many physiological processes related to the macroelement and microelement budgets of trees such as deposition foliar absorption foliar leaching accretion and resorption leaf growth senescence and litterfall occur only or predominantly at certain times of the year turpault et al 2021 and were responsible for the seasonal variation of nutrients in different biomass pools of the canopy in addition for certain elements interactions are expected to occur predominantly with leaves or with the bark of twigs branches and stems furthermore effects by canopy epiphytes have also been observed mendieta leiva et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 but they play a minor role in the forest stand we studied therefore we assume that seasonal effects of element fluxes would occur in the stem distance gradient but even if the gradients of water fluxes during summer showed a trend opposite to the element concentration gradients e g lower tf volume table 4 but higher element concentration in the centre of the tree table 5 supplement 1 the element concentration gradients overcompensated the oppositely directed water flux gradients this means that for all seasons the resulting element flux gradients remained similar to the annual averages for nearly all elements the only exception were the mn fluxes in summer where tf concentrations and fluxes were lower at 0 5 m than at 2 5 m stem distance supplement 1 for the elements fe k si al s cl cu and mn the enrichment factors in sf were 1 5 times higher than in tf table 5 this could indicate that these elements leached from the bark more intensively than from the leaves when they came into contact with the biomass of the tree crowns which might happen in different seasons however those seasonal aspects were not evaluated in this study 4 3 soil hydrology and fine root distribution the third aspect addressed the question of whether any hydrological gradients found in sp were also reflected in soil hydrology our results show that during the summer soil moisture at depths of 0 2 m decreased close to the stem to a lesser extent than those more distant from the stem in contrast at soil depths of 0 7 m and below soil moisture showed greater dynamics near the trunk than farther from it fig 7 for interpretation we have to take into account two impact factors first tf volume in summer is about 10 15 lower near the trunk than farther from the trunk on the other hand soil water content might be affected by additional water input by sf into the small area close to the stem which partly compensates for lower tf rates in a spatially stratified study of sf and tf a short term influence on soil moisture was detected but this disappeared after a few hours to a few days and soil moisture conditions returned to those determined by soil structure metzger et al 2017 secondly our results could be explained by reduced water uptake from 0 2 m soil depth near the trunk than farther from it but conversely higher water uptake from deeper soil layers close to the trunk than those farther away indeed our results on fine root distribution support the spatial pattern in soil moisture dynamics at depths of 0 0 3 m our soils exhibited a maximum fine root density of about 2 5 m from the stems and decreased as the distance to the stem increased or decreased fig 8 on the other hand at soil depths of 0 3 0 6 m minimum fine root density was observed at about 2 5 m distance which increased closer to the stem and further away from it this different root distribution in the soil according to soil depth was not expected since beech is considered a tree species with a heart shaped root system johnson and lehmann 2006 köstler et al 1968 schwärzel et al 2012 in which denser rooting in the centre of the trunk was generally expected however we have to note that our study did not analyse root density 1 m to the stem and that our results are only based on a spatial gradient through the root system of three trees the effects of high acidity and heavy metal contamination on the root system due to deposition with the sf are probably more likely to be expected in the closer infiltration area a horizontal and vertical fine root distribution in a stem distance gradient similar to our results was found in an acidic soil beech stand in solling region friedrich 1992 soil organic matter originating from root turnover as indicated by suberin derived lipids showed a spatial pattern for a beech stand similar to our results on fine root distribution spielvogel et al 2014 in the hainich national park in germany one study investigated maximum fine root biomass at approximately 3 m stem distance jurasinski et al 2012 another study of a mixed beech oak stand in the lüneburg heath found a fine root biomass of beech that increased with distance from the stem up to 3 5 m leuschner et al 2001 at other sites root abundance in the area close to the trunk was more common e g in the northeastern german lowlands hornschuch 2009 hornschuch and riek 2007 or in a mixed deciduous forest stand hölscher et al 2002 still others found no correlation between fine root biomass and distance from the stem hertel 1999 but rather a clustered root distribution depending on the proximity to coarse roots or nutrient supply bakker et al 2008 schmid and kazda 2002 our results therefore confirm earlier observations that spatial fine root distribution depends on spatial pattern of tf ford and deans 1978 finally it should be noted that there is no significant dependence of the rooting intensity on the stem distance in the lowest depth investigated 120 180 cm here the individual occurrence of better soil layers possible clay and lime lenses could have a differentiating effect on the formation of higher root densities 4 4 chemical soil condition the fourth aspect dealt with the question of whether any stem distance gradient found in the chemical composition of the sp was also reflected in the soil in the solid soil phase our investigations found no evidence of this effect with regard to soil ph and base saturation this confirms the results by metzger et al 2021 from a mixed european beech forest who also found no ph differences and attributed this to low air pollution our study site is also located in an area with relatively low atmospheric deposition wellbrock et al 2005 as indicated by similar ph values in sf tf and pr supplement 1 additionally there are lime components in the subsoil of our stand that are accessible to the roots so that basic cations can be transferred to the topsoil via the base pump effect with the litterfall vejre and hoppe 1998 consequently periodically observed acid inputs from sf and tf can probably still be buffered by exchangeable basic cations from the soil however the closest stem distance we studied in this regard was 1 m and thus farther away than is usual in other investigations on sf impact on soil chemistry falkengren grerup 1989 gersper and holowaychuk 1971 jochheim 1985 kazda and glatzel 1984 levia and germer 2015 furthermore it must be taken into account that many observations including some of those cited above regarding the strong acidifying effects of stemflow on soil chemical conditions originate from areas and or decades with a higher atmospheric acid deposition a sf infiltration area of 0 3 m2 per tree would result assuming a circular area with a radius of 0 31 m from the centre of the trunk only in the case of slopes impermeable substrate or very heavy precipitation events can larger sf influence areas be expected van stan and allen 2020 which was not the case for our study site in the soil solution on the other hand we found effects in the stem distance gradient for a number of elements that could be related to the input from sf and tf the higher k and mn concentrations of the near trunk or middle crown area and the lowest concentrations at the crown edge table 8 corresponded to those in sf and tf within the stem distance gradient table 5 however the lower na mg and cl concentrations of the soil solution near the stem contrast with the stem distance gradients of tf higher k and lower na mg and cl concentrations close to the stem were also found by chang and matzner 2000a although their study investigated different stem distances and soil depths they interpreted the na and cl concentrations increasing with stem distance with a distal increase in evapotranspiration and the associated thickening effect of soil solution which might also be true in our investigation our results on the horizontal root distribution with maximum fine root density at 2 5 m from the trunk fig 8 at 0 to 0 3 m soil depth but closer to the trunk at 0 3 to 0 6 m soil depth support this assumption the significant correlations between the element concentrations in sf and tf and the soil solutions which were also shown in parallel seasonal changes also support this observation with cl mn s and zn only those elements showed this behaviour whose concentrations in the soil are primarily determined by input with precipitation water and less by soil chemical processes since the ph values of sf and tf did not indicate acid inputs into the soil no soil chemical reactions such as increased al concentrations in the soil solution could be observed soil solution is subject to both spatial and temporal variations of the influencing factors various processes with their own dynamics take place in the soil such as decomposition of litter and som soil chemical reactions and uptake of water and nutrients by roots short term effects of sp and tf might also have an impact on soil solution at the beginning of a precipitation event dry deposited pollutants are washed away and or leaf contents are leached out with increasing duration the concentrations in sf and tf decrease hansen et al 1994 kazda 1991 levia et al 2011 when infiltrating the soil and displacing the existing soil solution the element concentrations in the soil solution might follow this dynamic of sp for a short time but will then return to chemical equilibrium following the slower soil processes mentioned above similar observations in a figurative sense were made for soil moisture pattern metzger et al 2017 those short term dynamics cannot be captured with the weekly sampling of sp or fortnightly sampling of soil solution as used here however we consider it quite possible that spatial gradients of soil chemical conditions can develop in a spatially homogeneous soil under a canopy over a rotation period of tree species with pronounced stemflow depending on the exposure to air pollutants 5 conclusions our study confirmed our hypothesis that canopy structure of beech trees affects the spatial distribution of stand precipitation resulting in a distinct stemflow and a radial symmetrical gradient of throughfall unexpectedly a seasonal pattern of the stem distance gradient of the tf volume was revealed which could be attributed to leaved or leafless periods in summer tf was lower near the trunk than distant from it but higher in winter our second hypothesis concerning the spatial variability of element concentrations and fluxes in tf within the stem distance gradient could also be confirmed for almost all elements concentrations in tf were highest near the stem throughout the year as the element fluxes were primarily determined by element concentration gradients and less by water fluxes the element fluxes with tf were higher near the trunk the spatial variation of water and element input into the soil under the canopy of beech trees seems to affect the distribution of roots the observed lower fine root density of the topsoil near the trunk in contrast to the distal area with the highest density in deeper soil layers was supported by the dynamics of soil moisture however this contradicts the previous idea of a heart shaped root system of beech trees with regard to soil chemical conditions no stem distance gradient could be detected which was attributed to the low atmospheric deposition load of the forest stand and the high acid neutralisation capacity in the canopy for the topsoil solution the short term dynamics of the nutrient inputs with the stand precipitation prevented the demonstration of a clear relationship with the soil solution even though relationships were indicated for some elements we found some evidence of correlations between sf or tf element inputs and its concentrations in the soil solution at least in some phases on the other hand the applied method of fortnightly sampling of the soil solution severely limits the information value regarding its temporal variation based on data from shorter collection intervals an assessment of soil chemical consequences could also be carried out with the help of dynamic simulation models that capture soil chemical reactions spatial and or temporal variations in resource distribution affect patterns of plant communities and soil biogeochemical processes studies on ecosystem processes therefore must directly or indirectly incorporate considerations of spatial and temporal dependencies into their observations tischer et al 2020b our results underline the need to consider the spatial variability of water and element fluxes under

3476,the partitioning of bulk precipitation pr in forest ecosystems and its chemical composition depends on both meteorological factors such as precipitation amount and intensity evaporation rate and wind speed and stand structural factors such as stand density canopy structure bark texture and spatiotemporal distribution and density of foliage we analysed fluxes of water and element contained therein of a mature european beech fagus sylvatica l forest stand on sandy soils in northeastern germany we applied a radially symmetrical setup within a stem distance gradient to measure stand precipitation sp with its components of throughfall tf and stemflow sf as well as to measure soil moisture the chemical composition of the soil solution the soil chemistry and the fine root

of 620 mm a 1 the partitioning resulted in 79 tf 6 sf and 15 canopy interception tf volume increased with distance to stem during summer but decreased during winter clear spatial gradients with increasing concentrations from pr to different classes of tf as the distance from the trunk decreased to sf were observed for nearly all elements the contact of precipitation with leaves and the canopy structures alters the chemical composition of tf and sf by transferring elements from dry deposition or leaching of intracellular materials from the canopy and leads to the input of larger amounts of macroelements and heavy metals with the sp into the soil spatial patterns of canopy structures thus affect the spatial variation of tf and its constituents which also affects the spatial

pr first gained worldwide attention over a hundred years ago friesen and van stan 2019 hoppe 1896 horton 1919 in forests some precipitation reaches the soil through canopy gaps as free tf without contact to vegetation the other parts of precipitation with contact to the canopy may be intercepted building a short term water storage pool from which the three main water fluxes canopy interception

texture diameter at breast height dbh and the height to width ratio of the as an indicator of the canopy geometry jiang et al 2021 tonello et al 2021b van stan et al 2021 which might affect the tf due to lateral transport of precipitation under certain conditions epiphytes grow on tree trunks that are supplied with water and nutrients by the stemflow the presence of epiphytes can substantially enhance interception and increases the effect of forest canopy structure on the vertical and horizontal redistribution of precipitation by modifying water and nutrient availability spatially and temporally mendieta leiva et al 2020 in central europe european beech fagus sylvatica l as a deciduous tree species builds a particularly funnel shaped crown caused by steeply inclined branches and twigs in combination with a very smooth bark enhancing the lateral transport of precipitation water that is directed towards the centre of the tree andré et al 2011 frischbier and wagner 2015 schwärzel et al 2012 staelens et al 2006b voigt 1960b this lateral transport results in modified tf rates at the centre of the tree and distinct occurrence of sf european beech has one of the highest sf rates for incident rainfall for any tree species in central europe ranging from 3 to 25 germer et al 2012 in contrast for other tree species e g norway spruce precipitation water is often directed to the distant crown edge beier et al 1993 whelan et al 1998 or no stem distance gradient has been observed as for example in scots pine kowalska et al 2016 the precipitation moistens the leaves and the wooden plant parts which may affect the chemical composition of water by transferring elements from dry deposition facilitating the leaching of intracellular materials from the canopy or triggering the net uptake or release of solutes from insects and epiphytic organisms mcdowell et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 nutrient contents of pr tf and sf have to be analysed in order to estimate processes of the ecosystem internal nutrient cycle such as canopy leaching and absorption and to enable a calculation of the total deposition the spatial and temporal variability of tf solute inputs and its chemical constitution in forest ecosystems are the result of several meteorological and canopy structural factors levia and frost 2006 van stan et al 2020 the element concentrations of the air and the weather conditions as well as structures of the plant surfaces all determine the deposition process erisman and draaijers 2003 precipitation water can react with the surface of leaves and branches and lead to absorption and leaching especially in deciduous trees the alternation between leafy and leafless periods as well as accretion and resorption of elements in the canopy can additionally contribute to temporal variability because dry deposition and canopy exchange during the leafed period exceed those of the leafless period andré et al 2008 berger et al 2008 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006a staelens et al 2007 turpault et al 2021 voigt 1960a the spatial distribution of leaf area seems to be one of the most important impact factors determining the spatial variability of tf chemistry in a vertical analysis within beech and spruce canopies an increase in element concentrations could be attributed to dry deposition and canopy leaching adriaenssens et al 2012 the double funnelling effect of beech trees generates sf due to its canopy structure directing water and nutrients to the inner part of the heart shaped root system johnson and lehmann 2006 köstler et al 1968 schwärzel et al 2012 this may have a considerable effect on plant productivity and yield because of its capacity to direct nutrients to biogeochemically active areas van stan et al 2016 on the other hand high input rates of acids and heavy metals have also been reported this may have a major impact on soil chemistry at least in polluted regions chang and matzner 2000a falkengren

deposition load has decreased over the last few decades türtscher et al 2017 those altered chemical soil conditions can in turn affect the turnover processes of the carbon and nitrogen budget of the soil chang and matzner 2000b schäfer 1988 as a result of soil acidification changes in ground vegetation were found around the stem base area with higher abundances of acidophytes andersson 1991 bruelheide and udelhoven 2005 falkengren grerup 1989 jochheim 1985 the spatial distribution of tf within a forest and of sf in the centre of the tree and the effects of these on soil hydrology may also affect the spatial fine root distribution using results from a sitka spruce forest ford and deans 1978 reported that the spatial pattern of tf paralleled the distribution of fine roots in the soil in a spatially stratified study of sf and tf a short term influence on soil moisture was detected but this disappeared after a few hours to a few days and reverted to soil moisture conditions determined by soil structure metzger et al 2017 the aim of this study was to identify the spatial patterns of water and element fluxes with sf and tf under canopies of a beech forest ecosystem and the impact of those spatial patterns on the soil hydrology and fine root distribution as well as on chemical soil conditions our study does not focus on the phenomenon of stemflow but rather on the spatial distribution of throughfall within a stem distance gradient while extreme weather related events can have a major impact on material flows in the short term these are put into perspective in the long term it was not the aim of this study to examine such individual events or to determine long term trends we hypothesised that 1 structural factors of beech trees cause lateral transport of precipitation resulting in high stemflow proportions and radially symmetrical distribution of throughfall 2 canopy structure of beech trees cause different levels of contact of precipitation with the plant surfaces and create stem distance gradients of element concentrations and fluxes 3 the spatial distribution of stemflow and throughfall volume and its mineral element content influences the distribution of fine roots and 4 the chemical constitution of stemflow and troughfall affects the soil chemistry 2 material and methods we investigated a mature european beech fagus sylvatica l forest

scots pine forest pinus sylvestris l so a mixed forest of beech and pine developed thereafter from 1985 to 1988 the upper pine layer of the mixed forest stand was cut stepwise and a pure beech forest

for a wide range of forest sites from southwestern to northeastern germany meteorological data were sampled in the beech forest under the closed canopy and simultaneously by a weather station at an open field at a distance of 0 8 km from the beech stand for precipitation and solar radiation additional measurements of pr for gap filling were taken in a forest aisle at a distance of 0 5 km from the beech stand for the analysis of water and element fluxes within the forest stand we applied a radially symmetrical setup to determine soil moisture stemflow and throughfall soil solution and soil chemistry fig 2 the stem and canopy structural traits of the sampled trees were listed intable 3 tf was collected weekly using 15 deposition samplers each with a sampling area of 314 cm2 rs200 ums munich at 2 m height the volume of the samples was weighed for calculation of water and element fluxes twelve of these samplers were arranged at different stem distances 0 5 1 5 2 5 m under the canopy of four trees and three additional samplers were arranged in canopy gaps sf was collected using collars constructed of polyurethane foam where the contact surfaces with water were lined with paraffin to ensure chemically inert behaviour sf volume was measured continuously at one stem tree 49 with a tipping bucket rain gauge as well as from four trees weekly by sampling the water in barrels and measuring the filling height after collection of samples all samplers were brushed and cleaned with distilled water for the next collection period all trees with sf and tf measurements belonged to the co dominant tree layer the sf in mm was calculated by multiplying the sf volume per tree l by the number of trees per ha ha 1 divided by 10 000 to convert the related area from ha to m2 to calculate the shares of area of infiltrating sp the following assumptions were made the samplers at the distances 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m from the stem centre were assumed to represent the area between the stem centre to 1 m 1 to 2 m and 2 to 3 5 m respectively representing a share of 6 7 20 4 and 56 0 of the forest area the deposition sampler under the canopy gaps represented the remaining 16 9 to calculate the water flux including element fluxes with tf for the entire forest stand the flux of each stem distance category was area weighted to relate sf to an area we distinguish sff which is related to the entire forest area from sfi which is related to an assumed infiltrating area of 0 3 m2 per tree very close to the stem with 216 trees ha 1 this amounts to 64 8 m2 ha 1 or 0 648 of the total forest area the sf infiltration area partly overlaps with the innermost circle of the tf infiltration area analysis of soil water content took place hourly at different distances to the stem 0 5 1 5 2 5 m of one stem at 0 2 0 7 2 5 and 5 0 m soil depths using ml2 thetaprobes delta t devices ltd cambridge uk soil solutions were sampled using borosilicate suction probes ecotech bonn gmbh from 0 2 0 7 2 5 and 5 0 m soil depths at different distances from two stems 0 5 1 5 2 5 m two replicates per tree depth and distance the samples were collected by applying a suction of 30 kpa at 0 2 and 0 7 cm and 35 kpa at 2 5 m for the 0 2 m soil depth the soil solution was sampled in glass bottles for soil depths 0 2 m the soil solutions were stored within the shafts of the suction probes soil solutions were collected fortnightly and the four samples per soil depth and stem distance were bulked for chemical analysis when recording the spatial rooting intensity we deviated from the general sampling design of the radial symmetric set up in contrast root penetration was examined along a 3 8 m long and 1 8 m deep wall of a soil pit lachmann 2002 the profile wall was roughened and divided into a grid of 10x10 cm squares the number of visible root tips differentiated into coarse and fine roots diameter 2 mm 2 mm was counted for each of these 684 squares fine root density as a number of fine root tips per dm2 was averaged for four soil layers 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 1 2 m and 1 2 1 8 m the soil pit was located in the influence area of three beech trees for which the horizontal distance to each root examination plot was determined the diameter at breast height dbh of these beech trees was 48 7 cm 36 3 cm and 21 3 cm to quantify the overall influence of these three trees on the root examination point the tree distances were averaged weighted with the tree dimension this approach assumes that the contribution that a tree makes to the local rooting intensity is proportional to the tree dimension and inversely proportional to the tree distance according to hornschuch 2009 the basal area ba of the trees at a height of 1 30 m was used as an expression of the tree dimension and the weighted horizontal tree distance dwm for each root examination point was calculated as follows d wm d 1 ba 1 d 2 ba 2 d 3 ba 3 ba 1 ba 2 ba 3 pr tf sf and soil solution were analysed for concentrations of macroelements and heavy metals at the central ecological laboratory of the eberswalde university for sustainable development water samples of pr tf sf and soil solution were collected largely according to the methods of the icp forests manual clarke et al 2021 nieminen et al 2016 water samples were filtered black band filter in the field before transport to laboratory and stored at 18 c until analysis for the chemical analysis the samples were thawed and membrane filtrated 0 45 µm the preparation and chemical analysis of the water samples were conducted according to the rules of the icp forests manual könig et al 2005 the chemical analysis of ca mg k na al fe mn si s p cu pb and zn was conducted by applying atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes ions of nh4 no3 cl so4 2 were analysed using ion chromatography alkalinity was determined by titration and conductivity by conductometry the ph value was measured using a ph electrode to calculate the element fluxes with precipitation it was necessary to fill measurement gaps of water fluxes or element concentrations gaps in tf and sf measurements were filled using data from continuously sampled tf of a rain gauge or as a substitute the pr of weather stations gaps in the time series of element concentration were filled using the nearest neighbour analysis procedure knn of ibm spss 27 using the amount of precipitation the month and the year as covariates in contrast to calculate and statistically test temporal and spatial distribution of element concentrations we did not fill the gaps and used only measured samples the total deposition of macroelements was calculated following the model described in draaijers and erisman 1995 for more information on the water and macroelement budget of the experimental site we refer to our previous papers jochheim et al 2007 sommer et al 2013 for statistical analyses of seasonal differences we grouped the monthly analysed water samples of all years into four seasons spring months 3 5 summer 6 8 autumn 9 11 and winter 12 2 statistical tests to determine the significance of element concentrations as well as water and element fluxes were conducted using non parametric tests nptests of ibm spss 27 we employed the kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 to compare parameter differences between seasons to test the significance of related samples e g the differences of element concentrations between different distances from the stem we applied friedman s two way analysis of variance by ranks for related samples friedman 1937 friedman 1939 3 results 3 1 precipitation and spatial pattern of stand precipitation pr over the investigation period averaged 620 mm a 1 ranging between 415 mma 1 in 2018 and 849 mm a 1 in 2007 a plurality of 35 fell during the summer months followed by 24 in winter 23 in autumn and finally 18 in spring fig 3 tf and sf contributed 489 and 35 mma 1 to sp which is 79 and 6 of pr respectively canopy interception as the difference between pr and sp was calculated to be 95 mm a 1 or 15 of pr the seasonal pattern of tf was similar to pr with the highest rates in summer and the lowest rates in spring at all trunk distances in contrast the highest sf rates see table 4 were found in winter with 7 6 of total pr followed by summer and the lowest in autumn and spring percentages of sf rates ranged between 7 6 in winter and 4 8 in summer tf volume increased with distance from the stem during the summer months fig 4 table 4 at the closest distance 0 5 m from the trunk tf was on average 15 lower compared to the highest distance under a canopy gap at distances of 1 5 and 2 5 m the difference decreased to 10 and 6 respectively we observed a contrasting gradient during the winter months where tf decreased with distance from the trunk at a distance of 0 5 m 1 5 m 2 5 m tf was 19 16 12 higher than under the canopy gap only weak or non significant trends in spatial distribution of tf were detected during spring and autumn see supplement 2 3 2 chemical conditions of precipitation and stand precipitation water 3 2 1 element concentrations clear spatial gradients with increasing concentrations from pr to tf to sf emerged for nearly all elements the trends of increasing enrichment factors ef were also clear across the four different tf classes at different stem distances as the distance from the trunk decreased fig 5 shows k mg n nh4 and na concentrations averaged over the whole investigation period as examples the elements differed in their enrichment factors which were calculated as the concentration in the sp fractions related to the concentration in pr table 5 elements with the highest ef were mn k mg and p followed by a group of elements with moderate ef cl s h ca no3 cu na si al the lowest ef were found for fe n nh4 zn and pb these relations held for nearly all seasons with only a few exceptions see supplement 1 for p n nh4 n no3 and zn the concentrations in sf water were lower during wintertime and in some cases also during spring mg ca mn and p showed similar spatial patterns but in contrast the concentrations in sf fell in summer and autumn below those of tf in the innermost circle mean ph values in pr were 5 87 0 69 those in tf range were between 5 77 and 5 86 with a very low stem distance gradient only the sf had marginally but significantly lower ph values of 5 71 the observations on conductivity and alkalinity complete the picture as higher ion concentrations cause high conductivity and alkalinity 3 2 2 element fluxes chemical elements reacted differently within the types of sp compared to pr element flux is the result of the concentrations of a given element multiplied by the water flux which is reduced in tf compared to pr as a result the enrichment factors of element fluxes are usually lower than those of element concentrations the fluxes of some elements mn k p mg si are considerably higher in sp than in pr table 6 table 7 examples in fig 6 these elements show mean efsp of 2 a second group of elements cl ca s cu na n no3 h al with efsp values between 1 2 and 2 carry moderately higher masses in tf and a third group of elements fe n nh4 zn pb transport similar or even lower quantities with sp under canopy gaps than with pr most element fluxes showed a strong gradient within the different tf infiltrating areas from the canopy gap towards the stem table 6 this could be found for all seasons see supplement 2 exceptions were h n nh4 and n no3 where significant differences could only be validated between tfgap and the other tf infiltrating areas but not between 0 5 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m stem distance the fluxes at tf0 5m are about twice as much as those at tfgap table 6 however for some elements na h n nh4 n no3 p pb the ratio tf0 5m to tfgap was lower than 1 7 for elements with concentrations that increased as the distance from the trunk decreased the proportions in the fluxes increased relative to the percentage of the area around the tree table 7 thus 8 5 of the k from the tf entered the innermost circle of 1 m radius even though the share of the area was only 6 7 element fluxes with stemflow contributed between 5 and 15 to total sp if the sf of e g k with 2 34 kg ha 1 a 1 is examined in light of the small infiltration area of 0 3 m2 per tree it results in a very intense k input of 361 kg ha 1 a 1 3 3 soil hydrology to evaluate the effect of the spatial distribution of tf and sf on soil water contents we assessed the seasonal dynamics of measured soil moisture within a stem distance gradient to this end we calculated the monthly averages of soil water content swc within every hydrological year 1 nov 31 oct we compared the annual differences between the minimum and maximum values of these monthly mean swc within the stem distance gradient the results from the 0 2 m soil depth show lower annual swc dynamics close to the stem than those at 1 5 m and 2 5 m distances fig 7 in contrast in deeper soil layers 0 7 m depth we found higher annual swc dynamics close to the stem than farther from it 3 4 fine roots the dependence of the rooting intensity number of fine root tips per dm2 on the profile wall in the soil depths 0 0 3 m 0 3 0 6 m 0 6 1 2 m and 1 2 1 8 m on the stem distance was initially examined individually for the three beech trees in the vicinity of the soil pit linear regression between the tree distance and the fine root sum only leads to low coefficients of determination and are usually not significant the specific relationship between the tree distance and the fine root density on the other hand can be well fitted with a quadratic function maximum coefficient of determination 0 81 with the exception of the soil depth 1 2 1 8 m the relationships between rooting intensity and the respective distance to the three trees are significant at a depth of 1 2 1 8 m there are no significant relationships for any of the trees the different dependencies of fine root density on the stem distance in the individual soil depths can also be seen when the mean distance of all trees weighted with the trees basal area are used instance of the distance to the single trees fig 8 in the upper soil depth 0 0 3 m a maximum of fine root density is reached on average at a distance of about 2 5 m from the stem bases fine root density decreases towards the stem base as well as towards the canopy gap the opposite is the case at a depth of 0 3 0 6 m and with a tendency also at 0 6 1 2 m here the rooting intensity increases sharply towards the stem base on the one hand and also from a stem distance 3 m on the other the latter is also the case at a depth of 0 6 1 2 m in the lowest soil depth investigated 1 2 1 8 m there is no significant dependence of fine root density on the stem distance 3 5 chemical soil conditions the elements reaching the soil with sp are subject to reactions with plant roots and the soil matrix during transport through the soil to estimate the impact of the sp chemistry on soil solution we evaluated the soil solution of topsoil regarding their stem distance gradient fig 9 table 8 data for the soil solution chemistry of deeper soil depths within the stem distance gradient are given in the supplement 3 some elements k p n nh4 n no3 alkalinity showed drastically factor 0 2 0 6 lower concentrations in 0 2 m soil solution compared to tf mn cu pb and conductivity remained almost unchanged factor 1 0 1 3 whereas others mg ca h cl s so4 showed slightly higher factor 1 4 2 7 moderately higher na fe zn factors 3 5 or extremely higher concentrations al si factors 35 and 86 compared to tf we distinguished four groups of elements within the stem distance gradient at 0 2 m soil depth the first group na mg cl doc alkalinity showed a minimum close to the stem and a maximum distant from the stem fig 9 table 8 the second group ca al si zn conductivity had a minimum proximal to the stem but a maximum in the middle of the canopy at 1 5 m stem distance the third group mn k showed a minimum at 2 5 m distance and increased as it approached the stem note that for k the median decreased as stem distance increased fig 9 whereas the mean values of k showed a maximum at 1 5 m stem distance due to a large number of extreme values table 8 for the element concentrations in the fourth group no significant differences between the three stem distances were found the trends in the stem distance gradient existed during all seasons supplement 3 statistically significant correlations between element concentrations in stemflow and throughfall on one hand and those in the soil solution of topsoil at the corresponding stem distance on the other with similar concentration ranges were found for cl so4 mn and zn the coefficients of determination r2 ranged between 0 054 and 0 180 and were usually highest for cl and mn between sf or tf0 5m and soil solution at 50 cm stem distance p 0 001 for so4 and zn between sf and soil solution p 0 001 and for so4 and zn between tf0 5m and soil solution p 0 01 parallel seasonal dynamics with maximum concentrations in winter and minimum concentrations in summer were observed for cl mn and zn in both the stand precipitation and the soil solution the correlations for so4 between sf or tf and soil solution is based on other seasonal dynamics in contrast to the soil solution the chemical conditions of the soil matrix such as ph cation exchange capacity and base saturation did not show clear trends across the stem distance gradient data not shown the spatial variation within the stem distance gradient corresponded to the spatial variation of the entire sample plot 4 discussion 4 1 spatial patterns of stand precipitation the results of our study have confirmed many investigations concerning the partitioning of precipitation by european beech with its contributions to canopy interception tf and sf particularly under meteorological conditions comparable to our investigations meesenburg et al 2009 müller 2019 peck and mayer 1996 russ et al 2016 staelens et al 2006b staelens et al 2008 our study mainly focused on the spatial variability of sp within a stem distance gradient under the canopy of a beech stand while the importance of the sf of beech trees is well known from many studies far fewer studies on the spatial variability of tf exist to our surprise our results showed spatial gradients of tf volume but they differed depending on the season while in summer the tf near the trunk was 15 lower than under the crown gap in winter it was 19 higher near the trunk fig 4 table 4 in this context it should be noted that lateral shifts of sp caused by wind hörmann et al 1996 as well as by tree swaying can blur the definition of the measurement positions of tf this explains why precipitation in gaps has at least partial contact with leaves before it reaches the ground and does not equal that of pr in the transitional phases of spring and autumn the gradients were not or only slightly pronounced table 4 it can be assumed that the canopy parts close to the trunk have a higher canopy density with a higher leaf area index lai adriaenssens et al 2012 fleck 2001 and higher canopy interception than those at the crown edge frischbier et al 2019 staelens et al 2006b staelens et al 2008 the distribution of tf has even been proposed as a method to calculate the spatial distribution of lai frischbier et al 2019 our results for stem distance as a determining variable for tf volume during the summer months correspond with those of other investigations frischbier and wagner 2015 herwitz 1987 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006b which calculated lateral flow vis à vis the relative crown radius position of the measurement points and observed that the highest discharge amounts were at positions below the inner part of the beech crown during the winter months however this gradient reverses the lack of foliage and the associated canopy interception are two possible causes what remains is the funnel effect caused by the crown shape of the beech with its distal obliquely upward pointing branches frischbier and wagner 2015 schwärzel et al 2012 this effect causes precipitation water to be directed towards the centre of the trunk herwitz 1986 levia and frost 2006 in extreme cases water can then be passed on to the trunk forming the distinctive sf of the beech alternatively it can drip off before reaching the trunk on rough surfaces of branches and twigs already in the canopy which leads to a tf that increases as distance to the stem decreases in the leafless period this effect outweighs the more pronounced canopy interception close to the trunk which can only take place on branches and twigs in winter another process is precipitation transported horizontally by wind and broken by the branch structures or the combing out of cloud and fog droplets burkard et al 2003 erisman and draaijers 2003 gautam et al 2017 katata 2014 köhler et al 2015 this also takes place mainly in the leafless period due to weather conditions precipitation here is also transported towards the crown centre and trunk a similar variation of tf according to foliage condition was demonstrated by staelens et al 2006b in a beech forest where tf during the growing season was negatively correlated with canopy cover and branch cover whereas branch cover did not correlate during defoliated periods the proportion of sf in our study was quantified between 4 8 in summer and 7 6 in winter this is at the lower end of what has been found in other studies of european beech exhibiting between 10 and 16 for three german beech forest sites meesenburg et al 2009 and between 3 and 25 in a pan european literature review germer et al 2012 and within a global synthesis over several biomes and climates sadeghi et al 2020 though the intensity of individual events is probably more decisive than the annual sums of precipitation berger et al 2008 the sf proportion also corresponds to the picture of other studies with regard to the canopy height width relation sadeghi et al 2020 which was determined here at 1 9 table 3 the relatively low pr of 620 mm a 1 have been suspected as possible causes for low sf fractions voss et al 2016 since the bark of sampled trees was classified as smooth to very smooth in our investigation table 3 this is not a possible further cause for the low sf shares indeed an evaluation with our data set yielded a positive correlation between pr during summer and the share of sf mean pr 71 6 mm a 1 mean sf 4 85 sf 0 0279 pr 1 97 r2 0 555 investigations in regions with similarly low annual precipitation came to comparable sf proportions chang and matzner 2000a russ et al 2017 the seasonal differences found here are also consistent with other studies levia and germer 2015 sf averaging 6 7 of the total sp infiltrates a small not exactly definable area the infiltration area of sf was reported to vary over a wide range from 0 04 to 11 8 m2 tree 1 and depends on several factors such as tree anatomy and dimension precipitation intensity and duration hydraulic conductivity and slope inclination herwitz 1986 van stan and allen 2020 for european beech this area has been estimated to range from 0 02 m2 tischer et al 2020a to 0 25 m2 schwärzel et al 2012 to 1 m2 chang and matzner 2000a jochheim and schäfer 1988 assuming that sf infiltrates into the soil close to the trunk into macropores caused by coarse roots schwärzel et al 2012 an infiltration area of the order of the basal area of each tree plus the stem base swelling could be estimated at 0 3 m2 per tree the innermost circle with a radius of 1 m around the trunk covering 7 of the forest area accounts for 6 2 of the total sp while the dominant tf fraction 52 6 infiltrates 56 of the annular area between 2 and 3 5 m stem distance thus the importance of the areas close to the trunk for the water balance of the entire stand is of subordinate importance although clear gradients of tf volumes in the stem distance gradient have been found however smaller surface units such as the sf infiltration area and the inner ring around the trunk become more important for other research if the element fluxes are considered 4 2 the chemical composition of precipitation and stand precipitation the second aspect concerned the question of whether the reaction of sp with the leaves the bark of twigs and branches of the canopy as well as the stem would be reflected in a stem distance gradient of concentrations and fluxes of elements the pronounced accumulation of many elements in sf and their effects on soil chemical conditions have been widely documented germer et al 2012 levia and frost 2003 levia and germer 2015 but few studies have addressed the question of concentration gradients in tf in stem distance gradients within forests our findings support the presence and range of enrichment factors for nearly all elements in the tf and especially in the sf compared to pr table 5 as described in other studies adriaenssens et al 2012 andré et al 2008 berger et al 2008 chang and matzner 2000a levia et al 2011 levia and germer 2015 meesenburg et al 2009 nihlgård 1970 robson et al 1994 staelens et al 2006a b 2007 2008 talkner et al 2010 turpault et al 2021 our investigation confirmed the gradations of enrichment factors found in these publicationsfor macroelements table 5 with mn k and mg having the highest enrichment factors the high concentrations of these elements in the sf and tf were mainly caused by canopy leaching while the elements with lower enrichment factors are increasingly derived from dry deposition the element concentrations determined here in precipitation and throughfall do not deviate fundamentally from the wide concentration ranges determined in tropical rainforests zimmermann et al 2007 but were considerably lower than in various forests in the cerrado brasil which is located in close proximity to industrial areas surrounded by eucalyptus sp and sugarcane plantations with the latter being regularly burned tonello et al 2021a comparing leaching of nutrients from deciduous tree species to those from coniferous tree species provides an inconsistent picture aubrey 2020 canopy leaching found to be higher for deciduous trees than for coniferous adriaenssens et al 2012 whereas others found the opposite result berger et al 2008 evergreen coniferous tree species seem to be more affected by dry deposited pollutants than deciduous trees which only offer a smaller receptor surface over the winter de schrijver et al 2007 but even within the four different classes of tf increasing concentrations were detected for most elements since the stem was approximated table 5 exceptions with no or only weakly pronounced spatial gradients were the elements h nh4 no3 and pb in the sf element concentrations once again increased significantly compared to the tf with the exception of zn table 5 the results support similar findings on varying nutrient fluxes in the stem distance gradient adriaenssens et al 2012 in contrast to a study by chang and matzner 2000a which found only small concentration differences between standard and proximal tf obviously the different contact intensity of the precipitation water with the leaves twigs and branches caused the distribution patterns of element concentrations and fluxes in sp in the stem distance gradient due to the presumably higher lai and stem area index sai at the centre of the trees fleck 2001 or the higher coverage of the ground area close to the trunk with leafy crown parts compared to more distant areas there are more pronounced deposition and canopy leaching processes which have been detected in both horizontal and vertical concentration gradients under the canopy of beech trees adriaenssens et al 2012 staelens et al 2006a found that the spatial heterogeneity of ion deposition under beech trees was significantly affected by leaves in the growing period and by branches in non foliated conditions combining the element concentrations with the water flux enabled to obtain gradients of the element fluxes however these were mainly determined by the element concentration since the mean annual water fluxes varied little table 6 this led to higher element fluxes in the proximal stem area many physiological processes related to the macroelement and microelement budgets of trees such as deposition foliar absorption foliar leaching accretion and resorption leaf growth senescence and litterfall occur only or predominantly at certain times of the year turpault et al 2021 and were responsible for the seasonal variation of nutrients in different biomass pools of the canopy in addition for certain elements interactions are expected to occur predominantly with leaves or with the bark of twigs branches and stems furthermore effects by canopy epiphytes have also been observed mendieta leiva et al 2020 van stan and pypker 2015 but they play a minor role in the forest stand we studied therefore we assume that seasonal effects of element fluxes would occur in the stem distance gradient but even if the gradients of water fluxes during summer showed a trend opposite to the element concentration gradients e g lower tf volume table 4 but higher element concentration in the centre of the tree table 5 supplement 1 the element concentration gradients overcompensated the oppositely directed water flux gradients this means that for all seasons the resulting element flux gradients remained similar to the annual averages for nearly all elements the only exception were the mn fluxes in summer where tf concentrations and fluxes were lower at 0 5 m than at 2 5 m stem distance supplement 1 for the elements fe k si al s cl cu and mn the enrichment factors in sf were 1 5 times higher than in tf table 5 this could indicate that these elements leached from the bark more intensively than from the leaves when they came into contact with the biomass of the tree crowns which might happen in different seasons however those seasonal aspects were not evaluated in this study 4 3 soil hydrology and fine root distribution the third aspect addressed the question of whether any hydrological gradients found in sp were also reflected in soil hydrology our results show that during the summer soil moisture at depths of 0 2 m decreased close to the stem to a lesser extent than those more distant from the stem in contrast at soil depths of 0 7 m and below soil moisture showed greater dynamics near the trunk than farther from it fig 7 for interpretation we have to take into account two impact factors first tf volume in summer is about 10 15 lower near the trunk than farther from the trunk on the other hand soil water content might be affected by additional water input by sf into the small area close to the stem which partly compensates for lower tf rates in a spatially stratified study of sf and tf a short term influence on soil moisture was detected but this disappeared after a few hours to a few days and soil moisture conditions returned to those determined by soil structure metzger et al 2017 secondly our results could be explained by reduced water uptake from 0 2 m soil depth near the trunk than farther from it but conversely higher water uptake from deeper soil layers close to the trunk than those farther away indeed our results on fine root distribution support the spatial pattern in soil moisture dynamics at depths of 0 0 3 m our soils exhibited a maximum fine root density of about 2 5 m from the stems and decreased as the distance to the stem increased or decreased fig 8 on the other hand at soil depths of 0 3 0 6 m minimum fine root density was observed at about 2 5 m distance which increased closer to the stem and further away from it this different root distribution in the soil according to soil depth was not expected since beech is considered a tree species with a heart shaped root system johnson and lehmann 2006 köstler et al 1968 schwärzel et al 2012 in which denser rooting in the centre of the trunk was generally expected however we have to note that our study did not analyse root density 1 m to the stem and that our results are only based on a spatial gradient through the root system of three trees the effects of high acidity and heavy metal contamination on the root system due to deposition with the sf are probably more likely to be expected in the closer infiltration area a horizontal and vertical fine root distribution in a stem distance gradient similar to our results was found in an acidic soil beech stand in solling region friedrich 1992 soil organic matter originating from root turnover as indicated by suberin derived lipids showed a spatial pattern for a beech stand similar to our results on fine root distribution spielvogel et al 2014 in the hainich national park in germany one study investigated maximum fine root biomass at approximately 3 m stem distance jurasinski et al 2012 another study of a mixed beech oak stand in the lüneburg heath found a fine root biomass of beech that increased with distance from the stem up to 3 5 m leuschner et al 2001 at other sites root abundance in the area close to the trunk was more common e g in the northeastern german lowlands hornschuch 2009 hornschuch and riek 2007 or in a mixed deciduous forest stand hölscher et al 2002 still others found no correlation between fine root biomass and distance from the stem hertel 1999 but rather a clustered root distribution depending on the proximity to coarse roots or nutrient supply bakker et al 2008 schmid and kazda 2002 our results therefore confirm earlier observations that spatial fine root distribution depends on spatial pattern of tf ford and deans 1978 finally it should be noted that there is no significant dependence of the rooting intensity on the stem distance in the lowest depth investigated 120 180 cm here the individual occurrence of better soil layers possible clay and lime lenses could have a differentiating effect on the formation of higher root densities 4 4 chemical soil condition the fourth aspect dealt with the question of whether any stem distance gradient found in the chemical composition of the sp was also reflected in the soil in the solid soil phase our investigations found no evidence of this effect with regard to soil ph and base saturation this confirms the results by metzger et al 2021 from a mixed european beech forest who also found no ph differences and attributed this to low air pollution our study site is also located in an area with relatively low atmospheric deposition wellbrock et al 2005 as indicated by similar ph values in sf tf and pr supplement 1 additionally there are lime components in the subsoil of our stand that are accessible to the roots so that basic cations can be transferred to the topsoil via the base pump effect with the litterfall vejre and hoppe 1998 consequently periodically observed acid inputs from sf and tf can probably still be buffered by exchangeable basic cations from the soil however the closest stem distance we studied in this regard was 1 m and thus farther away than is usual in other investigations on sf impact on soil chemistry falkengren grerup 1989 gersper and holowaychuk 1971 jochheim 1985 kazda and glatzel 1984 levia and germer 2015 furthermore it must be taken into account that many observations including some of those cited above regarding the strong acidifying effects of stemflow on soil chemical conditions originate from areas and or decades with a higher atmospheric acid deposition a sf infiltration area of 0 3 m2 per tree would result assuming a circular area with a radius of 0 31 m from the centre of the trunk only in the case of slopes impermeable substrate or very heavy precipitation events can larger sf influence areas be expected van stan and allen 2020 which was not the case for our study site in the soil solution on the other hand we found effects in the stem distance gradient for a number of elements that could be related to the input from sf and tf the higher k and mn concentrations of the near trunk or middle crown area and the lowest concentrations at the crown edge table 8 corresponded to those in sf and tf within the stem distance gradient table 5 however the lower na mg and cl concentrations of the soil solution near the stem contrast with the stem distance gradients of tf higher k and lower na mg and cl concentrations close to the stem were also found by chang and matzner 2000a although their study investigated different stem distances and soil depths they interpreted the na and cl concentrations increasing with stem distance with a distal increase in evapotranspiration and the associated thickening effect of soil solution which might also be true in our investigation our results on the horizontal root distribution with maximum fine root density at 2 5 m from the trunk fig 8 at 0 to 0 3 m soil depth but closer to the trunk at 0 3 to 0 6 m soil depth support this assumption the significant correlations between the element concentrations in sf and tf and the soil solutions which were also shown in parallel seasonal changes also support this observation with cl mn s and zn only those elements showed this behaviour whose concentrations in the soil are primarily determined by input with precipitation water and less by soil chemical processes since the ph values of sf and tf did not indicate acid inputs into the soil no soil chemical reactions such as increased al concentrations in the soil solution could be observed soil solution is subject to both spatial and temporal variations of the influencing factors various processes with their own dynamics take place in the soil such as decomposition of litter and som soil chemical reactions and uptake of water and nutrients by roots short term effects of sp and tf might also have an impact on soil solution at the beginning of a precipitation event dry deposited pollutants are washed away and or leaf contents are leached out with increasing duration the concentrations in sf and tf decrease hansen et al 1994 kazda 1991 levia et al 2011 when infiltrating the soil and displacing the existing soil solution the element concentrations in the soil solution might follow this dynamic of sp for a short time but will then return to chemical equilibrium following the slower soil processes mentioned above similar observations in a figurative sense were made for soil moisture pattern metzger et al 2017 those short term dynamics cannot be captured with the weekly sampling of sp or fortnightly sampling of soil solution as used here however we consider it quite possible that spatial gradients of soil chemical conditions can develop in a spatially homogeneous soil under a canopy over a rotation period of tree species with pronounced stemflow depending on the exposure to air pollutants 5 conclusions our study confirmed our hypothesis that canopy structure of beech trees affects the spatial distribution of stand precipitation resulting in a distinct stemflow and a radial symmetrical gradient of throughfall unexpectedly a seasonal pattern of the stem distance gradient of the tf volume was revealed which could be attributed to leaved or leafless periods in summer tf was lower near the trunk than distant from it but higher in winter our second hypothesis concerning the spatial variability of element concentrations and fluxes in tf within the stem distance gradient could also be confirmed for almost all elements concentrations in tf were highest near the stem throughout the year as the element fluxes were primarily determined by element concentration gradients and less by water fluxes the element fluxes with tf were higher near the trunk the spatial variation of water and element input into the soil under the canopy of beech trees seems to affect the distribution of roots the observed lower fine root density of the topsoil near the trunk in contrast to the distal area with the highest density in deeper soil layers was supported by the dynamics of soil moisture however this contradicts the previous idea of a heart shaped root system of beech trees with regard to soil chemical conditions no stem distance gradient could be detected which was attributed to the low atmospheric deposition load of the forest stand and the high acid neutralisation capacity in the canopy for the topsoil solution the short term dynamics of the nutrient inputs with the stand precipitation prevented the demonstration of a clear relationship with the soil solution even though relationships were indicated for some elements we found some evidence of correlations between sf or tf element inputs and its concentrations in the soil solution at least in some phases on the other hand the applied method of fortnightly sampling of the soil solution severely limits the information value regarding its temporal variation based on data from shorter collection intervals an assessment of soil chemical consequences could also be carried out with the help of dynamic simulation models that capture soil chemical reactions spatial and or temporal variations in resource distribution affect patterns of plant communities and soil biogeochemical processes studies on ecosystem processes therefore must directly or indirectly incorporate considerations of spatial and temporal dependencies into their observations tischer et al 2020b our results underline the need to consider the spatial variability of water and element fluxes under

3477,assessment of the accuracy of satellite based precipitation products spps is essential prior to their use in formal applications however thorough assessments of spps by traditional approaches are typically not practical when gauge observations are sparse the triple collocation tc approach can be used to perform spatially continuous assessments but tc is affected by error and bias in this study a novel approach for the spatially continuous assessment of spps that integrates tc and the traditional discrete gauge based approach via geographically weighted regression gwr was developed this approach referred to as tc gwr allows spps to be assessed in areas with limited gauge observations the tc gwr was tested comprehensively through using four widely used spps over mainland china the tc gwr generates spatially continuous assessment results for spps and outperforms significantly the original tc approach in assessing the accuracy of spps quantitatively the performance of tc gwr was generally robust to variation in the density of gauge stations 50 100 200 400 and 800 gauge stations and showed acceptable performance when gauge data are relatively sparse except for the extremely sparse gauge cases only 10 stations over mainland china overall tc gwr integrates the advantages of the traditional approach higher reliability and the tc approach spatial continuity and provides a valuable alternative for assessing spps in areas with limited gauge observations such as remote mountainous areas and developing countries keywords satellite based precipitation product accuracy assessment triple collocation gauge based assessment approach geographically weighted regression 1 introduction satellite based precipitation products spps are precipitation estimates that are mainly derived from satellite remote sensing information such as passive microwave pmw infrared ir and spaceborne precipitation radar reflectivity hong et al 2012 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018a compared with traditional gauge based station observations spps have several advantages such as wide spatial coverage and spatial continuity thus spps provide alternative precipitation data for areas with sparse or no gauge observations such as mountainous areas and developing countries bai et al 2019 hong et al 2012 tang et al 2020 yong et al 2015 widely used high resolution gridded spps include the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap mega et al 2019 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg hou et al 2014 these spps have been widely used for drought monitoring early flood warning hydrological and environmental modeling and water resources planning bai et al 2020 bai et al 2019 lai et al 2019 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2017a zhong et al 2019 nevertheless spps also have shortcomings such as low accuracy compared with gauge observations reductions in the accuracy of spps are caused by several factors including complicated surface conditions sampling error and insufficient sensitivity between electromagnetic signals and clouds aghakouchak et al 2011 chen et al 2018a kidd et al 2003 xie and arkin 1997 therefore the accuracy of spps needs to be assessed before they are used in formal applications deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 massari et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 gauge observations are typically used as the benchmark for assessing the accuracy of spps because of their high accuracy and robustness this traditional assessment approach has been used in gauged areas worldwide aghakouchak et al 2011 deng et al 2019 tang et al 2018b tang et al 2020 wang et al 2017b zhong et al 2019 however because of the high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation the reliability of the traditional assessment approach depends on the quality and spatial density of gauge data massari et al 2017 tang et al 2018b when the gauge network is sparse the assessment results typically only represent the accuracy of spps at the location of the gauges the accuracy of spps over ungauged grid cells remains unclear shen and xiong 2016 zhong et al 2019 therefore thorough assessments for spps are difficult for areas with low gauge densities which hinders local applications of spps previous studies have indicated that the density of the current gauge network worldwide is sparse uneven and insufficient for the quantitative assessment of spps in many areas kidd et al 2017 massari et al 2017 it is critically needed to develop an assessment approach that is robust to variation in gauge densities recently the triple collocation tc approach which does not require benchmark data mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 has been proposed for the spatial continuous assessment of spps over the ungauged areas tc is based on the assumption of the error independence between three different estimate sources and can estimate the correlation coefficients between the estimates and the true values alemohammad et al 2015 mccoll et al 2014 tc has been used to assess the data products of various geophysical variables such as soil moisture ocean wind and wave heights under the conditions without reliable ground observations bai et al 2021 chen et al 2018b khaki et al 2018 mccoll et al 2014 tavakol et al 2019 in recent years some studies have used tc for global and regional spp assessments in various areas including the continental us europe africa mainland china and central asia alemohammad et al 2015 brocca et al 2019 chen et al 2021 li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 wu et al 2019 these studies have typically adopted a conventional spp a bottom up spps generated via different mechanisms which typically is the soil moisture to rain sm2rain products brocca et al 2019 and a model based reanalysis precipitation product as a triplet input for tc these studies have found that tc can accurately capture the spatial pattern of spp accuracy and is highly spatially correlated with the results of traditional approaches employing gauge stations nevertheless apparent biases have been noted for tc in applications and these biases reduce the efficacy of tc for the quantitative assessment of spps bai et al 2021 li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 non zero error cross correlation ecc is considered a major source of bias for example reanalysis precipitation products might introduce the same satellite pmw or ir data sources with spps for data assimilation and the spps also usually share the same remote sensing data or have similar error characteristics for the detection of small rainfall chen et al 2021 the propose of quadruple collocation qc approach alleviates the problem of ecc between precipitation datasets chen et al 2021 nevertheless qc assumes that non zero ecc exists between only two datasets which is also difficult to be satisfied in practices merging the less accurate but spatial continuous data with the more accurate but spatial discrete data is an effective approach to generate the more accurate and spatial continuous result bai et al 2019 li et al 2018b such approaches thus have the potential to integrate the advantage of spatial continuous of tc approach as well as the high accuracy of gauge based traditional assessment approach so that provide a reliable spatial continuous assessment for the spps over the sparsely gauged areas the geographically weighted regression gwr approach páez et al 2011 is one of the approaches that can merge continuous spatial prediction with discrete point data it is a geographical regression analysis approach that further improves and generalizes the traditional linear regression and considers the spatial variation of the regression relationships and can further effectively utilize the geographical auxiliary variables so that have higher fitting accuracy chen et al 2018b found that gwr approaches outperform other point grid merging approaches like geographical difference analysis gda and is less sensitive to errors in input gridded data the superiority of gwr also have been widely verified in several studies merging discrete gauge data and spatial continuous gridded data of geophysical and environmental variables such as precipitation air temperature and pm2 5 chao et al 2018 chen et al 2020 lu et al 2019 arshad et al 2021 chen et al 2015 he and huang 2018 karbalaye ghorbanpour et al 2021 li et al 2018b in a recent study deng et al 2019 the accuracy of spp was shown to be closely related to several geographical factors such as longitude latitude and elevation this indicates that more accurate spatially continuous assessment of spps might be achieved by integrating the traditional approach and tc via the gwr approach by further introducing such geographical factors the goal of this study was to develop a novel and reliable approach that can be used for spatially continuous assessment of spps in areas with sparse gauge observations in this approach the tc approach is utilized to provide spatial continuous assessment of spps the traditional approach is utilized to provide spatial discrete point scale but more accurate assessment of spps while the gwr is utilized to integrate the results of both assessment approach therefore this approach is referred to as tc gwr mainland china which has a vast territory with various climate types including humid and arid climates was used to test the tc gwr approach the objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate and test the tc gwr approach and 2 compare the performance of tc gwr with the original tc and other related approaches to evaluate the performance and characteristics of the tc gwr four famous spps including cmorph persiann cdr and the early and final run products of imerg were used to validate the tc gwr approach this study contributed a valuable approach for assessing spps over remote areas and developing countries with limited gauge observations 2 study area and data 2 1 mainland china mainland china fig 1 was used as the study area to test the tc gwr approach it has a vast territory and is located to the northwest of the pacific ocean the elevation of mainland china is high in the southwest tibetan plateau and low in the east southern and northern mainland china are dominated by a humid subtropical and a semi humid temperate monsoon climate respectively the northwest is dominated by an arid and semi arid temperate continental climate and the southwest tibetan plateau is dominated by a cold and arid alpine plateau climate therefore mainland china varies greatly in climate terrain and land cover type precipitation is abundant on the southeast shore up to 2000 mm per year and low in the northwest inland below 200 mm per year 2 2 imerg imerg hou et al 2014 is currently the most famous spp it provides level 3 precipitation data at a 0 1 spatial resolution and the temporal resolution up to half hourly the latest version 06 of imerg tan et al 2019 provides long term precipitation data since june 2000 by integrating remote sensing data such as infrared ir passive microwave pmw and precipitation radar data from various satellite missions including trmm and gpm the two releases of imerg the early run product imerg e and the final run product imerg f were used in this study the imerg e is a near real time product that is generated only by satellite remote sensing information and updates precipitation data approximately 4 h after real time whereas imerg f is a post processing product that incorporates gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and thus has higher accuracy but much longer latency ca 2 months than imerg e the imerg products were downloaded from the gpm website https pmm nasa gov dataaccess downloads gpm both the imerg e and imerg f were spatially resampled to 0 25 temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 3 persiann cdr persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 was developed by the university of california irvine uci it provides semi global long term precipitation data since 1983 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and daily timescale to address the need of consistent long term high resolution and global precipitation data persiann cdr is produced from the satellite based ir brightness temperature data via an adaptive artificial neural network ann model that is trained by using stage iv radar based precipitation data of the national center for environmental prediction ncep a 2 5 monthly precipitation dataset called the global precipitation climatology project gpcp was used to bias correct the persiann cdr to improve accuracy and reliability the persiann cdr data were derived from the data portal of the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at uci http chrsdata eng uci edu the downloaded persiann cdr data were at daily resolution but then temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 4 cmorph cmorph joyce et al 2004 is a widely used spp that incorporates satellite based ir and pmw information and it provides precipitation data at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolutions of daily and 3 hourly since 1998 cmorph is produced by propagating the pmw precipitation estimations via the motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite ir data the adopted release of cmorph in this study is the bias corrected cmorph cmorph crt which is produced by matching the probability distribution function between the original cmorph and daily gauge observations of the climate prediction center cpc over the contiguous united states the cmorph data were downloaded from the cpc website https ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip cmorph v1 0 the downloaded cmorph data were at daily resolution then temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 5 sm2rain ascat the sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 is a high resolution semi global spp produced by a bottom up approach it is distinct from traditional spps because it is inversely inferred from soil moisture data retrieved from the advanced scatterometer ascat via a soil water balance model brocca et al 2014 brocca et al 2013 ascat is a real aperture radar instrument on metop satellites that measures radar backscatter at the c band and is currently rarely used by other precipitation estimation products sm2rain ascat is thus relatively independent of most other spps in both mechanism and data sources and is widely used as a triplet input for tc chen et al 2021 massari et al 2017 sm2rain ascat provides precipitation data from 2007 with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 5 km the sm2rain ascat data were resampled to 0 25 grid cells in this study 2 6 era5 precipitation product era5 hersbach et al 2020 is the latest set of global atmospheric reanalysis data generated by the copernicus climate change service c3s and it provides long term global precipitation assimilation data from 1979 to the present era5 is produced by applying a four dimensional variational algorithm on the latest integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 of emcwf which realizes several upgrades based on the antecedent era interim including a higher spatial resolution of 0 25 and improved variational bias scheme integrating more historical observations era5 and other reanalyses are often conducted as a triplet member to assess the spps by using tc because of their distinct mechanisms based on atmospheric physical modeling compared with most spps the era5 precipitation data were obtained from the c3s website https doi org 10 24381 cds f17050d7 2 7 gauge observations a widely used gauge interpolated gridded precipitation data product over mainland china called china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa shen and xiong 2016 released by the china meteorological administration cma was used as the reference for the gauge based traditional assessment approach and to validate the results of tc gwr cgdpa is produced by precipitation observations from about 2400 gauges over mainland china via an optimal interpolation approach that considers topography at a spatial resolution of 0 25 because the source data of the 2400 gauges were not available 0 25 grid cells of cgdpa that contain at least one gauge were considered to represent gauge stations according to the reliability model of the reference data for the timescale and gauge density proposed by tang et al 2018b one gauge station for 0 25 grid cells is adequate for limiting the error of the calculated correlation coefficient 5 for monthly scale therefore we suggest that the cgdpa data at these grid cells are reasonable for representing the true precipitation at the monthly scale based on the cgdpa metadata we further eliminated grid cells with an excessive number of timesteps months without observations only grid cells with an observation rate over 99 from 2007 to 2018 were selected and regarded as gauge stations finally 2180 grid cells were selected to obviate confusion the centers of these grid cells represented location of gauge stations and the corresponding cgdpa data represented gauge data 3 methods 3 1 triple collocation and traditional assessment approach the tc approach can assess the spps by indirectly estimating the correlation coefficient cc between the spps and the truth which is a widely used accuracy indicator of spps in the tc gwr approach the cc of the spps by tc approach hereafter as c c tc is firstly estimated at all gridcells over the study area next the cc of the spps is also calculated by traditional assessment approach hereafter as c c trad over the gauge stations by directly referencing to the gauge observations finally the spatial continuous c c tc and the point scale c c trad are merged by gwr approach the tc approach mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 can estimate the cc between the precipitation estimations and the truth without reference data it requires three precipitation estimation datasets generated via different mechanisms tc is based on an additive error model as follows 1 x i α i β i t ε i where x i denotes the precipitation estimations from triplet member i i 1 2 3 t is the truth α i and β i denote the ordinary least squares intercepts and ε i denotes the random error the covariance between each of the two triplet members q ij can be expressed as follows 2 q ij c o v r i r j β i β j σ t 2 β i c o v ε j t β j c o v ε i t α i e ε j α j e ε i c o v ε i ε j where c o v denotes covariance e denotes mean value the following assumptions are made for each triplet member the random errors have zero means e ε i 0 the error cross correlation ecc is zero c o v ε i ε j 0 for i j and the errors are uncorrelated with truth c o v ε i t 0 therefore q ij can also be expressed as follows 3 q ij c o v x i x j β i 2 σ 2 t σ 2 ε i i j β i β j σ 2 t i j where q ij denotes the covariance between triplet member i and j and c o v and σ 2 denote the covariance and variance function respectively under this framework the cc between triplet member i and the truth i e indicator of the accuracy of triplet member i can be determined as 4 c c x i t c o v x i t σ 2 x i σ 2 t β i σ 2 t q ii σ 2 t β i σ 2 t q ii β i 2 σ 2 t q ii by solving equations 2 and 3 the c c tc of each triplet member can be derived as mccoll et al 2014 5 cc tc 1 q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 cc tc 2 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 cc tc 3 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 four triplets were used to assess the four spps via tc 1 sm2rain ascat era5 and imerg e triplet a 2 sm2rain ascat era5 and imerg f triplet b 3 sm2rain ascat era5 and persiann cdr triplet c and 4 sm2rain ascat era5 and cmorph triplet d in the traditional assessment approach the c c trad is calculated with referencing to the gauge observations 6 c c trad c o v x r σ 2 x σ 2 r where r denotes the gauge observations and x denotes the spp data in this study the assessments of the spps were performed at the monthly time scale for the period of 2007 to 2018 3 2 geographically weighted regression gwr in the tc gwr approach gwr páez et al 2011 is used to integrate the results of tc and the gauge based traditional approach more specifically the c c tc of the four spps estimated by tc is corrected by using the gauge based traditional approach results c c trad at the gauge stations gwr is a spatial regression approach that aims to predict unknown variables at some locations according to local auxiliary variables and needs to be trained by a finite training dataset gwr is a localization extension of the traditional linear regression algorithm and the regression coefficients are related to the geographical relationships associated with the locations of training datasets the gwr model used in this study is shown as 7 y i β 0 u i v i k 1 m β k u i v i x i k i where y i is the dependent variable for example c c trad in this study at location i x i k is the k th independent variable for example c c tc and geographical auxiliary data like elevation in this study of location i β 0 u i v i and β k u i v i are the regression coefficients of location i which is the function related to u i and v i the coordinates m is the number of dependent variables and i is the residual the regression coefficients can be estimated by solving the following equation 8 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y where β i is the vector of the estimated regression coefficient at location i requiring prediction x is the matrix of independent variables of the training set rows denote different samples and columns denote different variables y is the vector of dependent variables of the training set and w is the spatial weighting matrix the weights in w are typically specified by continuous monotonic decreasing functions of the distance between the training samples and the location needing prediction the gaussian kernel was used to calculate the weights 9 w ij exp d ij 2 b j 2 where w ij is the weight between location i and the location of the training sample j d ij is the distance b j is the kernel bandwidth of training sample j which are the hyperparameters needing to be determined by cross validation to improve the performance of tc gwr longitude latitude and elevation were used as additional auxiliary data to aid the integration of c c tc and c c trad via gwr because they can potentially affect the performance of spps the elevation data of mainland china were derived from digital elevation model dem data of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm project farr et al 2007 and were resampled to 0 25 grid cells the gwr model was trained using the c c trad based on gauge data the corresponding c c tc and the additional auxiliary data longitude latitude elevation at the gauge stations c c trad was used as the dependent variable c c tc and the auxiliary data were used as independent variables the merged cc was then denoted by c c tc g w r a flowchart of the tc gwr approach is shown in fig 2 note that the distribution of the gauge stations in our case study was uneven fig 1 therefore the kernel bandwidth of gwr was determined in an adaptive manner i e using the number of influencing stations n as the variable to be optimized by cross validation for each prediction location the bandwidth was set as its distance to the location of the n th nearest training sample 3 3 experiment design a random sampling procedure was used to validate the proposed tc gwr approach given that gauge density has a significant impact on point grid merging bai et al 2019 the training datasets for the gwr model were randomly sampled from the 2180 gauge stations with six sampling sizes to represent different gauge densities which includes 10 50 100 200 400 and 800 stations respectively the sampling size of 10 stations averagely nearly one station per 10 6 km2 represents an extreme condition with highly sparse gauges the rest of the gauge stations were used as a validation set to validate the performance of tc gwr to guarantee the fairness of the validations for the four sampling sizes of training sets the size of the validation sets was consistently set to 2180 800 1380 stations for the four sampling sizes for each sampling size random sampling with replacement was performed 50 times tc gwr was trained using the training sets from each random sample and the prediction results were validated through using the corresponding validation sets fig 3 shows the training and validation station sets of one of the 50 random samples four model candidates of tc gwr with different auxiliary data were designed to investigate the impacts of the auxiliary variables only c c tc was used as an independent variable of tc gwr in the model 1 whereas different combinations of longitude latitude and elevation with c c tc as independent variables were used in models 2 3 and 4 more specifically model 2 uses both c c tc and elevation model 3 uses both c c tc and spatial coordinates longitude and latitude while model 4 use all independent variables c c tc elevation and spatial coordinates independent variables of the four model candidates are also listed in table 1 moreover additional approaches for estimating the ccs of the spps for comparison with tc gwr were also adopted to facilitate the study of the superiority of tc gwr and are detailed below 1 gwr without tc similar to tc gwr longitude latitude and elevation were used as independent variables but c c tc was excluded this can be considered to represent the non c c tc version of model 4 of tc gwr or the traditional spatial interpolation of c c trad 2 multiple linear regression mlr this model assumes that c c trad is the simple linear sum of independent variables including c c tc longitude latitude and elevation 10 y i a 0 k 1 m a k x i k i where a 0 and a k are the regression coefficients which are global constants unrelated to spatial location the mlr model was trained by the ordinary least squares method independent variables of tc gwr the gwr without tc and mlr are also listed in table 1 three validation metrics were used to validate the quantitative performance of tc gwr and other approaches for comparison including the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the bias for more convenient description of the metrics hereafter the ccs estimated by the non traditional approaches including original tc tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr are collectively abbreviated as cc esti rmse quantifies the absolute error of the cc esti relative to the c c trad at the validation stations 11 rmse cc esti cc trad 2 n where n is the number of cc esti records smaller rmse indicates better performance and target value of rmse is 0 nse quantifies the normalized fitness of the estimated ccs of spps along with the c c trad among the validation stations 12 nse 1 cc esti cc trad 2 cc trad cc trad 2 where cc trad is the mean value of cc trad among all validation stations higher nse indicates better performance and target value of nse is 1 bias quantifies the absolute systematic bias of the estimated ccs of spps relative to the c c trad among the validation stations 13 bias cc esti cc trad 1 where cc esti is the mean value of cc esti among all validation stations target value of bias is 0 and positive negative value of bias indicates overestimation underestimation respectively 4 results 4 1 evaluation of original tc approach before applying the tc gwr approach it is necessary to understand the performance tc approach for better realizing the improvement of tc gwr spatial map of c c trad and c c tc along with their standard deviation std at the gauge stations are shown in fig 4 we also calculated the rmse nse bias of the c c tc with referenced to c c trad at all gauge stations and results are shown in table 2 c c trad in fig 4 shows that imerg f generally has best accurate while imerg e has the poorest accuracy among the four spps c c trad of imerg f shows smallest std 0 048 because accuracy of imerg f is very high for most area of mainland china with many similar c c trad values close to 1 cmorph shows highest std 0 124 indicating that its accuracy varies greatly among different areas c c tc shows similar overall spatial pattern with c c trad revealing the reasonability of tc in capturing spatial pattern of spps accuracy however overall overestimation of cc of different extent by tc is also widely found for the four spps with positive bias of 0 02 to 0 06 especially for the imerg f and persiann cdr which even shows abnormal cc values over 1 similar results were also found by relative studies like massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b and bai et al 2021 rmses of c c tc are also apparent which is lowest for imerg f 0 053 and highest for persiann cdr 0 076 however due to the low spatial variation of cc of imerg f error of c c tc presents relatively large magnitude compared to the low std of cc causing the poorest nse 0 22 for imerg f according to eq 12 nse value depends on the ratio between the error of estimations and variation of benchmark data by comparison c c tc shows highest nse for cmorph due to the high spatial variation of cc of cmorph although the rmse of cmorph is also high 0 068 anyhow these results above further indicate the necessity of improvement for tc 4 2 performance of different tc gwr models figs 5 to 7 show the spatial rmse nse and bias of the ccs of spps from four model candidates of tc gwr by using the training station sets of 10 800 stations medians of these validation metrics from 50 random sample sets are listed in table 3 except for the 10 station training set all model candidates of tc gwr show higher performance than the original tc in most cases which resulted in decrement in spatial rmse by up to 0 03 improvements in spatial nse by up to 0 8 and reduced bias closed to 0 for the four spps the improvement in the assessment of cmorph by tc gwr was less compared with other approaches probably because the performance of the original tc was already high for cmorph nevertheless for the extremely sparse station sets all model candidates show no improvement and even poorer performance than the original tc with a wider range of the validation metrics as shown in fig 3 there might be even no stations over the west and northeast china in the 10 station sets which can cause the failure of tc gwr over these areas this might reveal the limitation of tc gwr that it might be not applicable when the gauge stations are extremely sparse since all approaches are unapplicable under the cases of 10 station sets relative results would be less mentioned in the following among the four model candidates of tc gwr except for the extremely sparse 10 station sets model 4 shows the best performance and stability over the different training stations probably because it includes all geographic auxiliary variables longitude latitude and elevation model 3 ranks second compared with model 4 elevation was excluded in model 3 which might suggest that elevation information is less important than spatial information longitude and latitude when integrating the results of tc and the traditional approach model 1 and 2 without auxiliary variables or with only elevation perform more poorly especially when the number of training stations is lower 100 and 200 station sets this indicates that models 1 and 2 are less stable and less robust to variation in the density of training stations in sum model 4 has the best performance and is less affected by the density of training stations thus model 4 was used in the subsequent study for the tc gwr approach 4 3 comparison with other approaches figs 8 to 10 show the spatial rmse nse and bias of the ccs of spps from tc gwr compared with other approaches using the training station sets medians of the rmse nse and bias from 50 random sample sets are listed in table 4 except for the 10 station training set the three approaches generally outperform the original tc while for the extreme sparse 10 station set all approaches show unsatisfactory performance as there is no improvement in rmse nse and even bias in most conditions in most cases tc gwr shows the best performance among the three approaches given that its nse are highest while rmse and bias are smallest relative to the original tc mlr ranks second the performance of gwr without tc is generally poorer than tc gwr and mlr and is even poorer than the original tc when assessing cmorph with acceptable improvements in only the bias probably because of the involved tc results tc gwr and mlr show stable performance when the number of training stations ranges from 50 to 800 as their nse are high up to 0 76 and the rmse are low down to 0 03 even for the 50 station training set for the denser training station sets tc gwr shows superiority to mlr especially for the assessment of imerg e tc gwr might be superior to mlr in utilizing the information provided by denser training sets to capture spatial variation in relationships between c c tc and c c trad the performance of gwr without tc is generally unstable and sensitive to the density of training stations for example gwr without tc shows high performance similar to mlr and tc gwr for assessing imerg e and persiann cdr when a dense 800 training station set is used but the performance rapidly decreases when the sparser training station sets are used this indicates the importance of tc for accurately retrieving the spatial pattern of spps for tc gwr without the background field provided by the tc results gwr can only estimate the ccs of spps for ungauged areas using the point scale station data and geographic information and is thus more sensitive to the density of training stations and spatial heterogeneity in the accuracy of spps fig 11 and fig 12 show the spatial pattern of differences between the ccs of spps from the three approaches tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr and the traditional approach c c tc c c trad for the gauge stations the results using the training station sets of 200 and 800 stations were used as examples these results were selected from the training station sample sets featuring a median nse among the 50 random sample sets for each spp and approach the original tc overestimates the accuracy of spps in most areas of mainland china especially for persiann cdr and the error also shows high spatial variation these errors are reduced in the results of tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr especially in eastern china tc gwr generally shows the lowest error levels among the three approaches especially in the 800 station cases fig 9 the difference between c c tc and c c trad of all spps is close to zero for eastern and southwestern china in these cases note that these three approaches tend to show smaller improvements relative to the original tc in northwestern china compared with other areas as the local over and underestimation of the ccs of spps are still apparent especially for the 200 station cases gwr without tc shows high over and underestimation of the ccs of spps by up to 0 5 for northwestern china the sparser gauge stations and more complicated environment of northwestern china might be the main causes of the smaller improvements by comparison tc gwr and mlr show noticeable but much smaller over and underestimations in these areas even when the sparser 200 station training sets were used these findings reflect the lower stability and high sensitivity of gwr without tc to gauge density tc provided useful information on the spatial pattern of spp accuracy for tc gwr and mlr which enhanced their reliability in assessing spps in sparsely gauged areas fig 13 and fig 14 show the spatial pattern of the ranks of the accuracy of the spps at the gauge stations which are based on the cc values from the assessment approaches using the 200 and 800 station sets as examples these results were derived from the training station sample set with median nse out of the 50 random sample sets all the approaches except gwr without tc show close spatial patterns in the accuracy ranking of imerg e and imerg f with the traditional approach imerg e is ranked last in most of eastern china and is ranked the second and third in some areas in western china imerg f is ranked first for nearly all mainland china these approaches show discrepancies in the accuracy ranking for persiann cdr and cmorph based on the traditional approach persiann cdr is mainly ranked the second for northern china the third for southern china and the fourth for some areas in southwestern china the ranking patterns of tc gwr and mlr are most similar to the traditional approach whereas the original tc and gwr without tc overestimate the area where persiann cdr is ranked the second the traditional approach tc gwr and mlr show that cmorph is ranked the second over some areas in southern and southwestern china while original tc and gwr without tc underestimate and overestimate the area where cmorph is ranked the second respectively comparison of figs 13 and 14 reveals that spatial patterns of the ranks of spps show relatively low discrepancies for tc gwr and mlr when training station sets of different densities are used indicating the stability of both approaches the results above indicate the superiority of tc gwr for assessing differences in the accuracy of spps 4 4 assessment of spps figs 15 and 16 show the assessment results of the four spps by the tc gwr and other approaches the results based on the 200 and 800 training station sets were used as examples all approaches generally revealed the accuracy pattern of the four spps but some discrepancies were observed for the magnitude of ccs and other details in some areas according to results of tc gwr imerg e has high accuracy over the tibetan plateau southwestern china and part of northeastern china ccs over 0 9 poor accuracy over most of northwestern china ccs below 0 7 and moderate accuracy over the rest of china ccs of 0 8 0 9 the original tc overestimates the ccs in many areas such as northeastern china the accuracy pattern recovered by mlr is similar to that recovered by tc gwr and gwr without tc shows a smoother accuracy pattern of imerg e and lacked many spatial details especially when the 200 station training set was used for imerg f tc gwr and mlr report high accuracy ccs over 0 9 over most of mainland china and moderate accuracy ccs of 0 8 0 9 over northwestern china probably due to the effect of non zero ecc original tc systematically overestimates ccs and the estimated c c tc shows abnormal values over 1 in many areas which reveals the superiority of tc gwr and mlr gwr without tc recovered an accuracy pattern of imerg f closer to tc gwr but some spatial details were still lacking for persiann cdr all approaches show a similar spatial distribution of accuracy in which accuracy is high in northeastern china and the tibetan plateau however the original tc still systematically overestimates the cc cmorph shows high spatial heterogeneity in the accuracy pattern high ccs are observed for the eastern tibetan plateau northeastern china and part of southern china but fragments with moderate accuracy are also present tc gwr and mlr reduced the problem of abnormal cc values over 1 of original tc and preserved the details of the accuracy pattern of the original tc because gwr without tc only depends on c c trad over training stations and geographic auxiliary data many details of the accuracy pattern of cmorph are lost which precludes it from capturing the high spatial heterogeneity of the accuracy pattern this might explain why the performance of gwr without tc is even poorer than that of the original tc overall tc gwr and mlr show the most reliable and stable performance for assessing the spps and retrieving their accuracy patterns and are superior to the original tc and gwr without tc the original tc tends to overestimate the accuracy of spps and generates abnormally high cc values greater than 1 whereas gwr without tc typically fails to capture details of the accuracy patterns of spps 5 discussion 5 1 limitation of the original tc in this study the original tc shows relatively weak performance than the other gauge related approaches for most occasions even for the cases of relatively sparse 50 and 100 station sets for the four spps original tc commonly shows higher rmse and apparent positive systematic bias especially for persiann cdr some of the spps used in this study also have been used as cases in validation of the original tc in some former studies massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 according to the results of such studies the cc of imerg f derived by original tc had bias of about 0 02 to 0 08 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b the cc of persiann cdr had bias of about 0 05 to 0 09 for daily scale li et al 2018a li et al 2018b or of 0 02 to 0 04 for monthly scale bai et al 2021 while the cc of cmorph had bias of about 0 01 to 0 12 massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 also found the abnormal cc value that over 1 derived by tc the discrepancies in these results might be because of differences in research areas used gauge data adopted tc approach time range of spps etc even so the results of original tc in this study are still in reasonable range by comparing to the former studies non zero ecc represented by c o v ε i ε j in eq 2 is commonly regarded as the major cause of the deviations in original tc results massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 chen et al 2021 bai et al 2021 conducted a quantitative assessment on the ecc by taking the gauge data as true values and reported that the deviation in tc results is linked to the c o v ε i ε j values relative to the value of q ij in eq 2 overlapping satellite pmw data input used in spps and era5 might be a potential cause of the non zero ecc between spps and era5 moreover even though sm2rain ascat has relatively independent data source to other spps brocca et al 2019 and would feature low ecc with other spps chen et al 2021 it also introduced some era5 data such as the era5 rainfall used for sm2rain model calibration and bias correction of output data brocca et al 2019 chen et al 2021 so that caused the non zero ecc between sm2rain ascat and era5 such ecc have also been verified by a quantitative assessment of qc conducted by chen et al 2021 over europe and africa overall original tc still has the limitation in the performance of assessing the cc of spps due to the widespread non zero ecc over the precipitation estimation products thus further improvement would be necessary 5 2 superiority and potential improvement of tc gwr our results demonstrate that the performance and stability of tc gwr are higher compared with the original tc gwr without tc and mlr across several station densities suggesting that tc gwr has much potential to be used to assess spps over areas where gauge stations are sparse nevertheless it is required to consider potential sources of error and factors that could affect the performance of tc gwr the gwr approach has been widely used for integrating spps or other less reliable spatially continuous gridded environmental datasets with more reliable spatially discrete gauge observations arshad et al 2021 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2018a he and huang 2018 however this approach has not yet been used to improve the estimation of the accuracy pattern of spps assessed by tc with gauge data because the accuracy of precipitation estimations is usually related to the mechanism and amount of precipitation deng et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 these former gwr related studies provide useful references previous studies pointed out that the density and quality of the training stations that provide c c trad might critically affect the gwr results chen et al 2018a here six densities of training stations were used to investigate the effect of station density on the performance of tc gwr and the results indicates that tc gwr performs better when the density of stations is higher which is consistent with previous studies nevertheless at the relatively low density of training stations 50 station sets tc gwr still performs acceptably in most cases and only the extremely low density cases 10 station sets show no improvement in tc gwr by comparison gwr without tc not only shows high sensitivity to training station density but also has poorer performance under the lowest station density the assessment results of gwr without tc also show smoother patterns of spp accuracy this might indicate that the accuracy of precipitation estimation datasets also shows high spatial heterogeneity consequently estimations in areas of ungauged locations are difficult when only sparse gauge data are used therefore even though tc is affected by the non zero ecc and differs greatly from the assessment results based on the traditional approach tc is essential for tc gwr because it provides useful detailed information on the accuracy spatial patterns of spps li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 the evenness of the distribution of the training stations might also affect the gwr chen et al 2018a for each training station density 50 training station samples were randomly sampled from the 2180 gauge stations and the medians of the validation metrics over 50 samples were used to avoid undue impact of occasional outliers the results of the 50 random samples can also be used to investigate the effect of the distribution of training stations fig 17 and 18 show the spatial pattern of the standardized deviation of the ccs of spps from tc gwr and two other approaches over the 50 random samples the training station densities of 200 and 800 were also used as examples these three approaches show low uncertainty for different sets of random samples of training stations over eastern china this might be because the density of local training stations in eastern china is high as the example shown in fig 3 even though these training stations were randomly selected and thus might be unevenly distributed for northwestern china especially for western xinjiang and the tibetan plateau where gauge stations are highly sparse ccs estimated by the three approaches show high discrepancies among the 50 random samples these uncertainties are highly significant in the assessment results of gwr without tc but are also somewhat apparent for tc gwr and mlr this indicates that although the background field provided by the tc results was used in the tc gwr and mlr their performance can also be affected by the spatial distribution of training stations for ungauged remote and boundary areas even if the density of training stations remains constant the uncertainty of mlr is smaller than that of tc gwr for the boundary areas in some cases chen et al 2018a suggested that the performance of gwr is sensitive to extrapolation because it relies on local regression coefficients tc gwr might be relatively less reliable in these cases and mlr might be more suitable because of its constant global regression coefficients the mixed gwr model using global regression coefficients for part of the independent variables used by arshad et al 2021 might also be effective fig 16 according to previous studies of gwr the accuracy of background fields e g the tc results of this study and the auxiliary variables used might also affect the performance of tc gwr chen et al 2018a li et al 2018b in this study the performance of the original tc varied widely in assessing the four spps because of the effect of non zero ecc chen et al 2021 massari et al 2017 its performance was best for cmorph nse of ca 0 7 and poorest for imerg f nse of ca 0 2 nevertheless improvements in tc gwr from the original tc are not significantly related to the performance of the original tc in this study as the nses of tc gwr are approximately 0 7 for the spps except for imerg f probably because imerg f has consistent cc values of 0 9 over most areas chen et al 2018a also found that the gwr based approach was less affected by the error of the background field and the effect of the background field on the gwr based approach was complex which might be related to the spatially variable relationships between predictors and predictands and the introduction of other auxiliary variables the addition of auxiliary variables is known to have a substantial effect on the performance of gwr and related approaches chao et al 2018 chen et al 2020 lu et al 2019 chen et al 2018a because the auxiliary variables might potentially be related to the predictands and thus provide useful information to support predictions longitude latitude and elevation are the most commonly used auxiliary variables for gwr and were used in this study to characterize the accuracy of spps they are known to be linked to topographic and geographic factors deng et al 2019 comparison of different model candidates of tc gwr using different combinations of the auxiliary variables also demonstrates the superiority of using geographic auxiliary variables as models with more auxiliary variables have higher nse and their superiority compared with other models is greater when the density of training stations is sparse note that many other auxiliary variables such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst adopted for blending spps and gauge data arshad et al 2021 chao et al 2018 were not used because their relationship to the accuracy of spps remains unclear these variables might also be used for tc gwr in future applications once their relationship to spp accuracy is clarified 6 conclusion we contributed a novel approach tc gwr in this study to provide a valuable approach for assessing spps especially for areas and countries with limited gauge data in addition the tc gwr has been comprehensively tested to examine its performance tc gwr allows spps to be assessed reliably and spatially continuously in areas with limited gauge observations tc gwr integrates the point scale gauge based traditional approach and the spatially continuous gridded tc approach via gwr tc gwr was tested with a case study using four widely used spps over mainland china six densities of the gauge stations were used to train the gwr model 10 50 100 200 400 and 800 stations and test the impact of the gauge density on the performance of tc gwr validation of the model candidates of tc gwr indicates that geographical auxiliary data have a significant effect on its performance of the four model candidates using different combinations of geographical auxiliary data model 4 which used longitude latitude and elevation had the best performance in estimating the cc of spps and was the most robust to variation in the training gauge density except for the sparest 10 station cases and had the highest and most stable spatial nse smallest rmse and bias of the estimated ccs and model 3 which used only longitude and latitude ranked the second for the extremely sparse 10 station cases tc gwr shows unsatisfactory performance which reveals the limitation of gwr i e the less applicability when using extremely sparse gauge stations comparison of tc gwr with the original tc and two other approaches gwr without tc and mlr revealed that tc gwr remarkably outperformed the original tc and was superior to gwr without tc and mlr as it showed the highest performance in estimating the ccs of spps highest spatial nse of up to 0 76 and smallest rmse down to 0 03 tg gwr also showed stable performance among the different training gage densities even performing acceptably for the 50 station set mlr generally ranked the second probably because of its comparative disadvantage in the detection of the local spatial relationships between the tc results and traditional approach results gwr without tc usually showed much poorer performance than tc gwr and mlr and even poorer performance than the original tc in some cases and it was greatly affected by training sets with a low gauge density this reveals the difficulty of performing reliable and thorough assessments via the traditional approach when available gauge observations are sparse and indicates the superiority of the tc gwr approach for integrating reliability and spatial continuity nevertheless for the extremely sparse 10 station sets averagely only about one station per 10 6 km2 all approaches perform unsatisfactory with no improvement and even poorer performance than the original tc therefore it should be noted that the tc gwr might be unapplicable for such an extreme condition overall tc gwr generally shows acceptable and stable performance in generating accurate and spatially continuous assessment of the spps it provides a valuable alternative approach for assessing spps in areas with sparse gauge observations such as in remote mountainous

3477,assessment of the accuracy of satellite based precipitation products spps is essential prior to their use in formal applications however thorough assessments of spps by traditional approaches are typically not practical when gauge observations are sparse the triple collocation tc approach can be used to perform spatially continuous assessments but tc is affected by error and bias in this study a novel approach for the spatially continuous assessment of spps that integrates tc and the traditional discrete gauge based approach via geographically weighted regression gwr was developed this approach referred to as tc gwr allows spps to be assessed in areas with limited gauge observations the tc gwr was tested comprehensively through using four widely used spps over mainland china the tc gwr generates spatially continuous assessment results for spps and outperforms significantly the original tc approach in assessing the accuracy of spps quantitatively the performance of tc gwr was generally robust to variation in the density of gauge stations 50 100 200 400 and 800 gauge stations and showed acceptable performance when gauge data are relatively sparse except for the extremely sparse gauge cases only 10 stations over mainland china overall tc gwr integrates the advantages of the traditional approach higher reliability and the tc approach spatial continuity and provides a valuable alternative for assessing spps in areas with limited gauge observations such as remote mountainous areas and developing countries keywords satellite based precipitation product accuracy assessment triple collocation gauge based assessment approach geographically weighted regression 1 introduction satellite based precipitation products spps are precipitation estimates that are mainly derived from satellite remote sensing information such as passive microwave pmw infrared ir and spaceborne precipitation radar reflectivity hong et al 2012 tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018a compared with traditional gauge based station observations spps have several advantages such as wide spatial coverage and spatial continuity thus spps provide alternative precipitation data for areas with sparse or no gauge observations such as mountainous areas and developing countries bai et al 2019 hong et al 2012 tang et al 2020 yong et al 2015 widely used high resolution gridded spps include the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap mega et al 2019 the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 and the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement imerg hou et al 2014 these spps have been widely used for drought monitoring early flood warning hydrological and environmental modeling and water resources planning bai et al 2020 bai et al 2019 lai et al 2019 tang et al 2020 wang et al 2017a zhong et al 2019 nevertheless spps also have shortcomings such as low accuracy compared with gauge observations reductions in the accuracy of spps are caused by several factors including complicated surface conditions sampling error and insufficient sensitivity between electromagnetic signals and clouds aghakouchak et al 2011 chen et al 2018a kidd et al 2003 xie and arkin 1997 therefore the accuracy of spps needs to be assessed before they are used in formal applications deng et al 2019 lu et al 2021 massari et al 2017 zhong et al 2019 gauge observations are typically used as the benchmark for assessing the accuracy of spps because of their high accuracy and robustness this traditional assessment approach has been used in gauged areas worldwide aghakouchak et al 2011 deng et al 2019 tang et al 2018b tang et al 2020 wang et al 2017b zhong et al 2019 however because of the high spatial heterogeneity of precipitation the reliability of the traditional assessment approach depends on the quality and spatial density of gauge data massari et al 2017 tang et al 2018b when the gauge network is sparse the assessment results typically only represent the accuracy of spps at the location of the gauges the accuracy of spps over ungauged grid cells remains unclear shen and xiong 2016 zhong et al 2019 therefore thorough assessments for spps are difficult for areas with low gauge densities which hinders local applications of spps previous studies have indicated that the density of the current gauge network worldwide is sparse uneven and insufficient for the quantitative assessment of spps in many areas kidd et al 2017 massari et al 2017 it is critically needed to develop an assessment approach that is robust to variation in gauge densities recently the triple collocation tc approach which does not require benchmark data mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 has been proposed for the spatial continuous assessment of spps over the ungauged areas tc is based on the assumption of the error independence between three different estimate sources and can estimate the correlation coefficients between the estimates and the true values alemohammad et al 2015 mccoll et al 2014 tc has been used to assess the data products of various geophysical variables such as soil moisture ocean wind and wave heights under the conditions without reliable ground observations bai et al 2021 chen et al 2018b khaki et al 2018 mccoll et al 2014 tavakol et al 2019 in recent years some studies have used tc for global and regional spp assessments in various areas including the continental us europe africa mainland china and central asia alemohammad et al 2015 brocca et al 2019 chen et al 2021 li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 wu et al 2019 these studies have typically adopted a conventional spp a bottom up spps generated via different mechanisms which typically is the soil moisture to rain sm2rain products brocca et al 2019 and a model based reanalysis precipitation product as a triplet input for tc these studies have found that tc can accurately capture the spatial pattern of spp accuracy and is highly spatially correlated with the results of traditional approaches employing gauge stations nevertheless apparent biases have been noted for tc in applications and these biases reduce the efficacy of tc for the quantitative assessment of spps bai et al 2021 li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 non zero error cross correlation ecc is considered a major source of bias for example reanalysis precipitation products might introduce the same satellite pmw or ir data sources with spps for data assimilation and the spps also usually share the same remote sensing data or have similar error characteristics for the detection of small rainfall chen et al 2021 the propose of quadruple collocation qc approach alleviates the problem of ecc between precipitation datasets chen et al 2021 nevertheless qc assumes that non zero ecc exists between only two datasets which is also difficult to be satisfied in practices merging the less accurate but spatial continuous data with the more accurate but spatial discrete data is an effective approach to generate the more accurate and spatial continuous result bai et al 2019 li et al 2018b such approaches thus have the potential to integrate the advantage of spatial continuous of tc approach as well as the high accuracy of gauge based traditional assessment approach so that provide a reliable spatial continuous assessment for the spps over the sparsely gauged areas the geographically weighted regression gwr approach páez et al 2011 is one of the approaches that can merge continuous spatial prediction with discrete point data it is a geographical regression analysis approach that further improves and generalizes the traditional linear regression and considers the spatial variation of the regression relationships and can further effectively utilize the geographical auxiliary variables so that have higher fitting accuracy chen et al 2018b found that gwr approaches outperform other point grid merging approaches like geographical difference analysis gda and is less sensitive to errors in input gridded data the superiority of gwr also have been widely verified in several studies merging discrete gauge data and spatial continuous gridded data of geophysical and environmental variables such as precipitation air temperature and pm2 5 chao et al 2018 chen et al 2020 lu et al 2019 arshad et al 2021 chen et al 2015 he and huang 2018 karbalaye ghorbanpour et al 2021 li et al 2018b in a recent study deng et al 2019 the accuracy of spp was shown to be closely related to several geographical factors such as longitude latitude and elevation this indicates that more accurate spatially continuous assessment of spps might be achieved by integrating the traditional approach and tc via the gwr approach by further introducing such geographical factors the goal of this study was to develop a novel and reliable approach that can be used for spatially continuous assessment of spps in areas with sparse gauge observations in this approach the tc approach is utilized to provide spatial continuous assessment of spps the traditional approach is utilized to provide spatial discrete point scale but more accurate assessment of spps while the gwr is utilized to integrate the results of both assessment approach therefore this approach is referred to as tc gwr mainland china which has a vast territory with various climate types including humid and arid climates was used to test the tc gwr approach the objectives of this study were to 1 demonstrate and test the tc gwr approach and 2 compare the performance of tc gwr with the original tc and other related approaches to evaluate the performance and characteristics of the tc gwr four famous spps including cmorph persiann cdr and the early and final run products of imerg were used to validate the tc gwr approach this study contributed a valuable approach for assessing spps over remote areas and developing countries with limited gauge observations 2 study area and data 2 1 mainland china mainland china fig 1 was used as the study area to test the tc gwr approach it has a vast territory and is located to the northwest of the pacific ocean the elevation of mainland china is high in the southwest tibetan plateau and low in the east southern and northern mainland china are dominated by a humid subtropical and a semi humid temperate monsoon climate respectively the northwest is dominated by an arid and semi arid temperate continental climate and the southwest tibetan plateau is dominated by a cold and arid alpine plateau climate therefore mainland china varies greatly in climate terrain and land cover type precipitation is abundant on the southeast shore up to 2000 mm per year and low in the northwest inland below 200 mm per year 2 2 imerg imerg hou et al 2014 is currently the most famous spp it provides level 3 precipitation data at a 0 1 spatial resolution and the temporal resolution up to half hourly the latest version 06 of imerg tan et al 2019 provides long term precipitation data since june 2000 by integrating remote sensing data such as infrared ir passive microwave pmw and precipitation radar data from various satellite missions including trmm and gpm the two releases of imerg the early run product imerg e and the final run product imerg f were used in this study the imerg e is a near real time product that is generated only by satellite remote sensing information and updates precipitation data approximately 4 h after real time whereas imerg f is a post processing product that incorporates gauge observations from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and thus has higher accuracy but much longer latency ca 2 months than imerg e the imerg products were downloaded from the gpm website https pmm nasa gov dataaccess downloads gpm both the imerg e and imerg f were spatially resampled to 0 25 temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 3 persiann cdr persiann cdr ashouri et al 2015 was developed by the university of california irvine uci it provides semi global long term precipitation data since 1983 with a spatial resolution of 0 25 and daily timescale to address the need of consistent long term high resolution and global precipitation data persiann cdr is produced from the satellite based ir brightness temperature data via an adaptive artificial neural network ann model that is trained by using stage iv radar based precipitation data of the national center for environmental prediction ncep a 2 5 monthly precipitation dataset called the global precipitation climatology project gpcp was used to bias correct the persiann cdr to improve accuracy and reliability the persiann cdr data were derived from the data portal of the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at uci http chrsdata eng uci edu the downloaded persiann cdr data were at daily resolution but then temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 4 cmorph cmorph joyce et al 2004 is a widely used spp that incorporates satellite based ir and pmw information and it provides precipitation data at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and temporal resolutions of daily and 3 hourly since 1998 cmorph is produced by propagating the pmw precipitation estimations via the motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite ir data the adopted release of cmorph in this study is the bias corrected cmorph cmorph crt which is produced by matching the probability distribution function between the original cmorph and daily gauge observations of the climate prediction center cpc over the contiguous united states the cmorph data were downloaded from the cpc website https ftp cpc ncep noaa gov precip cmorph v1 0 the downloaded cmorph data were at daily resolution then temporally aggregated to monthly timescale for experiment 2 5 sm2rain ascat the sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 is a high resolution semi global spp produced by a bottom up approach it is distinct from traditional spps because it is inversely inferred from soil moisture data retrieved from the advanced scatterometer ascat via a soil water balance model brocca et al 2014 brocca et al 2013 ascat is a real aperture radar instrument on metop satellites that measures radar backscatter at the c band and is currently rarely used by other precipitation estimation products sm2rain ascat is thus relatively independent of most other spps in both mechanism and data sources and is widely used as a triplet input for tc chen et al 2021 massari et al 2017 sm2rain ascat provides precipitation data from 2007 with a spatial resolution of approximately 12 5 km the sm2rain ascat data were resampled to 0 25 grid cells in this study 2 6 era5 precipitation product era5 hersbach et al 2020 is the latest set of global atmospheric reanalysis data generated by the copernicus climate change service c3s and it provides long term global precipitation assimilation data from 1979 to the present era5 is produced by applying a four dimensional variational algorithm on the latest integrated forecasting system ifs cycle 41r2 of emcwf which realizes several upgrades based on the antecedent era interim including a higher spatial resolution of 0 25 and improved variational bias scheme integrating more historical observations era5 and other reanalyses are often conducted as a triplet member to assess the spps by using tc because of their distinct mechanisms based on atmospheric physical modeling compared with most spps the era5 precipitation data were obtained from the c3s website https doi org 10 24381 cds f17050d7 2 7 gauge observations a widely used gauge interpolated gridded precipitation data product over mainland china called china gauge based daily precipitation analysis cgdpa shen and xiong 2016 released by the china meteorological administration cma was used as the reference for the gauge based traditional assessment approach and to validate the results of tc gwr cgdpa is produced by precipitation observations from about 2400 gauges over mainland china via an optimal interpolation approach that considers topography at a spatial resolution of 0 25 because the source data of the 2400 gauges were not available 0 25 grid cells of cgdpa that contain at least one gauge were considered to represent gauge stations according to the reliability model of the reference data for the timescale and gauge density proposed by tang et al 2018b one gauge station for 0 25 grid cells is adequate for limiting the error of the calculated correlation coefficient 5 for monthly scale therefore we suggest that the cgdpa data at these grid cells are reasonable for representing the true precipitation at the monthly scale based on the cgdpa metadata we further eliminated grid cells with an excessive number of timesteps months without observations only grid cells with an observation rate over 99 from 2007 to 2018 were selected and regarded as gauge stations finally 2180 grid cells were selected to obviate confusion the centers of these grid cells represented location of gauge stations and the corresponding cgdpa data represented gauge data 3 methods 3 1 triple collocation and traditional assessment approach the tc approach can assess the spps by indirectly estimating the correlation coefficient cc between the spps and the truth which is a widely used accuracy indicator of spps in the tc gwr approach the cc of the spps by tc approach hereafter as c c tc is firstly estimated at all gridcells over the study area next the cc of the spps is also calculated by traditional assessment approach hereafter as c c trad over the gauge stations by directly referencing to the gauge observations finally the spatial continuous c c tc and the point scale c c trad are merged by gwr approach the tc approach mccoll et al 2014 stoffelen 1998 can estimate the cc between the precipitation estimations and the truth without reference data it requires three precipitation estimation datasets generated via different mechanisms tc is based on an additive error model as follows 1 x i α i β i t ε i where x i denotes the precipitation estimations from triplet member i i 1 2 3 t is the truth α i and β i denote the ordinary least squares intercepts and ε i denotes the random error the covariance between each of the two triplet members q ij can be expressed as follows 2 q ij c o v r i r j β i β j σ t 2 β i c o v ε j t β j c o v ε i t α i e ε j α j e ε i c o v ε i ε j where c o v denotes covariance e denotes mean value the following assumptions are made for each triplet member the random errors have zero means e ε i 0 the error cross correlation ecc is zero c o v ε i ε j 0 for i j and the errors are uncorrelated with truth c o v ε i t 0 therefore q ij can also be expressed as follows 3 q ij c o v x i x j β i 2 σ 2 t σ 2 ε i i j β i β j σ 2 t i j where q ij denotes the covariance between triplet member i and j and c o v and σ 2 denote the covariance and variance function respectively under this framework the cc between triplet member i and the truth i e indicator of the accuracy of triplet member i can be determined as 4 c c x i t c o v x i t σ 2 x i σ 2 t β i σ 2 t q ii σ 2 t β i σ 2 t q ii β i 2 σ 2 t q ii by solving equations 2 and 3 the c c tc of each triplet member can be derived as mccoll et al 2014 5 cc tc 1 q 12 q 13 q 11 q 23 cc tc 2 q 12 q 23 q 22 q 13 cc tc 3 q 13 q 23 q 33 q 12 four triplets were used to assess the four spps via tc 1 sm2rain ascat era5 and imerg e triplet a 2 sm2rain ascat era5 and imerg f triplet b 3 sm2rain ascat era5 and persiann cdr triplet c and 4 sm2rain ascat era5 and cmorph triplet d in the traditional assessment approach the c c trad is calculated with referencing to the gauge observations 6 c c trad c o v x r σ 2 x σ 2 r where r denotes the gauge observations and x denotes the spp data in this study the assessments of the spps were performed at the monthly time scale for the period of 2007 to 2018 3 2 geographically weighted regression gwr in the tc gwr approach gwr páez et al 2011 is used to integrate the results of tc and the gauge based traditional approach more specifically the c c tc of the four spps estimated by tc is corrected by using the gauge based traditional approach results c c trad at the gauge stations gwr is a spatial regression approach that aims to predict unknown variables at some locations according to local auxiliary variables and needs to be trained by a finite training dataset gwr is a localization extension of the traditional linear regression algorithm and the regression coefficients are related to the geographical relationships associated with the locations of training datasets the gwr model used in this study is shown as 7 y i β 0 u i v i k 1 m β k u i v i x i k i where y i is the dependent variable for example c c trad in this study at location i x i k is the k th independent variable for example c c tc and geographical auxiliary data like elevation in this study of location i β 0 u i v i and β k u i v i are the regression coefficients of location i which is the function related to u i and v i the coordinates m is the number of dependent variables and i is the residual the regression coefficients can be estimated by solving the following equation 8 β i x t w i x 1 x t w i y where β i is the vector of the estimated regression coefficient at location i requiring prediction x is the matrix of independent variables of the training set rows denote different samples and columns denote different variables y is the vector of dependent variables of the training set and w is the spatial weighting matrix the weights in w are typically specified by continuous monotonic decreasing functions of the distance between the training samples and the location needing prediction the gaussian kernel was used to calculate the weights 9 w ij exp d ij 2 b j 2 where w ij is the weight between location i and the location of the training sample j d ij is the distance b j is the kernel bandwidth of training sample j which are the hyperparameters needing to be determined by cross validation to improve the performance of tc gwr longitude latitude and elevation were used as additional auxiliary data to aid the integration of c c tc and c c trad via gwr because they can potentially affect the performance of spps the elevation data of mainland china were derived from digital elevation model dem data of the shuttle radar topography mission srtm project farr et al 2007 and were resampled to 0 25 grid cells the gwr model was trained using the c c trad based on gauge data the corresponding c c tc and the additional auxiliary data longitude latitude elevation at the gauge stations c c trad was used as the dependent variable c c tc and the auxiliary data were used as independent variables the merged cc was then denoted by c c tc g w r a flowchart of the tc gwr approach is shown in fig 2 note that the distribution of the gauge stations in our case study was uneven fig 1 therefore the kernel bandwidth of gwr was determined in an adaptive manner i e using the number of influencing stations n as the variable to be optimized by cross validation for each prediction location the bandwidth was set as its distance to the location of the n th nearest training sample 3 3 experiment design a random sampling procedure was used to validate the proposed tc gwr approach given that gauge density has a significant impact on point grid merging bai et al 2019 the training datasets for the gwr model were randomly sampled from the 2180 gauge stations with six sampling sizes to represent different gauge densities which includes 10 50 100 200 400 and 800 stations respectively the sampling size of 10 stations averagely nearly one station per 10 6 km2 represents an extreme condition with highly sparse gauges the rest of the gauge stations were used as a validation set to validate the performance of tc gwr to guarantee the fairness of the validations for the four sampling sizes of training sets the size of the validation sets was consistently set to 2180 800 1380 stations for the four sampling sizes for each sampling size random sampling with replacement was performed 50 times tc gwr was trained using the training sets from each random sample and the prediction results were validated through using the corresponding validation sets fig 3 shows the training and validation station sets of one of the 50 random samples four model candidates of tc gwr with different auxiliary data were designed to investigate the impacts of the auxiliary variables only c c tc was used as an independent variable of tc gwr in the model 1 whereas different combinations of longitude latitude and elevation with c c tc as independent variables were used in models 2 3 and 4 more specifically model 2 uses both c c tc and elevation model 3 uses both c c tc and spatial coordinates longitude and latitude while model 4 use all independent variables c c tc elevation and spatial coordinates independent variables of the four model candidates are also listed in table 1 moreover additional approaches for estimating the ccs of the spps for comparison with tc gwr were also adopted to facilitate the study of the superiority of tc gwr and are detailed below 1 gwr without tc similar to tc gwr longitude latitude and elevation were used as independent variables but c c tc was excluded this can be considered to represent the non c c tc version of model 4 of tc gwr or the traditional spatial interpolation of c c trad 2 multiple linear regression mlr this model assumes that c c trad is the simple linear sum of independent variables including c c tc longitude latitude and elevation 10 y i a 0 k 1 m a k x i k i where a 0 and a k are the regression coefficients which are global constants unrelated to spatial location the mlr model was trained by the ordinary least squares method independent variables of tc gwr the gwr without tc and mlr are also listed in table 1 three validation metrics were used to validate the quantitative performance of tc gwr and other approaches for comparison including the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and the bias for more convenient description of the metrics hereafter the ccs estimated by the non traditional approaches including original tc tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr are collectively abbreviated as cc esti rmse quantifies the absolute error of the cc esti relative to the c c trad at the validation stations 11 rmse cc esti cc trad 2 n where n is the number of cc esti records smaller rmse indicates better performance and target value of rmse is 0 nse quantifies the normalized fitness of the estimated ccs of spps along with the c c trad among the validation stations 12 nse 1 cc esti cc trad 2 cc trad cc trad 2 where cc trad is the mean value of cc trad among all validation stations higher nse indicates better performance and target value of nse is 1 bias quantifies the absolute systematic bias of the estimated ccs of spps relative to the c c trad among the validation stations 13 bias cc esti cc trad 1 where cc esti is the mean value of cc esti among all validation stations target value of bias is 0 and positive negative value of bias indicates overestimation underestimation respectively 4 results 4 1 evaluation of original tc approach before applying the tc gwr approach it is necessary to understand the performance tc approach for better realizing the improvement of tc gwr spatial map of c c trad and c c tc along with their standard deviation std at the gauge stations are shown in fig 4 we also calculated the rmse nse bias of the c c tc with referenced to c c trad at all gauge stations and results are shown in table 2 c c trad in fig 4 shows that imerg f generally has best accurate while imerg e has the poorest accuracy among the four spps c c trad of imerg f shows smallest std 0 048 because accuracy of imerg f is very high for most area of mainland china with many similar c c trad values close to 1 cmorph shows highest std 0 124 indicating that its accuracy varies greatly among different areas c c tc shows similar overall spatial pattern with c c trad revealing the reasonability of tc in capturing spatial pattern of spps accuracy however overall overestimation of cc of different extent by tc is also widely found for the four spps with positive bias of 0 02 to 0 06 especially for the imerg f and persiann cdr which even shows abnormal cc values over 1 similar results were also found by relative studies like massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b and bai et al 2021 rmses of c c tc are also apparent which is lowest for imerg f 0 053 and highest for persiann cdr 0 076 however due to the low spatial variation of cc of imerg f error of c c tc presents relatively large magnitude compared to the low std of cc causing the poorest nse 0 22 for imerg f according to eq 12 nse value depends on the ratio between the error of estimations and variation of benchmark data by comparison c c tc shows highest nse for cmorph due to the high spatial variation of cc of cmorph although the rmse of cmorph is also high 0 068 anyhow these results above further indicate the necessity of improvement for tc 4 2 performance of different tc gwr models figs 5 to 7 show the spatial rmse nse and bias of the ccs of spps from four model candidates of tc gwr by using the training station sets of 10 800 stations medians of these validation metrics from 50 random sample sets are listed in table 3 except for the 10 station training set all model candidates of tc gwr show higher performance than the original tc in most cases which resulted in decrement in spatial rmse by up to 0 03 improvements in spatial nse by up to 0 8 and reduced bias closed to 0 for the four spps the improvement in the assessment of cmorph by tc gwr was less compared with other approaches probably because the performance of the original tc was already high for cmorph nevertheless for the extremely sparse station sets all model candidates show no improvement and even poorer performance than the original tc with a wider range of the validation metrics as shown in fig 3 there might be even no stations over the west and northeast china in the 10 station sets which can cause the failure of tc gwr over these areas this might reveal the limitation of tc gwr that it might be not applicable when the gauge stations are extremely sparse since all approaches are unapplicable under the cases of 10 station sets relative results would be less mentioned in the following among the four model candidates of tc gwr except for the extremely sparse 10 station sets model 4 shows the best performance and stability over the different training stations probably because it includes all geographic auxiliary variables longitude latitude and elevation model 3 ranks second compared with model 4 elevation was excluded in model 3 which might suggest that elevation information is less important than spatial information longitude and latitude when integrating the results of tc and the traditional approach model 1 and 2 without auxiliary variables or with only elevation perform more poorly especially when the number of training stations is lower 100 and 200 station sets this indicates that models 1 and 2 are less stable and less robust to variation in the density of training stations in sum model 4 has the best performance and is less affected by the density of training stations thus model 4 was used in the subsequent study for the tc gwr approach 4 3 comparison with other approaches figs 8 to 10 show the spatial rmse nse and bias of the ccs of spps from tc gwr compared with other approaches using the training station sets medians of the rmse nse and bias from 50 random sample sets are listed in table 4 except for the 10 station training set the three approaches generally outperform the original tc while for the extreme sparse 10 station set all approaches show unsatisfactory performance as there is no improvement in rmse nse and even bias in most conditions in most cases tc gwr shows the best performance among the three approaches given that its nse are highest while rmse and bias are smallest relative to the original tc mlr ranks second the performance of gwr without tc is generally poorer than tc gwr and mlr and is even poorer than the original tc when assessing cmorph with acceptable improvements in only the bias probably because of the involved tc results tc gwr and mlr show stable performance when the number of training stations ranges from 50 to 800 as their nse are high up to 0 76 and the rmse are low down to 0 03 even for the 50 station training set for the denser training station sets tc gwr shows superiority to mlr especially for the assessment of imerg e tc gwr might be superior to mlr in utilizing the information provided by denser training sets to capture spatial variation in relationships between c c tc and c c trad the performance of gwr without tc is generally unstable and sensitive to the density of training stations for example gwr without tc shows high performance similar to mlr and tc gwr for assessing imerg e and persiann cdr when a dense 800 training station set is used but the performance rapidly decreases when the sparser training station sets are used this indicates the importance of tc for accurately retrieving the spatial pattern of spps for tc gwr without the background field provided by the tc results gwr can only estimate the ccs of spps for ungauged areas using the point scale station data and geographic information and is thus more sensitive to the density of training stations and spatial heterogeneity in the accuracy of spps fig 11 and fig 12 show the spatial pattern of differences between the ccs of spps from the three approaches tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr and the traditional approach c c tc c c trad for the gauge stations the results using the training station sets of 200 and 800 stations were used as examples these results were selected from the training station sample sets featuring a median nse among the 50 random sample sets for each spp and approach the original tc overestimates the accuracy of spps in most areas of mainland china especially for persiann cdr and the error also shows high spatial variation these errors are reduced in the results of tc gwr gwr without tc and mlr especially in eastern china tc gwr generally shows the lowest error levels among the three approaches especially in the 800 station cases fig 9 the difference between c c tc and c c trad of all spps is close to zero for eastern and southwestern china in these cases note that these three approaches tend to show smaller improvements relative to the original tc in northwestern china compared with other areas as the local over and underestimation of the ccs of spps are still apparent especially for the 200 station cases gwr without tc shows high over and underestimation of the ccs of spps by up to 0 5 for northwestern china the sparser gauge stations and more complicated environment of northwestern china might be the main causes of the smaller improvements by comparison tc gwr and mlr show noticeable but much smaller over and underestimations in these areas even when the sparser 200 station training sets were used these findings reflect the lower stability and high sensitivity of gwr without tc to gauge density tc provided useful information on the spatial pattern of spp accuracy for tc gwr and mlr which enhanced their reliability in assessing spps in sparsely gauged areas fig 13 and fig 14 show the spatial pattern of the ranks of the accuracy of the spps at the gauge stations which are based on the cc values from the assessment approaches using the 200 and 800 station sets as examples these results were derived from the training station sample set with median nse out of the 50 random sample sets all the approaches except gwr without tc show close spatial patterns in the accuracy ranking of imerg e and imerg f with the traditional approach imerg e is ranked last in most of eastern china and is ranked the second and third in some areas in western china imerg f is ranked first for nearly all mainland china these approaches show discrepancies in the accuracy ranking for persiann cdr and cmorph based on the traditional approach persiann cdr is mainly ranked the second for northern china the third for southern china and the fourth for some areas in southwestern china the ranking patterns of tc gwr and mlr are most similar to the traditional approach whereas the original tc and gwr without tc overestimate the area where persiann cdr is ranked the second the traditional approach tc gwr and mlr show that cmorph is ranked the second over some areas in southern and southwestern china while original tc and gwr without tc underestimate and overestimate the area where cmorph is ranked the second respectively comparison of figs 13 and 14 reveals that spatial patterns of the ranks of spps show relatively low discrepancies for tc gwr and mlr when training station sets of different densities are used indicating the stability of both approaches the results above indicate the superiority of tc gwr for assessing differences in the accuracy of spps 4 4 assessment of spps figs 15 and 16 show the assessment results of the four spps by the tc gwr and other approaches the results based on the 200 and 800 training station sets were used as examples all approaches generally revealed the accuracy pattern of the four spps but some discrepancies were observed for the magnitude of ccs and other details in some areas according to results of tc gwr imerg e has high accuracy over the tibetan plateau southwestern china and part of northeastern china ccs over 0 9 poor accuracy over most of northwestern china ccs below 0 7 and moderate accuracy over the rest of china ccs of 0 8 0 9 the original tc overestimates the ccs in many areas such as northeastern china the accuracy pattern recovered by mlr is similar to that recovered by tc gwr and gwr without tc shows a smoother accuracy pattern of imerg e and lacked many spatial details especially when the 200 station training set was used for imerg f tc gwr and mlr report high accuracy ccs over 0 9 over most of mainland china and moderate accuracy ccs of 0 8 0 9 over northwestern china probably due to the effect of non zero ecc original tc systematically overestimates ccs and the estimated c c tc shows abnormal values over 1 in many areas which reveals the superiority of tc gwr and mlr gwr without tc recovered an accuracy pattern of imerg f closer to tc gwr but some spatial details were still lacking for persiann cdr all approaches show a similar spatial distribution of accuracy in which accuracy is high in northeastern china and the tibetan plateau however the original tc still systematically overestimates the cc cmorph shows high spatial heterogeneity in the accuracy pattern high ccs are observed for the eastern tibetan plateau northeastern china and part of southern china but fragments with moderate accuracy are also present tc gwr and mlr reduced the problem of abnormal cc values over 1 of original tc and preserved the details of the accuracy pattern of the original tc because gwr without tc only depends on c c trad over training stations and geographic auxiliary data many details of the accuracy pattern of cmorph are lost which precludes it from capturing the high spatial heterogeneity of the accuracy pattern this might explain why the performance of gwr without tc is even poorer than that of the original tc overall tc gwr and mlr show the most reliable and stable performance for assessing the spps and retrieving their accuracy patterns and are superior to the original tc and gwr without tc the original tc tends to overestimate the accuracy of spps and generates abnormally high cc values greater than 1 whereas gwr without tc typically fails to capture details of the accuracy patterns of spps 5 discussion 5 1 limitation of the original tc in this study the original tc shows relatively weak performance than the other gauge related approaches for most occasions even for the cases of relatively sparse 50 and 100 station sets for the four spps original tc commonly shows higher rmse and apparent positive systematic bias especially for persiann cdr some of the spps used in this study also have been used as cases in validation of the original tc in some former studies massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 according to the results of such studies the cc of imerg f derived by original tc had bias of about 0 02 to 0 08 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b the cc of persiann cdr had bias of about 0 05 to 0 09 for daily scale li et al 2018a li et al 2018b or of 0 02 to 0 04 for monthly scale bai et al 2021 while the cc of cmorph had bias of about 0 01 to 0 12 massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 also found the abnormal cc value that over 1 derived by tc the discrepancies in these results might be because of differences in research areas used gauge data adopted tc approach time range of spps etc even so the results of original tc in this study are still in reasonable range by comparing to the former studies non zero ecc represented by c o v ε i ε j in eq 2 is commonly regarded as the major cause of the deviations in original tc results massari et al 2017 li et al 2018a li et al 2018b bai et al 2021 chen et al 2021 bai et al 2021 conducted a quantitative assessment on the ecc by taking the gauge data as true values and reported that the deviation in tc results is linked to the c o v ε i ε j values relative to the value of q ij in eq 2 overlapping satellite pmw data input used in spps and era5 might be a potential cause of the non zero ecc between spps and era5 moreover even though sm2rain ascat has relatively independent data source to other spps brocca et al 2019 and would feature low ecc with other spps chen et al 2021 it also introduced some era5 data such as the era5 rainfall used for sm2rain model calibration and bias correction of output data brocca et al 2019 chen et al 2021 so that caused the non zero ecc between sm2rain ascat and era5 such ecc have also been verified by a quantitative assessment of qc conducted by chen et al 2021 over europe and africa overall original tc still has the limitation in the performance of assessing the cc of spps due to the widespread non zero ecc over the precipitation estimation products thus further improvement would be necessary 5 2 superiority and potential improvement of tc gwr our results demonstrate that the performance and stability of tc gwr are higher compared with the original tc gwr without tc and mlr across several station densities suggesting that tc gwr has much potential to be used to assess spps over areas where gauge stations are sparse nevertheless it is required to consider potential sources of error and factors that could affect the performance of tc gwr the gwr approach has been widely used for integrating spps or other less reliable spatially continuous gridded environmental datasets with more reliable spatially discrete gauge observations arshad et al 2021 chen et al 2015 chen et al 2018a he and huang 2018 however this approach has not yet been used to improve the estimation of the accuracy pattern of spps assessed by tc with gauge data because the accuracy of precipitation estimations is usually related to the mechanism and amount of precipitation deng et al 2019 zhong et al 2019 these former gwr related studies provide useful references previous studies pointed out that the density and quality of the training stations that provide c c trad might critically affect the gwr results chen et al 2018a here six densities of training stations were used to investigate the effect of station density on the performance of tc gwr and the results indicates that tc gwr performs better when the density of stations is higher which is consistent with previous studies nevertheless at the relatively low density of training stations 50 station sets tc gwr still performs acceptably in most cases and only the extremely low density cases 10 station sets show no improvement in tc gwr by comparison gwr without tc not only shows high sensitivity to training station density but also has poorer performance under the lowest station density the assessment results of gwr without tc also show smoother patterns of spp accuracy this might indicate that the accuracy of precipitation estimation datasets also shows high spatial heterogeneity consequently estimations in areas of ungauged locations are difficult when only sparse gauge data are used therefore even though tc is affected by the non zero ecc and differs greatly from the assessment results based on the traditional approach tc is essential for tc gwr because it provides useful detailed information on the accuracy spatial patterns of spps li et al 2018a massari et al 2017 the evenness of the distribution of the training stations might also affect the gwr chen et al 2018a for each training station density 50 training station samples were randomly sampled from the 2180 gauge stations and the medians of the validation metrics over 50 samples were used to avoid undue impact of occasional outliers the results of the 50 random samples can also be used to investigate the effect of the distribution of training stations fig 17 and 18 show the spatial pattern of the standardized deviation of the ccs of spps from tc gwr and two other approaches over the 50 random samples the training station densities of 200 and 800 were also used as examples these three approaches show low uncertainty for different sets of random samples of training stations over eastern china this might be because the density of local training stations in eastern china is high as the example shown in fig 3 even though these training stations were randomly selected and thus might be unevenly distributed for northwestern china especially for western xinjiang and the tibetan plateau where gauge stations are highly sparse ccs estimated by the three approaches show high discrepancies among the 50 random samples these uncertainties are highly significant in the assessment results of gwr without tc but are also somewhat apparent for tc gwr and mlr this indicates that although the background field provided by the tc results was used in the tc gwr and mlr their performance can also be affected by the spatial distribution of training stations for ungauged remote and boundary areas even if the density of training stations remains constant the uncertainty of mlr is smaller than that of tc gwr for the boundary areas in some cases chen et al 2018a suggested that the performance of gwr is sensitive to extrapolation because it relies on local regression coefficients tc gwr might be relatively less reliable in these cases and mlr might be more suitable because of its constant global regression coefficients the mixed gwr model using global regression coefficients for part of the independent variables used by arshad et al 2021 might also be effective fig 16 according to previous studies of gwr the accuracy of background fields e g the tc results of this study and the auxiliary variables used might also affect the performance of tc gwr chen et al 2018a li et al 2018b in this study the performance of the original tc varied widely in assessing the four spps because of the effect of non zero ecc chen et al 2021 massari et al 2017 its performance was best for cmorph nse of ca 0 7 and poorest for imerg f nse of ca 0 2 nevertheless improvements in tc gwr from the original tc are not significantly related to the performance of the original tc in this study as the nses of tc gwr are approximately 0 7 for the spps except for imerg f probably because imerg f has consistent cc values of 0 9 over most areas chen et al 2018a also found that the gwr based approach was less affected by the error of the background field and the effect of the background field on the gwr based approach was complex which might be related to the spatially variable relationships between predictors and predictands and the introduction of other auxiliary variables the addition of auxiliary variables is known to have a substantial effect on the performance of gwr and related approaches chao et al 2018 chen et al 2020 lu et al 2019 chen et al 2018a because the auxiliary variables might potentially be related to the predictands and thus provide useful information to support predictions longitude latitude and elevation are the most commonly used auxiliary variables for gwr and were used in this study to characterize the accuracy of spps they are known to be linked to topographic and geographic factors deng et al 2019 comparison of different model candidates of tc gwr using different combinations of the auxiliary variables also demonstrates the superiority of using geographic auxiliary variables as models with more auxiliary variables have higher nse and their superiority compared with other models is greater when the density of training stations is sparse note that many other auxiliary variables such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land surface temperature lst adopted for blending spps and gauge data arshad et al 2021 chao et al 2018 were not used because their relationship to the accuracy of spps remains unclear these variables might also be used for tc gwr in future applications once their relationship to spp accuracy is clarified 6 conclusion we contributed a novel approach tc gwr in this study to provide a valuable approach for assessing spps especially for areas and countries with limited gauge data in addition the tc gwr has been comprehensively tested to examine its performance tc gwr allows spps to be assessed reliably and spatially continuously in areas with limited gauge observations tc gwr integrates the point scale gauge based traditional approach and the spatially continuous gridded tc approach via gwr tc gwr was tested with a case study using four widely used spps over mainland china six densities of the gauge stations were used to train the gwr model 10 50 100 200 400 and 800 stations and test the impact of the gauge density on the performance of tc gwr validation of the model candidates of tc gwr indicates that geographical auxiliary data have a significant effect on its performance of the four model candidates using different combinations of geographical auxiliary data model 4 which used longitude latitude and elevation had the best performance in estimating the cc of spps and was the most robust to variation in the training gauge density except for the sparest 10 station cases and had the highest and most stable spatial nse smallest rmse and bias of the estimated ccs and model 3 which used only longitude and latitude ranked the second for the extremely sparse 10 station cases tc gwr shows unsatisfactory performance which reveals the limitation of gwr i e the less applicability when using extremely sparse gauge stations comparison of tc gwr with the original tc and two other approaches gwr without tc and mlr revealed that tc gwr remarkably outperformed the original tc and was superior to gwr without tc and mlr as it showed the highest performance in estimating the ccs of spps highest spatial nse of up to 0 76 and smallest rmse down to 0 03 tg gwr also showed stable performance among the different training gage densities even performing acceptably for the 50 station set mlr generally ranked the second probably because of its comparative disadvantage in the detection of the local spatial relationships between the tc results and traditional approach results gwr without tc usually showed much poorer performance than tc gwr and mlr and even poorer performance than the original tc in some cases and it was greatly affected by training sets with a low gauge density this reveals the difficulty of performing reliable and thorough assessments via the traditional approach when available gauge observations are sparse and indicates the superiority of the tc gwr approach for integrating reliability and spatial continuity nevertheless for the extremely sparse 10 station sets averagely only about one station per 10 6 km2 all approaches perform unsatisfactory with no improvement and even poorer performance than the original tc therefore it should be noted that the tc gwr might be unapplicable for such an extreme condition overall tc gwr generally shows acceptable and stable performance in generating accurate and spatially continuous assessment of the spps it provides a valuable alternative approach for assessing spps in areas with sparse gauge observations such as in remote mountainous

3478,process based models have been widely used for hydrologic modeling and it is a common practice to use sensitivity analysis methods for excluding non influential hydrologic processes from further investigation and or model improvement this study develops a new method called multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method to screen non influential system processes and parameters mmads is conceptually similar to the morris method for addressing parametric uncertainty but has a unique feature to address both process model uncertainty i e a process may be represented by multiple process models and process model parameter uncertainty i e parameters associated with a process model are random mmads first evaluates absolute differences of a quantity of interest i e a system model output by varying process models and or process model parameter values and then calculates the mean and variance of the differences for investigating process influence the mean measures overall influence of the process on the quantity of interest and the variance estimates influence of nonlinear effects of the process and or its interactions with other processes mmads is an extension of the morris method from a parameter space to a joint parameter model space for explicitly addressing both process model uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty the performance of mmads is evaluated by using two numerical experiments one experiment is based on sobol s g function with ten product elements and has analytical solutions of the mmads mean and variance of absolute differences the other experiment is for groundwater flow modeling which considers three processes i e recharge geology and snowmelt that interact with each other results indicate that mmads is computationally efficient and can identify non influential processes of complex hydrological systems keywords model uncertainty process sensitivity non influential process morris method 1 introduction process based hydrological modeling has been widely used over the last couple of decades for understanding and predicting behaviors of hydrological and environmental systems clark et al 2015a 2015b gorelick and zheng 2015 singh 2018 these systems are often open and complex and involve a number of processes and process interactions brenner et al 2018 clark et al 2015c beven 2002 noted that the development of more and more complex models that incorporate more and more detail about processes but which introduce more and more parameters that must be calibrated does not appear to be the future it is also unnecessary to include all system processes and process interactions because it happens often that only a subset of processes exerts a strong influence on system behaviors it is a common practice in hydrologic and environmental modeling to first identify non influential processes and process interactions and then to exclude them from model development and or improvement e g singh 2018 zeng et al 2018 ciric et al 2012 ketema and langergraber 2015 this is called factor fixing setting by saltelli et al 2004 2008 in a statistical context sensitivity analysis has long been used for factor fixing setting to identify non influential model parameters by investigating relations between model parameters and model outputs becker et al 2018 devak and dhanya 2017 huo et al 2019 haan 1989 pianosi et al 2016 song et al 2015 sobol et al 2007 razavi and gupta 2015 razavi et al 2021 this concept can be extended to identify non infleuntial proecess based on the idea that a process is considered to be non influential if model parameters associated with this process are identified as non influential markstrom et al 2016 sheikholeslami et al 2021 a widely used method of parameter sensitivity analysis method is the derivative based morris method morris 1991 although the morris method is theoretically less rigorous and practically less quantitative than sobol s variance based method wainwright et al 2014 feng et al 2019 it is conceptually straightforward and computationally efficient for screening non influential parameters this study uses the design ideas of the morris method but extends the ideas to consider not only parametric uncertainty but also process model uncertainty consider a hydrological system composed of two interacting processes a and b as shown in fig 1 in the conventional way of developing a system model to represent the system as shown in fig 1 a system process or a process for brevity is represented by a single process model for example process a is represented by process model ma θ a where ma denotes the process model and θ a is the vector of model parameters that are always treated as random variables integrating these process models gives a single system model m this concept of single model representation of a system and its processes and process interactions has become questionable when process model uncertainty arises i e available data and knowledge support multiple process models to represent a process e g process model m a 1 θ a 1 and m a 2 θ a 2 for process a as illustrated in fig 1 in a modular modeling framework to form a system model by integrating process models process model uncertainty leads to system model uncertainty i e multiple alternative system models m 1 m 2 are all plausible an example of this is given in fig 3 of clark et al 2015a that introduces the structure for unifying multiple modeling alternative summa approach other examples of surface water and groundwater modeling are given in clark et al 2008 ye et al 2010 2016 lu et al 2015 elshall and tsai 2014 chitsazan and tsai 2014 and haghnegahdar et al 2017 since modeled system behaviors depend on the choice of process models influence of a process on a system output e g hydraulic head is likely to be different when the process is simulated by different process models without considering process model uncertainty and only considering parametric uncertainty identification of non influential process may lead to biased results this study tackled the following question can we correctly screen out non influential processes if we are not certain about the choice of process models and model parameters a key to answering this question is how to consider model uncertainty for identifying non influential processes hydrologic model uncertainty has been studied for about two decades beven 2002 bredehoeft 2003 bredehoeft 2005 neuman 2003 poeter and anderson 2005 and there has been a number of studies on investigating influence of a process under multiple system models herman et al 2013 baroni and tarantola 2014 thomas steven savage et al 2016 dai and ye 2015 dai et al 2017a dai et al 2017b mai et al 2020 dell oca et al 2020 all these methods are computationally expensive as they require monte carlo simulations in a parameter space to approximate variance or other statistical moments of a quantity of interest although computational cost can be reduced by various approaches see the review article of razavi et al 2021 a large number of model executions are still needed this problem of high computational cost may be avoided if one is only interested in screening out non influential processes rather than ranking system processes based on morris one factor at a time concept van hoey et al 2014 developed a method to vary model components one at a time a model component was defined by van hoey et al 2014 as a conceptual description of a subprocess of the entire model which appears to be equivalent to a system process that is of interest to this study the method of van hoey et al 2014 applied the method to multiple alternative models of a process for evaluating the mean of absolute elementary effects denoted as μ an important term of the morris method as discussed in section 2 1 the μ values of any two alternative process models are plotted in a so called evaluation chart and the chart is used to evaluate impacts of process models on model outputs or model evaluation metrics while this method is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement it performs sensitivity analysis on individual system models and does not explicitly consider impacts of process models on model outputs because the method does not evaluate variation of model outputs caused by changing the process representation from one process model to another process model in other words the method of van hoey et al 2014 is still for a parameter space within a single system model but not for a joint parameter model space across multiple system models the goal of this study is thus to develop a new method called multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method which expands the design ideas of morris screening method from a parameter space to a joint parameter model space mmads evaluates not only the differences of a model output due to varying model parameter values but also the differences due to varying process models after the differences are evaluated for each process their mean and variance are calculated and used to identify non influential processes the calculation of mean and variance in the model space is based on model averaging methods that have been used in the hydrologic community for several decades beven 2002 neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 poeter and anderson 2005 a process with both small mean and small variance is considered to be non influential a small mean indicates small differences of model output when changing process models and process model parameter values a small variance is resulted from a lack of nonlinear effects and or interactions between process models and or process model parameter values similar to the morris screening method the mmads method is computationally efficient and this makes mmads appealing to real world applications for identifying non influential processes two numerical examples are employed to evaluate performance of mmads one example is based on a sobol s g function with ten product elements each element representing a process and has analytical expressions for the mean and variance of mmads the other example is for groundwater flow modeling with three interacting processes related to recharge geology and snowmelt robustness of mmads effects of process model weights and limitations of mmads are also discussed 2 background definitions and conceptualization 2 1 morris screening method for parameters of a single model to better understand the rational of developing the mmads method we start by briefly revisiting the morris screening method for addressing parametric uncertainty of a single system model morris 1991 following saltelli et al 2004 we use y x to denote a model output evaluated with k parameters x x 1 x 2 xk the range of each parameter is scaled e g by using its cumulative distribution to the unit interval 0 1 and the unit interval is then partitioned into p 1 equally sized intervals where p represents the number of levels the morris screening method evaluates the elementary effect ee via 1 e e i y x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where e e i is the elementary effect of the i th parameter xi δ is a predetermined multiple of the interval with the size of 1 p 1 x x 1 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k is the vector of the reference parameter values and each value is selected randomly from the set 0 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 except xi from the set 0 1 p 1 1 p 1 1 δ so that x i δ is still in range of 0 1 randomly sampling xi gives a number of eei and three statistics of eei are computed the mean μi of eei the mean μi of absolute eei and the standard deviation σi of eei as noted by campolongo et al 2007 μ is a better choice than μ for detecting parameters that have important overall influence on the output because μ avoids canceling out ee values with opposite signs the standard deviation σi is used to detect parameters that either have nonlinear effects on the output or interact with other parameters to affect the output a parameter with small μ and σ values is identified as non influential since the morris screening method is qualitative in nature in comparison with other global sensitivity analysis methods such as sobol s variance based methods it is commonly used for screening non influential parameters rather than quantitatively ranking importance or influence of model parameters fig 2 a is an illustration of evaluating the ee values based on a figure of saltelli et al 2004 for the purpose of illustration we assume that the system has two processes denoted as a and b and that each process is represented by one process model i e ma for process a and mb for process b we further assume that each process model has only one parameter i e xa for ma and xb for mb the system model is thus denoted as m a x a m b x b by integrating process models ma and mb with the number of levels p 5 and δ 1 4 a total of 20 ee values are obtained for each parameter i e the 20 black solid arrows for xa and the 20 black dashed arrows for xb as shown in fig 2 a if all the 20 ee values are small and the variation of the 20 ee values is also small the corresponding μ and σ values are small this indicates that the model output changes slightly when parameter values change and the parameter is non influential a process is identified to be non influential if its model parameters are identified to be non influential by the morris screening method if a process model contains more than one parameter the morris screening method can be applied to a group of parameters associated with the process saltelli et al 2004 2 2 basic ideas of mmads method fig 2 b illustrates the design ideas of mmads to consider both process model uncertainty and parametric uncertainty in line with fig 2 a we still assume that the system has two processes a and b to consider process model uncertainty we assume that process a can be represented by two alternative process models m a 1 and m a 2 an example of this is the penman monteith method monteith 1995 and the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 for estimating potential evapotranspiration for the sake of illustration in fig 2 b we assume that each process model has only one parameter i e parameters x a 1 and x a 2 for m a 1 and m a 2 respectively similarly process b also has two alternative process models i e process model m b 1 with parameter x b 1 and process model m b 2 with parameter x b 2 as a result we have four system models denoted as m a 1 x a 1 m b 1 x b 1 m a 1 x a 1 m b 2 x b 2 m a 2 x a 2 m b 1 x b 1 and m a 2 x a 2 m b 2 x b 2 it should be noted that the simple example of fig 2 b with two processes and one parameter for each process is only for illustrating the design ideas of mmads mmads is applicable to a real world system that contains more than two processes each of which has more than one parameter to illustrate the mmads design ideas we first assume that parametric uncertainty does not exist i e the true values of the parameters x a 1 x a 2 x b 1 and x b 2 are known in this case mmads evaluates the absolute difference dδ of the system model output δ in the following two situations under process model uncertainty 1 transition between the two process models of process a conditioning on model m b 1 of process b the term transition is used here to represent the change within a process model or from one process model to another process model in our case there are four transitions between the two models of process a as follows t m a m a 1 m a 1 m a 1 m a 2 m a 2 m a 1 m a 2 m a 2 where t m a denote the set of process model transitions of process a and the symbol denotes the transition the absolute difference dδ of model output for each transition is evaluated and then averaged over all the four transitions to yield e t m a d δ m b 1 the way of calculating the average is discussed below the e t m a d δ m b 1 term is conditioned on m b 1 and measures how the changes between and within the two process models m a m a 1 m a 2 of process a affect system model output given process model m b 1 since there is no parametric uncertainty at this stage dδ 0 for m a 1 m a 1 and m a 2 m a 2 and dδ for m a 1 m a 2 equals dδ for m a 2 m a 1 these however are not the case when parametric uncertainty exists for the process models and more discussion on this is given later 2 transition between the two models of process a conditioning on model m b 2 of process b repeating the calculation above for m b 2 we have e t m a d δ m b 2 that is conditioned on m b 2 and measures how the changes between and within the two process models m a m a 1 m a 2 affecting system model output given m b 2 for the two terms e t m a d δ m b 1 and e t m a d δ m b 2 obtained in steps 1 and 2 we calculate the average e a d δ e m b e t m a d δ m b for process a which measures how the changes between and within the two models of process a affect the system model output similarly we can also have e b d δ e m a e t m b d δ m a for process b which measures how the changes between and within the two models of process b affect system model output if process a is more influential than process b to the system model output then e a d δ should be larger than e b d δ the calculation for the average e d δ of dδ can be extended to a calculation for the variance v dδ of dδ and its corresponding equation is given in section 3 now let us consider parametric uncertainty i e true parameter values are unknown but parameter probability distributions are known in this case we use x to denote a set of parameter values the true parameter value x may be viewed as one realization of the random parameter as shown in fig 2 b each parameter range is discretized into p 1 equally sized intervals with the parametric uncertainty dδ 0 for transition m a 1 m a 1 because the transition means changes from one point of x a 1 to another point of x a 1 this parameter transition is denoted as x a 1 x a 1 where x a 1 and x a 1 are two points of x a 1 in this case dδ may be denoted as d δ x b m b m a 1 m a 1 x a 1 x a 1 which reads as the difference of a system model output for the parameter transition x a 1 x a 1 associated with process model transition m a 1 m a 1 conditioning on parameter value xb one parameter realization from x b 1 or x b 2 of process model mb m b 1 or m b 2 for process b similarly we can obtain the d δ values for the other three process model transitions in t m a for each of the four process model transitions in t m a there are multiple parameter transitions due to parametric uncertainty resulting in multiple dδ values for a single process model transition we calculate the average of dδ first over the parameter transitions within a process model transition and then across the process model transitions conditioning on a specific point x b of process model mb this gives e t m a d δ x b m b e t m a e t x a t m a d δ x b m b t x a t m a where t x a denotes a parameter transition of x a for the process model transition t m a of process a we further take average first over all parameter points x b and then over all process models m b of process b this gives e a d δ e m b e t m a d δ m b e m b e x b m b e t m a e t x a t m k d δ x b m b t x a t m a for process a the e b d δ term for process b can be evaluated in the same way the variance v d δ of dδ for process a can be evaluated in a similar way and a general equation is given in section 3 e a d δ e b d δ v a d δ and v b d δ are the most critical quantities of mmads and they consider both process model uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty fig 2 b illustrates the transitions between process models and between process model parameters fig 2 b1 and b2 the top row of fig 2 b shows the transitions conditioning on parameter x b 1 of process model m b 1 the red arrows in fig 2 b1 represent possible parameter transitions x a 1 x a 1 for process model transition m a 1 m a 1 and the blue arrows in fig 2 b2 represent possible parameter transitions x a 2 x a 2 for process model transition m a 2 m a 2 the black arrows from fig 2 b1 to b2 illustrate possible parameter transition x a 1 x a 2 for process model transition m a 1 m a 2 and the green arrows from fig 2 b2 to b1 illustrate possible parameter transitions x a 2 x a 1 for process model transition m a 2 m a 1 similarly fig 2 b1 and b2 the bottom row of fig 2 b show the transitions conditioning on parameter x b 2 of process model m b 2 because different process models may have different numbers of parameters and the parameters may have different physical meanings and ranges mmads does not use the derivative based ee of the morris method but uses the absolute difference dδ of model output δ 3 mathematical formulation and numerical implementation 3 1 mathematical formulation the basic ideas explained above are generalized in this section for any number of system processes and any number of process models of each process we first define mathematical symbols used in the generalization if process model uncertainty and parametric uncertainty do not exist system ouput δ m θ m θ 1 θ d is simulated by a single system model m with a vector of d dimensional system model parameters θ θ 1 θ d note that we here use θ to denote a set of deterministic parameter values and reserve θ to denote a set of random parameter values θ can be viewed as a realization of θ if the system of interest consists of multiple processes denoted as a b and each process has its own process model denoted as ma mb and associated parameters denoted as θa θb the system model m θ may be viewed as an integration of the process models i e m θ m a θ a m b θ b together with other system model components common to the processes e g domain discretization system initial conditions and driving forces the process model integration denoted by the union symbol above may need to consider nonlinear interactions between the process models an example of such an integration was given in dai et al 2017a for developing a system model of groundwater reactive transport by integrating processes of rechagre and geology in addition a process may have its sub processes for example a groundwater flow process may consist of sub processes such as recharge geology and evapotranspiration more discussions on process based modular modeling are referred to clark et al 2008 clark et al 2015a clark et al 2015b with the presence of process model uncertainty a system process may be represented by several alternative process models taking process a as an example it may be represented by multiple process models that form a set m a θ a m a 1 θ a 1 m a 2 θ a 2 each process model may have its own parameters or shared parameters with other process models integration of the alternative process models leads to alternative system models i e m θ m a θ a m b θ b if the process model parameters are random they are denoted as θ to be differentiated from θ which is viewed as a realization of θ in this case m θ m a θ a m b θ b becomes m θ m a θ a m b θ b we first give the equations of mean and variance of d δ for process k e g process a in section 2 2 with consideration of process model uncertainty only following the definition of posterior mean and variance of bayesian model averaging e g eqs 4 and 5 in ye et al 2004 the mean and variance of d δ for process k are defined as 2 e k d δ e m k e t m k d δ m k 3 v k d δ e m k v t m k d δ m k v m k e t m k d δ m k where m k in the subscription is the set of multiple process model combinations that represent all processes but k k e g process b in section 2 2 m k is the set of multiple process models only for process k and t m k is the set of process model transitions within process k i e t m k m k i m k j where i j 1 2 n m k with n m k being the number of process models that represent process k eq 2 indicates that if model output δ changes substantially when a process representation changes from m k i to m k j then this process is considered to have significant influence on the model output since there are multiple process model transitions for process k it is practically sensible to use the average e t m k d δ m k of d δ over all possible transitions in addition since the average for process k is for a combination m k of the process models for all the processes but process k it is necessary to evaluate the average e m k e t m k d δ m k over all the combinations the mean e k d δ of the output difference for process k thus measures the overall influence of process k through the transitions between any two process models the variance v k d δ of the output difference defined in eq 3 measures to what extent the output difference spreads out due to nonlinear effects of the process models and or interaction effects between process k and other processes the nonlinear effect is reflected by the v t m k d δ m k term in that if the process models are nonlinear d δ is large for a transition from one process model to another process model the e m k v t m k d δ m k term measures the average nonlinear effect over model set m k the interaction effect is reflected in the v m k e t m k d δ m k term in that the variance v m k is large when e t m k d δ m k is evaluated for two models in model set m k i e mk of process k interacting with m k of all process but k eqs 2 and 3 can be extended to address parameter uncertainty of the process models and the detailed derivation for the extension is given in appendix a the extended eqs 2 and 3 are 4 e k d δ e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 5 v k d δ k e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 2 e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 2 where subscript θ k m k of e θ k m k indicates that the expectation is with respect to random parameter θ k specific to model m k and subscript t θ k t m k of e t θ k t m k indicates that the expectation is with respect to the random parameters involved in the parameter transitions t θ k associated with the process model transitions t m k the θ k and t θ k terms in the parentheses are a single realization of θ k and t θ k respectively taking the process model transition t m k m a 1 m a 2 as an example the set of parameter transitions with respect to m a 1 m a 2 is t θ a θ a 1 m θ a 2 n where θ a 1 m and θ a 2 n are two randomly selected parameter realizations in θ a 1 and θ a 2 t θ a includes all possible parameter transitions from parameters of m a 1 to parameters of m a 2 when process model uncertainty does not exist i e each process is represented by only one process model eqs 4 and 5 become 6 e k d δ e θ k e t θ k d δ θ k t θ k 7 v k d δ e θ k e t

for a single system model for either a single or multiple system models ek dδ and vk dδ are used in the same way as that the mean and standard deviation μ and σ of ee are used the ek dδ and vk dδ of all processes under consideration are plotted in a 2 d plane and a process is more influential than other processes if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are larger than those of other processes however we do not suggest using mmads to rank processes or identify influential processes but to screen non influential processes because the mmads method is qualitative in nature for process identification a quantitative process ranking can be done by using more rigorous but more computationally expensive approaches such as the first order process sensitivity index developed by dai et al 2017a 3 2 model averaging and monte carlo integration the expectations with respect to the process models e m k and process model transitions e t m k in eqs 4 and 5 can be evaluated using the model averaging method via 8 e m k e θ k m k e θ k m k p m k 9 e t m k e t θ k t m k e t θ k t m k p t m k where the dot denotes the quantities in eqs 4 and 5 e g e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k in eq 4 p m k is the probability model averaging weight of a combination of the models for all the processes but process k p t m k is the probability of the transition from one process model to another process model evaluating p m k and p t m k requires that the probability p mk of process models for process k satisfy p m k 1 to evaluate p m k for a combination of process models it is assumed that selecting one process model of a process is independent to selecting one process model of another process with this assumption p m k can be evaluated as p m k i 1 n k p m k i where n k equals the number of processes minus one i e the number of all processes but process k and p m k i is the probability of a process model m k i taking a system with three processes a b and c as an example each process has two alterative models i e a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 and c 2 and the process models have the following probabilities i e p a 1 p a 2 0 5 p b 1 0 7 p b 2 0 3 p c 1 0 6 and p c 2 0 4 the combination b 1 c 1 of process models b 1 and c 1 has the probability of p b 1 c 1 0 7 0 6 0 42 p t m k of the process model transition m k i m k j can be evaluated as p t m k p m k i p m k j where p m k i and p m k j are the process model probabilities of m k i and m k j respectively this calculation implies that each process model transitions has its own probability depending on the probabilities of the two process models of the transition using process b and its process model probabilities in the example above the probability for transition m b 1 m b 1 is 0 49 and the probability for the transition m b 1 m b 2 is 0 21 the process model probabilities can be either prior probability determined based on prior information or posterior probability determined by using both prior information and observations used for model calibration and uncertainty quantification prior probabilities are used in this study and evaluating posterior probabilities with bayesian model averaging is discussed in dai et al 2017a and lu et al 2015 the expectations e θ k m k and e t θ k t m k with respect to the process model parameters and parameter transitions can be evaluated using monte carlo methods for the convenience of discussion we use the same number n of parameter realizations for each process model combination m k and process model m k to evaluate the mean and variance of d δ using eqs 4 and 5 a total n m k n n m k 2 n 2 numbers of d δ are needed where n m k and n m k are the number of models of process k and the number of combinations of the models for all processes but k respectively the square terms are for the parameter transitions and process model transitions to obtain n m k n n m k 2 n 2 numbers of d δ requires a total n m k n n m k n numbers of model executions to reduce computational cost the n parameter realizations can be generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method so that a small number of realizations can cover the entire parameter space the procedure of generating the realizations of θ k m k and θ k m k and the procedure of computing d δ θ k m k θ k m k and d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k are as follows step 1 divide the cumulative distribution of each parameter into n equal strata and sample n parameter values from the n strata using the lhs method this results in a sample matrix with the dimension of n np where np is the total number of parameters involved in the multi models step 2 for each process model combination m k combine the columns of parameter values from the parameter matrix generated in step 1 for parameters associated with m k to yield the parameter set θ k m k step 3 for each process model m k combine the columns of parameter values from the parameter matrix generated in step 1 for parameters associated with m k to yield the parameter set θ k m k step 4 loop over the parameter sets θ k m k and θ k m k compute δ θ k m k θ k m k step 5 loop over the process model transitions and parameter transitions to compute d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k fig 3 shows the pseudo code to compute the mean and variance of d δ based on eqs 4 and 5 and the parameter sampling procedure described above 4 two numerical experiments mmads is evaluated using two numerical experiments one experiment is based on the sobol s g function which is commonly used as a benchmark function for sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 since mean ek dδ and varinace vk dδ can be anaytically derived this experiment can be used to verify the computer code based on the pesuedo code shown in fig 3 the other numerical experiment is for one dimensional groundwater flow modeling based on the synthetic case developed by dai et al 2017a the two examples demonstrate the capability and efficiency of mmads for screening non influential processes under both parametric uncertainty and process model uncertainty 4 1 sobol s g function the sobol s g function is defined as saltelli et al 2010 10 g x 1 x k a 1 a k δ 1 δ k α 1 α k i 1 k g i g i 1 α i 2 x i δ i i x i δ i 1 α i a i 1 a i where x i is a parameter following uniform distribution u 0 1 a i r is a positive coefficient δ i 0 1 and α i 0 are shift and curvature parameters respectively and i x i δ i is the integer part of x i δ i the analytical solutions of the sobol s first order s i and total effect s ti sensitivity indices for parameter xi were given by saltelli et al 2010 as s i v i v and s ti v ti v where v i α i 2 1 2 α i 1 a i 2 v ti v i j i 1 v j and v i 1 k 1 v i 1 the total effect sensitivity index s ti is of particular importance to this study because it can quantitatively measure influence of xi on the g function the s ti based ranking of parameter influence is used as a reference to evaluate whether mmads can identify non influential parameters for a single system model for example if a parameter is identified to be non influential by s ti it should also be identified by mmads as non influential the influence of x i is controlled by the curvature parameter α i and coefficient a i a larger α i and a smaller a i give a larger total effect parameter sensitivity index s ti indicating higher influence of xi since s ti does not depend on the shift parameter δ i we set δ i 0 in this study the g i function in eq 10 is then simplified to 11 g i 1 α i 2 x i 1 α i a i 1 a i 4 1 1 processes and process models for an illustrative purpose we set k 10 in eq 10 to consider ten product elements g i i 1 2 10 and assume that each element g i represents a process when there is no process model uncertainty eqs 6 and 7 derived for parameter sensitivity analysis are used for identify non influential processes since each element has only one parameter xi the sensitivty of parameter xi is viewed as the sensitivity of process g i for example if parameter x 1 is the least influential parameter among x 1 x 10 then the process represented by g 1 is the least influential process among the ten processes represented by g 1 g 10 to consider process model uncertainty we assum that each g i has two plausible process models g i 1 and g i 2 i 1 2 10 with the function form of eq 11 but different a i and α i values the uniform distribution of parameter xi is the same for the two process models for the α values we set α i 1 1 and α i 2 2 for all the ten processes where the superscripts 1 and 2 are for the two process models the a i 1 and a i 2 values of the ten processes are listed in table 1 so that the process models are different with different levels of influence to model output taking the first process represented by g 1 as an example its two alternative process models are g 1 1 2 2 x 1 1 0 002 1 002 and g 1 2 3 2 x 1 1 2 0 005 1 005 it should be noted that although this experiment only considers ten processes a combination of the process models yields a total of 210 1 024 system models this large number of system models indicates that the numerical example with ten processes is complex enough for evaluating mmads performance 4 1 2 sensitivity results for individual system models appendix b derives analytical expressions ek dδ and vk dδ of each process for a single system model of the sobol s g function since each process g i has only one parameter xi the sensitivity of process g i is reflected by the sensitivity of parameter xi taking two system models i 1 10 g i 1 and i 1 10 g i 2 as an example table 2 lists the analytical values of ek dδ and vk dδ for parameters x1 x10 associated with the ten processes our numerical results are almost identical to the analytical results with the maximum retaliative error less than 3 table 2 also lists the analytical results of sobol s total effect sensitivity index that is for estimating sensitivity of parameter xi in mmads a process is considered to be less influential than other processes if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of other processes taking system model i 1 10 g i 1 as an example process g 10 is the least influential process or equivalently parameter x 10 is the least influential parameter because it has the smallest ek dδ and vk dδ values among the ten processes the identification of the least influential process is consistent with the identification of the least influential parameter based on the sobol s total effect sensitivity index s ti for system model i 1 10 g i 2 the least influential process becomes g 9 which is also the case for s ti the change of the least influential process is attributed to using different α i and a i values for the two system models the change happens to other system models but results are not shown due to the changes there is uncertainty in identifying non influential system processes and biased identification may be resulted if ignoring process model uncertainty it is thus necessary to use mmads for identifying non influential process under process model uncertainty 4 1 3 sensitivity results for multiple system models based on eqs 4 and 5 appendix c derives analytical expressions of e dδ and v dδ for multiple system models of the sobol s g function to evaluate the ek dδ and vk dδ values for each process we assume that its two process models have equal weights i e p g i 1 p g i 2 0 5 and the analytical results of ek dδ and vk dδ are listed in table 2 the numerical results are almost identical to the analytical results with the maximum retaliative error less than 3 this verifies our computer codes based on the pseudo code shown in fig 3 fig 4 a illustrates how to use the ek dδ and vk dδ values for qualitatively identifying influential and non influential processes for individual system models and multiple system models the ek dδ and v k d δ values are plotted as cross symbols for the multiple system models and as open symbols for the individual system models for the multiple system models fig 4 a suggests that g 1 is the most influential process because it is located at the upper right corner and that g 9 is the least influential process because it is located at the lower left corner for the 1 024 individual system models the ek dδ values of each process are separated into two groups with 512 models in each group this is a special case for the sobol g function because there are two process models for each process and the ek dδ values of a process is determined only by the a and α values of the process model as indicated by eq b7 mmads should be used for identifying non influentual processes not for ranking process influence because ek dδ and vk dδ are approximations for example table 2 shows that for the multiple system models while ek dδ of process g 4 is slightly larger than that of g 5 vk dδ of process g 4 is smaller than that of g 5 it is thus difficult to rank the two processes 4 2 groundwater flow modeling this numerical experiment of groundwater flow modeling is modified from dai et al 2017a as shown in fig 5 the unconfined aquifer has the length of l 10 000 m which is under a steady state condition the aquifer is bounded by two constant head boundaries and subject to a uniform precipitation process model uncertainty exists in the following three system processes 1 recharge process that converts precipitation to aquifer recharge 2 geology process that characterizes hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and 3 snowmelt process that estimates snow melt rate to determine hydraulic head at the east boundary of the domain the process models are described below 4 2 1 processes and process models following dai et al 2017a two recharge models r 1 and r 2 are used to simulate the recharge process that converts precipitation m d to groundwater recharge m d and they are 12 r 1 w a p 14 0 5 r 2 w b p 15 7 where a and b are scaling parameters dimensionless assumed to follow the normal distribution n 2 0 0 42 and the uniform distribution u 0 2 0 5 respectively p is the annual precipitation which is set as 4 175 10 3 m d 1 524mm yr hydraulic conductivity k m d over the domain is parameterized by two geology process models g 1 and g 2 as follows 13 g 1 k for any x g 2 k k 1 for x 7000 k 2 for x 7000 in model g 1 the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity follows the lognormal distribution ln 2 9 0 52 model g 2 has two zones of hydraulic conductivity separated at the location of x 0 7000 m fig 5 the hydraulic conductivities k 1 of zone 1 x less than 7000 m and k 2 of zone 2 x 7000 m are assumed to follow the lognormal distributions ln 2 6 0 32 and ln 3 2 0 32 respectively for the lake boundary its hydraulic head is set to be constant at h 1 300 m for the river boundary the river stage h 2 is determined by the empirical rating curve function below to covert a river discharge into the river stage via 14 h 2 0 3 q 0 6 289 where q is river discharge m3 s and the coefficients of 0 3 0 6 and 289 are chosen arbitrarily for this numerical experiment the river discharge depends on snowmelt runoff via 15 q c sn m s v c a where csn is runoff coefficient dimensionless m is snow melt rate m s svc is the ratio of snow covered area to watershed area a m2 we arbitrarily set csn 0 8 svc 0 7 and a 2000 km2 and use two models to estimate the daily snow melt rate i e the degree day method and the restricted degree day radiation balance method hock 2003 kustas et al 1994 martinec et al 2007 the two models are 16 m 1 m f 1 t a t m m 2 m f 2 t a t m r r n where f 1 and f 2 are snowmelt factors mm d that are assumed to follow normal distributions n 3 5 0 752 and n 2 5 0 32 respectively ta is the average temperature for a given day and tm is the temperature threshold typically set to be 0 when snow melt occurs the second model considers the effects of surface radiation budget rn w m2 and uses conversion factor r mm d w m2 to convert the energy flux to snowmelt rate ta and rn are set as 7 and 80 w m2 respectively and r is assumed to follow the normal distribution of n 0 3 0 052 a combination of the two recharge process models two geology process models and two snowmelt process models leads to a total of eight system models and they are denoted as r 1 g 1 m 1 r 1 g 1 m 2 r 1 g 2 m 1 r 1 g 2 m 2 r 2 g 1 m 1 r 2 g 1 m 2 r 2 g 2 m 1 and r 2 g 2 m 2 all process models have equal weights i e p r1 p r2 0 5 p g1 p g2 0 5 and p m1 p m2 0 5 the groundwater discharge per unit width at the location x 0 7 000 m is the quantity of interest for the sensitivity analysis and it is labeled as q 0 in fig 5 the analytical solution of the discharge q x at any location is derived as 17 q x k 1 h 1 2 h 2 2 2 x 0 λ x 0 λ l 1 2 w x 0 2 λ x 0 2 λ l 2 x 0 λ x 0 λ l w x where λ k 1 k 2 for the geological model g 1 with homogenous hydraulic conductivity i e k k 1 k 2 eq 22 becomes 18 q x k h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l 1 2 w l w x which is the well known solution available in hydrogeology textbooks using the analytical solutions of q x the mmads method is implemented using monte carlo simulations based on the pseudo code shown in fig 3 4 2 2 sensitivity results for individual system models table 3 lists the ek dδ and vk dδ values evaluated for the recharge geology and snowmelt processes of the eight individual system models with consideration of parametric uncertainty if a process model has more than one parameter e g k 1 and k 2 associated with process model g 2 and f 2 and r associated with process model m 2 the indices are evaluated for the grouped parameters specifically speaking the θk term in eqs 4 and 5 includes two parameters for each system model since ek dδ and vk dδ are evaluated for all parameters of each process ek dδ and vk dδ measure influence of individual processes taking system model r 2 g 2 m 2 as an example the mean and variance of parameter b measure influence of the recharge process those of parameters k 1 and k 2 measure influence of the geology process and those of parameters f 2 and r measure influence of the snowmelt process table 3 also lists the total effect parameter sensitivity sti calculated by using salib of herman and usher 2017 sti is used to quantitatively rank the three processes in terms of their influence within each system model and the sti based process rank is used as a reference to evaluate mmads results table 3 shows that for each system model the process rank of mmads is the same as that given by sti indicating that the mmads results are reliable the process rank changes substantially between system models and any of the three processes can be ranked as the most influential or the least influential process for example in system model r 1 g 1 m 1 the recharge process is identified as the least influential process and the snowmelt process as the most influential process whereas it is the opposite case for system model r 2 g 2 m 2 this is also observed in fig 4 b that plots the three processes in three colors recharge in red geology in green and snowmelt in blue the open symbols of the eight individual system models are mixed and do not reveal a pattern to indicate process influence under process model uncertainty it is therefore necessary to use mmads method for identifying non influential processes for all the system models to address process model uncertainty for the individual system models the mmads results can reflect process interactions this is made clear by examining the ek dδ and vk dδ values of r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 which have different recharge models but the same geology and snowmelt models for the two system models with homogeneous hydraulic conductivity based on eq 18 the groundwater discharge per unit width at x 0 7000 m which equals to 0 7l is 19 q x 0 k h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l 0 2 w l this equation shows that w does not interact with k or h 2 indicating that the recharge process does not interact with the geology or snowmelt process as a results between r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 the ek dδ and vk dδ values of a the recharge model parameter change but those of k the geology model parameter and f 1 the snowmelt model parameter do not change this is not surprising in the context of mmads calculation to evaluate the output difference dδ caused by the variation of parameter k of the geology process parameter a or b of the recharge process eq 12 and parameter f 1 of the snowmelt process eq 16 are fixed since the recharge and geology processes do not interact the second term 0 2wl in eq 19 does not affect dδ due to change of k which means that dδ is not affected by parameter a or b therefore the dδ value for k is the same for r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 on the other hand the process interaction is reflected in the ek dδ and vk dδ values of r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 1 g 1 m 2 these values of k and f 1 for r 1 g 1 m 1 are different from those of k and f 2 r for r 1 g 1 m 2 because the interaction between k and f 1 is different from the interaction between k and f 2 r as indicated by eq 19 4 2 3 sensitivity results for multiple system models in this numerical experiment ek dδ and vk dδ are evaluated numerically using monte carlo simulations based on the procedure discussed in section 3 2 the cumulative distribution of each parameter is divide into n 5000 equal strata to generate 5000 lhs parameter samples fig 6 illustrates convergence of ek dδ and vk dδ of the three processes for the multiple system models convergence for individual system models not shown here the 95 confidence intervals shown in fig 6 are estimated by using 100 bootstrapping resamples to assess the effect of sampling uncertainty and to evaluate robustness of the estimator to sample variability archer et al 1997 yang 2011 fig 6 shows that the ek dδ and vk dδ values converge after about 350 parameter realizations and the corresponding total number of model executions is 980 000 2 2 350 2 350 a discussion on computational cost of mmads is given in section 5 table 3 lists the ek dδ and vk dδ values of the recharge geology and snowmelt processes with consideration of both process model and parametric uncertainty the two sensitivity measures listed in table 3 are estimated by using all 5000 parameter realizations and the corresponding number of model executions is 200 000 000 2 2 5000 2 5000 the large number of model executions is affordable in this numerical example due to the use of analytical solutions of q 0 and the numerical results shown in table 3 are accurate enough for identifying non influential processes a discussion on computational cost of mmads is given in section 5 mmads identifies the snowmelt process as the most influential one followed by the geology process and then the recharge process this is also observed in fig 4 b that plots ek dδ and v k d δ for the three processes using cross symbols in three colors the snowmelt process has the largest ek dδ and vk dδ values substantially larger than those of the geology and recharge process this may be due to the nonlinear effect of the snowmelt process reflected by the h 2 2 term in eqs 17 or 18 and the interaction between the snowmelt and geology processes discussed above due to the qualitative nature of mmads using it to explain the nonlinear effect and process interactions is not straightforward 5 further investigation and discussion 5 1 computational cost and robustness of mmads although 200 000 000 2 2 5000 2 5000 model executions are used for the groundwater example the high computational cost is unnecessarily and can be substantially reduced in practice to determine the smallest number of model executions that can give accurate results for the groundwater flow modeling example we gradually increase the number n of parameter realizations from 10 to 400 and evaluate a criterion called robustness by following razavi and gupta 2016 for each n value ek dδ and vk dδ of the three processes are estimated by 100 numerical experiments with 100 different sets of random parameter samples based on the ek dδ and vk dδ values we count how many times when snowmelt is identified by mmads as the most influential process geology as the second most influential process and recharge as the least influential process the process ranking is obtained above using 200 million model executions dividing the numbers by 100 gives mmads robustness for identifying influential processes the results are plotted in fig 7 for the three processes the figure shows that mmads is almost 100 robust to identify snowmelt as the most influential process even for a small number n of parameter realizations when n is small mmads cannot correctly identify recharge as the least influential process or identify geology as the second least influential process the mmads robustness is the same for ranking the recharge and geology processes because the groundwater example considers only three processes and snowmelt is always identified as the most influential process an important observation from fig 7 is that the mmads results are accurate enough with robustness larger than 95 when using n 20 parameter realizations the corresponding number of model executions is 3 200 2 2 20 2 20 substantially smaller than the number of 200 million model executions this number of model executions is expected to be computationally affordable for moderate models with nowadays computational resources available to general molders in addition the model executions are independent and can be conducted in parallel which can further improve computational efficiency of mmads 5 2 effects of process model probabilities on mmads method the numerical experiments above assume equal probabilities for alternative process models whereas it is likely that the models have different probabilities to explore the effects of process model probabilities on ek dδ and vk dδ we evaluate the mean and variance for the groundwater flow modeling example using different sets of process model probabilities for the groundwater experiment since each process has two alternative models and the sum of their probabilities is one e g p r 1 p r 2 1 0 for the recharge process we only need to vary probabilities of three process models one for each process we thus vary p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 and generate their values from the standard uniform distribution u 0 1 therefore for each process a random number r is sampled for from the uniform distribution u 0 1 and transformed into process probability values following the approach described by moeini et al 2011 subsequently sobol s variance based sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine sensitivity of ek dδ and vk dδ to process model probabilities which is referred to as a sensitivity analysis of a sensitivity analysis paleari and confalonieri 2016 puy et al 2020 for estimating sobol s first order si and total effect sti sensitivity indices we use the sampling scheme discussed in saltelli et al 2010 to generate two sampling matrices a and b each has the dimension of 1000 rows 3 columns corresponding to 1000 realizations of the model probabilities of p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 based on a and b three additional matrices are generated and each is denoted as ci i 1 2 and 3 ci is a copy of a but its column i is replaced with column i of matrix b si and sti are estimated using the 5000 parameter sets of the five matrices estimating si and sti does not require new dδ values because the sensitivity analysis only changes process model probabilities fig 8 shows that the e dδ and v dδ values of the three processes change with model probabilities of the corresponding processes for example in fig 8 a and 8 d e dδ and v dδ of the recharge process vary with probability p r 1 of model r 1 for all the three processes their ek dδ and vk dδ values change when process model probability changes the magnitude of changes is the largest for the snowmelt process fig 8 c and 8 f the variation patterns are different for the three processes in fig 8 a and 8 d for the recharge process ek dδ and vk dδ generally decrease when p r 1 increases the variation pattern is the opposite for the geology process as shown in fig 8 b and 8 e for the snowmelt process fig 8 c and 8 f shows that ek dδ and vk dδ first increase and then decrease with the increase of p m 1 the non monotonic variation pattern indicates that using appropriate model probability values is important for mmads to identifying non influential processes it should be noted that although each plot of fig 8 only shows ek dδ or vk dδ changes with probability of one process model ek dδ and vk dδ are also affected by probability of the other two process models it is possible that inappropriate probability of one process model may affect identification influence of non influence of another process investigating this is warranted in a future study we further examine to what extent process model probability affects identification of non influential processes for the 5000 realizations of ek dδ and vk dδ values we count how many times each process is identified as the most non influential process i e the process ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of the other two processes the recharge process is identified as the most non influential one for 2758 out of 5000 times 55 16 the geology process for 2080 times 41 60 the snowmelt process for 25 times 0 50 these quantitative results indicate again that using appropriate model probability values is important for mmads to identifying non influential processes fig 9 illustrates sobol s total effect sensitivity index sti evaluated for ek dδ and vk dδ the results of fist order sensitivity index si are similar and thus not shown the sti values are estimated for each process and measure sensitivity of the process to p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 fig 9 a indicates that ek dδ of the recharge process is most sensitive to p r 1 and then to p g 1 but not to p m 1 this is different for the geology and snowmelt processes whose ek dδ values are most sensitive to p m 1 this is especially the case for the snowmelt process fig 9 b shows to what extent vk dδ of each process is sensitive to p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 we observe from fig 9 that ek dδ and vk dδ of a process are substantially sensitive to the process s model probability which is not surprising while the sensitivity of one process ek dδ and vk dδ to other processes model probability may be negligible it is not always the case this indicates again that it is important to accurately estimate model probability of all processes for identifying non influential processes 5 3 limitations and future work the mmads method discussed in this study is subject to three limitations the first limitation is that the computational cost for n m k n n m k n number of model executions may be high especially for a large number n of parameter realizations although fig 7 indicates that n 20 gives satisfactory results for the groundwater example each process model has only one or two parameters when the number of random model parameters increase the number of parameter realizations is expected to increase and the curse of dimensionality may occur one way to reduce the computational cost of mmads is to break the two nested loops of parameter realizations shown in fig 3 and this can be done by using the binning method that was used in dai et al 2017a 2017b the binning method reduces the number of model executions from the order of n 2 to the order of n and its implementation is straightforward however the binning method is not mathematically rigorous and more theoretical development is needed in a future study the second limitation is that the derivation of ek dδ and vk dδ in eqs 4 and 5 implicitly assumes that the probabilities of process models and model parameters are independent this assumption for parameters may be invalid in practice and joint parameter distributions of a variety of forms may be needed after the joint distributions are determined correlated parameter realizations can be generated using various approaches e g lhs for estimating ek dδ and vk dδ for correlated process models their joint probability has not been adequately studied the bayesian network of dai et al 2019 may potentially address the issue of process model correlation but more in depth investigation is needed the last limitation is the qualitative nature of the mmads method in the current study a process is identified to be non influential if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of other processes the identification is in a relatively sense and it is possible for mmads to identify the most influential or non influential process however mmads cannot quantify the extent that one process is more influential or non influential than another process on the other hand if one is not interested in the most non influential process but a set of processes that are non influential mmads does not provide a quantitative threshold to decisively identify the processes while this problem may be addressed by using a clustering method discussed in sheikholeslami et al 2019 the drawback of mmads is inherent in screening methods including the morris screening method 6 conclusions this study develops a new multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method to identify non influential system processes with consideration of uncertainty in both process model structures and process model parameters mmads is an extension of the morris method from the parameter space to the parameter model space in which a system process may be represented by multiple process models the absolute differences of a model output are first evaluated by considering not only process model variation but also process model parameter variation the variations are quantified by the mean and variance of the differences which are evaluated by using the model averaging approaches based on probabilities of process models a process with small mean and variance is considered to be non influential to our knowledge there does not exist a method like mmads that explicitly considers uncertainty in process model structures and process model parameters and integrates the expended morris method with model averaging methods the two numerical experiments employed in this study demonstrate the following 1 the process ranking changes between alternative system models which manifests the needs of identifying non influential system processes under process model uncertainty and process model parametric uncertainty 2 considering only parametric uncertainty may lead to biased identification of non influential processes 3 for the first numerical experiment with the sobol s g function the analytical solutions for the mean and variance of the multi model differences verify the pseudo code and numerical code used to evaluate the mean and variance of mmads 3 the second numerical experiment of groundwater flow modeling with three interacting processes shows that the mean and variance of mmads reflect interactions between geology and snowmelt processes and no interactions between the two processes and the recharge process the mmads method similar to the morris method plots the mean and standard deviation of the multi model differences in a 2 d plane and the plot can be used to visually identify non influential system processes for the numerical example of groundwater flow modeling mmads method can give a meaningful process ranking with a small number of model executions in mmads the process model probabilities can play an important role in determining non influential processes similar to the morris method mmads method may be used as a screening tool for qualitatively identifying non influential processes while mmads is used for differential equation based groundwater models in this study the method can be applied to data driven models that are developed using statistical and or machine learning techniques because applications of mmads do not rely on knowing model structures but only need to consider transitions between models and model inputs a further investigation on this is warranted declaration of competing interest the authors

3478,process based models have been widely used for hydrologic modeling and it is a common practice to use sensitivity analysis methods for excluding non influential hydrologic processes from further investigation and or model improvement this study develops a new method called multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method to screen non influential system processes and parameters mmads is conceptually similar to the morris method for addressing parametric uncertainty but has a unique feature to address both process model uncertainty i e a process may be represented by multiple process models and process model parameter uncertainty i e parameters associated with a process model are random mmads first evaluates absolute differences of a quantity of interest i e a system model output by varying process models and or process model parameter values and then calculates the mean and variance of the differences for investigating process influence the mean measures overall influence of the process on the quantity of interest and the variance estimates influence of nonlinear effects of the process and or its interactions with other processes mmads is an extension of the morris method from a parameter space to a joint parameter model space for explicitly addressing both process model uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty the performance of mmads is evaluated by using two numerical experiments one experiment is based on sobol s g function with ten product elements and has analytical solutions of the mmads mean and variance of absolute differences the other experiment is for groundwater flow modeling which considers three processes i e recharge geology and snowmelt that interact with each other results indicate that mmads is computationally efficient and can identify non influential processes of complex hydrological systems keywords model uncertainty process sensitivity non influential process morris method 1 introduction process based hydrological modeling has been widely used over the last couple of decades for understanding and predicting behaviors of hydrological and environmental systems clark et al 2015a 2015b gorelick and zheng 2015 singh 2018 these systems are often open and complex and involve a number of processes and process interactions brenner et al 2018 clark et al 2015c beven 2002 noted that the development of more and more complex models that incorporate more and more detail about processes but which introduce more and more parameters that must be calibrated does not appear to be the future it is also unnecessary to include all system processes and process interactions because it happens often that only a subset of processes exerts a strong influence on system behaviors it is a common practice in hydrologic and environmental modeling to first identify non influential processes and process interactions and then to exclude them from model development and or improvement e g singh 2018 zeng et al 2018 ciric et al 2012 ketema and langergraber 2015 this is called factor fixing setting by saltelli et al 2004 2008 in a statistical context sensitivity analysis has long been used for factor fixing setting to identify non influential model parameters by investigating relations between model parameters and model outputs becker et al 2018 devak and dhanya 2017 huo et al 2019 haan 1989 pianosi et al 2016 song et al 2015 sobol et al 2007 razavi and gupta 2015 razavi et al 2021 this concept can be extended to identify non infleuntial proecess based on the idea that a process is considered to be non influential if model parameters associated with this process are identified as non influential markstrom et al 2016 sheikholeslami et al 2021 a widely used method of parameter sensitivity analysis method is the derivative based morris method morris 1991 although the morris method is theoretically less rigorous and practically less quantitative than sobol s variance based method wainwright et al 2014 feng et al 2019 it is conceptually straightforward and computationally efficient for screening non influential parameters this study uses the design ideas of the morris method but extends the ideas to consider not only parametric uncertainty but also process model uncertainty consider a hydrological system composed of two interacting processes a and b as shown in fig 1 in the conventional way of developing a system model to represent the system as shown in fig 1 a system process or a process for brevity is represented by a single process model for example process a is represented by process model ma θ a where ma denotes the process model and θ a is the vector of model parameters that are always treated as random variables integrating these process models gives a single system model m this concept of single model representation of a system and its processes and process interactions has become questionable when process model uncertainty arises i e available data and knowledge support multiple process models to represent a process e g process model m a 1 θ a 1 and m a 2 θ a 2 for process a as illustrated in fig 1 in a modular modeling framework to form a system model by integrating process models process model uncertainty leads to system model uncertainty i e multiple alternative system models m 1 m 2 are all plausible an example of this is given in fig 3 of clark et al 2015a that introduces the structure for unifying multiple modeling alternative summa approach other examples of surface water and groundwater modeling are given in clark et al 2008 ye et al 2010 2016 lu et al 2015 elshall and tsai 2014 chitsazan and tsai 2014 and haghnegahdar et al 2017 since modeled system behaviors depend on the choice of process models influence of a process on a system output e g hydraulic head is likely to be different when the process is simulated by different process models without considering process model uncertainty and only considering parametric uncertainty identification of non influential process may lead to biased results this study tackled the following question can we correctly screen out non influential processes if we are not certain about the choice of process models and model parameters a key to answering this question is how to consider model uncertainty for identifying non influential processes hydrologic model uncertainty has been studied for about two decades beven 2002 bredehoeft 2003 bredehoeft 2005 neuman 2003 poeter and anderson 2005 and there has been a number of studies on investigating influence of a process under multiple system models herman et al 2013 baroni and tarantola 2014 thomas steven savage et al 2016 dai and ye 2015 dai et al 2017a dai et al 2017b mai et al 2020 dell oca et al 2020 all these methods are computationally expensive as they require monte carlo simulations in a parameter space to approximate variance or other statistical moments of a quantity of interest although computational cost can be reduced by various approaches see the review article of razavi et al 2021 a large number of model executions are still needed this problem of high computational cost may be avoided if one is only interested in screening out non influential processes rather than ranking system processes based on morris one factor at a time concept van hoey et al 2014 developed a method to vary model components one at a time a model component was defined by van hoey et al 2014 as a conceptual description of a subprocess of the entire model which appears to be equivalent to a system process that is of interest to this study the method of van hoey et al 2014 applied the method to multiple alternative models of a process for evaluating the mean of absolute elementary effects denoted as μ an important term of the morris method as discussed in section 2 1 the μ values of any two alternative process models are plotted in a so called evaluation chart and the chart is used to evaluate impacts of process models on model outputs or model evaluation metrics while this method is conceptually straightforward and easy to implement it performs sensitivity analysis on individual system models and does not explicitly consider impacts of process models on model outputs because the method does not evaluate variation of model outputs caused by changing the process representation from one process model to another process model in other words the method of van hoey et al 2014 is still for a parameter space within a single system model but not for a joint parameter model space across multiple system models the goal of this study is thus to develop a new method called multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method which expands the design ideas of morris screening method from a parameter space to a joint parameter model space mmads evaluates not only the differences of a model output due to varying model parameter values but also the differences due to varying process models after the differences are evaluated for each process their mean and variance are calculated and used to identify non influential processes the calculation of mean and variance in the model space is based on model averaging methods that have been used in the hydrologic community for several decades beven 2002 neuman 2003 ye et al 2004 poeter and anderson 2005 a process with both small mean and small variance is considered to be non influential a small mean indicates small differences of model output when changing process models and process model parameter values a small variance is resulted from a lack of nonlinear effects and or interactions between process models and or process model parameter values similar to the morris screening method the mmads method is computationally efficient and this makes mmads appealing to real world applications for identifying non influential processes two numerical examples are employed to evaluate performance of mmads one example is based on a sobol s g function with ten product elements each element representing a process and has analytical expressions for the mean and variance of mmads the other example is for groundwater flow modeling with three interacting processes related to recharge geology and snowmelt robustness of mmads effects of process model weights and limitations of mmads are also discussed 2 background definitions and conceptualization 2 1 morris screening method for parameters of a single model to better understand the rational of developing the mmads method we start by briefly revisiting the morris screening method for addressing parametric uncertainty of a single system model morris 1991 following saltelli et al 2004 we use y x to denote a model output evaluated with k parameters x x 1 x 2 xk the range of each parameter is scaled e g by using its cumulative distribution to the unit interval 0 1 and the unit interval is then partitioned into p 1 equally sized intervals where p represents the number of levels the morris screening method evaluates the elementary effect ee via 1 e e i y x 1 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where e e i is the elementary effect of the i th parameter xi δ is a predetermined multiple of the interval with the size of 1 p 1 x x 1 x i 1 x i x i 1 x k is the vector of the reference parameter values and each value is selected randomly from the set 0 1 p 1 2 p 1 1 except xi from the set 0 1 p 1 1 p 1 1 δ so that x i δ is still in range of 0 1 randomly sampling xi gives a number of eei and three statistics of eei are computed the mean μi of eei the mean μi of absolute eei and the standard deviation σi of eei as noted by campolongo et al 2007 μ is a better choice than μ for detecting parameters that have important overall influence on the output because μ avoids canceling out ee values with opposite signs the standard deviation σi is used to detect parameters that either have nonlinear effects on the output or interact with other parameters to affect the output a parameter with small μ and σ values is identified as non influential since the morris screening method is qualitative in nature in comparison with other global sensitivity analysis methods such as sobol s variance based methods it is commonly used for screening non influential parameters rather than quantitatively ranking importance or influence of model parameters fig 2 a is an illustration of evaluating the ee values based on a figure of saltelli et al 2004 for the purpose of illustration we assume that the system has two processes denoted as a and b and that each process is represented by one process model i e ma for process a and mb for process b we further assume that each process model has only one parameter i e xa for ma and xb for mb the system model is thus denoted as m a x a m b x b by integrating process models ma and mb with the number of levels p 5 and δ 1 4 a total of 20 ee values are obtained for each parameter i e the 20 black solid arrows for xa and the 20 black dashed arrows for xb as shown in fig 2 a if all the 20 ee values are small and the variation of the 20 ee values is also small the corresponding μ and σ values are small this indicates that the model output changes slightly when parameter values change and the parameter is non influential a process is identified to be non influential if its model parameters are identified to be non influential by the morris screening method if a process model contains more than one parameter the morris screening method can be applied to a group of parameters associated with the process saltelli et al 2004 2 2 basic ideas of mmads method fig 2 b illustrates the design ideas of mmads to consider both process model uncertainty and parametric uncertainty in line with fig 2 a we still assume that the system has two processes a and b to consider process model uncertainty we assume that process a can be represented by two alternative process models m a 1 and m a 2 an example of this is the penman monteith method monteith 1995 and the hargreaves method hargreaves et al 1985 for estimating potential evapotranspiration for the sake of illustration in fig 2 b we assume that each process model has only one parameter i e parameters x a 1 and x a 2 for m a 1 and m a 2 respectively similarly process b also has two alternative process models i e process model m b 1 with parameter x b 1 and process model m b 2 with parameter x b 2 as a result we have four system models denoted as m a 1 x a 1 m b 1 x b 1 m a 1 x a 1 m b 2 x b 2 m a 2 x a 2 m b 1 x b 1 and m a 2 x a 2 m b 2 x b 2 it should be noted that the simple example of fig 2 b with two processes and one parameter for each process is only for illustrating the design ideas of mmads mmads is applicable to a real world system that contains more than two processes each of which has more than one parameter to illustrate the mmads design ideas we first assume that parametric uncertainty does not exist i e the true values of the parameters x a 1 x a 2 x b 1 and x b 2 are known in this case mmads evaluates the absolute difference dδ of the system model output δ in the following two situations under process model uncertainty 1 transition between the two process models of process a conditioning on model m b 1 of process b the term transition is used here to represent the change within a process model or from one process model to another process model in our case there are four transitions between the two models of process a as follows t m a m a 1 m a 1 m a 1 m a 2 m a 2 m a 1 m a 2 m a 2 where t m a denote the set of process model transitions of process a and the symbol denotes the transition the absolute difference dδ of model output for each transition is evaluated and then averaged over all the four transitions to yield e t m a d δ m b 1 the way of calculating the average is discussed below the e t m a d δ m b 1 term is conditioned on m b 1 and measures how the changes between and within the two process models m a m a 1 m a 2 of process a affect system model output given process model m b 1 since there is no parametric uncertainty at this stage dδ 0 for m a 1 m a 1 and m a 2 m a 2 and dδ for m a 1 m a 2 equals dδ for m a 2 m a 1 these however are not the case when parametric uncertainty exists for the process models and more discussion on this is given later 2 transition between the two models of process a conditioning on model m b 2 of process b repeating the calculation above for m b 2 we have e t m a d δ m b 2 that is conditioned on m b 2 and measures how the changes between and within the two process models m a m a 1 m a 2 affecting system model output given m b 2 for the two terms e t m a d δ m b 1 and e t m a d δ m b 2 obtained in steps 1 and 2 we calculate the average e a d δ e m b e t m a d δ m b for process a which measures how the changes between and within the two models of process a affect the system model output similarly we can also have e b d δ e m a e t m b d δ m a for process b which measures how the changes between and within the two models of process b affect system model output if process a is more influential than process b to the system model output then e a d δ should be larger than e b d δ the calculation for the average e d δ of dδ can be extended to a calculation for the variance v dδ of dδ and its corresponding equation is given in section 3 now let us consider parametric uncertainty i e true parameter values are unknown but parameter probability distributions are known in this case we use x to denote a set of parameter values the true parameter value x may be viewed as one realization of the random parameter as shown in fig 2 b each parameter range is discretized into p 1 equally sized intervals with the parametric uncertainty dδ 0 for transition m a 1 m a 1 because the transition means changes from one point of x a 1 to another point of x a 1 this parameter transition is denoted as x a 1 x a 1 where x a 1 and x a 1 are two points of x a 1 in this case dδ may be denoted as d δ x b m b m a 1 m a 1 x a 1 x a 1 which reads as the difference of a system model output for the parameter transition x a 1 x a 1 associated with process model transition m a 1 m a 1 conditioning on parameter value xb one parameter realization from x b 1 or x b 2 of process model mb m b 1 or m b 2 for process b similarly we can obtain the d δ values for the other three process model transitions in t m a for each of the four process model transitions in t m a there are multiple parameter transitions due to parametric uncertainty resulting in multiple dδ values for a single process model transition we calculate the average of dδ first over the parameter transitions within a process model transition and then across the process model transitions conditioning on a specific point x b of process model mb this gives e t m a d δ x b m b e t m a e t x a t m a d δ x b m b t x a t m a where t x a denotes a parameter transition of x a for the process model transition t m a of process a we further take average first over all parameter points x b and then over all process models m b of process b this gives e a d δ e m b e t m a d δ m b e m b e x b m b e t m a e t x a t m k d δ x b m b t x a t m a for process a the e b d δ term for process b can be evaluated in the same way the variance v d δ of dδ for process a can be evaluated in a similar way and a general equation is given in section 3 e a d δ e b d δ v a d δ and v b d δ are the most critical quantities of mmads and they consider both process model uncertainty and model parameter uncertainty fig 2 b illustrates the transitions between process models and between process model parameters fig 2 b1 and b2 the top row of fig 2 b shows the transitions conditioning on parameter x b 1 of process model m b 1 the red arrows in fig 2 b1 represent possible parameter transitions x a 1 x a 1 for process model transition m a 1 m a 1 and the blue arrows in fig 2 b2 represent possible parameter transitions x a 2 x a 2 for process model transition m a 2 m a 2 the black arrows from fig 2 b1 to b2 illustrate possible parameter transition x a 1 x a 2 for process model transition m a 1 m a 2 and the green arrows from fig 2 b2 to b1 illustrate possible parameter transitions x a 2 x a 1 for process model transition m a 2 m a 1 similarly fig 2 b1 and b2 the bottom row of fig 2 b show the transitions conditioning on parameter x b 2 of process model m b 2 because different process models may have different numbers of parameters and the parameters may have different physical meanings and ranges mmads does not use the derivative based ee of the morris method but uses the absolute difference dδ of model output δ 3 mathematical formulation and numerical implementation 3 1 mathematical formulation the basic ideas explained above are generalized in this section for any number of system processes and any number of process models of each process we first define mathematical symbols used in the generalization if process model uncertainty and parametric uncertainty do not exist system ouput δ m θ m θ 1 θ d is simulated by a single system model m with a vector of d dimensional system model parameters θ θ 1 θ d note that we here use θ to denote a set of deterministic parameter values and reserve θ to denote a set of random parameter values θ can be viewed as a realization of θ if the system of interest consists of multiple processes denoted as a b and each process has its own process model denoted as ma mb and associated parameters denoted as θa θb the system model m θ may be viewed as an integration of the process models i e m θ m a θ a m b θ b together with other system model components common to the processes e g domain discretization system initial conditions and driving forces the process model integration denoted by the union symbol above may need to consider nonlinear interactions between the process models an example of such an integration was given in dai et al 2017a for developing a system model of groundwater reactive transport by integrating processes of rechagre and geology in addition a process may have its sub processes for example a groundwater flow process may consist of sub processes such as recharge geology and evapotranspiration more discussions on process based modular modeling are referred to clark et al 2008 clark et al 2015a clark et al 2015b with the presence of process model uncertainty a system process may be represented by several alternative process models taking process a as an example it may be represented by multiple process models that form a set m a θ a m a 1 θ a 1 m a 2 θ a 2 each process model may have its own parameters or shared parameters with other process models integration of the alternative process models leads to alternative system models i e m θ m a θ a m b θ b if the process model parameters are random they are denoted as θ to be differentiated from θ which is viewed as a realization of θ in this case m θ m a θ a m b θ b becomes m θ m a θ a m b θ b we first give the equations of mean and variance of d δ for process k e g process a in section 2 2 with consideration of process model uncertainty only following the definition of posterior mean and variance of bayesian model averaging e g eqs 4 and 5 in ye et al 2004 the mean and variance of d δ for process k are defined as 2 e k d δ e m k e t m k d δ m k 3 v k d δ e m k v t m k d δ m k v m k e t m k d δ m k where m k in the subscription is the set of multiple process model combinations that represent all processes but k k e g process b in section 2 2 m k is the set of multiple process models only for process k and t m k is the set of process model transitions within process k i e t m k m k i m k j where i j 1 2 n m k with n m k being the number of process models that represent process k eq 2 indicates that if model output δ changes substantially when a process representation changes from m k i to m k j then this process is considered to have significant influence on the model output since there are multiple process model transitions for process k it is practically sensible to use the average e t m k d δ m k of d δ over all possible transitions in addition since the average for process k is for a combination m k of the process models for all the processes but process k it is necessary to evaluate the average e m k e t m k d δ m k over all the combinations the mean e k d δ of the output difference for process k thus measures the overall influence of process k through the transitions between any two process models the variance v k d δ of the output difference defined in eq 3 measures to what extent the output difference spreads out due to nonlinear effects of the process models and or interaction effects between process k and other processes the nonlinear effect is reflected by the v t m k d δ m k term in that if the process models are nonlinear d δ is large for a transition from one process model to another process model the e m k v t m k d δ m k term measures the average nonlinear effect over model set m k the interaction effect is reflected in the v m k e t m k d δ m k term in that the variance v m k is large when e t m k d δ m k is evaluated for two models in model set m k i e mk of process k interacting with m k of all process but k eqs 2 and 3 can be extended to address parameter uncertainty of the process models and the detailed derivation for the extension is given in appendix a the extended eqs 2 and 3 are 4 e k d δ e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 5 v k d δ k e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 2 e m k e θ k m k e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k 2 where subscript θ k m k of e θ k m k indicates that the expectation is with respect to random parameter θ k specific to model m k and subscript t θ k t m k of e t θ k t m k indicates that the expectation is with respect to the random parameters involved in the parameter transitions t θ k associated with the process model transitions t m k the θ k and t θ k terms in the parentheses are a single realization of θ k and t θ k respectively taking the process model transition t m k m a 1 m a 2 as an example the set of parameter transitions with respect to m a 1 m a 2 is t θ a θ a 1 m θ a 2 n where θ a 1 m and θ a 2 n are two randomly selected parameter realizations in θ a 1 and θ a 2 t θ a includes all possible parameter transitions from parameters of m a 1 to parameters of m a 2 when process model uncertainty does not exist i e each process is represented by only one process model eqs 4 and 5 become 6 e k d δ e θ k e t θ k d δ θ k t θ k 7 v k d δ e θ k e t θ k d δ θ k t θ k 2 e θ k e t θ k d δ θ k t θ k 2 these are similar to the mean and variance of elementary effects in the morris screening method and can be used to screen non influential parameters for a single system model for either a single or multiple system models ek dδ and vk dδ are used in the same way as that the mean and standard deviation μ and σ of ee are used the ek dδ and vk dδ of all processes under consideration are plotted in a 2 d plane and a process is more influential than other processes if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are larger than those of other processes however we do not suggest using mmads to rank processes or identify influential processes but to screen non influential processes because the mmads method is qualitative in nature for process identification a quantitative process ranking can be done by using more rigorous but more computationally expensive approaches such as the first order process sensitivity index developed by dai et al 2017a 3 2 model averaging and monte carlo integration the expectations with respect to the process models e m k and process model transitions e t m k in eqs 4 and 5 can be evaluated using the model averaging method via 8 e m k e θ k m k e θ k m k p m k 9 e t m k e t θ k t m k e t θ k t m k p t m k where the dot denotes the quantities in eqs 4 and 5 e g e t m k e t θ k t m k d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k in eq 4 p m k is the probability model averaging weight of a combination of the models for all the processes but process k p t m k is the probability of the transition from one process model to another process model evaluating p m k and p t m k requires that the probability p mk of process models for process k satisfy p m k 1 to evaluate p m k for a combination of process models it is assumed that selecting one process model of a process is independent to selecting one process model of another process with this assumption p m k can be evaluated as p m k i 1 n k p m k i where n k equals the number of processes minus one i e the number of all processes but process k and p m k i is the probability of a process model m k i taking a system with three processes a b and c as an example each process has two alterative models i e a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 c 1 and c 2 and the process models have the following probabilities i e p a 1 p a 2 0 5 p b 1 0 7 p b 2 0 3 p c 1 0 6 and p c 2 0 4 the combination b 1 c 1 of process models b 1 and c 1 has the probability of p b 1 c 1 0 7 0 6 0 42 p t m k of the process model transition m k i m k j can be evaluated as p t m k p m k i p m k j where p m k i and p m k j are the process model probabilities of m k i and m k j respectively this calculation implies that each process model transitions has its own probability depending on the probabilities of the two process models of the transition using process b and its process model probabilities in the example above the probability for transition m b 1 m b 1 is 0 49 and the probability for the transition m b 1 m b 2 is 0 21 the process model probabilities can be either prior probability determined based on prior information or posterior probability determined by using both prior information and observations used for model calibration and uncertainty quantification prior probabilities are used in this study and evaluating posterior probabilities with bayesian model averaging is discussed in dai et al 2017a and lu et al 2015 the expectations e θ k m k and e t θ k t m k with respect to the process model parameters and parameter transitions can be evaluated using monte carlo methods for the convenience of discussion we use the same number n of parameter realizations for each process model combination m k and process model m k to evaluate the mean and variance of d δ using eqs 4 and 5 a total n m k n n m k 2 n 2 numbers of d δ are needed where n m k and n m k are the number of models of process k and the number of combinations of the models for all processes but k respectively the square terms are for the parameter transitions and process model transitions to obtain n m k n n m k 2 n 2 numbers of d δ requires a total n m k n n m k n numbers of model executions to reduce computational cost the n parameter realizations can be generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs method so that a small number of realizations can cover the entire parameter space the procedure of generating the realizations of θ k m k and θ k m k and the procedure of computing d δ θ k m k θ k m k and d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k are as follows step 1 divide the cumulative distribution of each parameter into n equal strata and sample n parameter values from the n strata using the lhs method this results in a sample matrix with the dimension of n np where np is the total number of parameters involved in the multi models step 2 for each process model combination m k combine the columns of parameter values from the parameter matrix generated in step 1 for parameters associated with m k to yield the parameter set θ k m k step 3 for each process model m k combine the columns of parameter values from the parameter matrix generated in step 1 for parameters associated with m k to yield the parameter set θ k m k step 4 loop over the parameter sets θ k m k and θ k m k compute δ θ k m k θ k m k step 5 loop over the process model transitions and parameter transitions to compute d δ θ k m k t θ k t m k fig 3 shows the pseudo code to compute the mean and variance of d δ based on eqs 4 and 5 and the parameter sampling procedure described above 4 two numerical experiments mmads is evaluated using two numerical experiments one experiment is based on the sobol s g function which is commonly used as a benchmark function for sensitivity analysis saltelli et al 2010 since mean ek dδ and varinace vk dδ can be anaytically derived this experiment can be used to verify the computer code based on the pesuedo code shown in fig 3 the other numerical experiment is for one dimensional groundwater flow modeling based on the synthetic case developed by dai et al 2017a the two examples demonstrate the capability and efficiency of mmads for screening non influential processes under both parametric uncertainty and process model uncertainty 4 1 sobol s g function the sobol s g function is defined as saltelli et al 2010 10 g x 1 x k a 1 a k δ 1 δ k α 1 α k i 1 k g i g i 1 α i 2 x i δ i i x i δ i 1 α i a i 1 a i where x i is a parameter following uniform distribution u 0 1 a i r is a positive coefficient δ i 0 1 and α i 0 are shift and curvature parameters respectively and i x i δ i is the integer part of x i δ i the analytical solutions of the sobol s first order s i and total effect s ti sensitivity indices for parameter xi were given by saltelli et al 2010 as s i v i v and s ti v ti v where v i α i 2 1 2 α i 1 a i 2 v ti v i j i 1 v j and v i 1 k 1 v i 1 the total effect sensitivity index s ti is of particular importance to this study because it can quantitatively measure influence of xi on the g function the s ti based ranking of parameter influence is used as a reference to evaluate whether mmads can identify non influential parameters for a single system model for example if a parameter is identified to be non influential by s ti it should also be identified by mmads as non influential the influence of x i is controlled by the curvature parameter α i and coefficient a i a larger α i and a smaller a i give a larger total effect parameter sensitivity index s ti indicating higher influence of xi since s ti does not depend on the shift parameter δ i we set δ i 0 in this study the g i function in eq 10 is then simplified to 11 g i 1 α i 2 x i 1 α i a i 1 a i 4 1 1 processes and process models for an illustrative purpose we set k 10 in eq 10 to consider ten product elements g i i 1 2 10 and assume that each element g i represents a process when there is no process model uncertainty eqs 6 and 7 derived for parameter sensitivity analysis are used for identify non influential processes since each element has only one parameter xi the sensitivty of parameter xi is viewed as the sensitivity of process g i for example if parameter x 1 is the least influential parameter among x 1 x 10 then the process represented by g 1 is the least influential process among the ten processes represented by g 1 g 10 to consider process model uncertainty we assum that each g i has two plausible process models g i 1 and g i 2 i 1 2 10 with the function form of eq 11 but different a i and α i values the uniform distribution of parameter xi is the same for the two process models for the α values we set α i 1 1 and α i 2 2 for all the ten processes where the superscripts 1 and 2 are for the two process models the a i 1 and a i 2 values of the ten processes are listed in table 1 so that the process models are different with different levels of influence to model output taking the first process represented by g 1 as an example its two alternative process models are g 1 1 2 2 x 1 1 0 002 1 002 and g 1 2 3 2 x 1 1 2 0 005 1 005 it should be noted that although this experiment only considers ten processes a combination of the process models yields a total of 210 1 024 system models this large number of system models indicates that the numerical example with ten processes is complex enough for evaluating mmads performance 4 1 2 sensitivity results for individual system models appendix b derives analytical expressions ek dδ and vk dδ of each process for a single system model of the sobol s g function since each process g i has only one parameter xi the sensitivity of process g i is reflected by the sensitivity of parameter xi taking two system models i 1 10 g i 1 and i 1 10 g i 2 as an example table 2 lists the analytical values of ek dδ and vk dδ for parameters x1 x10 associated with the ten processes our numerical results are almost identical to the analytical results with the maximum retaliative error less than 3 table 2 also lists the analytical results of sobol s total effect sensitivity index that is for estimating sensitivity of parameter xi in mmads a process is considered to be less influential than other processes if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of other processes taking system model i 1 10 g i 1 as an example process g 10 is the least influential process or equivalently parameter x 10 is the least influential parameter because it has the smallest ek dδ and vk dδ values among the ten processes the identification of the least influential process is consistent with the identification of the least influential parameter based on the sobol s total effect sensitivity index s ti for system model i 1 10 g i 2 the least influential process becomes g 9 which is also the case for s ti the change of the least influential process is attributed to using different α i and a i values for the two system models the change happens to other system models but results are not shown due to the changes there is uncertainty in identifying non influential system processes and biased identification may be resulted if ignoring process model uncertainty it is thus necessary to use mmads for identifying non influential process under process model uncertainty 4 1 3 sensitivity results for multiple system models based on eqs 4 and 5 appendix c derives analytical expressions of e dδ and v dδ for multiple system models of the sobol s g function to evaluate the ek dδ and vk dδ values for each process we assume that its two process models have equal weights i e p g i 1 p g i 2 0 5 and the analytical results of ek dδ and vk dδ are listed in table 2 the numerical results are almost identical to the analytical results with the maximum retaliative error less than 3 this verifies our computer codes based on the pseudo code shown in fig 3 fig 4 a illustrates how to use the ek dδ and vk dδ values for qualitatively identifying influential and non influential processes for individual system models and multiple system models the ek dδ and v k d δ values are plotted as cross symbols for the multiple system models and as open symbols for the individual system models for the multiple system models fig 4 a suggests that g 1 is the most influential process because it is located at the upper right corner and that g 9 is the least influential process because it is located at the lower left corner for the 1 024 individual system models the ek dδ values of each process are separated into two groups with 512 models in each group this is a special case for the sobol g function because there are two process models for each process and the ek dδ values of a process is determined only by the a and α values of the process model as indicated by eq b7 mmads should be used for identifying non influentual processes not for ranking process influence because ek dδ and vk dδ are approximations for example table 2 shows that for the multiple system models while ek dδ of process g 4 is slightly larger than that of g 5 vk dδ of process g 4 is smaller than that of g 5 it is thus difficult to rank the two processes 4 2 groundwater flow modeling this numerical experiment of groundwater flow modeling is modified from dai et al 2017a as shown in fig 5 the unconfined aquifer has the length of l 10 000 m which is under a steady state condition the aquifer is bounded by two constant head boundaries and subject to a uniform precipitation process model uncertainty exists in the following three system processes 1 recharge process that converts precipitation to aquifer recharge 2 geology process that characterizes hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and 3 snowmelt process that estimates snow melt rate to determine hydraulic head at the east boundary of the domain the process models are described below 4 2 1 processes and process models following dai et al 2017a two recharge models r 1 and r 2 are used to simulate the recharge process that converts precipitation m d to groundwater recharge m d and they are 12 r 1 w a p 14 0 5 r 2 w b p 15 7 where a and b are scaling parameters dimensionless assumed to follow the normal distribution n 2 0 0 42 and the uniform distribution u 0 2 0 5 respectively p is the annual precipitation which is set as 4 175 10 3 m d 1 524mm yr hydraulic conductivity k m d over the domain is parameterized by two geology process models g 1 and g 2 as follows 13 g 1 k for any x g 2 k k 1 for x 7000 k 2 for x 7000 in model g 1 the aquifer is assumed to be homogeneous and the hydraulic conductivity follows the lognormal distribution ln 2 9 0 52 model g 2 has two zones of hydraulic conductivity separated at the location of x 0 7000 m fig 5 the hydraulic conductivities k 1 of zone 1 x less than 7000 m and k 2 of zone 2 x 7000 m are assumed to follow the lognormal distributions ln 2 6 0 32 and ln 3 2 0 32 respectively for the lake boundary its hydraulic head is set to be constant at h 1 300 m for the river boundary the river stage h 2 is determined by the empirical rating curve function below to covert a river discharge into the river stage via 14 h 2 0 3 q 0 6 289 where q is river discharge m3 s and the coefficients of 0 3 0 6 and 289 are chosen arbitrarily for this numerical experiment the river discharge depends on snowmelt runoff via 15 q c sn m s v c a where csn is runoff coefficient dimensionless m is snow melt rate m s svc is the ratio of snow covered area to watershed area a m2 we arbitrarily set csn 0 8 svc 0 7 and a 2000 km2 and use two models to estimate the daily snow melt rate i e the degree day method and the restricted degree day radiation balance method hock 2003 kustas et al 1994 martinec et al 2007 the two models are 16 m 1 m f 1 t a t m m 2 m f 2 t a t m r r n where f 1 and f 2 are snowmelt factors mm d that are assumed to follow normal distributions n 3 5 0 752 and n 2 5 0 32 respectively ta is the average temperature for a given day and tm is the temperature threshold typically set to be 0 when snow melt occurs the second model considers the effects of surface radiation budget rn w m2 and uses conversion factor r mm d w m2 to convert the energy flux to snowmelt rate ta and rn are set as 7 and 80 w m2 respectively and r is assumed to follow the normal distribution of n 0 3 0 052 a combination of the two recharge process models two geology process models and two snowmelt process models leads to a total of eight system models and they are denoted as r 1 g 1 m 1 r 1 g 1 m 2 r 1 g 2 m 1 r 1 g 2 m 2 r 2 g 1 m 1 r 2 g 1 m 2 r 2 g 2 m 1 and r 2 g 2 m 2 all process models have equal weights i e p r1 p r2 0 5 p g1 p g2 0 5 and p m1 p m2 0 5 the groundwater discharge per unit width at the location x 0 7 000 m is the quantity of interest for the sensitivity analysis and it is labeled as q 0 in fig 5 the analytical solution of the discharge q x at any location is derived as 17 q x k 1 h 1 2 h 2 2 2 x 0 λ x 0 λ l 1 2 w x 0 2 λ x 0 2 λ l 2 x 0 λ x 0 λ l w x where λ k 1 k 2 for the geological model g 1 with homogenous hydraulic conductivity i e k k 1 k 2 eq 22 becomes 18 q x k h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l 1 2 w l w x which is the well known solution available in hydrogeology textbooks using the analytical solutions of q x the mmads method is implemented using monte carlo simulations based on the pseudo code shown in fig 3 4 2 2 sensitivity results for individual system models table 3 lists the ek dδ and vk dδ values evaluated for the recharge geology and snowmelt processes of the eight individual system models with consideration of parametric uncertainty if a process model has more than one parameter e g k 1 and k 2 associated with process model g 2 and f 2 and r associated with process model m 2 the indices are evaluated for the grouped parameters specifically speaking the θk term in eqs 4 and 5 includes two parameters for each system model since ek dδ and vk dδ are evaluated for all parameters of each process ek dδ and vk dδ measure influence of individual processes taking system model r 2 g 2 m 2 as an example the mean and variance of parameter b measure influence of the recharge process those of parameters k 1 and k 2 measure influence of the geology process and those of parameters f 2 and r measure influence of the snowmelt process table 3 also lists the total effect parameter sensitivity sti calculated by using salib of herman and usher 2017 sti is used to quantitatively rank the three processes in terms of their influence within each system model and the sti based process rank is used as a reference to evaluate mmads results table 3 shows that for each system model the process rank of mmads is the same as that given by sti indicating that the mmads results are reliable the process rank changes substantially between system models and any of the three processes can be ranked as the most influential or the least influential process for example in system model r 1 g 1 m 1 the recharge process is identified as the least influential process and the snowmelt process as the most influential process whereas it is the opposite case for system model r 2 g 2 m 2 this is also observed in fig 4 b that plots the three processes in three colors recharge in red geology in green and snowmelt in blue the open symbols of the eight individual system models are mixed and do not reveal a pattern to indicate process influence under process model uncertainty it is therefore necessary to use mmads method for identifying non influential processes for all the system models to address process model uncertainty for the individual system models the mmads results can reflect process interactions this is made clear by examining the ek dδ and vk dδ values of r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 which have different recharge models but the same geology and snowmelt models for the two system models with homogeneous hydraulic conductivity based on eq 18 the groundwater discharge per unit width at x 0 7000 m which equals to 0 7l is 19 q x 0 k h 1 2 h 2 2 2 l 0 2 w l this equation shows that w does not interact with k or h 2 indicating that the recharge process does not interact with the geology or snowmelt process as a results between r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 the ek dδ and vk dδ values of a the recharge model parameter change but those of k the geology model parameter and f 1 the snowmelt model parameter do not change this is not surprising in the context of mmads calculation to evaluate the output difference dδ caused by the variation of parameter k of the geology process parameter a or b of the recharge process eq 12 and parameter f 1 of the snowmelt process eq 16 are fixed since the recharge and geology processes do not interact the second term 0 2wl in eq 19 does not affect dδ due to change of k which means that dδ is not affected by parameter a or b therefore the dδ value for k is the same for r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 2 g 1 m 1 on the other hand the process interaction is reflected in the ek dδ and vk dδ values of r 1 g 1 m 1 and r 1 g 1 m 2 these values of k and f 1 for r 1 g 1 m 1 are different from those of k and f 2 r for r 1 g 1 m 2 because the interaction between k and f 1 is different from the interaction between k and f 2 r as indicated by eq 19 4 2 3 sensitivity results for multiple system models in this numerical experiment ek dδ and vk dδ are evaluated numerically using monte carlo simulations based on the procedure discussed in section 3 2 the cumulative distribution of each parameter is divide into n 5000 equal strata to generate 5000 lhs parameter samples fig 6 illustrates convergence of ek dδ and vk dδ of the three processes for the multiple system models convergence for individual system models not shown here the 95 confidence intervals shown in fig 6 are estimated by using 100 bootstrapping resamples to assess the effect of sampling uncertainty and to evaluate robustness of the estimator to sample variability archer et al 1997 yang 2011 fig 6 shows that the ek dδ and vk dδ values converge after about 350 parameter realizations and the corresponding total number of model executions is 980 000 2 2 350 2 350 a discussion on computational cost of mmads is given in section 5 table 3 lists the ek dδ and vk dδ values of the recharge geology and snowmelt processes with consideration of both process model and parametric uncertainty the two sensitivity measures listed in table 3 are estimated by using all 5000 parameter realizations and the corresponding number of model executions is 200 000 000 2 2 5000 2 5000 the large number of model executions is affordable in this numerical example due to the use of analytical solutions of q 0 and the numerical results shown in table 3 are accurate enough for identifying non influential processes a discussion on computational cost of mmads is given in section 5 mmads identifies the snowmelt process as the most influential one followed by the geology process and then the recharge process this is also observed in fig 4 b that plots ek dδ and v k d δ for the three processes using cross symbols in three colors the snowmelt process has the largest ek dδ and vk dδ values substantially larger than those of the geology and recharge process this may be due to the nonlinear effect of the snowmelt process reflected by the h 2 2 term in eqs 17 or 18 and the interaction between the snowmelt and geology processes discussed above due to the qualitative nature of mmads using it to explain the nonlinear effect and process interactions is not straightforward 5 further investigation and discussion 5 1 computational cost and robustness of mmads although 200 000 000 2 2 5000 2 5000 model executions are used for the groundwater example the high computational cost is unnecessarily and can be substantially reduced in practice to determine the smallest number of model executions that can give accurate results for the groundwater flow modeling example we gradually increase the number n of parameter realizations from 10 to 400 and evaluate a criterion called robustness by following razavi and gupta 2016 for each n value ek dδ and vk dδ of the three processes are estimated by 100 numerical experiments with 100 different sets of random parameter samples based on the ek dδ and vk dδ values we count how many times when snowmelt is identified by mmads as the most influential process geology as the second most influential process and recharge as the least influential process the process ranking is obtained above using 200 million model executions dividing the numbers by 100 gives mmads robustness for identifying influential processes the results are plotted in fig 7 for the three processes the figure shows that mmads is almost 100 robust to identify snowmelt as the most influential process even for a small number n of parameter realizations when n is small mmads cannot correctly identify recharge as the least influential process or identify geology as the second least influential process the mmads robustness is the same for ranking the recharge and geology processes because the groundwater example considers only three processes and snowmelt is always identified as the most influential process an important observation from fig 7 is that the mmads results are accurate enough with robustness larger than 95 when using n 20 parameter realizations the corresponding number of model executions is 3 200 2 2 20 2 20 substantially smaller than the number of 200 million model executions this number of model executions is expected to be computationally affordable for moderate models with nowadays computational resources available to general molders in addition the model executions are independent and can be conducted in parallel which can further improve computational efficiency of mmads 5 2 effects of process model probabilities on mmads method the numerical experiments above assume equal probabilities for alternative process models whereas it is likely that the models have different probabilities to explore the effects of process model probabilities on ek dδ and vk dδ we evaluate the mean and variance for the groundwater flow modeling example using different sets of process model probabilities for the groundwater experiment since each process has two alternative models and the sum of their probabilities is one e g p r 1 p r 2 1 0 for the recharge process we only need to vary probabilities of three process models one for each process we thus vary p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 and generate their values from the standard uniform distribution u 0 1 therefore for each process a random number r is sampled for from the uniform distribution u 0 1 and transformed into process probability values following the approach described by moeini et al 2011 subsequently sobol s variance based sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine sensitivity of ek dδ and vk dδ to process model probabilities which is referred to as a sensitivity analysis of a sensitivity analysis paleari and confalonieri 2016 puy et al 2020 for estimating sobol s first order si and total effect sti sensitivity indices we use the sampling scheme discussed in saltelli et al 2010 to generate two sampling matrices a and b each has the dimension of 1000 rows 3 columns corresponding to 1000 realizations of the model probabilities of p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 based on a and b three additional matrices are generated and each is denoted as ci i 1 2 and 3 ci is a copy of a but its column i is replaced with column i of matrix b si and sti are estimated using the 5000 parameter sets of the five matrices estimating si and sti does not require new dδ values because the sensitivity analysis only changes process model probabilities fig 8 shows that the e dδ and v dδ values of the three processes change with model probabilities of the corresponding processes for example in fig 8 a and 8 d e dδ and v dδ of the recharge process vary with probability p r 1 of model r 1 for all the three processes their ek dδ and vk dδ values change when process model probability changes the magnitude of changes is the largest for the snowmelt process fig 8 c and 8 f the variation patterns are different for the three processes in fig 8 a and 8 d for the recharge process ek dδ and vk dδ generally decrease when p r 1 increases the variation pattern is the opposite for the geology process as shown in fig 8 b and 8 e for the snowmelt process fig 8 c and 8 f shows that ek dδ and vk dδ first increase and then decrease with the increase of p m 1 the non monotonic variation pattern indicates that using appropriate model probability values is important for mmads to identifying non influential processes it should be noted that although each plot of fig 8 only shows ek dδ or vk dδ changes with probability of one process model ek dδ and vk dδ are also affected by probability of the other two process models it is possible that inappropriate probability of one process model may affect identification influence of non influence of another process investigating this is warranted in a future study we further examine to what extent process model probability affects identification of non influential processes for the 5000 realizations of ek dδ and vk dδ values we count how many times each process is identified as the most non influential process i e the process ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of the other two processes the recharge process is identified as the most non influential one for 2758 out of 5000 times 55 16 the geology process for 2080 times 41 60 the snowmelt process for 25 times 0 50 these quantitative results indicate again that using appropriate model probability values is important for mmads to identifying non influential processes fig 9 illustrates sobol s total effect sensitivity index sti evaluated for ek dδ and vk dδ the results of fist order sensitivity index si are similar and thus not shown the sti values are estimated for each process and measure sensitivity of the process to p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 fig 9 a indicates that ek dδ of the recharge process is most sensitive to p r 1 and then to p g 1 but not to p m 1 this is different for the geology and snowmelt processes whose ek dδ values are most sensitive to p m 1 this is especially the case for the snowmelt process fig 9 b shows to what extent vk dδ of each process is sensitive to p r 1 p g 1 and p m 1 we observe from fig 9 that ek dδ and vk dδ of a process are substantially sensitive to the process s model probability which is not surprising while the sensitivity of one process ek dδ and vk dδ to other processes model probability may be negligible it is not always the case this indicates again that it is important to accurately estimate model probability of all processes for identifying non influential processes 5 3 limitations and future work the mmads method discussed in this study is subject to three limitations the first limitation is that the computational cost for n m k n n m k n number of model executions may be high especially for a large number n of parameter realizations although fig 7 indicates that n 20 gives satisfactory results for the groundwater example each process model has only one or two parameters when the number of random model parameters increase the number of parameter realizations is expected to increase and the curse of dimensionality may occur one way to reduce the computational cost of mmads is to break the two nested loops of parameter realizations shown in fig 3 and this can be done by using the binning method that was used in dai et al 2017a 2017b the binning method reduces the number of model executions from the order of n 2 to the order of n and its implementation is straightforward however the binning method is not mathematically rigorous and more theoretical development is needed in a future study the second limitation is that the derivation of ek dδ and vk dδ in eqs 4 and 5 implicitly assumes that the probabilities of process models and model parameters are independent this assumption for parameters may be invalid in practice and joint parameter distributions of a variety of forms may be needed after the joint distributions are determined correlated parameter realizations can be generated using various approaches e g lhs for estimating ek dδ and vk dδ for correlated process models their joint probability has not been adequately studied the bayesian network of dai et al 2019 may potentially address the issue of process model correlation but more in depth investigation is needed the last limitation is the qualitative nature of the mmads method in the current study a process is identified to be non influential if its ek dδ and vk dδ values are smaller than those of other processes the identification is in a relatively sense and it is possible for mmads to identify the most influential or non influential process however mmads cannot quantify the extent that one process is more influential or non influential than another process on the other hand if one is not interested in the most non influential process but a set of processes that are non influential mmads does not provide a quantitative threshold to decisively identify the processes while this problem may be addressed by using a clustering method discussed in sheikholeslami et al 2019 the drawback of mmads is inherent in screening methods including the morris screening method 6 conclusions this study develops a new multi model absolute difference based sensitivity mmads analysis method to identify non influential system processes with consideration of uncertainty in both process model structures and process model parameters mmads is an extension of the morris method from the parameter space to the parameter model space in which a system process may be represented by multiple process models the absolute differences of a model output are first evaluated by considering not only process model variation but also process model parameter variation the variations are quantified by the mean and variance of the differences which are evaluated by using the model averaging approaches based on probabilities of process models a process with small mean and variance is considered to be non influential to our knowledge there does not exist a method like mmads that explicitly considers uncertainty in process model structures and process model parameters and integrates the expended morris method with model averaging methods the two numerical experiments employed in this study demonstrate the following 1 the process ranking changes between alternative system models which manifests the needs of identifying non influential system processes under process model uncertainty and process model parametric uncertainty 2 considering only parametric uncertainty may lead to biased identification of non influential processes 3 for the first numerical experiment with the sobol s g function the analytical solutions for the mean and variance of the multi model differences verify the pseudo code and numerical code used to evaluate the mean and variance of mmads 3 the second numerical experiment of groundwater flow modeling with three interacting processes shows that the mean and variance of mmads reflect interactions between geology and snowmelt processes and no interactions between the two processes and the recharge process the mmads method similar to the morris method plots the mean and standard deviation of the multi model differences in a 2 d plane and the plot can be used to visually identify non influential system processes for the numerical example of groundwater flow modeling mmads method can give a meaningful process ranking with a small number of model executions in mmads the process model probabilities can play an important role in determining non influential processes similar to the morris method mmads method may be used as a screening tool for qualitatively identifying non influential processes while mmads is used for differential equation based groundwater models in this study the method can be applied to data driven models that are developed using statistical and or machine learning techniques because applications of mmads do not rely on knowing model structures but only need to consider transitions between models and model inputs a further investigation on this is warranted declaration of competing interest the authors

3479,the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature has a significant effect on the coupled heat water transport in freezing soil which can cause the frost heave and thaw settlement and thus influence the stability of infrastructures the premelting theory for water ice in soils is developed to study the unfrozen water variation in freezing soil the developed theory integrates the interfacial premelting of contact ice the soil particles the melting of the ice surface and the premelting induced by impurity and curvature a model to predict the unfrozen water content is then established by considering the change of unfrozen water film the equivalent grain size is introduced to improve the solving efficiency in the calculation finally the proposed analytical model is verified by the test data the results indicate that the thickness of water film in soils increases when the surface charge density and the impurity concentration increase under the same supercooling degree the surface melting on the interfaces of soil particle and the pore ice has key influence on the variation of the liquid water content meanwhile the unfrozen water content increases with the increasing impurity concentration and surface charge on soil particles besides the unfrozen water content also increases with the decreasing radius of soil particles keywords unfrozen water water film

surface in china xu et al 1995 under the long term range of environmental temperature in these areas infrastructures suffer periodical freeze thaw action due to the water ice phase transition the variation of unfrozen water content during the freeze thaw process can affect the mechanical and physical properties of soil e g the strength permeability and thermal conductivity zhang et al 2017 thus how to reasonably predict the variation of unfrozen water content is key for frozen soil in cold regions existing studies indicate that the unfrozen water content in the soil depends on the temperature soil type salt components water saturation and freezing thawing process xu et al 1995 bing and ma 2011 dall amico et al 2011 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 li et al 2018 usually the water ice phase is relatively difficult due to the low freezing temperature for the soil with finer particles higher ion content particularly chloridion and lower water saturation meanwhile hysteresis phenomenon appears for the unfrozen water content during the freezing thawing process and it decreases with the increase of freeze thaw cycles shoop and bigl 1997 tian et al 2014 numerous theoretical models were proposed to describe the variation of unfrozen water content in frozen soil combing with the homogeneous nucleation theory the pore plugging and the single pore theory hitchcock et al 2011 revealed the freeze thaw hysteresis mechanism of liquid in a porous medium anderson and tice 1972 firstly discovered the power function relationship between the unfrozen water content and temperature and presented an empirical equation to calculate the unfrozen water content however the parameters in the equation need to be determined by experiments subsequently several exponential or power function equations have been further improved and developed mckenzie et al 2007 kong et al 2020 some parameters that related to the physical properties are added in these equations including the specific surface area the saturation ratio ect later studies have confirmed that water freezing in soils is affected by pore pressure xu et al 1995 to consider the pore pressure variation during the water ice phase change process clapeyron equation was firstly used in porous media to describe the relationship among the ice water pressure and temperature black 1995 the study of black 1995 lays a key theoretical base to reveal heat water behavior in frozen soil daanen and nieber 2009 painter and karra 2014 lai et al 2014 chai et al 2018 researchers have proposed several models to describe the water content variation during the freezing thawing process by developing the clapeyron equation dall amico et al 2011 established an equation to calculate the unfrozen water content by combining the clapeyron equation with the soil water characteristic curve however the model is not appropriate for the unsaturated soil because of the complexity in solving soil water potential sheshukov and nieber 2011 derived a prediction formula for unfrozen water content by considering the residual water content and improving the clapeyron equation ideal prediction models were presented considering the hypotheses of the freezing sequence of pore water from macro pore to micro pore with the introduction of the pore size distribution function wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 suggested a method based on the grain size distribution to obtain the variation of unfrozen water content at different temperatures the above models supply theoretical guidance for the analyses of unfrozen water content in freezing soil however they mostly depend on the soil water characteristic curve which needs to be obtained from laboratory tests meanwhile the physical meanings of some parameters in these models anderson and tice 1972 dall amico et al 2011 wang et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 are relatively vague besides several parameters which even cannot be obtained by experiment are determined according to the engineering experience furthermore the spherical pore is assumed in the current models for unfrozen water content considering pore size distribution which needs to be further clarified because the ice crystallization changes with a pore size wan and yang 2020 premelting of ice in a porous medium provides a new idea for the calculation of unfrozen water content the premelting theory for the unfrozen water content in the porous medium at subfreezing temperatures was firstly presented by cahn et al 1992 the complex influence of impurities on the interfacial and surface of melting ice in the premelting theory was discussed by wettlaufer 1999 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 defined impurities interfacial premelting of the charged solid surface and curvature induced premelting by the impurities to describe the premelting in a porous medium impurities and surface charge measurement can determine the water content in the uniform solid particle size medium the physical conception of the parameters in the premelting theory is very clear meanwhile the charged characteristics impurity concentration and some microscopic characteristics are also well considered in premelting theory however the theory is mainly used to calculate the unfrozen water content for the equal diameter spherical particle system and very few data on the predicting method for soils were published in this study we developed the premelting theory for soils by considering the effect of curvature and ice grain boundary melting a new equation for soil was established according to the distribution of liquid pore water during the freezing process then the unfrozen water content data for different types of soils clay silty clay loess and sand were selected to validate the developed analytical model finally the effect of impurity and the radius of soil particles on unfrozen water content are also discussed based on the model 2 theory of phase change phase transition between ice and water is a physiochemical process and the reversible equilibrium of ice and water is firstly discussed in porous medium in an open system the chemical potential can be defined as follows prausnitz et al 1999 1 μ i g n i t p n j where g μi ni t and p represent the gibbs free energy chemical potential of a substance i the amount of a substance i temperature and pressure respectively the chemical potential related to any standard states can be presented as follows steiger 2005 2 μ i μ i r t ln a i where μ i is the standard state chemical potential of substance i ai is the activity of substance i and their related calculation can be found in prausnitz et al 1999 and steiger et al 2008 and r is the gas constant an ideal system is considered to be composed of a fusible substance in voids of a porous medium to consider the interface between solid ice and liquid water in the medium an interfacial free energy ginterface associated with the width of liquid water film is proposed in our calculation it is assumed that the solid phase of the substance is homogeneous and isotropic at a certain temperature and pressure the total gibbs free energy can be written as 3 g i μ i n i δ mix g g int e r f a c e d where d is the width of liquid water film mixg is the variation of gibbs free energy caused by the entropy of mixing in frozen soils and it can be written as eq 4 the detailed deduction process about mixg is shown in appendix a 4 δ mix g r t n i ln a i hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 demonstrated that interfacial energy has two contributions 5 g int e r f a c e d f dis d f elec d a h 12 π d 2 2 q s 2 κ ε ε 0 e κ d in eq 5 6 κ εε 0 k t d e 2 n a n im where κ 1 is the debye length for monovalent ions f dis d is dispersion forces f elec d captures the effect of immobile charges at the interface ah is hamaker constant ε0 is the vacuum permittivity ε is the relative permittivity of liquid water na is avogadro s number e is the electron charge k is boltzmann s constant and q s is immobile surface charges with a given surface charge density a ternary system is assumed for frozen soils including the soil particle layer the premelted quasiliquid layer water film with width d and the ice crystals layer usually soils contain a certain amount of impurity such as ions bing and ma 2011 therefore gibbs free energy for the frozen medium with impurity can be obtained by eq 7 7 g t p n l n s n im μ l t p n l μ s t p n s μ im t p n im r t n l ln a l n s ln a s n im ln a im g int e r f a c e d where the subscripts l s and im refer to the liquid solid ice and impurity in soils respectively the solid ice and the liquid water are in equilibrium at the freezing point of liquid and the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium can be expressed as 8 g n s g n l in normal condition the activity of ice can be taken as 1 according to prausnitz et al 1999 the latent heat between water and ice is estimated as a constant at a temperature around tm 273 15 k the difference between chemical potentials per mole of the solid and the liquid can be determined at the constant pressure wan and yang 2020 9 μ l μ s s l s s t m t l wi t m δ t where sl and ss are entropy of the liquid water and solid ice respectively lwi refers to the latent heat of phase change between water and ice and δt is the temperature deviation from 273 15 k thus the eq 10 can be obtained by combining with eqs 7 9 10 ρ l l wi t m δ t ρ l r t ln a l g int e r f a c e d g interface is the the derivative of ginterface combined with eq 5 eq 10 can be written as follows 11 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l a h ρ l 6 π

of ice is neglected in this study in the ice water system ice crystal is surrounded by liquid water eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 13 g t p n l n s n im μ l t p n l μ s t p n s μ im t p n im r t n l ln a l n s ln a s n im ln a im a s γ sl where γsl is the surface free energy between ice and water and as refers to the area of ice crystal it should be noted that n s ρsvs in the total system for the general case of the interfacial surface with principal radii of curvatures r 1 and r 2 eq 8 can be used to obtain the temperature decrease caused by curved liquid surface in thermodynamic equilibrium the relationship among them is shown in eq 14 14 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l γ sl ρ s 1 r 1 1 r 2 where ρs is the molar density of ice crystal 3 interfacial melting in soils soil is a particular porous medium and the above theory on phase change between ice and water can be used to solve ice melting problem although soils usually contain different grain sizes an ideal system can be assumed in fig 1 arya and paris 1981 the soil particles with the same size are stacked up in a certain space in the system ice completely fills the pores or interstices between adjacent grain matrices of spherical particles before melting meanwhile solid particles are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the test can determine grain size distribution and the grain diameter is taken as the same in a small range of soil particle size the ratio of the volume of soil with ri to the total volume of soil is taken as fi considering the liquid in pores and neck among pores the amount of liquid depends on the soil particles pack condition two typical particle packs corresponding to the most densely arrangement and loosest arrangement of soil particles including the simple cubic packing sc fig 2 a and the cubic close packing fcc fig 2b are utilized for the calculation of liquid content it s assumed that there exists only one grain ice crystal in each pore and a grain boundary in each neck between pores to analyze the model in a simple way a basic unit is supposed as a cube dashed lines in fig 2 the packing fraction fp i for sphere radius ri is defined as the ratio of total sphere occupied volume to total volume of soil particle with radius ri and the interstices between these soil particles the value of fp i is estimated from the geometrical shape illustrated in fig 2 for these two particle packs the common value of fp i sc 0 5236 in fig 2a and fp i fcc 0 7405 in fig 2b are selected cahn et al 1992 respectively all pore water turns into ice crystal when soils at ultra low temperature and total interstitial spaces will be filled with ice crystals before pre melting ice crystals begin to melt when the temperature rises ice crystals start to melt and water exists in the form of film water and interstitial water the film water mainly exists on the surface of soil particles and the interface of ice crystals while the interstitial water mainly remains in the interstices surrounded by ice crystals and soil particles the temperature of the film water is determined by the ice liquid curved interface thus sections 3 1 and 3 2 focus on the method of solving above two forms of liquid water 3 1 surface melting on the surface of soil particles and ice grains if np i is defined as soil particle number per unit volume of soil with sphere radius ri the entire superficial area per unit soil volume can be calculated as 15 s p i 4 π r i 2 n p i where n p i is 1 8ri 3 for sc and 2 8 r i 3 for fcc respectively the packing fraction fp i can be estimated by eq 16 16 f p i 4 3 π r i 3 n p i therefore s p i is derived as 17 s p i 3 r i f p i for the sc packing each pore possesses six equivalent nearest neighbor pores fig 2 the number of pores is the same as soil particles in each soil unit hence there are three grain boundaries for every soil particle because two soil particles share one ice grain surface four touched spheres in a square confine the necks joining pores fig 3 a the area of grain boundary can be calculated using geometric dimensioning in sc packing fig 3 the area for each ice grain boundary which is the contact area between two adjacent ice crystals as shown in fig 3a is equal to the difference between the square area and the soil particles area considering that the ri is far less than ri the calculated equation can be written as eq 18 18 s gb i sc 2 r i 2 r i 2 π r i r i 2 4 π r i r i 2 therefore the entire superficial area which is contributed by the ice grain boundary per unit volume can be estimated as 19 s gb i sc 3 n p i s gb i sc 3 4 π 8 r i r i 2 r i 3 for the fcc packing soil grain size is reduced to arrange the spherical soil particle each neck is bounded by three touched spheres fig 3b the area for each grain boundary is equal to the difference between the triangle area and the area of soil grain it can be approximately calculated by eq 20 20 s gb i fcc 3 π 2 r i r i 2 there are eight tetrahedrons in the fcc packing every tetrahedron includes four triangular faces therefore one unit cell includes thirty two necks each soil particle comprises eight necks because each unit cell consists of four soil particles fig 3b the entire superficial area contributed by the grain ice boundary per unit volume is estimated by eq 21 21 s gb i fcc 8 n p i s gb i fcc 2 3 π 2 r i r i 2 r i 3 the volume of liquid in the film at the spherical soil particles and grain ice boundaries per unit volume of soil can be written as 22 f l i mat f l i gblayer s p i d p i s gb i d gb i 3 2 melting induced by sharp curvature regions there are two types of the region with sharp curvature one is the crevices between two adjacent spheres fig 4 caused by the formation of ice crystal in a pore consisting of several particles the other is the edge between the ice grain boundaries and the spheres fig 3a which is formed by the two adjacent ices when they touch with each other on any particle surface the volume for each crevice approximates to 2πriri 2 when ri is far less than ri cahn et al 1992 for the sc packing one sphere has six neighboring spheres however every sphere possesses twelve neighboring spheres for the fcc packing thus there are three crevices per sphere for the sc packing and six crevices per sphere for the fcc packing eqs 23 and 24 determine the volume of the crevices per unit soil volume in sc and fcc packing respectively 23 f l i crevice sc 3 n p i sc 2 π r i r i 2 3 4 π r i 2 r i 2 24 f l i crevice fcc 6 n p i fcc 2 π r i r i 2 3 2 2 π r i 2 r i 2 if neglect the correlation between the curvature of adjacent spheres and the interface between ice and water the liquid water in the cross section fig 3a is written as 25 s edge i 2 r i 2 π r i 2 4 according to the above analyses each soil particle contains one pore and three ice grain boundaries for the sc packing and eight necks for the fcc packing for the sc packing every ice grain boundary has a total edge length that equals to the arc length of touched soil particles fig 3a 4 2πri 4 2πri each neck comprises a total edge length for the fcc packing that equals to the arc length of three touched soil particles fig 3b 3 2πri 6 πri therefore the following equations can calculate the total melting volume in neck per unit soil volume 26 f l i edge sc 2 π r i 3 s edge i n p i sc 3 π r i 2 8 r i 2 27 f l i edge fcc π r i 8 s edge i n p i fcc 2 π r i 2 2 r i 2 the total liquid fraction in volume composed of soil particle with radius ri can be obtained as the sum of the four individual contributions which were derived as f l i mat

ri by r which is the radius of the spherical particle eq 14 determines the freezing point of liquid water in the crevices and the ice grain boundary edges usually the two principal radii of curvatures are different and the greater radius of the surface on the ice water interface can be eliminated to simplify the gibbs thomson equation therefore eq 14 is presented as 31 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l γ sl ρ s 1 r i for an ideal dilute solution al nim ρld thus the radius of curvature in eq 31 can be estimated by eq 32 32 r i γ sl ρ s l wi t m δ t r t m n im ρ l d considering the soil composes of the different radius of particles the total liquid fraction in the soil be obtained as follows 33 f l 1 n f i f l i in which 34 f i η i r i 3 η i r i 3 where ηi is the ratio of the number of soil particles with radius ri to the total number of soil particles it can be obtained from the distribution of soil particles it is necessary to build the relationship between the initial impurity concentration and the numbers of mole per unit area of the impurities all pores are filled with liquid water when the temperature reaches 273 15 k furthermore all the impurities are assumed to dissolve in liquid water the initial impurity concentration cim 0 can be calculated using the maximum film width which is equal to the radius of necks joining pores shown in fig 3 35 c im 0 sc n im n 2 1 r 36 c im 0 fcc 2 n im n 3 1 r where n is the number of ions per solute molecule for sodium chloride n 2 for soil with low impurity concentration the ideal gas theorem is applicable the eq 11 can

grain boundary hansen goos et al 2010 other significant parameters are listed in table 1 according to the volume fraction distribution for soil particles the total unfrozen water content can be calculated by eq 33 in the equation the unfrozen water content under different soil particle radii requires to be determined to simplify the solution an equivalent grain size re is introduced and shape factor α is considered when soil particle is completely spherical α 1 thus eq 33 can be written as 38 f l fcc 3 α r e f p fcc d p 2 3 π 2 α r e r 2 α r e 3 d gb 3 2 π 2 r 2 α r e 2 2 π 2 r 2 α r

sl t m l wi ρ s δ t 4 results and analyses 4 1 temperature decrease caused by the variation of the liquid film for common soils such as silty clay loess and sandy loam the surface charge density can be approximately taken as qs 1 0 10 1 c m2 jin et al 2019 usually the surface charge density on the ice surface is impossible to reach this high value 1 0 10 1 c m2 daigle 2021 and it is much smaller compared with the surface charge density on soil particle surface thus the action of ice surface charge on water freezing is ignored in the calculation besides electrical interactions at low ion concentrations wilen et al 1995 is not considered the temperature decrease of pore liquid water caused by the variation of the liquid film is calculated by eq 37 fig 5 illustrates the relative results fig 5 displays that the variation of undercooling with liquid film width the undercooling increases as the width of liquid film decreases concentration essentially influences the rate of temperature decrease in the same variation of liquid film width by increasing impurity concentration the undercooling δt firstly decreases at the thicker liquid film then at the thinner one when the nim exceeds 1 μmol m2 the undercooling δt increases as nim increases at the same liquid film width moreover there must be a large undercooling δt dozens of kelvins even hundreds of kelvins at high concentration to create the width of the liquid film several nanometers in ice liquid soil particle system fig 5a when the amount of charges on the surface of a solid reduce fig 5b the undercooling δt drastically decreases at the range of thick liquid film under low impurity concentration meanwhile the impurity can decrease the undercooling δt within certain limits especially for a tiny amount of concentration the undercooling δt approaches to 11 5 k and 0 115 k above 5 nm for pure water for qs 0 1 c m2 and qs 0 01 c m2 respectively thus for pure water it can be inferred that the freezing process of water is entirely determined by the free energy caused by immobile surface charges at the thicker liquid film the dispersion force mostly regulates the freezing water action when the liquid coating is several nanometers thick the influence of immobile surface charges on undercooling decreases as concentration rises especially for low immobile surface charges following that the amount of undercooling is determined by the amount of water activity 4 2 variation of unfrozen water content eq 11 estimates the temperature decrease for a certain width of the liquid film the radius of the surface on the ice liquid interface r can be estimated using eq 32 subsequently the total unfrozen water content can be determined fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the radius and the temperature decrease during the liquid freezing process clearly the radius of the ice liquid interface increases as the concentration of impurity increases at the same temperature range a higher amount of water exists for higher concentration at the same temperature the immobile surface charge decrease results in uniform temperature decrease at high water undercooling such as above 1 k however immobile surface charge apparently affects the water supercooling below 1 k the impact of impurity concentration on the temperature decrease reduces below 0 1 μmol m2 when the immobile surface charge decreases the supercooling is entirely determined by impurities when the concentration is larger than 0 1 μmol m2 when the radius of the soil particle is taken as 10 μm fig 7 depicts the evolution of unfrozen water content in the sc model under four individual contributions each individual contribution may be seen to be unique and the surface of soil particles has a major influence on the water freezing process the unfrozen water is mainly determined by the width of the water film on the surface of soil particles when the impurity concentration is lower than 10 μmol m2 the unfrozen water content decreases to approximately 10 4 m3 m3 at approximately supercooling 100 k however the unfrozen water content caused by premelting on grain boundary decreases to a value of less than 10 5 m3 m3 at the same conditions the unfrozen water content induced by crevices and necks reduces to 10 5 m3 m3 at approximately 10 k moreover the unfrozen water content increases as the concentration of impurity rises although the unfrozen water content increases with the reduction of the impurity concentration when the concentration is less than 0 1 μmol m2 the variation characteristic is distinct for the melting on soil particles surface and at the grain boundary within a small concentration range the impurity concentration has less effect on the variation of unfrozen water content contributed by crevices and necks 4 3 applications in soils to analyze the effect of the impurity concentration and soil particle size on the unfrozen water content same sized soil particles are assumed to be a specific type of soil three kinds of soil particles with radius r 1 μm 10 μm and 100 μm are analyzed based on the above mentioned equations respectively for a high concentration of impurity we suppose the concentration is higher than 0 01 mol l eqs 35 and 36 reveal that the concentration of impurity is greater than 4 μmol m2 when the soil particles radius is larger than 1 μm the liquid fraction changes due to the supercooling which can be calculated based on the above equations fig 8 illustrates the results of a liquid fraction under different impurity concentrations the amount of unfrozen water is directly affected by the impurity concentration when the concentration of soil particles with the same radius increases the change rate of the unfrozen water content decreases it is more difficult for the pore water of soil particles with a smaller radius to freeze at the same starting volumetric concentration for example the initial freezing point is about 0 18 c in the sc model when the initial volumetric concentration is 0 024 mol l at the r 1 μm fig 8a whereas it increases to approximately 0 07 c at the same concentration when r 10 μm fig 8b however it remains constant at the same concentration when the radius is larger than 10 μm fig 8c the difference in the initial freezing point of soil with different radii decreases when the concentration increases the initial freezing point is about 0 76 c in the sc model when the initial volumetric concentration is 0 24 mol l at the r 1 μm however it increases to approximately 0 70 c at the same concentration when r is larger than 10 μm the water freezing curve for soil particles with different radii illustrates the same features when the concentration reaches 2 4 mol l fig 9 indicates the variations of unfrozen water content under different soil particles radii to eliminate the effect of impurity concentration the initial volumetric concentration is set as the same it can be seen the unfrozen water content decreases as the soil particle radius increases the unfrozen water content decreases from approximately 10 3 m3 m3 to 10 5 m3 m3 at δt 100 k when the soil particle radius varies from 1 μm to 100 μm the variation of unfrozen water content is mainly determined by melting on soil particles surface at the smaller soil particle radius the total unfrozen water content approaches the liquid water content caused by the variation of the liquid film on soil particles surface at r 1 μm the only difference is the initial freezing point the total water content approaches to when δt is larger than 1 k without the effect of radius size the radius of the surface determines the initial freezing point on the ice liquid interface at lower volumetric concentrations such as 2 4 10 5 mol l the variation of total unfrozen water content closes to the unfrozen water content contributed by crevices and necks f l i crevice f l i edge at the beginning of water freezing when the soil particle s radius increases moreover the contribution caused by grain boundary is small compared with other parts in low temperature e g f l mat f l crevice and f l edge the variation of unfrozen water content with δt is illustrated in fig 10 in the calculation the surface charge is not considered the variation is the same when the soil particle s radius is larger than 10 μm at a lower initial volumetric impurity concentration however the unfrozen water content decreases more quickly near the initial freezing point at a lower radius r 1 μm when the surface charge is not considered fig 10 therefore for a lower initial volumetric concentration of impurity the pore water freezing becomes more difficult under the surface charge s action the influence gradually decreases in the freezing process of pore water especially when δt is larger than 10 k the reason is the increase of the concentration weakens the effect of surface charge and predominates the pore water freezing process the equivalent grain size can be obtained via the distribution of soil particle size fig 11 lists three kinds of soil particle distribution they are silty clay loess and sand respectively usually soil particle distribution is shown as a mass fraction which is replaced by corresponding volume fraction for the convenience of calculation for the silty clay its equivalent soil particle radius is approximately 8 μm according to the soil particle size distribution fig 11a for loess and sand their equivalent grain radii are 10 μm and 56 μm respectively moreover the equivalent soil particle size of clay is about 4 μm xu et al 1995 leng et al 2010 for most types of soils the initial freezing point is from 0 2 to 0 5 c wen et al 2012 wan et al 2015 and the volumetric impurity concentration is attributed to mainly affect the freezing point here the concentration approximates 0 05 mol l wan et al 2015 so the immobile surface impurities concentration is determined by eqs 35 and the initial concentration is about 3 3 102 μmol m2 if the radius is taken as 8 μm and popular solute is assumed as sodium chloride a typical salt in soils then eqs 38 and 39 could calculate the unfrozen water content in soils fig 12 illustrates the calculated and measured experimental results of unfrozen water content in different soils in calculation the initial supercooling a phenomenon that when temperature is below the freezing point of water the water keeps liquid state within a certain temperature range is ignored the sc and fcc models reasonably predict the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature specifically at the beginning of the freezing process δt 6 k in silty clay clay and sand δt 4 k in loess the calculated unfrozen water content by the sc model is closer to the test results fig 12a fig 12b fig 12c with the decreasing of temperature the calculated unfrozen water content by the fcc model is closer to the test results 4 4 a case for no charge and impurity the unfrozen water content then be calculated by combining eqs 38 39 41 and 42 for two solid particle matrixes of monosized spherical particles graphitized carbon black powders and polystyrene powders their average diameters of powder particles are 0 24 and 10 μm respectively the suggested values of αr e 0 1 μm for graphitized carbon black powders and αr e 1 5 μm for polystyrene powders are selected dash et al 2006 fig 13 illustrates the results of comparison between the calculated and experimental results of unfrozen water content by the sc and fcc packing powders the improved sc and fcc models predict the unfrozen water content reasonably the presented models show higher accuracy at the higher suppercooling compared to the models by cahn et al 1992 fig 13a 13b additionally the prediction value of the model in this study approaches to test data in smaller grain sized powders fig 13a however the prediction of unfrozen water content shows a relatively larger error for larger sized powder at low supercooling ranging from 1 k to 5 k compared to cahn et al s 1992 models fig 13b one reason is to simplify the calculation of unfrozen water content on the surface of soil particles by treating the ice water interface as cusps at particle contacts which reduces the value of unfrozen water content the other is that the experiential data has very little variation at low supercooling ranging from 1 k to 5 k thus it is difficult to simulate unfrozen water content variation at this temperature range 5 discussions a method for the calculation of unfrozen water content in freezing soil is presented based on the variation of the water film the pore water is determined by four premelting effects of pore solution including the surface melting on the interface of soil particle and ice the ice grain boundary melting the crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles the results demonstrate that surface melting plays a dominant role in pore water freezing the unfrozen water content is mainly determined by the impurity concentration surface charge on the soil particle surface and the radius of soil particles the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature reduces when the impurity concentration and the surface charge on soil particles increase and the radius of soil particles decreases the influence of dispersion forces on water freezing is explicit with few nanometers thick of the water film the effect of immobile charges at the soil particle surface on water freezing is determined by the relative concentration between impurity and immobile charges the influence produced by immobile charges decreases as the impurity concentration increases which causes the debye length to decrease to evaluate the unfrozen water content the correlation between liquid water content and the supercooling is connected with the thickness of the water film this study correlates the thickness d of the premelted layer as a function of the undercooling δt if a value of d is assumed the corresponding δt can be obtained based on eq 11 meanwhile the unfrozen water content can be determined by solving eqs 38 and 39 at the value of d consequently the variation of unfrozen water content with undercooling δt can be determined the higher division of d causes the higher accuracy of unfrozen water content obtained this method differs from the traditional methods using exponential or power function relationship or soil freezing characteristic curve anderson and tice 1972 dall amico et al 2011 lai et al 2014 tang et al 2018 lu et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 wan and yang et al 2020 some parameters in traditional models cannot present apparent physical meaning which considerably limits the understanding of the models however most of parameters in the developed permelting model have clear physical meaning the physical and chemical characteristics of soil particles such impurity concentration charge on the surface of soil particle surface free energy between ice and water the equivalent diameter of soil etc are introduced to the present model usually the variation of unfrozen water content in soils is small when the temperature decreases below 20 c chai et al 2018 the water film is difficult to be several nanometers at such low temperature range thus the interfacial energy contributed by dispersion forces can be ignored in solving unfrozen water content in soils our presented equation is more appropriate for saturated soils the variation of unfrozen water content has not been changed along the original freezing curve of saturated soils for unsaturated soils there is solely necessary to move the original freezing curve of saturated soils started from the value of initial saturability to the initial freezing point however the initial freezing point for unsaturated soils is different from that in saturated soil wen et al 2012 so it is effective to solve the problem combing soil water characteristic curve with soil water freezing curve wan and yang 2020 for practical soils soil particles surface is uneven and the shapes of soil particles are not necessarily spherical the suggested shape factor α for most soils ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 its value is more appropriate to take a larger one for sand and a smaller one for clay but the physical significance of the shape factor is unclear and how to consider the hybrid condition about the particle shape and roughness of the particle surface is still unknown besides the present model do not consider the structural differences in different soils this maybe one of the reasons for poor simulation in clay so future studies in these areas are recommended to develop a model to improve the computational accuracy of unfrozen water content 6 conclusions this study presents an analytical model based on a developed premelting theory an equivalent grain size is introduced to the analytical model to improve the solution efficiency the analyses and applications discuss the effects of impurity concentration the immobile charge on the particle s surface and the radius of soil particles on unfrozen water content the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the thickness of water film is mainly determined by the immobile charge on the surface of soil particles and the concentration of impurity it increases when the surface charge density and the concentration of impurity increase at the same temperature decrease rate 2 the variation of unfrozen water content decreases when the impurity concentration and the immobile charge on the surface of soil particles increase and the radius soil particle decreases 3 pore water is determined by four premelting effects of pore solution including the surface melting on the interface of soil particle and ice and the ice crystal boundary melting the crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles the surface melting on the interface of soil particles and ice plays a pivotal role in the variation of the liquid water content during the freezing process and the other effects on unfrozen water content induced by ice crystal boundary melting crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and crevice melting along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles decreases in order 4 an equivalent soil particle size based on the distribution of soil particle size should consider the shape factor in soils which is suggested to range from 0 24 to 0 36 when the soil type varies from clay to sand the variation of the unfroze water content caused by the surface areas of soil particles and the ice grain boundaries are the function of δt 1 3 however the variation of unfrozen water content contributed by a number of crevices and total perimeter length is the function of δt 2 for soils without immobile charge and

3479,the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature has a significant effect on the coupled heat water transport in freezing soil which can cause the frost heave and thaw settlement and thus influence the stability of infrastructures the premelting theory for water ice in soils is developed to study the unfrozen water variation in freezing soil the developed theory integrates the interfacial premelting of contact ice the soil particles the melting of the ice surface and the premelting induced by impurity and curvature a model to predict the unfrozen water content is then established by considering the change of unfrozen water film the equivalent grain size is introduced to improve the solving efficiency in the calculation finally the proposed analytical model is verified by the test data the results indicate that the thickness of water film in soils increases when the surface charge density and the impurity concentration increase under the same supercooling degree the surface melting on the interfaces of soil particle and the pore ice has key influence on the variation of the liquid water content meanwhile the unfrozen water content increases with the

surface in china xu et al 1995 under the long term range of environmental temperature in these areas infrastructures suffer periodical freeze thaw action due to the water ice phase transition the variation of unfrozen water content during the freeze thaw process can affect the mechanical and physical properties of soil e g the strength permeability and thermal conductivity zhang et al 2017 thus how to reasonably predict the variation of unfrozen water content is key for frozen soil in cold regions existing studies indicate that the unfrozen water content in the soil depends on the temperature soil type salt components water saturation and freezing thawing process xu et al 1995 bing and ma 2011 dall amico et al 2011 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 li et al 2018 usually the water ice phase is relatively difficult due to the low freezing temperature for the soil with finer particles higher ion content particularly chloridion and lower water saturation meanwhile hysteresis phenomenon appears for the unfrozen water content during the freezing thawing process and it decreases with the increase of freeze thaw cycles shoop and bigl 1997 tian et al 2014 numerous theoretical models were proposed to describe the variation of unfrozen water content in frozen soil combing with the homogeneous nucleation theory the pore plugging and the single pore theory hitchcock et al 2011 revealed the freeze thaw hysteresis mechanism of liquid in a porous medium anderson and tice 1972 firstly discovered the power function relationship between the unfrozen water content and temperature and presented an empirical equation to calculate the unfrozen water content however the parameters in the equation need to be determined by experiments subsequently several exponential or power function equations have been further improved and developed mckenzie et al 2007 kong et al 2020 some parameters that related to the physical properties are added in these equations including the specific surface area the saturation ratio ect later studies have confirmed that water freezing in soils is affected by pore pressure xu et al 1995 to consider the pore pressure variation during the water ice phase change process clapeyron equation was firstly used in porous media to describe the relationship among the ice water pressure and temperature black 1995 the study of black 1995 lays a key theoretical base to reveal heat water behavior in frozen soil daanen and nieber 2009 painter and karra 2014 lai et al 2014 chai et al 2018 researchers have proposed several models to describe the water content variation during the freezing thawing process by developing the clapeyron equation dall amico et al 2011 established an equation to calculate the unfrozen water content by combining the clapeyron equation with the soil water characteristic curve however the model is not appropriate for the unsaturated soil because of the complexity in solving soil water potential sheshukov and nieber 2011 derived a prediction formula for unfrozen water content by considering the residual water content and improving the clapeyron equation ideal prediction models were presented considering the hypotheses of the freezing sequence of pore water from macro pore to micro pore with the introduction of the pore size distribution function wang et al 2017 xiao et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 suggested a method based on the grain size distribution to obtain the variation of unfrozen water content at different temperatures the above models supply theoretical guidance for the analyses of unfrozen water content in freezing soil however they mostly depend on the soil water characteristic curve which needs to be obtained from laboratory tests meanwhile the physical meanings of some parameters in these models anderson and tice 1972 dall amico et al 2011 wang et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 are relatively vague besides several parameters which even cannot be obtained by experiment are determined according to the engineering experience furthermore the spherical pore is assumed in the current models for unfrozen water content considering pore size distribution which needs to be further clarified because the ice crystallization changes with a pore size wan and yang 2020 premelting of ice in a porous medium provides a new idea for the calculation of unfrozen water content the premelting theory for the unfrozen water content in the porous medium at subfreezing temperatures was firstly presented by cahn et al 1992 the complex influence of impurities on the interfacial and surface of melting ice in the premelting theory was discussed by wettlaufer 1999 hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 defined impurities interfacial premelting of the charged solid surface and curvature induced premelting by the impurities to describe the premelting in a porous medium impurities and surface charge measurement can determine the water content in the uniform solid particle size medium the physical conception of the parameters in the premelting theory is very clear meanwhile the charged characteristics impurity concentration and some microscopic characteristics are also well considered in premelting theory however the theory is mainly used to calculate the unfrozen water content for the equal diameter spherical particle system and very few data on the predicting method for soils were published in this study we developed the premelting theory for soils by considering the effect of curvature and ice grain boundary melting a new equation for soil was established according to the distribution of liquid pore water during the freezing process then the unfrozen water content data for different types of soils clay silty clay loess and sand were selected to validate the developed analytical model finally the effect of impurity and the radius of soil particles on unfrozen water content are also discussed based on the model 2 theory of phase change phase transition between ice and water is a physiochemical process and the reversible equilibrium of ice and water is firstly discussed in porous medium in an open system the chemical potential can be defined as follows prausnitz et al 1999 1 μ i g n i t p n j where g μi ni t and p represent the gibbs free energy chemical potential of a substance i the amount of a substance i temperature and pressure respectively the chemical potential related to any standard states can be presented as follows steiger 2005 2 μ i μ i r t ln a i where μ i is the standard state chemical potential of substance i ai is the activity of substance i and their related calculation can be found in prausnitz et al 1999 and steiger et al 2008 and r is the gas constant an ideal system is considered to be composed of a fusible substance in voids of a porous medium to consider the interface between solid ice and liquid water in the medium an interfacial free energy ginterface associated with the width of liquid water film is proposed in our calculation it is assumed that the solid phase of the substance is homogeneous and isotropic at a certain temperature and pressure the total gibbs free energy can be written as 3 g i μ i n i δ mix g g int e r f a c e d where d is the width of liquid water film mixg is the variation of gibbs free energy caused by the entropy of mixing in frozen soils and it can be written as eq 4 the detailed deduction process about mixg is shown in appendix a 4 δ mix g r t n i ln a i hansen goos and wettlaufer 2010 demonstrated that interfacial energy has two contributions 5 g int e r f a c e d f dis d f elec d a h 12 π d

interface ah is hamaker constant ε0 is the vacuum permittivity ε is the relative permittivity of liquid water na is avogadro s number e is the electron charge k is boltzmann s constant and q s is immobile surface charges with a given surface charge density a ternary system is assumed for frozen soils including the soil particle layer the premelted quasiliquid layer water film with width d and the ice crystals layer usually soils contain a certain amount of impurity such as ions bing and ma 2011 therefore gibbs free energy for the frozen medium with impurity can be obtained by eq 7 7 g t p n l n s n im μ l t p n l μ s t p n s μ im t p n im r t n l ln a l n s ln a s n im ln a im g int e r f a c e d where the subscripts l s and im refer to the liquid solid ice and impurity in soils respectively the solid ice and the liquid water are in equilibrium at the freezing point of liquid and the condition for thermodynamic equilibrium can be expressed as 8 g n s g n l in normal condition the activity of ice can be taken as 1 according to prausnitz et al 1999 the latent heat between water and ice is estimated as a constant at a temperature around tm 273 15 k the difference between chemical potentials per mole of the solid and the liquid can be determined at the constant pressure wan and yang 2020 9 μ l μ s s l s s t m t l wi t m δ t where sl and ss are entropy of the liquid water and solid ice respectively lwi refers to the latent heat of phase change between water and ice and δt is the temperature deviation from 273 15 k thus the eq 10 can be obtained by combining with eqs 7 9 10 ρ l l wi t m δ t ρ l r t ln a l g int e r f a c e d g interface is the the derivative of ginterface combined with eq 5 eq 10 can be written as follows 11 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l a h ρ l 6 π

of ice is neglected in this study in the ice water system ice crystal is surrounded by liquid water eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 13 g t p n l n s n im μ l t p n l μ s t p n s μ im t p n im r t n l ln a l n s ln a s n im ln a im a s γ sl where γsl is the surface free energy between ice and water and as refers to the area of ice crystal it should be noted that n s ρsvs in the total system for the general case of the interfacial surface with principal radii of curvatures r 1 and r 2 eq 8 can be used to obtain the temperature decrease caused by curved liquid surface in thermodynamic equilibrium the relationship among them is shown in eq 14 14 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l γ sl ρ s 1 r 1 1 r 2 where ρs is the molar density of ice crystal 3 interfacial melting in soils soil is a particular porous medium and the above theory on phase change between ice and water can be used to solve ice melting problem although soils usually contain different grain sizes an ideal system can be assumed in fig 1 arya and paris 1981 the soil particles with the same size are stacked up in a certain space in the system ice completely fills the pores or interstices between adjacent grain matrices of spherical particles before melting meanwhile solid particles are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic the test can determine grain size distribution and the grain diameter is taken as the same in a small range of soil particle size the ratio of the volume of soil with ri to the total volume of soil is taken as fi considering the liquid in pores and neck among pores the amount of liquid depends on the soil particles pack condition two typical particle packs corresponding to the most densely arrangement and loosest arrangement of soil particles including the simple cubic packing sc fig 2 a and the cubic close packing fcc fig 2b are utilized for the calculation of liquid content it s assumed that there exists only one grain ice crystal in each pore and a grain boundary in each neck between pores to analyze the model in a simple way a basic unit is supposed as a cube dashed lines in fig 2 the packing fraction fp i for sphere radius ri is defined as the ratio of total sphere occupied volume to total volume of soil particle with radius ri and the interstices between these soil particles the value of fp i is estimated from the geometrical shape illustrated in fig 2 for these two particle packs the common value of fp i sc 0 5236 in fig 2a and fp i fcc 0 7405 in fig 2b are selected cahn et al 1992 respectively all pore water turns into ice crystal when soils at ultra low temperature and total interstitial spaces will be filled with ice crystals before pre melting ice crystals begin to melt when the temperature rises ice crystals start to melt and water exists in the form of film water and interstitial water the film water mainly exists on the surface of soil particles and the interface of ice crystals while the interstitial water mainly remains in the interstices surrounded by ice crystals and soil particles the temperature of the film water is determined by the ice liquid curved interface thus sections 3 1 and 3 2 focus on the method of solving above two forms of liquid water 3 1 surface melting on the surface of soil particles and ice grains if np i is defined as soil particle number per unit volume of soil with sphere radius ri the entire superficial area per unit soil volume can be calculated as 15 s p i 4 π r i 2 n p i where n p i is 1 8ri 3 for sc and 2 8 r i 3 for fcc respectively the packing fraction fp i can be estimated by eq 16 16 f p i 4 3 π r i 3 n p i therefore s p i is derived as 17 s p i 3 r i f p i for the sc packing each pore possesses six equivalent nearest neighbor pores fig 2 the number of pores is the same as soil particles in each soil unit hence there are three grain boundaries for every soil particle because two soil particles share one ice grain surface four touched spheres in a square confine the necks joining pores fig 3 a the area of grain boundary can be calculated using geometric dimensioning in sc packing fig 3 the area for each ice grain boundary which is the contact area between two adjacent ice crystals as shown in fig 3a is equal to the difference between the square area and the soil particles area considering that the ri is far less than ri the calculated equation can be written as eq 18 18 s gb i sc 2 r i 2 r

are two types of the region with sharp curvature one is the crevices between two adjacent spheres fig 4 caused by the formation of ice crystal in a pore consisting of several particles the other is the edge between the ice grain boundaries and the spheres fig 3a which is formed by the two adjacent ices when they touch with each other on any particle surface the volume for each crevice approximates to 2πriri 2 when ri is far less than ri cahn et al 1992 for the sc packing one sphere has six neighboring spheres however every sphere possesses twelve neighboring spheres for the fcc packing thus there are three crevices per sphere for the sc packing and six crevices per sphere for the fcc packing eqs 23 and 24 determine the volume of the crevices per unit soil volume in sc and

particle contains one pore and three ice grain boundaries for the sc packing and eight necks for the fcc packing for the sc packing every ice grain boundary has a total edge length that equals to the

ri by r which is the radius of the spherical particle eq 14 determines the freezing point of liquid water in the crevices and the ice grain boundary edges usually the two principal radii of curvatures are different and the greater radius of the surface on the ice water interface can be eliminated to simplify the gibbs thomson equation therefore eq 14 is presented as 31 l wi t m δ t r t ln a l γ sl

concentration and the numbers of mole per unit area of the impurities all pores are filled with liquid water when the temperature reaches 273 15 k furthermore all the impurities are assumed to dissolve in liquid water the initial impurity concentration cim 0 can be calculated using the maximum film width which is equal to the radius of necks joining pores shown in fig 3 35 c im 0 sc n im n

grain boundary hansen goos et al 2010 other significant parameters are listed in table 1 according to the volume fraction distribution for soil particles the total unfrozen water content can be calculated by eq 33 in the equation the unfrozen water content under different soil particle radii requires to be determined to simplify the solution an equivalent grain size re is introduced and shape factor α is considered when soil particle is completely spherical α 1 thus eq 33 can be written as 38 f l fcc 3 α r e f p fcc d p 2 3 π 2 α r e r 2 α r e 3 d gb 3 2 π 2 r 2 α r e 2 2 π 2 r 2 α r

sl t m l wi ρ s δ t 4 results and analyses 4 1 temperature decrease caused by the variation of the liquid film for common soils such as silty clay loess and sandy loam the surface charge density can be approximately taken as qs 1 0 10 1 c m2 jin et al 2019 usually the surface charge density on the ice surface is impossible to reach this high value 1 0 10 1 c m2 daigle 2021 and it is much smaller compared with the surface charge density on soil particle surface thus the action of ice surface charge on water freezing is ignored in the calculation besides electrical interactions at low ion concentrations wilen et al 1995 is not considered the temperature decrease of pore liquid water caused by the variation of the liquid film is calculated by eq 37 fig 5 illustrates the relative results fig 5 displays that the variation of undercooling with liquid film width the undercooling increases as the width of liquid film decreases concentration essentially influences the rate of temperature decrease in the same variation of liquid film width by increasing impurity concentration the undercooling δt firstly decreases at the thicker liquid film then at the thinner one when the nim exceeds 1 μmol m2 the undercooling δt increases as nim increases at the same liquid film width moreover there must be a large undercooling δt dozens of kelvins even hundreds of kelvins at high concentration to create the width of the liquid film several nanometers in ice liquid soil particle system fig 5a when the amount of charges on the surface of a solid reduce fig 5b the undercooling δt drastically decreases at the range of thick liquid film under low impurity concentration meanwhile the impurity can decrease the undercooling δt within certain limits especially for a tiny amount of concentration the undercooling δt approaches to 11 5 k and 0 115 k above 5 nm for pure water for qs 0 1 c m2 and qs 0 01 c m2 respectively thus for pure water it can be inferred that the freezing process of water is entirely determined by the free energy caused by immobile surface charges at the thicker liquid film the dispersion force mostly regulates the freezing water action when the liquid coating is several nanometers thick the influence of immobile surface charges on undercooling decreases as concentration rises especially for low immobile surface charges following that the amount of undercooling is determined by the amount of water activity 4 2 variation of unfrozen water content eq 11 estimates the temperature decrease for a certain width of the liquid film the radius of the surface on the ice liquid interface r can be estimated using eq 32 subsequently the total unfrozen water content can be determined fig 6 illustrates the relationship between the radius and the temperature decrease during the liquid freezing process clearly the radius of the ice liquid interface increases as the concentration of impurity increases at the same temperature range a higher amount of water exists for higher concentration at the same temperature the immobile surface charge decrease results in uniform temperature decrease at high water undercooling such as above 1 k however immobile surface charge apparently affects the water supercooling below 1 k the impact of impurity concentration on the temperature decrease reduces below 0 1 μmol m2 when the immobile surface charge decreases the supercooling is entirely determined by impurities when the concentration is larger than 0 1 μmol m2 when the radius of the soil particle is taken as 10 μm fig 7 depicts the evolution of unfrozen water content in the sc model under four individual contributions each individual contribution may be seen to be unique and the surface of soil particles has a major influence on the water freezing process the unfrozen water is mainly determined by the width of the water film on the surface of soil particles when the impurity concentration is lower than 10 μmol m2 the unfrozen water content decreases to approximately 10 4 m3 m3 at approximately supercooling 100 k however the unfrozen water content caused by premelting on grain boundary decreases to a value of less than 10 5 m3 m3 at the same conditions the unfrozen water content induced by crevices and necks reduces to 10 5 m3 m3 at approximately 10 k moreover the unfrozen water content increases as the concentration of impurity rises although the unfrozen water content increases with the reduction of the impurity concentration when the concentration is less than 0 1 μmol m2 the variation characteristic is distinct for the melting on soil particles surface and at the grain boundary within a small concentration range the impurity concentration has less effect on the variation of unfrozen water content contributed by crevices and necks 4 3 applications in soils to analyze the effect of the impurity concentration and soil particle size on the unfrozen water content same sized soil particles are assumed to be a specific type of soil three kinds of soil particles with radius r 1 μm 10 μm and 100 μm are analyzed based on the above mentioned equations respectively for a high concentration of impurity we suppose the concentration is higher than 0 01 mol l eqs 35 and 36 reveal that the concentration of impurity is greater than 4 μmol m2 when the soil particles radius is larger than 1 μm the liquid fraction changes due to the supercooling which can be calculated based on the above equations fig 8 illustrates the results of a liquid fraction under different impurity concentrations the amount of unfrozen water is directly affected by the impurity concentration when the concentration of soil particles with the same radius increases the change rate of the unfrozen water content decreases it is more difficult for the pore water of soil particles with a smaller radius to freeze at the same starting volumetric concentration for example the initial freezing point is about 0 18 c in the sc model when the initial volumetric concentration is 0 024 mol l at the r 1 μm fig 8a whereas it increases to approximately 0 07 c at the same concentration when r 10 μm fig 8b however it remains constant at the same concentration when the radius is larger than 10 μm fig 8c the difference in the initial freezing point of soil with different radii decreases when the concentration increases the initial freezing point is about 0 76 c in the sc model when the initial volumetric concentration is 0 24 mol l at the r 1 μm however it increases to approximately 0 70 c at the same concentration when r is larger than 10 μm the water freezing curve for soil particles with different radii illustrates the same features when the concentration reaches 2 4 mol l fig 9 indicates the variations of unfrozen water content under different soil particles radii to eliminate the effect of impurity concentration the initial volumetric concentration is set as the same it can be seen the unfrozen water content decreases as the soil particle radius increases the unfrozen water content decreases from approximately 10 3 m3 m3 to 10 5 m3 m3 at δt 100 k when the soil particle radius varies from 1 μm to 100 μm the variation of unfrozen water content is mainly determined by melting on soil particles surface at the smaller soil particle radius the total unfrozen water content approaches the liquid water content caused by the variation of the liquid film on soil particles surface at r 1 μm the only difference is the initial freezing point the total water content approaches to when δt is larger than 1 k without the effect of radius size the radius of the surface determines the initial freezing point on the ice liquid interface at lower volumetric concentrations such as 2 4 10 5 mol l the variation of total unfrozen water content closes to the unfrozen water content contributed by crevices and necks f l i crevice f l i edge at the beginning of water freezing when the soil particle s radius increases moreover the contribution caused by grain boundary is small compared with other parts in low temperature e g f l mat f l crevice and f l edge the variation of unfrozen water content with δt is illustrated in fig 10 in the calculation the surface charge is not considered the variation is the same when the soil particle s radius is larger than 10 μm at a lower initial volumetric impurity concentration however the unfrozen water content decreases more quickly near the initial freezing point at a lower radius r 1 μm when the surface charge is not considered fig 10 therefore for a lower initial volumetric concentration of impurity the pore water freezing becomes more difficult under the surface charge s action the influence gradually decreases in the freezing process of pore water especially when δt is larger than 10 k the reason is the increase of the concentration weakens the effect of surface charge and predominates the pore water freezing process the equivalent grain size can be obtained via the distribution of soil particle size fig 11 lists three kinds of soil particle distribution they are silty clay loess and sand respectively usually soil particle distribution is shown as a mass fraction which is replaced by corresponding volume fraction for the convenience of calculation for the silty clay its equivalent soil particle radius is approximately 8 μm according to the soil particle size distribution fig 11a for loess and sand their equivalent grain radii are 10 μm and 56 μm respectively moreover the equivalent soil particle size of clay is about 4 μm xu et al 1995 leng et al 2010 for most types of soils the initial freezing point is from 0 2 to 0 5 c wen et al 2012 wan et al 2015 and the volumetric impurity concentration is attributed to mainly affect the freezing point here the concentration approximates 0 05 mol l wan et al 2015 so the immobile surface impurities concentration is determined by eqs 35 and the initial concentration is about 3 3 102 μmol m2 if the radius is taken as 8 μm and popular solute is assumed as sodium chloride a typical salt in soils then eqs 38 and 39 could calculate the unfrozen water content in soils fig 12 illustrates the calculated and measured experimental results of unfrozen water content in different soils in calculation the initial supercooling a phenomenon that when temperature is below the freezing point of water the water keeps liquid state within a certain temperature range is ignored the sc and fcc models reasonably predict the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature specifically at the beginning of the freezing process δt 6 k in silty clay clay and sand δt 4 k in loess the calculated unfrozen water content by the sc model is closer to the test results fig 12a fig 12b fig 12c with the decreasing of temperature the calculated unfrozen water content by the fcc model is closer to the test results 4 4 a case for no charge and impurity the unfrozen water content then be calculated by combining eqs 38 39 41 and 42 for two solid particle matrixes of monosized spherical particles graphitized carbon black powders and polystyrene powders their average diameters of powder particles are 0 24 and 10 μm respectively the suggested values of αr e 0 1 μm for graphitized carbon black powders and αr e 1 5 μm for polystyrene powders are selected dash et al 2006 fig 13 illustrates the results of comparison between the calculated and experimental results of unfrozen water content by the sc and fcc packing powders the improved sc and fcc models predict the unfrozen water content reasonably the presented models show higher accuracy at the higher suppercooling compared to the models by cahn et al 1992 fig 13a 13b additionally the prediction value of the model in this study approaches to test data in smaller grain sized powders fig 13a however the prediction of unfrozen water content shows a relatively larger error for larger sized powder at low supercooling ranging from 1 k to 5 k compared to cahn et al s 1992 models fig 13b one reason is to simplify the calculation of unfrozen water content on the surface of soil particles by treating the ice water interface as cusps at particle contacts which reduces the value of unfrozen water content the other is that the experiential data has very little variation at low supercooling ranging from 1 k to 5 k thus it is difficult to simulate unfrozen water content variation at this temperature range 5 discussions a method for the calculation of unfrozen water content in freezing soil is presented based on the variation of the water film the pore water is determined by four premelting effects of pore solution including the surface melting on the interface of soil particle and ice the ice grain boundary melting the crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles the results demonstrate that surface melting plays a dominant role in pore water freezing the unfrozen water content is mainly determined by the impurity concentration surface charge on the soil particle surface and the radius of soil particles the variation of unfrozen water content with temperature reduces when the impurity concentration and the surface charge on soil particles increase and the radius of soil particles decreases the influence of dispersion forces on water freezing is explicit with few nanometers thick of the water film the effect of immobile charges at the soil particle surface on water freezing is determined by the relative concentration between impurity and immobile charges the influence produced by immobile charges decreases as the impurity concentration increases which causes the debye length to decrease to evaluate the unfrozen water content the correlation between liquid water content and the supercooling is connected with the thickness of the water film this study correlates the thickness d of the premelted layer as a function of the undercooling δt if a value of d is assumed the corresponding δt can be obtained based on eq 11 meanwhile the unfrozen water content can be determined by solving eqs 38 and 39 at the value of d consequently the variation of unfrozen water content with undercooling δt can be determined the higher division of d causes the higher accuracy of unfrozen water content obtained this method differs from the traditional methods using exponential or power function relationship or soil freezing characteristic curve anderson and tice 1972 dall amico et al 2011 lai et al 2014 tang et al 2018 lu et al 2019 qiu et al 2020 wan and yang et al 2020 some parameters in traditional models cannot present apparent physical meaning which considerably limits the understanding of the models however most of parameters in the developed permelting model have clear physical meaning the physical and chemical characteristics of soil particles such impurity concentration charge on the surface of soil particle surface free energy between ice and water the equivalent diameter of soil etc are introduced to the present model usually the variation of unfrozen water content in soils is small when the temperature decreases below 20 c chai et al 2018 the water film is difficult to be several nanometers at such low temperature range thus the interfacial energy contributed by dispersion forces can be ignored in solving unfrozen water content in soils our presented equation is more appropriate for saturated soils the variation of unfrozen water content has not been changed along the original freezing curve of saturated soils for unsaturated soils there is solely necessary to move the original freezing curve of saturated soils started from the value of initial saturability to the initial freezing point however the initial freezing point for unsaturated soils is different from that in saturated soil wen et al 2012 so it is effective to solve the problem combing soil water characteristic curve with soil water freezing curve wan and yang 2020 for practical soils soil particles surface is uneven and the shapes of soil particles are not necessarily spherical the suggested shape factor α for most soils ranges from 0 2 to 0 4 its value is more appropriate to take a larger one for sand and a smaller one for clay but the physical significance of the shape factor is unclear and how to consider the hybrid condition about the particle shape and roughness of the particle surface is still unknown besides the present model do not consider the structural differences in different soils this maybe one of the reasons for poor simulation in clay so future studies in these areas are recommended to develop a model to improve the computational accuracy of unfrozen water content 6 conclusions this study presents an analytical model based on a developed premelting theory an equivalent grain size is introduced to the analytical model to improve the solution efficiency the analyses and applications discuss the effects of impurity concentration the immobile charge on the particle s surface and the radius of soil particles on unfrozen water content the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the thickness of water film is mainly determined by the immobile charge on the surface of soil particles and the concentration of impurity it increases when the surface charge density and the concentration of impurity increase at the same temperature decrease rate 2 the variation of unfrozen water content decreases when the impurity concentration and the immobile charge on the surface of soil particles increase and the radius soil particle decreases 3 pore water is determined by four premelting effects of pore solution including the surface melting on the interface of soil particle and ice and the ice crystal boundary melting the crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles the surface melting on the interface of soil particles and ice plays a pivotal role in the variation of the liquid water content during the freezing process and the other effects on unfrozen water content induced by ice crystal boundary melting crevice melting at the contacts among soil particles and crevice melting along the perimeter lines where grain boundaries terminate at soil particles decreases in order 4 an equivalent soil particle size based on the distribution of soil particle size should consider the shape factor in soils which is suggested to range from 0 24 to 0 36 when the soil type varies from clay to sand the variation of the unfroze water content caused by the surface areas of soil particles and the ice grain boundaries are the function of δt 1 3 however the variation of unfrozen water content contributed by a number of crevices and total perimeter length is the function of δt 2 for soils without immobile charge and
