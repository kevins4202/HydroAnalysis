6165,predicting the evolution of concentration distribution for contaminant transport in wetland flows has a wide range of ecological applications to account for the ecological effect such as substrate absorption the influence of bed absorption on the dispersion process of contaminant transport in a wetland channel with rectangular cross section is analytically investigated in this study by the technique of long time asymptotic expansion the combined effects of bed absorption free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect are demonstrated by parameter analysis in terms of the bed absorption coefficient and the aspect ratio of the channel section the studied cases illustrate that bed absorption decreases the total mass of the contaminant cloud retained in the flow and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud increases as the intensity of bed absorption amplifies environmental dispersivity is augmented with bed absorption in a deep wetland channel which is inverse in a shallow channel the effect of bed absorption weakens the positive skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the wetland channel approaches square while strengthens the negative skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the channel is relatively shallow moreover the cross sectional mean concentration decays faster under the effect of bed absorption for applications the critical length and duration of the influenced region are presented with bed absorption keywords bed absorption environmental dispersion mean concentration distribution wetland flow influenced region 1 introduction wetland ecosystems such as rivers lakes and coastal zones

transverse and longitudinal dispersion with artificial and real emergent vegetation the process of transport and dispersion of tracers in wetland channels with both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies were also experimentally investigated de serio et al 2018 wetlands with aquatic vegetation exhibit complicated flow behavior leading to difficulties in assessing the fate of contaminant clouds shucksmith et al 2011 2010 to illustrate the transport process based on taylor s classical analysis of dispersion taylor 1953 1954 zeng and chen 2009 extended the phase average technique to wetland flows in order to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and solid in the studied region rajagopal and tao 1995 liu and masliyah 2005 based on the phase average model numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the solute transport process in different wetland flows wang et al 2018a jiang et al 2017 wang et al 2014 wu et al 2011 zeng and chen 2011 for example solute transport in free water surface effect dominated wang and zeng 2019 zeng et al 2019 swarup and dalal 2019 wu et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 wang and huai 2018 wu and singh 2018

or multi zone wu et al 2011 chen 2013 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 wu et al 2016a wetland flows have been widely discussed moreover the effect of wind on environmental dispersion in wetland flow is also analyzed wang and huai 2018 zeng et al 2012 li et al 2017 the above studies provide valuable information on contaminant transport in wetland flows to account for the ecological effect such as substrate absorption contaminant transport in wetland flow under the effect of bed absorption also deserves attention the model of boundary absorption with an irreversible first order catalytic reaction is widely employed ng and yip 2001 berkowitz and zhou 1996 dijk and berkowitz 1998 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 studied the interphase mass transport due to an irreversible first order reaction at the wall i e the wall is conductive and solved the convective diffusion equation by gill s method gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 after that solute dispersion in tube flow with wall reaction has been widely discussed smith 1983 mazumder and das 1992 jiang and grotberg 1993 ng and rudraiah 2008 jiang and chen 2018 provided higher order solutions regarding gill 1967 s generalized dispersion model for solute transport in poiseuille flow with wall absorption despite this the contaminant transport process in wetland flows is very different from that in pure fluid flows due to the existence of vegetation shao et al 2014 recently wang and chen 2016 studied the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant transport in open channel flow and found that the effect of bed absorption strengthened the downstream inhomogeneity of vertical concentration distribution similar result that bed absorption causes downstream large transverse concentration non uniformity has been found by barik and dalal 2018 by the three scale perturbation analysis wang and chen 2017b also revealed that contaminant cloud shows to be more contracted and reformed by bed absorption with an increasing damping factor of wetland flows such explorations focusing on the multi dimensional concentration distribution of the contaminant cloud instead of solely the stream wise distribution of the cross sectional mean provide more detailed information on the transport processes in both pure fluid wu et al 2016b and wetland flows wu et al 2015 as first introduced by the theoretical analysis of wu and chen 2014b in discussing the decay of the transverse concentration difference however previous studies on the contaminant transport process in wetland flow with bed absorption considered only the free water surface effect namely the wetland flow is idealized as two dimensional free surface flow which is appropriate when the lateral scale of the flow is much larger than its vertical scale for some practical applications when the two direction dimensions are comparable both the free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect should be reckoned chen et al 2010 have proposed a model for environmental dispersion in a realistic three dimensional wetland channel flow which demonstrated the lateral effect on the dispersion process moreover guo et al 2018a concretely analyzed the spatial concentration distribution of contaminant transport in a wetland channel with a rectangular cross section and found that the aspect ratio ratio of height to width of the flow greatly affected the dispersion process nevertheless the effect of bed absorption on contaminant transport in three dimensional wetland flow has not been discussed furthermore in applications such as environmental risk assessment and ecological restoration associated with wetlands the critical length and duration of the influenced region with contaminant concentration exceeding given standard levels should be reconsidered under the effect of bed absorption therefore this paper analytically studies the dispersion process of contaminant transport in a three dimensional wetland flow with bed absorption by chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the influence of bed absorption will be the focus the main objectives of this work are i to illustrate the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of the dispersion process such as exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity and skewness ii to present the cross sectional mean concentration distribution modified by high order moments under the effect of bed absorption and iii to investigate the critical length and duration of the polluted region a specific application example will be presented 2 formulation for contaminant transport in wetland flow for solute transport in wetland flows by the phase average technique mass transport equation can be expressed as liu and masliyah 2005 zeng and chen 2009 2011 1 ϕ

edgeworth expansion with respect to large time is applied to solve the above mass transport equation which has been used in our previous works jiang and chen 2019a guo et al 2018b guo et al 2018a to obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion it is necessary to solve the equations of concentration moments first 3 1 concentration moments and basic characteristics the p th concentration moment is defined aris 1956 maier et al 2002 as 20 m p y z t c x y z t x p d x p 0 1 2 moreover the p th cross sectional mean concentration moment is 21 m p t c x t x p d x p 0 1 2 characteristic of an exponential decay in space distribution of the concentration is subjected to the auxiliary relations aris 1956 fischer et al 1979 barton 1983 as 22 c y z t x p c y z t 0 p 1 2 3 23 c x y z t x x x p c

solve above eqs 24 27 details can be found in appendix b to discuss the basic characteristics of the transport process the definition of the p th order central moment of concentration is given in appendix c quantity of exchange rate advection velocity environmental dispersivity and skewness are defined as follows wang and chen 2017a the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of the contaminant in the channel chen et al 2010 with no bed absorption m 0 1 which reflects the mass conservation in flow with bed absorption the quantity of m 0 can depict the retained mass of the contaminant in the flow which characterizes the exchange rate the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the contaminant cloud therefore the advection velocity is obtained as 28 v g d x g d t where x g t m 1 m 0 environmental dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 29 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution in the initial stage skewness γ 1 associated with the third order moment is defined as 30 γ 1 ν 3 ν 2 3 2 3 2 edgeworth expansion now we can obtain the asymptotic solution for the concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion the coefficients of edgeworth expansion can be obtained through the cumulants of concentration distribution guo et al 2018a b based on the p th order central concentration moments defined in appendix c the cumulants are given as 31 k 1 x g k 2 ν 2 k 3 ν 3 we denote σ k 2 which is the standard deviation the edgeworth s series up to the second order gives 32 c x y z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where he n are the hermite polynomials 33 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n e x 2 2 d x n n 0 1 2 x is the standardized variable x x x g σ eq 32 includes the third order cumulant of concentration distribution therefore it can reflect the skewness of concentration distribution for practical applications the accuracy of the result is appropriate chatwin 1970 similarly the asymptotic solution for cross sectional mean concentration distribution is 34 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where x is the standardized variable of the cross sectional distribution 35 x x x g σ 4 results and discussion for contaminant transport in wetland channel with rectangular cross section several factors can affect the dispersion process such as the velocity profile of the cross section mass diffusivity the superficial mass dispersivity and the effect of bed absorption etc chen et al 2010 zeng and chen 2009 previous work guo et al 2018a has analyzed the effect of damping factor α and aspect ratio r on the dispersion process without consideration of the effect of bed absorption therefore this paper will focus on the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process of contaminant transport through the wetland channel with three different aspect ratios i e r 0 2 r 1 and r 5 note that other parameters are typically chosen as α 1 r l 1 r kx 1 r kz 1 and pe 100 respectively correspondingly the velocity profiles are illustrated in fig 2 in the following sections the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of dispersion i e exchange rate advection velocity environmental dispersivity and skewness will be illustrated the evolution of cross sectional mean concentration distribution will also be discussed 4 1 basic characteristics of dispersion 4 1 1 exchange rate in the presence of bed absorption the parameter of exchange rate can be defined which reflects the depletion of the total mass of the contaminant cloud retained in the flow with time caused by the irreversible bed absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow decreases over time as depicted in fig 3 a the total mass of contaminant cloud reduces more quickly with the increment of bed absorption when the aspect ratio of the cross section is constant without bed absorption the total mass of the contaminant cloud is constant and equal to 1 due to the mass conservation it is seen that the depletion of the total mass of contaminant cloud is faster with a smaller r when β is fixed as a result of the larger bed absorption area to investigate the effect of bed absorption on the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant cloud in wetland channel the mass proportion in the upper half zone is obtained as follows 36 r u z 0 5 1 y 0 1 m 0 y z t d y d z m 0 t the mass proportion in the upper half layer is increased with time and reaches a constant value at a large time as illustrated in fig 3 b the effect of bed absorption causes contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer which is more obvious as the absorption intensity increases wang and chen 2017a the contaminant near the bed layer is depleted by bed absorption which leads to the increased ratio of mass in the upper layer without bed absorption the mass proportion in the upper half layer equals 50 constantly moreover the mass proportion in the upper layer is greater for a larger aspect ratio when β is fixed actually the mass exchange rate is independent of the velocity profile in flow sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 ng and rudraiah 2008 jiang and grotberg 1993 which could be inferred from eq 24 corresponding to p 0 based on the boundary condition of eq 16 an effective bed absorption parameter can be defined as r β when β is fixed with the increasing of r the effective absorption intensity is stronger and more solute near the bed layer is depleted leading to the larger mass proportion in the upper layer on a large time scale a stable condition could be achieved under the balance of diffusion and bed absorption the stable condition arrives more quickly with a smaller r in terms of the governing equation eq 14 with the specified values of the dimensionless parameters r kz r kx pe it illustrates that the effective mass dispersivity along the vertical direction i e r kz r is inversely proportional to r as above mentioned the effective bed absorption intensity is proportional to r therefore for a smaller r the stable condition arrives more quickly in addition the stable condition arrives more slowly for a larger β when r is fixed more time is needed to reach balance between vertical diffusion and bed absorption 4 1 2 advection velocity under the effect of bed absorption the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud increases gradually and reaches a constant value at a large time as shown in fig 4 a globally the mean advection velocity is larger as the intensity of bed absorption increases which is consistent with previous results wang and chen 2017a the effect of bed absorption causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer due to the large velocity in the upper layer hence advection velocity of the centroid of the contaminant cloud is increased note that without the effect of bed absorption the mean advection velocity is equal to 0 constantly which means that the centroid of the contaminant cloud always keeps moving at the cross sectional mean velocity fu et al 2016 when β is constant the mean advection velocity is larger in the case of r 1 the phenomenon can be explained by the cross sectional velocity profile as seen in fig 2 affected by the effect of sidewall and bed the velocity profile for the case of r 1 is highly nonuniform which leads to a larger deviation between the upper layer velocity and the cross sectional mean velocity 4 1 3 environmental dispersivity the dispersivity associated with the second order central moment of cross sectional mean concentration distribution reflects the effective diffusion coefficient of the contaminant cloud in flow aris 1956 wu et al 2019 the dispersivity increases with time and reaches a constant value at a large time as depicted in fig 4 b after the contaminant is uniformly released on the cross section of the wetland channel the contaminant cloud is dispersed under the effect of velocity shear in the longitudinal direction and diffusion in the vertical and lateral directions diffusion in the longitudinal direction is generally ignored taylor 1953 in the initial time the effect of advection velocity dominates the dispersion process therefore the dispersivity increases over time at a large time the effect of mass diffusivity and superficial mass dispersivity tends to homogenize the cross sectional concentration distribution as discussed in previous work guo et al 2018a and the dispersivity keeps constant the effect of bed absorption affects the constant value of the dispersivity when the aspect ratio r is fixed with the bed absorption the contaminant cloud concentrates more in the upper layer as characterized by fig 3 b the velocity shear in the upper layer greatly affects the value of dispersivity for a deep channel r 5 on a large time scale the concentration distribution is dominated by the free water surface effect because concentration distribution in the lateral direction tends to uniformity guo et al 2018a as seen in fig 2 c the velocity shear is decreased in the upper layer hence the dispersivity is weakened with the increment of β however in the case of a shallow channel r 0 2 the condition is different the lateral sidewall effect dominates the concentration distribution on a larger time scale under the effect of bed absorption contaminant cloud near the bed layer where the velocity shear is small is reduced therefore the dispersivity is increased as the value of β increases when the intensity of bed absorption is determined dispersivity is also affected by the aspect ratio r which is similar to the previous work guo et al 2018a the dispersivity is larger when the aspect ratio approaches to 1 other parameters are constant where both the lateral sidewall effect and the free water surface effect dominate the dispersion process the dispersivity is reduced with the increment of β which is analogous to the case of r 5 significantly without bed absorption dispersion processes in the case of r 0 2 and r 5 are identical guo et al 2018a 4 1 4 skewness the skewness associated with the third order central moment measures asymmetry of a given distribution and whose sign indicates its front loading negative or back loading positive wang and chen 2017a aminian et al 2016 2018 the shear flow shapes the concentration distribution which creates an asymmetry chatwin 1970 when r 1 the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is positively skewed γ 1 0 as shown in fig 5 however when r 0 2 and 5 the cross sectional mean concentration distributions are negatively skewed which are consistent with previous results guo et al 2018a aminian et al 2016 when r 0 2 the concentration distribution is dominated by the free water surface effect in the initial stage when the concentration distribution is mainly shaped by the velocity profile in the vertical direction of the cross section the contaminant cloud is concentrated more on the upper layer in the downstream and bed layer in the upstream due to the small velocity shear in the upper layer the contaminant cloud is more concentrated in the downstream which leads to the negative skewness in the presence of bed absorption contaminant near the bed layer in the upstream is depleted which strengthens the tapering tail of the concentration distribution on a large time scale the concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect the effect of bed absorption is weakened on the contrary for r 5 the concentration distribution is dominated by the bank sidewall effect at a small time and by the free water surface effect at a large time hence the effect of bed absorption strengthened the negative skewness more obviously at large time t 1 as depicted by yellow curves in fig 5 it is abnormal in the condition of β 2 due to large bed absorption the long tail of concentration distribution in the upstream is decreased hence negative skewness is weakened in the case of r 1 both the free water surface effect and lateral sidewall effect dominate the concentration distribution aminian et al 2016 have revealed that the concentration distribution near the interior of the flow tends to a negative skewness which reverses at the wall hence the cross sectional mean concentration distribution affected more by the wall is positively skewed the effect of bed absorption decreases the concentration near the bed layer in the upstream which diminishes the degree of back loading 4 2 cross sectional mean concentration distribution in order to visually describe the contaminant transport process the temporal evolution of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution modified by high order moments is illustrated in fig 6 under the effect of dispersivity and bed absorption the curves become more flat with time the effect of bed absorption on the one hand reduces the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow on the other hand affects the environmental dispersivity as discussed in the above sections different values of β have a significant influence on the cross sectional mean concentration distribution for r 0 2 compared with r 1 or 5 as depicted in fig 6 the yellow curves alter little with different β in contrast to the red curves the total mass of contaminant retained in the flow is decreased more quickly in the case of r 0 2 therefore the maximum value of the transverse mean concentration is a faster reduction moreover axes of curves are biased more toward the downstream x 0 with a larger β when r is constant which could be explained by fig 4 a without the effect of bed absorption the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is about origin symmetric on the whole wu et al 2015 and the centroid advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is constant to zero due to the bed absorption the centroid velocity is increased from zero which leads to the concentration distribution moving to downstream the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetric at the initial stage as depicted in fig 6 b the curves of r 0 2 or 5 are front loading while are back loading in the case of r 1 which are consistent with the results in the section of skewness the asymmetry is not disappeared even on a larger time scale it is noteworthy that although the environmental dispersivity is the largest when r 1 shown in fig 4 b the maximum of the cross sectional mean concentration decreases more quickly in the case of r 0 2 which is different from that in the condition of β 0 the effect of bed absorption could reduce the maximum concentration more quickly which is valuable for some applications 5 application examples in the case of wastewater emission into the wetland the cross sectional mean concentration would decay under the effect of bed absorption and environmental dispersivity for environmental risk assessment associated with the wetlands what essential is an influenced region where the contaminant concentration is beyond given standard levels for a given concentration level the critical length and duration of the influenced region can be obtained based on the eq 34 for practical purposes the term associated with the third order moment is neglected we have the dimensionless critical length s of the influenced region for a given upper limit of concentration c 0 as 37 s 2 σ t 2 ln 2 π σ t c 0 ln m 0 t for practical applications a

constituent of plumbum pb associated with the plant wastewater emissions the safe upper limits of concentration for five standard levels are given in table 1 for an instantaneous emission of q 1 kg in wetland flow the variation of critical length with time for different standard concentration levels is depicted in fig 7 for comparison the case of β 0 is also illustrated with bed absorption the critical length and duration of the influenced region are decreased greatly the critical length and duration of the influenced region increase as stricter standard concentration levels are adopted 6 conclusions presented in this work the combined effects of bed absorption free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect are considered in terms of environmental dispersion in a wetland flow the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of dispersion is illustrated the results reveal that bed absorption decreases the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow over time and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer by depleting the contaminant cloud near the bed layer the total mass is depleted more quickly in a shallow wetland channel than that in a deep wetland channel due to the larger bed absorption area the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is increased with the increment of the intensity of bed absorption for a deep wetland channel environmental dispersivity is augmented under the effect of bed absorption while it is reduced in the case of a shallow wetland channel the effect of bed absorption weakens the positive skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the cross section of wetland channel approaches square while strengthens the negative skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the channel is shallow moreover the maximum of the cross sectional mean concentration reduces more quickly with the effect of bed absorption for application purposes the critical length and duration of the influenced region where the concentration is beyond the given standard levels are presented the effect of bed absorption can reduce the critical length and duration of the influenced region greatly which have essential implications for environmental risk assessment and environmental management acknowledgments this work is supported by the national

6165,predicting the evolution of concentration distribution for contaminant transport in wetland flows has a wide range of ecological applications to account for the ecological effect such as substrate absorption the influence of bed absorption on the dispersion process of contaminant transport in a wetland channel with rectangular cross section is analytically investigated in this study by the technique of long time asymptotic expansion the combined effects of bed absorption free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect are demonstrated by parameter analysis in terms of the bed absorption coefficient and the aspect ratio of the channel section the studied cases illustrate that bed absorption decreases the total mass of the contaminant cloud retained in the flow and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud increases as the intensity of bed absorption amplifies environmental dispersivity is augmented with bed absorption in a deep wetland channel which is inverse in a shallow channel the effect of bed absorption weakens the positive skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the wetland channel approaches square while strengthens the negative skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the channel is relatively shallow moreover the cross sectional mean concentration decays faster under the effect of bed absorption for applications the critical length and duration of the influenced region are presented with bed absorption keywords bed absorption environmental dispersion mean concentration distribution wetland flow influenced region 1 introduction wetland ecosystems such as rivers lakes and coastal zones

transverse and longitudinal dispersion with artificial and real emergent vegetation the process of transport and dispersion of tracers in wetland channels with both flexible submerged and rigid emergent canopies were also experimentally investigated de serio et al 2018 wetlands with aquatic vegetation exhibit complicated flow behavior leading to difficulties in assessing the fate of contaminant clouds shucksmith et al 2011 2010 to illustrate the transport process based on taylor s classical analysis of dispersion taylor 1953 1954 zeng and chen 2009 extended the phase average technique to wetland flows in order to smear out the discontinuity between the two phases of water and solid in the studied region rajagopal and tao 1995 liu and masliyah 2005 based on the phase

or multi zone wu et al 2011 chen 2013 wang et al 2015 luo et al 2016 wu et al 2016a wetland flows have been widely discussed moreover the effect of wind on environmental dispersion in wetland flow is also analyzed wang and huai 2018 zeng et al 2012 li et al 2017 the above studies provide valuable information on contaminant transport in wetland flows to account for the ecological effect such as substrate absorption contaminant transport in wetland flow under the effect of bed absorption also deserves attention the model of boundary absorption with an irreversible first order catalytic reaction is widely employed ng and yip 2001 berkowitz and zhou 1996 dijk and berkowitz 1998 sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 studied the interphase mass transport due to an irreversible first order reaction at the wall i e the wall is conductive and solved the convective diffusion equation by gill s method gill and sankarasubramanian 1970 after that solute dispersion in tube flow with wall reaction has been widely discussed smith 1983 mazumder and das 1992 jiang and grotberg 1993 ng and rudraiah 2008 jiang and chen 2018 provided higher order solutions regarding gill 1967 s generalized dispersion model for solute transport in poiseuille flow with wall absorption despite this the contaminant transport process in wetland flows is very different from that in pure fluid flows due to the existence of vegetation shao et al 2014 recently wang and chen 2016 studied the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant transport in open channel flow and found that the effect of bed absorption strengthened the downstream inhomogeneity of vertical concentration distribution similar result that bed absorption causes downstream large transverse concentration non uniformity has been found by barik and dalal 2018 by the three scale perturbation analysis wang and chen 2017b also revealed that contaminant cloud shows to be more contracted and reformed by bed absorption with an increasing damping factor of wetland flows such explorations focusing on the multi dimensional concentration distribution of the contaminant cloud instead of solely the stream wise distribution of the cross sectional mean provide more detailed information on the transport processes in both pure fluid wu et al 2016b and wetland flows wu et al 2015 as first introduced by the theoretical analysis of wu and chen 2014b in discussing the decay of the transverse concentration difference however previous studies on the contaminant transport process in wetland flow with bed absorption considered only the free water surface effect namely the wetland flow is idealized as two dimensional free surface flow which is appropriate when the lateral scale of the flow is much larger than its vertical scale for some practical applications when the two direction dimensions are comparable both the free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect should be reckoned chen et al 2010 have proposed a model for environmental dispersion in a realistic three dimensional wetland channel flow which demonstrated the lateral effect on the dispersion process moreover guo et al 2018a concretely analyzed the spatial concentration distribution of contaminant transport in a wetland channel with a rectangular cross section and found that the aspect ratio ratio of height to width of the flow greatly affected the dispersion process nevertheless the effect of bed absorption on contaminant transport in three dimensional wetland flow has not been discussed furthermore in applications such as environmental risk assessment and ecological restoration associated with wetlands the critical length and duration of the influenced region with contaminant concentration exceeding given standard levels should be reconsidered under the effect of bed absorption therefore this paper analytically studies the dispersion process of contaminant transport in a three dimensional wetland flow with bed absorption by chatwin 1970 s long time asymptotic expansion the influence of bed absorption will be the focus the main objectives of this work are i to illustrate the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of the dispersion process such as exchange rate advection velocity dispersivity and skewness ii to present the cross sectional mean concentration distribution modified by high order moments under the effect of bed absorption and iii to investigate the critical length and duration of the polluted region a specific application example will be presented 2 formulation for

edgeworth expansion with respect to large time is applied to solve the above mass transport equation which has been used in our previous works jiang and chen 2019a guo et al 2018b guo et al 2018a to obtain the coefficients of edgeworth expansion it is necessary to solve the equations of concentration moments first 3 1 concentration moments and basic characteristics the p th concentration moment is defined aris 1956 maier et al 2002 as 20 m p y z t c x y z t x p d x p 0 1 2 moreover the p th cross sectional mean concentration moment is 21 m p t c x t x p d x p 0 1 2 characteristic of an

solve above eqs 24 27 details can be found in appendix b to discuss the basic characteristics of the transport process the definition of the p th order central moment of concentration is given in appendix c quantity of exchange rate advection velocity environmental dispersivity and skewness are defined as follows wang and chen 2017a the zeroth order mean concentration moment reflects the total mass of the contaminant in the channel chen et al 2010 with no bed absorption m 0 1 which reflects the mass conservation in flow with bed absorption the quantity of m 0 can depict the retained mass of the contaminant in the flow which characterizes the exchange rate the first order mean concentration moment represents the centroid position of the contaminant cloud therefore the advection velocity is obtained as 28 v g d x g d t where x g t m 1 m 0 environmental dispersivity associated with the second order mean concentration moment wang and chen 2017a is quantified as 29 d t 1 2 d ν 2 d t to capture the non gaussian concentration distribution in the initial stage skewness γ 1 associated with the third order moment is defined as 30 γ 1 ν 3 ν 2 3 2 3 2 edgeworth expansion now we can obtain the asymptotic solution for the concentration distribution chatwin 1970 s technique is actually an edgeworth expansion the coefficients of edgeworth expansion can be obtained through the cumulants of concentration distribution guo et al 2018a b based on the p th order central concentration moments defined in appendix c the cumulants are given as 31 k 1 x g k 2 ν 2 k 3 ν 3 we denote σ k 2 which is the standard deviation the edgeworth s series up to the second order gives 32 c x y z t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where he n are the hermite polynomials 33 he n x 1 n e x 2 2 d n e

for practical applications the accuracy of the result is appropriate chatwin 1970 similarly the asymptotic solution for cross sectional mean concentration distribution is 34 c x t m 0 exp x 2 2 2 π σ 1 k 3 3 σ 3 he 3 x o σ 2 where x is the standardized variable of the cross sectional distribution 35 x x x g σ 4 results and discussion for contaminant transport in wetland channel with rectangular cross section several factors can affect the dispersion process such as the velocity profile of the cross section mass diffusivity the superficial mass dispersivity and the effect of bed absorption etc chen et al 2010 zeng and chen 2009 previous work guo et al 2018a has analyzed the effect of damping factor α and aspect ratio r on the dispersion process without consideration of the effect of bed absorption therefore this paper will focus on the effect of bed absorption on the dispersion process of contaminant transport through the wetland channel with three different aspect ratios i e r 0 2 r 1 and r 5 note that other parameters are typically chosen as α 1 r l 1 r kx 1 r kz 1 and pe 100 respectively correspondingly the velocity profiles are illustrated in fig 2 in the following sections the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of dispersion i e exchange rate advection velocity environmental dispersivity and skewness will be illustrated the evolution of cross sectional mean concentration distribution will also be discussed 4 1 basic characteristics of dispersion 4 1 1 exchange rate in the presence of bed absorption the parameter of exchange rate can be defined which reflects the depletion of the total mass of the contaminant cloud retained in the flow with time caused by the irreversible bed absorption sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow decreases over time as depicted in fig 3 a the total mass of contaminant cloud reduces more quickly with the increment of bed absorption when the aspect ratio of the cross section is constant without bed absorption the total mass of the contaminant cloud is constant and equal to 1 due to the mass conservation it is seen that the depletion of the total mass of contaminant cloud is faster with a smaller r when β is fixed as a result of the larger bed absorption area to investigate the effect of bed absorption on the vertical concentration distribution of contaminant cloud in wetland channel the mass proportion in the upper half zone is obtained as follows 36 r u z 0 5 1 y 0 1 m 0 y z t d y d z m 0 t the mass proportion in the upper half layer is increased with time and reaches a constant value at a large time as illustrated in fig 3 b the effect of bed absorption causes contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer which is more obvious as the absorption intensity increases wang and chen 2017a the contaminant near the bed layer is depleted by bed absorption which leads to the increased ratio of mass in the upper layer without bed absorption the mass proportion in the upper half layer equals 50 constantly moreover the mass proportion in the upper layer is greater for a larger aspect ratio when β is fixed actually the mass exchange rate is independent of the velocity profile in flow sankarasubramanian and gill 1973 ng and rudraiah 2008 jiang and grotberg 1993 which could be inferred from eq 24 corresponding to p 0 based on the boundary condition of eq 16 an effective bed absorption parameter can be defined as r β when β is fixed with the increasing of r the effective absorption intensity is stronger and more solute near the bed layer is depleted leading to the larger mass proportion in the upper layer on a large time scale a stable condition could be achieved under the balance of diffusion and bed absorption the stable condition arrives more quickly with a smaller r in terms of the governing equation eq 14 with the specified values of the dimensionless parameters r kz r kx pe it illustrates that the effective mass dispersivity along the vertical direction i e r kz r is inversely proportional to r as above mentioned the effective bed absorption intensity is proportional to r therefore for a smaller r the stable condition arrives more quickly in addition the stable condition arrives more slowly for a larger β when r is fixed more time is needed to reach balance between vertical diffusion and bed absorption 4 1 2 advection velocity under the effect of bed absorption the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud increases gradually and reaches a constant value at a large time as shown in fig 4 a globally the mean advection velocity is larger as the intensity of bed absorption increases which is consistent with previous results wang and chen 2017a the effect of bed absorption causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer due to the large velocity in the upper layer hence advection velocity of the centroid of the contaminant cloud is increased note that without the effect of bed absorption the mean advection velocity is equal to 0 constantly which means that the centroid of the contaminant cloud always keeps moving at the cross sectional mean velocity fu et al 2016 when β is constant the mean advection velocity is larger in the case of r 1 the phenomenon can be explained by the cross sectional velocity profile as seen in fig 2 affected by the effect of sidewall and bed the velocity profile for the case of r 1 is highly nonuniform which leads to a larger deviation between the upper layer velocity and the cross sectional mean velocity 4 1 3 environmental dispersivity the dispersivity associated with the second order central moment of cross sectional mean concentration distribution reflects the effective diffusion coefficient of the contaminant cloud in flow aris 1956 wu et al 2019 the dispersivity increases with time and reaches a constant value at a large time as depicted in fig 4 b after the contaminant is uniformly released on the cross section of the wetland channel the contaminant cloud is dispersed under the effect of velocity shear in the longitudinal direction and diffusion in the vertical and lateral directions diffusion in the longitudinal direction is generally ignored taylor 1953 in the initial time the effect of advection velocity dominates the dispersion process therefore the dispersivity increases over time at a large time the effect of mass diffusivity and superficial mass dispersivity tends to homogenize the cross sectional concentration distribution as discussed in previous work guo et al 2018a and the dispersivity keeps constant the effect of bed absorption affects the constant value of the dispersivity when the aspect ratio r is fixed with the bed absorption the contaminant cloud concentrates more in the upper layer as characterized by fig 3 b the velocity shear in the upper layer greatly affects the value of dispersivity for a deep channel r 5 on a large time scale the concentration distribution is dominated by the free water surface effect because concentration distribution in the lateral direction tends to uniformity guo et al 2018a as seen in fig 2 c the velocity shear is decreased in the upper layer hence the dispersivity is weakened with the increment of β however in the case of a shallow channel r 0 2 the condition is different the lateral sidewall effect dominates the concentration distribution on a larger time scale under the effect of bed absorption contaminant cloud near the bed layer where the velocity shear is small is reduced therefore the dispersivity is increased as the value of β increases when the intensity of bed absorption is determined dispersivity is also affected by the aspect ratio r which is similar to the previous work guo et al 2018a the dispersivity is larger when the aspect ratio approaches to 1 other parameters are constant where both the lateral sidewall effect and the free water surface effect dominate the dispersion process the dispersivity is reduced with the increment of β which is analogous to the case of r 5 significantly without bed absorption dispersion processes in the case of r 0 2 and r 5 are identical guo et al 2018a 4 1 4 skewness the skewness associated with the third order central moment measures asymmetry of a given distribution and whose sign indicates its front loading negative or back loading positive wang and chen 2017a aminian et al 2016 2018 the shear flow shapes the concentration distribution which creates an asymmetry chatwin 1970 when r 1 the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is positively skewed γ 1 0 as shown in fig 5 however when r 0 2 and 5 the cross sectional mean concentration distributions are negatively skewed which are consistent with previous results guo et al 2018a aminian et al 2016 when r 0 2 the concentration distribution is dominated by the free water surface effect in the initial stage when the concentration distribution is mainly shaped by the velocity profile in the vertical direction of the cross section the contaminant cloud is concentrated more on the upper layer in the downstream and bed layer in the upstream due to the small velocity shear in the upper layer the contaminant cloud is more concentrated in the downstream which leads to the negative skewness in the presence of bed absorption contaminant near the bed layer in the upstream is depleted which strengthens the tapering tail of the concentration distribution on a large time scale the concentration distribution is dominated by the lateral sidewall effect the effect of bed absorption is weakened on the contrary for r 5 the concentration distribution is dominated by the bank sidewall effect at a small time and by the free water surface effect at a large time hence the effect of bed absorption strengthened the negative skewness more obviously at large time t 1 as depicted by yellow curves in fig 5 it is abnormal in the condition of β 2 due to large bed absorption the long tail of concentration distribution in the upstream is decreased hence negative skewness is weakened in the case of r 1 both the free water surface effect and lateral sidewall effect dominate the concentration distribution aminian et al 2016 have revealed that the concentration distribution near the interior of the flow tends to a negative skewness which reverses at the wall hence the cross sectional mean concentration distribution affected more by the wall is positively skewed the effect of bed absorption decreases the concentration near the bed layer in the upstream which diminishes the degree of back loading 4 2 cross sectional mean concentration distribution in order to visually describe the contaminant transport process the temporal evolution of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution modified by high order moments is illustrated in fig 6 under the effect of dispersivity and bed absorption the curves become more flat with time the effect of bed absorption on the one hand reduces the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow on the other hand affects the environmental dispersivity as discussed in the above sections different values of β have a significant influence on the cross sectional mean concentration distribution for r 0 2 compared with r 1 or 5 as depicted in fig 6 the yellow curves alter little with different β in contrast to the red curves the total mass of contaminant retained in the flow is decreased more quickly in the case of r 0 2 therefore the maximum value of the transverse mean concentration is a faster reduction moreover axes of curves are biased more toward the downstream x 0 with a larger β when r is constant which could be explained by fig 4 a without the effect of bed absorption the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is about origin symmetric on the whole wu et al 2015 and the centroid advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is constant to zero due to the bed absorption the centroid velocity is increased from zero which leads to the concentration distribution moving to downstream the cross sectional mean concentration distribution is asymmetric at the initial stage as depicted in fig 6 b the curves of r 0 2 or 5 are front loading while are back loading in the case of r 1 which are consistent with the results in the section of skewness the asymmetry is not disappeared even on a larger time scale it is noteworthy that although the environmental dispersivity is the largest when r 1 shown in fig 4 b the maximum of the cross sectional mean concentration decreases more quickly in the case of r 0 2 which is different from that in the condition of β 0 the effect of bed absorption could reduce the maximum concentration more quickly which is valuable for some applications 5 application examples in the case of wastewater emission into the wetland the cross sectional mean concentration would decay under the effect of bed absorption and environmental dispersivity for environmental risk assessment associated with the wetlands what essential is an influenced region where the contaminant concentration is beyond given standard levels for a given concentration level the critical length and duration of the influenced region can be obtained based on the eq 34 for practical purposes the term associated with the third order moment is neglected we have the dimensionless critical length s of the influenced region for a given upper limit of concentration c 0 as 37 s 2 σ t 2 ln 2 π σ t c 0 ln m 0 t for practical applications a

wetland flow the variation of critical length with time for different standard concentration levels is depicted in fig 7 for comparison the case of β 0 is also illustrated with bed absorption the critical length and duration of the influenced region are decreased greatly the critical length and duration of the influenced region increase as stricter standard concentration levels are adopted 6 conclusions presented in this work the combined effects of bed absorption free water surface effect and the bank sidewall effect are considered in terms of environmental dispersion in a wetland flow the effect of bed absorption on the basic characteristics of dispersion is illustrated the results reveal that bed absorption decreases the total mass of contaminant cloud retained in the flow over time and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate more in the upper layer by depleting the contaminant cloud near the bed layer the total mass is depleted more quickly in a shallow wetland channel than that in a deep wetland channel due to the larger bed absorption area the mean advection velocity of the contaminant cloud is increased with the increment of the intensity of bed absorption for a deep wetland channel environmental dispersivity is augmented under the effect of bed absorption while it is reduced in the case of a shallow wetland channel the effect of bed absorption weakens the positive skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the cross section of wetland channel approaches square while strengthens the negative skewness of the cross sectional mean concentration distribution when the channel is shallow moreover the maximum of the cross sectional mean concentration reduces more quickly with the effect of bed absorption for application purposes the critical length and duration of the influenced region where the concentration is beyond the given standard levels are presented the effect of bed absorption can reduce the critical length and duration of the influenced region greatly which have essential implications for environmental risk assessment and environmental management acknowledgments this work is supported by the national

6166,reliable inversion of spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity is crucial to understand subsurface fluids migration the ensemble smoother direct sampling method es ds has proven to be an effective method to identify non gaussian hydraulic conductivity distributions by incorporating a variety of traditional hydrodynamic measurements e g piezometric head however inversion problems for non gaussian parameters often suffer from a sparsity of the available data from direct sampling in boreholes as a non intrusive cost effective and high sampling density method time lapse geophysical technique has not yet drawn much attention as a useful source of information for delineating the underlying non gaussian heterogeneity in this study we integrated coupled hydrogeophysical modeling and the es ds algorithm to estimate non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field by assimilating both geochemical and time lapse geophysical datasets four synthetic cases for a salt injection experiment monitored by both sampling analysis and electrical resistivity tomography are conducted to assess the ability of the proposed approach to characterize hydraulic properties by assimilating different types of data results show that using geochemical or geophysical data alone only allow a rough reconstruction of subsurface heterogeneity of aquifers but might lose the fine structure by incorporating multi source datasets the main patterns of the non gaussian reference fields can be reflected with an improved resolution the time lapse geophysical methods open up new opportunities to accurately characterize non gaussian aquifers and monitor the dynamic processes of subsurface fluids keywords non gaussian parameters estimation multi source data assimilation electrical resistivity tomography ensemble smoother 1 introduction accurate estimation of hydrodynamic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity is a key issue for the understanding of groundwater flow and contaminant transport process e g gómez hernández et al 2003 however it is still a great challenge to characterize the heterogeneous aquifer directly due to a scarcity of data from traditional hydrogeological investigations oliver and chen 2011 characterization of hydrodynamic parameters can be better obtained from stochastic inversion approaches using the direct data e g hydraulic conductivities measurement and indirect data e g observed head and tracer data zhou et al 2014a among these inversion approaches data assimilation methods have become popular and widely used in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering communities since they can incorporate multi source of information to jointly estimate model parameters and states e g ju et al 2018 oliver and chen 2011 zheng et al 2019 zhou et al 2014a various strategies have been proposed including the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 and its variants like the ensemble smoother es vanleeuwen and evensen 1996 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2009 and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 all of these methods assume however a multivariate gaussian distribution for the parameters and state variables which might be a questionable assumption in complex channelized aquifers this is for instance the case when the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity is controlled by features such as paleo channels with highly permeable preferential flow conduits zovi et al 2017 the same can be found in presence of complex sand clay interbedding caused by marine transgressions and regressions baeteman et al 1989 to address the challenge caused by the non gaussian priors two strategies have been proposed in the literature in the first set of approaches reparameterization methods are used to transform parameters e g log hydraulic conductivity from non gaussian distributions into gaussian distributions such as the normal score enkf zhou et al 2011 iterative normal score ensemble smoother li et al 2018 the gaussian anamorphosis schoeniger et al 2012 and the deep learning method canchumuni et al 2017 another set of approaches are based on geostatistical simulation which use a post processing step to make the posterior parameters consistent with the prior probability distribution for example sarma et al 2008 developed a kernel enkf to reconstruct the channelized hydraulic conductivity field based on the multiple point geo statistics mpg jafarpour and khodabakhshi 2011 introduced a probability conditioning method pcm which uses the updated parameters probabilities as secondary conditioning data to regenerate non gaussian conductivities field in the mpg laloy et al 2018 proposed a deep neural network approach based on the mpg simulation to deal with the non gaussianity lan et al 2019 combined the pcm and the esmda to estimate non gaussian fields of lithofacies indicators and hydraulic conductivities finally cao et al 2018 coupled iterative ensemble smoother with direct sampling an mpg method proposed by mariethoz et al 2010 via pilot points to inverse the non gaussian parameters this approach can effectively incorporate dynamic hydraulic head data into groundwater model and preserve the non gaussian structures as well although a wide range of methods have been proposed to characterize the non gaussian hydraulic parameters most researchers focused on assimilating only flow and transport measurements such as piezometric head and solute concentration data llopis albert and capilla 2010 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2012 xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 however directly sampling observations are relatively sparse and the acquisition cost is quite high compared with geophysical methods a relatively high uncertainty of characterization and predictions are expected with limited data sources this uncertainty can be reduced by using non invasive geophysical methods especially electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip with low costs and high sampling density binley et al 2015 geophysical methods have been broadly used in the characterization of gaussian heterogeneity irving and singha 2010 pollock and cirpka 2012 camporese et al 2015 ahmed et al 2016 kang et al 2018 2019 however only a few studies have been conducted in applying geophysical methods to identify non gaussian fields zovi et al 2017 gottschalk et al 2017 zovi et al 2017 and gottschalk et al 2017 used ert constraints on channel shape and geological properties and then assimilated the state variables e g water levels or lithological data to characterize the non gaussian subsurface heterogeneity comparing to static ert time lapse ert has a significant advantage in identifying subsurface structure and quantifying the dynamic of subsurface fluids jardani et al 2013 however to our knowledge time lapse geophysical methods have not been used to characterize the non gaussian fields to date in this study we leveraged the latest non gaussian data assimilation approach proposed by cao et al 2018 and built on our previous work kang et al 2018 2019 where multiphase fluids and ert ip forward model were coupled the non gaussian hydraulic conductivity was calibrated by jointly incorporating concentration data and time lapse ert data in this work we first developed a data assimilation framework based on the esmda ds algorithm which was adapted from the es ds method proposed by cao et al 2018 and coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of concentration and ert data a synthetic salt injection experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework four cases with different types of datasets were quantitatively compared including 1 using a small amount of concentration data alone 2 using ert data alone 3 combining a small amount of concentration and ert data and 4 using a large amount of concentration data further the influence of the number of pilot points on the inversion is discussed 2 methods 2 1 coupled hydrogeophysical model to simulate the resistivity anomaly caused by salt injection in non gaussian heterogeneity field with the presence of channelized clay layers a coupled forward model is developed among a flow and solute transport model petrophysical models and a geophysical forward model the coupled model is illustrated in fig 1 red dotted box and summarized in following steps step1 specify the hydraulic conductivity k field to simulate a heterogeneous and non gaussian distributed hydraulic conductivity we construct the channelized k field from a multiple point geostatistical method direct sampling mariethoz et al 2010 this method directly samples the training image for a given data event it can apply multiple point geo statistics to continuous variables and to multivariate problems besides it is fast computationally efficient and easy to parallelize mariethoz et al 2010 meerschman et al 2013 notably the hydraulic conductivity at each cell depends on the proportions of clay and sand for the convenience of subsequent calculations we transform k into permeability using 1 k k μ γ where k denotes the permeability µ is the dynamic viscosity µ 1 01 10 3 pa s at 25 c γ denotes the unit weight for water γ 9 8 103n kg step 2 calculate the volumetric clay content cl first the lower threshold permeability of clay free sand ksd is calculated by revil and cathles 1999 according to 2 k sd d sd 2 ϕ sd 3 m sd 24 where dsd is the grain diameter of sand m ϕsd represents the porosity of sand and msd denotes the cementation exponent of sand in this work dsd 1 10 4 m ϕsd 0 32 msd 2 0 power et al 2013 the resulting ksd 4 5 10 13 m2 which corresponds to a fine sand permeability values larger than ksd are assumed as clay free sand whereas others are indicative of sand containing a fraction of clay then eq 3 is used to calculate the volumetric clay content cl ratio of clay including water to the whole soil volume in terms of the permeability of clay sand mixtures 3 cl k sd 1 3 m cs k 1 3 m cs k sd 1 3 m cs 1 ϕ cl ϕ sd where mcs represents the cementation exponent corresponding to the clayey sand mixtures and ϕcl is the porosity of pure clay in this work mcs msd 2 0 ϕcl 0 56 power et al 2013 revil et al 2017a therefore we assumed cl 0 for the grid cells where k ksd when k ksd the corresponding clay content cl can be calculated through eq 3 for more details about this equation one can refer to revil and cathles 1999 step 3 calculate the total porosity ϕ and clay mass fractions φ w cl the total porosity is calculated from the clay content cl based on the equation developed by berg 2007 4 ϕ ϕ sd 1 c l ϕ cl c l the mass fraction of the clay and sand grains φ w cl φ w sd for each grid cell are given by power et al 2013 5 φ w cl cl

forward flow and solute transport model with k and ϕ in this work the steady state flow field can be obtained from the following governing equation bear 1972 7 k h 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h denotes the hydraulic head l the governing equation for non reactive component transport is defined as zheng and wang 1999 8 c t d c v c q s ϕ c s where c is the aqueous concentration of the non reactive component ml 3 t denotes time t d represents the diffusion coefficient l2t 1 v k h ϕ l2t 1 qs means the volumetric flow rate per unit volume of the aquifer t 1 ϕ is the total porosity and cs is the concentration of the source of the non reactive component ml 3 note that the salt concentration in this work is relatively low 1 g l therefore we can safely neglect its effect on density and buoyancy the flow and solute transport forward models are solved by modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 respectively step 5 convert c and φ w cl to ρ using the petrophysical models proposed by revil et al 2018 and sen and goode 1992 when the subsurface media is clay free the well known archie s law archie 1942 can be used as an appropriate physical model connecting the hydrological state to electrical properties however in presence of clay rich materials such a model may lead to errors patnode and wyllie 1950 to overcome this weakness the resistivity model developed by revil et al 2018 is used to quantify the influence of the clay grains on resistivity 9 1 ρ s w ϕ m σ w s w ϕ m 1 ρ s b λ φ w sd c e c sd φ w cl c e c cl and where the

surface conduction and the polarization associated with the quadrature conductivity respectively here b 4 1 10 9 m 2s 1v 1 and λ 3 460 10 10 m 2s 1v 1 revil et al 2017a 2018 cec c kg represents the total amount of cations which can be sorbed on the mineral surface cec is proportional to the clay content mao et al 2016 the influence of solute concentration and temperature upon the electrical

assume that the temperature remains constant 25 c step 6 simulate ρa apparent resistivity through geophysical forward model with the electrical properties ρ converted from petrophysical models the raw

represents a single current electrode idealized as a point source at the origin with current strength i a in this work the geophysical forward problem is solved by agi earthimager software agi 2010 2 2 ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds in this work the esmda ds is used as an inversion tool to characterize the non gaussian heterogeneous parameter field y loge hydraulic conductivity this method borrows computational efficiency from the esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 and leverages the capability of the ds mariethoz et al 2010 for handling the non gaussianity note that we adapt the iterative es ds proposed by cao et al 2018 to the esmda ds because the esmda has less computational expense and better data matches than the iterative es see emerick and reynolds 2013 this method can be summarized in following steps step 1 build the augmented state vector x parameters of interest p e g y are augmented with the state variables h e g c and ρa into a joint state vector x p h t step 2 decide the number of data assimilation na and the coefficient αi with i 1 n a for different times data assimilation for i 1 to na run step 3 to 5 step 3 for each realization run the coupled hydrogeophysical model from time zero with updated parameters 12 x i f g x i a i 1 2 n e where i is the ensemble member index superscripts f and a denote forecast and analysis respectively ne represents the number of the realizations in the ensemble through eq 12 we can obtain temporal evolutions of the state variables based on the model parameters which can be used for update in step 4 step 4 calculate the error covariance for the predicted state 13 c yd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e x i f x f d i d t 14 c dd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e d i d d i d t where c yd is the cross covariance matrix between the forecast state and the predicted data c dd is the covariance matrix of the predicted data and d i is the predicted data for the i th realization step 5 update the ensemble by 15 x i a x i f c yd c dd α l c d 1 d obs i d i i 1 2 n e where l is the times index of the esmda l 1 2 na c d is the covariance matrix of the measurements error and d obs is the perturbed observations with noise of covariance αl c d step 6 interpolate the updated y at pilot points to un sampled locations using ds method the extrapolated y fields will be implemented for the next iteration notably the pilot points play an important role in this approach if there are no pilot points the esmda ds becomes the ds alone and therefore dynamic data cannot be incorporated into the mpg simulations if all the nodes are pilot points the proposed algorithm ends with the esmda and the non gaussian patterns will not be preserved after assimilation to handle the non gaussianity we use the pilot points to bridge the esmda and ds for better flow and transport modeling 2 3 data assimilation framework fig 1 shows the flowing chart of the proposed data assimilation framework first an ensemble of non gaussian y fields is generated by the ds with the y fields the distribution of cl clay content and ϕ are obtained from eqs 3 and 4 next the groundwater model is propagated forward to get the evolution of solute concentration c using the petrophysical models the distributions of resistivity is converted from c and cl through geophysical forward model geophysical properties ρ are transferred to geophysical observations ρa then the esmda is used to update the ln k values at pilot points by incorporating geochemical and geophysical measurements c and ρa the updated ln k at the pilot points is used as hard data for the ds to regenerate the ln k fields 3 synthetic case study 3 1 case description to test the performance of the proposed framework we conduct a synthetic salt injection experiment in a non gaussian setting the solute transport process is monitored by both hydrogeological sampling and time lapse ert the synthetic salt injection experiment is developed for a 2d heterogeneous confined aquifer 40 m 20 m the study area is discretized into 80 40 3200 blocks the length of each block is 0 5 m δx δz 0 5 m no flow boundary conditions are imposed at the upper and lower side of the aquifer constant head boundary conditions are set at x 0 m hydraulic head h 102 m and x 40 m h 100 m to ensure groundwater flow for the solute transport model a linear inert tracer nacl source with a constant concentration c 1 g l is set along a line at x 1 0 m the initial concentration is set to zero in the whole domain the total simulation time is 100 days the flow and transport parameters are shown in table 1 for the ert forward model the domain boundaries are placed 240 m from the zone of interest to minimize boundary effects on geoelectric simulations the non gaussian y fields are generated through the ds simulation the ds can model both categorical and continuous variables based on the training image fig 2 a in reality the training image can be roughly inferred from expert information or geophysical methods e g seismic technique the resulting reference y field is shown in fig 2b the corresponding distribution of clay content is demonstrated in fig 2c note that the histogram of the reference y field fig 2d shows a strong non gaussian character the initial y fields are generated from the same training image based on the reference y field and the coupled hydrogeophysical model we can obtain the dynamic process of solute transport fig 2e and the corresponding resistivity distribution fig 2f the number of multiple data assimilation in the esmda algorithm is chosen to be 4 na 4 larger na might improve the characterization because more iterations are performed however the computation burden will also be significantly increased therefore na should be set to achieve a trade off between estimation accuracy and computation efficiency we have pre tested the performance of different na based on the simulation results not shown and previous research emerick and reynolds 2013 na is taken as 4 in this work we set the coefficients of data assimilation as follow α 1 9 333 α 2 7 0 α 3 4 0 and α 4 2 0 according to emerick and reynolds 2013 the realization size for esmda ds is taken as 500 the number of the pilot points is 300 the spatial distribution of the pilot points is randomly generated fig 3 a to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm sensitivity to the number of pilot points will be further discussed in section 5 3 2 multiple observation data to demonstrate the advantage of multi source data assimilation four cases table 2 are designed to analyze the trade off between the different types of datasets the non gaussian ln k field is estimated using only a few concentration data in case 1 only ert data in case 2 both concentration small amount and ert data in case 3 and a large amount of concentration data in case 4 to characterize the heterogeneous aquifer three vertical boreholes the red dotted frames in fig 3b are excavated at x 10 20 and 30 m for drilling sample and cross borehole ert measurements to obtain the concentration data 30 concentration observation points the black triangles in fig 3b are evenly distributed in three boreholes for case 1 and 3 in case 4 a large amount of concentration data is collected in 100 observation points the red circles in fig 3b to implement ert measurements 30 electrodes are installed in the vertical boreholes and 21 electrodes are set at the top aquifer aquitard contact fig 3c these electrodes are placed 2 m apart both in vertical boreholes and horizontal line the dipole dipole array a commonly used electrode array in field investigation e g johnson et al 2015 is used for the horizontal line while a bipole bipole configuration e g seferou et al 2013 is used for the cross well measurements the resulting geophysical measurement vector includes 561 apparent resistivity data besides the ert data acquisition for this synthetic case is assumed to be taken as instantaneous snapshots in other words the duration required to record the geophysical data is small with the time required for the salt to move in subsurface it follows that the solute transport can be neglected during each geophysical data acquisition with the known electrode configuration and the reference y distribution we can obtain the reference c and ρa data through the coupled hydrogeophysical model adding 3 and 15 relative errors to the reference c and ρa respectively the noisy measurements are acquired note that the resistivity data has a larger error due to its lower accuracy this level of noises is realistic in terms of real conditions jardani et al 2013 both the geochemical c and geophysical ρa measurements are acquired every 10 days from t1 10 d to t10 100 d 4 results 4 1 hydraulic conductivity estimation fig 4 demonstrates the ensemble mean variance and histogram of the calibrated y fields using different types of datasets the initial fields the first row in fig 4 are directly generated by the ds without considering any dynamic data although each realization can preserve non gaussian feature the ensemble mean only provides a relatively homogeneous result besides the ensemble variance for initial fields is the largest because no dynamic data are incorporated here in case 1 only limited amount of geochemical data 300 measurements in total is assimilated the limited data are very common in practice due to the high cost of traditional intrusive drilling method after integrating these dynamic geochemical data the ensemble mean can roughly delineate main preferential flow conduits of the reference however suffering from a scarcity of data the estimated field fails to characterize the true heterogeneity structure in detail e g the connectivity of the highly permeable preferential flow conduits is relatively poor in addition compared with the results from initial fields overall ensemble variance in case 1 declines considerably besides the y at the boundaries of channels have a larger uncertainty than those within the channels which is consistent with the results of cao et al 2018 and li et al 2018 the histogram from case 1 is closer to the reference due to the integration of dynamic geochemical data in case 2 the low cost and non invasive ert method is introduced to reconstruct the complex non gaussian heterogeneity the ensemble mean can roughly recover the reference y distribution compared with the results of case 1 in case 2 the preferential flow conduits are more connective and closer to the reference it is because ert can provide sufficient data 5610 measurements in total which are highly sensitive to the conductive solute and clay material in subsurface however suffering from the low resolution of ert the results in case 2 only produce a relatively smooth distribution of conductivities which loses the fine structure of the reference also lower measurement accuracy results in larger ensemble variance to improve the resolution of ert the survey design optimization e g loke et al 2014 and the image guided method based on gpr reflections e g zhou et al 2014b could be used to alleviate this problem in the future in case 3 we incorporate both the concentration and resistivity data to update the conductivities the results show that the ensemble mean map can reconstruct the reference field with a high resolution both the connectivity of the channel and the spatial distribution of conductivities can be preferably recovered this can be explained that ert data can act as a good complement to concentration data despite its low resolution ert can provide sufficient data covering the entire study area on the other hand constrained by the high accuracy concentration data the estimated field can successfully converge to the reference with a low uncertainty similarly jardani et al 2013 combined tracer test self potential and ert for gaussian permeability estimation via the pilot points and markov chain monte carlo sampling methods their results also demonstrate that when incorporating multi source datasets the hydraulic aquifer properties can be better constrained to further illustrate the advantage of integrating multi source datasets a large amount of concentration data 1000 measurements in total is considered in case 4 for comparison note that the estimated fields in case 3 is even comparable to those in case 4 however a huge amount of geochemical data like case 4 is impractical in reality therefore combining sufficient geophysical data and a small amount of high precision geochemical data is a good alternative it can be easily implemented and can accurately depict the non gaussian fields the results can also be investigated by comparing the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the non gaussian y ensembles for the initial fields and four cases with the cdf of the reference y field fig 5 the cdfs of the initial fields roughly illustrate the non gaussian character however their uncertainty is quite high and the ensemble mean is very different from the reference considering the geochemical data alone case 1 the dispersion of ensembles considerably declines but the ensemble mean cdf cannot match the reference well when using resistivity data alone case 2 the results suffer from an unacceptable huge uncertainty caused by the low resolution of ert by contrast the results in case 3 and 4 can better reconstruct the non gaussian structure with a lower uncertainty to quantitatively analyze the performance of these four cases the root mean square error rmse which is widely used to evaluate the performance of the inversion method e g chen and zhang 2006 jardani et al 2013 is applied as a criterion to measure the agreement between the estimated and reference distribution of y 16 rmse y 1 n g i 1 n g y r y a 2 where ng is the number of grids yr and ya represent the reference and the estimated ensemble mean distribution of loge hydraulic conductivity respectively optimally rmse should decline as the characterization improves fig 6 displays scatterplots the coefficient of determination r2 and the rmse of true versus estimated y for initial fields and four cases respectively these results indicate when using both geochemical and geophysical data sets case 3 and case 4 the updated fields can match the reference better than when just a single dataset is considered case 1 and case2 4 2 concentration data reproduction besides directly assessing the characterization of hydraulic conductivity we also evaluate the inversion results with the reproduction of concentration data based on the estimated y fields from these four cases the solute transport model is rerun to obtain the corresponding c distributions fig 7 demonstrates the ensemble mean ensemble variance and the cdf of plume distribution t 50 d for the initial fields and four cases note that the c distribution calculated from the initial fields does not exhibit any decent features shown by the reference field besides the variance and cdf maps demonstrate its uncertainty is quite high by contrast the results in case 1 4 can reflect the reference c distribution to some extent when a single dataset i e geochemical or geophysical data corresponding to case 1 and 2 respectively is used the esmda ds fail to characterize the fine architecture of the plumes moreover variance and cdf maps show both two cases still suffer from a relatively large uncertainty despite that the realizations slightly converge nevertheless considering both geochemical and geophysical datasets the results in case 3 can better reflect the plumes distribution with a lower uncertainty in addition the estimation accuracy achieved by combining multi source data is similar to the one achieved by using a large amount of drilling concentration data to quantitatively evaluate the capability of c reproduction for these four cases we calculate the rmse for ct 50d distributions table 3 it indicates the estimated c distribution in case 3 is more accurate than those in case 1 and 2 obviously integrating multi source datasets can preferably reproduce the concentration data all the computing work are run on a workstation with eight core 2 6 ghz cpu and 32 gb ram the computation time for the four cases are shown in table 3 the main cost of the total cpu time is spent by the forward groundwater model and geophysical model note that incorporating ert data case 2 and 3 requires additional calls of the forward ert model and therefore results in a longer computation time 5 discussion one important issue for the esmda ds algorithm is the optimization of the number of the pilot points therefore we performed a sensitivity analysis on the number of pilot points based on case 3 and discussed its influences on the inversion results fig 8 demonstrates the ensemble means of updated hydraulic conductivity using different number of pilot points with esmda ds i e npilot 100 300 900 and 3200 note that the ensemble mean is improved from npilot 100 to npilot 300 because the increasing number of pilot points help integrate more information from dynamic datasets also the uncertainty of the estimated y declines when the number of pilot points is further increased from 300 to 900 the ensemble variance further decreases however when npilot 900 the histogram shows less non gaussianity since the esmda will turn those points into gaussian distribution when all the nodes are pilot points npilot 3200 the esmda ds turns into esmda alone i e no ds is used for interpolation the ensemble mean map from esmda shows overfitting and the uncertainty of the conductivities is underestimated besides the histogram shows that after esmda assimilation the estimated y fields have almost become a gaussian distribution losing the bimodal distribution of the reference meanwhile based on the estimated y field by using different number of pilot points the solute transport model is rerun to obtain the corresponding c distributions fig 9 fig 9 illustrates that the uncertainty of the resulting concentration fields gradually declines with the elevated number of pilot points to make a quantitative comparison we calculate the rmse for y and ct 50d distributions table 4 when the number of pilot points increase from 100 to 300 both the estimations for y and ct 50d are improved on the other hand further increase in the number of pilot points might provide a worse estimation due to the loss of non gaussianity of the reference in summary a small amount of pilot points will not be enough to assimilate indirect data while a redundant number of pilot points will fail to preserve the non gaussian structure of the reference field therefore the number of pilot points should be carefully set to achieve a trade off between data assimilation and non gaussianity preservation see cao et al 2018 6 conclusions in order to overcome the difficulties due to a sparsity of observations from traditional hydrogeological investigations we developed a data assimilation framework integrating the coupled hydrogeological ert forward model and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds method to inverse the non gaussian parameter field to test the performance of the proposed framework we conducted a synthetic salt tracer injection experiment in a non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field this injection experiment is monitored by simulating both hydrogeological sampling and time lapse ert quantitative comparisons for four cases are performed using the following constraints 1 a small amount of concentration data alone 2 resistivity data alone 3 both concentration and ert data 4 a large amount of concentration data alone then the solute transport predictions are performed to evaluate the reproductive capability of the estimated hydraulic conductivities the influence of the number of pilot points on the results are further discussed the results show that using a single dataset concentration or resistivity the heterogeneous aquifer can be roughly reconstructed however neither geochemical nor geophysical data alone can characterize the fine heterogeneous structure combining geochemical and geophysical datasets can provide more detailed information of the non gaussian field indeed these two datasets preferably complement each other ert provides low accuracy but sufficient data covering the entire study area as a supplement a small amount of highly accurate concentration data can successfully reduce the uncertainty of the non gaussian inversion incorporating multi source datasets can even achieve a similar estimation accuracy as using a large amount of concentration data also results from the solute transport predictions demonstrate that integrating geochemical and geophysical data can better delineate the morphology of the plumes for the first time the time lapse geophysical datasets are used to identify the non gaussian pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field as non intrusive low cost and high sampling density approaches time lapse geophysical methods will open up new opportunities to identify the complex non gaussian subsurface heterogeneity and characterize the contaminant plumes note that we used a simple synthetic 2d example with two lithofacies to illustrate effectiveness of proposed framework in this work in reality the aquifer could be 3d and multivariate non gaussian as a result solving 3d non gaussian inversion problem will be more time consuming but in principle this framework can be easily applied to realistic cases where the subsurface heterogeneity is more complicated moreover the esmda ds supports parallel computing which can effectively alleviate computational burden in addition the petrophysical models are assumed to be perfect in this study however these models may face some uncertainties in reality and the petrophysical uncertainty might have an impact on the inversion result linde et al 2017 brunetti and linde 2018 for instance the petrophysical parameters such as cementation exponent might show some heterogeneity just like the permeability linde and doetsch 2016 therefore further studies in this field should account for petrophysical uncertainty to obtain a more realistic uncertainty assessment of the coupled inversion note that the characterization of the hydraulic properties from tracing test only provides an accurate estimation of the highly permeable channels however it suffers from some uncertainty in the low permeable area thus to improve the characterization a future work will concern to further incorporate the induced polarization ip method due to its high sensitivity to the clay content and the low permeability area see revil 2012 revil et al 2017b declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

6166,reliable inversion of spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity is crucial to understand subsurface fluids migration the ensemble smoother direct sampling method es ds has proven to be an effective method to identify non gaussian hydraulic conductivity distributions by incorporating a variety of traditional hydrodynamic measurements e g piezometric head however inversion problems for non gaussian parameters often suffer from a sparsity of the available data from direct sampling in boreholes as a non intrusive cost effective and high sampling density method time lapse geophysical technique has not yet drawn much attention as a useful source of information for delineating the underlying non gaussian heterogeneity in this study we integrated coupled hydrogeophysical modeling and the es ds algorithm to estimate non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field by assimilating both geochemical and time lapse geophysical datasets four synthetic cases for a salt injection experiment monitored by both sampling analysis and electrical resistivity tomography are conducted to assess the ability of the proposed approach to characterize hydraulic properties by assimilating different types of data results show that using geochemical or geophysical data alone only allow a rough reconstruction of subsurface heterogeneity of aquifers but might lose the fine structure by incorporating multi source datasets the main patterns of the non gaussian reference fields can be reflected with an improved resolution the time lapse geophysical methods open up new opportunities to accurately characterize non gaussian aquifers and monitor the dynamic processes of subsurface fluids keywords non gaussian parameters estimation multi source data assimilation electrical resistivity tomography ensemble smoother 1 introduction accurate estimation of hydrodynamic parameters such as hydraulic conductivity is a key issue for the understanding of groundwater flow and contaminant transport process e g gómez hernández et al 2003 however it is still a great challenge to characterize the heterogeneous aquifer directly due to a scarcity of data from traditional hydrogeological investigations oliver and chen 2011 characterization of hydrodynamic parameters can be better obtained from stochastic inversion approaches using the direct data e g hydraulic conductivities measurement and indirect data e g observed head and tracer data zhou et al 2014a among these inversion approaches data assimilation methods have become popular and widely used in hydrogeology and petroleum engineering communities since they can incorporate multi source of information to jointly estimate model parameters and states e g ju et al 2018 oliver and chen 2011 zheng et al 2019 zhou et al 2014a various strategies have been proposed including the kalman filter kf kalman 1960 and its variants like the ensemble smoother es vanleeuwen and evensen 1996 the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2009 and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 all of these methods assume however a multivariate gaussian distribution for the parameters and state variables which might be a questionable assumption in complex channelized aquifers this is for instance the case when the distribution of the hydraulic conductivity is controlled by features such as paleo channels with highly permeable preferential flow conduits zovi et al 2017 the same can be found in presence of complex sand clay interbedding caused by marine transgressions and regressions baeteman et al 1989 to address the challenge caused by the non gaussian priors two strategies have been proposed in the literature in the first set of approaches reparameterization methods are used to transform parameters e g log hydraulic conductivity from non gaussian distributions into gaussian distributions such as the normal score enkf zhou et al 2011 iterative normal score ensemble smoother li et al 2018 the gaussian anamorphosis schoeniger et al 2012 and the deep learning method canchumuni et al 2017 another set of approaches are based on geostatistical simulation which use a post processing step to make the posterior parameters consistent with the prior probability distribution for example sarma et al 2008 developed a kernel enkf to reconstruct the channelized hydraulic conductivity field based on the multiple point geo statistics mpg jafarpour and khodabakhshi 2011 introduced a probability conditioning method pcm which uses the updated parameters probabilities as secondary conditioning data to regenerate non gaussian conductivities field in the mpg laloy et al 2018 proposed a deep neural network approach based on the mpg simulation to deal with the non gaussianity lan et al 2019 combined the pcm and the esmda to estimate non gaussian fields of lithofacies indicators and hydraulic conductivities finally cao et al 2018 coupled iterative ensemble smoother with direct sampling an mpg method proposed by mariethoz et al 2010 via pilot points to inverse the non gaussian parameters this approach can effectively incorporate dynamic hydraulic head data into groundwater model and preserve the non gaussian structures as well although a wide range of methods have been proposed to characterize the non gaussian hydraulic parameters most researchers focused on assimilating only flow and transport measurements such as piezometric head and solute concentration data llopis albert and capilla 2010 zhou et al 2011 li et al 2012 xu and gómez hernández 2016 2018 however directly sampling observations are relatively sparse and the acquisition cost is quite high compared with geophysical methods a relatively high uncertainty of characterization and predictions are expected with limited data sources this uncertainty can be reduced by using non invasive geophysical methods especially electrical resistivity tomography ert and induced polarization ip with low costs and high sampling density binley et al 2015 geophysical methods have been broadly used in the characterization of gaussian heterogeneity irving and singha 2010 pollock and cirpka 2012 camporese et al 2015 ahmed et al 2016 kang et al 2018 2019 however only a few studies have been conducted in applying geophysical methods to identify non gaussian fields zovi et al 2017 gottschalk et al 2017 zovi et al 2017 and gottschalk et al 2017 used ert constraints on channel shape and geological properties and then assimilated the state variables e g water levels or lithological data to characterize the non gaussian subsurface heterogeneity comparing to static ert time lapse ert has a significant advantage in identifying subsurface structure and quantifying the dynamic of subsurface fluids jardani et al 2013 however to our knowledge time lapse geophysical methods have not been used to characterize the non gaussian fields to date in this study we leveraged the latest non gaussian data assimilation approach proposed by cao et al 2018 and built on our previous work kang et al 2018 2019 where multiphase fluids and ert ip forward model were coupled the non gaussian hydraulic conductivity was calibrated by jointly incorporating concentration data and time lapse ert data in this work we first developed a data assimilation framework based on the esmda ds algorithm which was adapted from the es ds method proposed by cao et al 2018 and coupled hydrogeophysical inversion of concentration and ert data a synthetic salt injection experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework four cases with different types of datasets were quantitatively compared including 1 using a small amount of concentration data alone 2 using ert data alone 3 combining a small amount of concentration and ert data and 4 using a large amount of concentration data further the influence of the number of pilot points on the inversion is discussed 2 methods 2 1 coupled hydrogeophysical model to simulate the resistivity anomaly caused by salt injection in non gaussian heterogeneity field with the presence of channelized clay layers a coupled forward model is developed among a flow and solute transport model petrophysical models and a geophysical forward model the coupled model is illustrated in fig 1 red dotted box and summarized in following steps step1 specify the hydraulic conductivity k field to simulate a heterogeneous and non gaussian distributed hydraulic conductivity we construct the channelized k field from a multiple point geostatistical method direct sampling mariethoz et al 2010 this method directly samples the training image for a given data event it can apply multiple point geo statistics to continuous variables and to multivariate problems besides it is fast computationally efficient and easy to parallelize mariethoz et al 2010 meerschman et al 2013 notably the hydraulic conductivity at each cell depends on the proportions of clay and sand for the convenience of subsequent calculations we transform k into permeability using 1 k k μ γ where k denotes the permeability µ is the dynamic viscosity µ 1 01 10 3 pa s at 25 c γ denotes the unit weight for water γ 9 8 103n kg step 2 calculate the volumetric clay content cl first the lower threshold permeability of clay free sand ksd is calculated by revil and cathles 1999 according to 2 k sd d sd 2 ϕ sd 3 m sd 24 where dsd is the grain diameter of sand m ϕsd represents the porosity of sand and msd denotes the cementation exponent of sand in this work dsd 1 10 4 m ϕsd 0 32 msd 2 0 power et al 2013 the resulting ksd 4 5 10 13 m2 which corresponds to a fine sand permeability values larger than ksd are assumed as clay free sand whereas others are indicative of sand containing a fraction of clay then eq 3 is used to calculate the volumetric clay content cl ratio of clay including water to the whole soil volume in terms of the permeability of clay sand mixtures 3 cl k sd 1 3 m cs k 1 3 m cs k sd 1 3 m cs 1 ϕ cl ϕ sd where mcs represents the cementation exponent corresponding to the clayey sand mixtures and ϕcl is the porosity of pure clay in this work mcs msd 2 0 ϕcl 0 56 power et al 2013 revil et al 2017a therefore we assumed cl 0 for the grid cells where k ksd when k ksd the corresponding clay content cl can be calculated through eq 3 for more details about this equation one can refer to revil and cathles 1999 step 3 calculate the total porosity ϕ and clay mass fractions φ w cl the total porosity is calculated from the clay content cl based on the equation developed by berg 2007 4 ϕ ϕ sd 1 c l ϕ cl c l the mass fraction of the clay and sand grains φ w cl φ w sd for each grid cell are given by power et al 2013 5 φ w cl cl 1 ϕ cl ρ cl c l 1 ϕ cl ρ cl 1 c l 1 ϕ sd ρ sd 6 φ w sd 1 φ w cl where ρcl and ρsd denote the density of the clay and sand grains in this work ρcl ρsd 2650 kg m3 the same as in revil et al 2017a step 4 forward flow and solute transport model with k and ϕ in this work the steady state flow field can be obtained from the following governing equation bear 1972 7 k h 0 where k is the hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h denotes the hydraulic head l the governing equation for non reactive component transport is defined as zheng and wang 1999 8 c t d c v c q s ϕ c s where c is the aqueous

the total porosity and cs is the concentration of the source of the non reactive component ml 3 note that the salt concentration in this work is relatively low 1 g l therefore we can safely neglect its effect on density and buoyancy the flow and solute transport forward models are solved by modflow harbaugh et al 2000 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 respectively step 5 convert c and φ w cl to ρ using the petrophysical models proposed by revil et al 2018 and sen and goode 1992 when the subsurface media is clay free the well known archie s law archie 1942 can be used as an appropriate physical model connecting the hydrological state to electrical properties however in presence of clay rich materials such a model may lead to errors patnode and wyllie 1950 to overcome this weakness the resistivity model developed by revil et al 2018 is used to quantify the influence of the clay grains on resistivity 9 1 ρ s w ϕ m σ w s w ϕ m 1 ρ s b λ φ w sd c e c sd φ w cl c e c cl and where the

surface conduction and the polarization associated with the quadrature conductivity respectively here b 4 1 10 9 m 2s 1v 1 and λ 3 460 10 10 m 2s 1v 1 revil et al 2017a 2018 cec c kg represents the total amount of cations which can be sorbed on the mineral surface cec is proportional to the clay content mao et al 2016 the influence of solute concentration and temperature upon the electrical

assume that the temperature remains constant 25 c step 6 simulate ρa apparent resistivity through geophysical forward model with the electrical properties ρ converted from petrophysical models the raw geophysical observation data ρa can be obtained through dc resistivity forward model given the space time distribution of bulk electrical resistivity the forward model can predict apparent resistivity

represents a single current electrode idealized as a point source at the origin with current strength i a in this work the geophysical forward problem is solved by agi earthimager software agi 2010 2 2 ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds in this work the esmda ds is used as an inversion tool to characterize the non gaussian heterogeneous parameter field y loge hydraulic conductivity this method borrows computational efficiency from the esmda emerick and reynolds 2013 and leverages the capability of the ds mariethoz et al 2010 for handling the non gaussianity note that we adapt the iterative es ds proposed by cao et al 2018 to the esmda ds because the esmda has less computational expense and better data matches than the iterative es see emerick and reynolds 2013 this method can be summarized in following steps step 1 build the augmented state vector x parameters of interest p e g y are augmented with the state variables h e g c and ρa into a joint state vector x p h t step 2 decide the number of data assimilation na and the coefficient αi with i 1 n a for different times data assimilation for i 1 to na run step 3 to 5 step 3 for each realization run the coupled hydrogeophysical model from time zero with updated parameters 12 x i f g x i a i 1 2 n e where i is the ensemble member index superscripts f and a denote forecast and analysis respectively ne represents the number of the realizations in the ensemble through eq 12 we can obtain temporal evolutions of the state variables based on the model parameters which can be used for update in step 4 step 4 calculate the error covariance for the predicted state 13 c yd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e x i f x f d i d t 14 c dd 1 n e 1 i 1 n e d i d d i d t where c yd is the cross covariance matrix between the forecast state and the predicted data c dd is the covariance matrix of the predicted data and d i is the predicted data for the i th realization step 5 update the ensemble by 15 x i a x i f c yd c dd α l c d 1 d obs i d i i 1 2 n e where l is the times index of the esmda l 1 2 na c d is the covariance matrix of the measurements error and d obs is the perturbed observations with noise of covariance αl c d step 6 interpolate the updated y at pilot points to un sampled locations using ds method the extrapolated y fields will be implemented for the next iteration notably the pilot points play an important role in this approach if there are no pilot points the esmda ds becomes the ds alone and therefore dynamic data cannot be incorporated into the mpg simulations if all the nodes are pilot points the proposed algorithm ends with the esmda and the non gaussian patterns will not be preserved after assimilation to handle the non gaussianity we use the pilot points to bridge the esmda and ds for better flow and transport modeling 2 3 data assimilation framework fig 1 shows the flowing chart of the proposed data assimilation framework first an ensemble of non gaussian y fields is generated by the ds with the y fields the distribution of cl clay content and ϕ are obtained from eqs 3 and 4 next the groundwater model is propagated forward to get the evolution of solute concentration c using the petrophysical models the distributions of resistivity is converted from c and cl through geophysical forward model geophysical properties ρ are transferred to geophysical observations ρa then the esmda is used to update the ln k values at pilot points by incorporating geochemical and geophysical measurements c and ρa the updated ln k at the pilot points is used as hard data for the ds to regenerate the ln k fields 3 synthetic case study 3 1 case description to test the performance of the proposed framework we conduct a synthetic salt injection experiment in a non gaussian setting the solute transport process is monitored by both hydrogeological sampling and time lapse ert the synthetic salt injection experiment is developed for a 2d heterogeneous confined aquifer 40 m 20 m the study area is discretized into 80 40 3200 blocks the length of each block is 0 5 m δx δz 0 5 m no flow boundary conditions are imposed at the upper and lower side of the aquifer constant head boundary conditions are set at x 0 m hydraulic head h 102 m and x 40 m h 100 m to ensure groundwater flow for the solute transport model a linear inert tracer nacl source with a constant concentration c 1 g l is set along a line at x 1 0 m the initial concentration is set to zero in the whole domain the total simulation time is 100 days the flow and transport parameters are shown in table 1 for the ert forward model the domain boundaries are placed 240 m from the zone of interest to minimize boundary effects on geoelectric simulations the non gaussian y fields are generated through the ds simulation the ds can model both categorical and continuous variables based on the training image fig 2 a in reality the training image can be roughly inferred from expert information or geophysical methods e g seismic technique the resulting reference y field is shown in fig 2b the corresponding distribution of clay content is demonstrated in fig 2c note that the histogram of the reference y field fig 2d shows a strong non gaussian character the initial y fields are generated from the same training image based on the reference y field and the coupled hydrogeophysical model we can obtain the dynamic process of solute transport fig 2e and the corresponding resistivity distribution fig 2f the number of multiple data assimilation in the esmda algorithm is chosen to be 4 na 4 larger na might improve the characterization because more iterations are performed however the computation burden will also be significantly increased therefore na should be set to achieve a trade off between estimation accuracy and computation efficiency we have pre tested the performance of different na based on the simulation results not shown and previous research emerick and reynolds 2013 na is taken as 4 in this work we set the coefficients of data assimilation as follow α 1 9 333 α 2 7 0 α 3 4 0 and α 4 2 0 according to emerick and reynolds 2013 the realization size for esmda ds is taken as 500 the number of the pilot points is 300 the spatial distribution of the pilot points is randomly generated fig 3 a to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm sensitivity to the number of pilot points will be further discussed in section 5 3 2 multiple observation data to demonstrate the advantage of multi source data assimilation four cases table 2 are designed to analyze the trade off between the different types of datasets the non gaussian ln k field is estimated using only a few concentration data in case 1 only ert data in case 2 both concentration small amount and ert data in case 3 and a large amount of concentration data in case 4 to characterize the heterogeneous aquifer three vertical boreholes the red dotted frames in fig 3b are excavated at x 10 20 and 30 m for drilling sample and cross borehole ert measurements to obtain the concentration data 30 concentration observation points the black triangles in fig 3b are evenly distributed in three boreholes for case 1 and 3 in case 4 a large amount of concentration data is collected in 100 observation points the red circles in fig 3b to implement ert measurements 30 electrodes are installed in the vertical boreholes and 21 electrodes are set at the top aquifer aquitard contact fig 3c these electrodes are placed 2 m apart both in vertical boreholes and horizontal line the dipole dipole array a commonly used electrode array in field investigation e g johnson et al 2015 is used for the horizontal line while a bipole bipole configuration e g seferou et al 2013 is used for the cross well measurements the resulting geophysical measurement vector includes 561 apparent resistivity data besides the ert data acquisition for this synthetic case is assumed to be taken as instantaneous snapshots in other words the duration required to record the geophysical data is small with the time required for the salt to move in subsurface it follows that the solute transport can be neglected during each geophysical data acquisition with the known electrode configuration and the reference y distribution we can obtain the reference c and ρa data through the coupled hydrogeophysical model adding 3 and 15 relative errors to the reference c and ρa respectively the noisy measurements are acquired note that the resistivity data has a larger error due to its lower accuracy this level of noises is realistic in terms of real conditions jardani et al 2013 both the geochemical c and geophysical ρa measurements are acquired every 10 days from t1 10 d to t10 100 d 4 results 4 1 hydraulic conductivity estimation fig 4 demonstrates the ensemble mean variance and histogram of the calibrated y fields using different types of datasets the initial fields the first row in fig 4 are directly generated by the ds without considering any dynamic data although each realization can preserve non gaussian feature the ensemble mean only provides a relatively homogeneous result besides the ensemble variance for initial fields is the largest because no dynamic data are incorporated here in case 1 only limited amount of geochemical data 300 measurements in total is assimilated the limited data are very common in practice due to the high cost of traditional intrusive drilling method after integrating these dynamic geochemical data the ensemble mean can roughly delineate main preferential flow conduits of the reference however suffering from a scarcity of data the estimated field fails to characterize the true heterogeneity structure in detail e g the connectivity of the highly permeable preferential flow conduits is relatively poor in addition compared with the results from initial fields overall ensemble variance in case 1 declines considerably besides the y at the boundaries of channels have a larger uncertainty than those within the channels which is consistent with the results of cao et al 2018 and li et al 2018 the histogram from case 1 is closer to the reference due to the integration of dynamic geochemical data in case 2 the low cost and non invasive ert method is introduced to reconstruct the complex non gaussian heterogeneity the ensemble mean can roughly recover the reference y distribution compared with the results of case 1 in case 2 the preferential flow conduits are more connective and closer to the reference it is because ert can provide sufficient data 5610 measurements in total which are highly sensitive to the conductive solute and clay material in subsurface however suffering from the low resolution of ert the results in case 2 only produce a relatively smooth distribution of conductivities which loses the fine structure of the reference also lower measurement accuracy results in larger ensemble variance to improve the resolution of ert the survey design optimization e g loke et al 2014 and the image guided method based on gpr reflections e g zhou et al 2014b could be used to alleviate this problem in the future in case 3 we incorporate both the concentration and resistivity data to update the conductivities the results show that the ensemble mean map can reconstruct the reference field with a high resolution both the connectivity of the channel and the spatial distribution of conductivities can be preferably recovered this can be explained that ert data can act as a good complement to concentration data despite its low resolution ert can provide sufficient data covering the entire study area on the other hand constrained by the high accuracy concentration data the estimated field can successfully converge to the reference with a low uncertainty similarly jardani et al 2013 combined tracer test self potential and ert for gaussian permeability estimation via the pilot points and markov chain monte carlo sampling methods their results also demonstrate that when incorporating multi source datasets the hydraulic aquifer properties can be better constrained to further illustrate the advantage of integrating multi source datasets a large amount of concentration data 1000 measurements in total is considered in case 4 for comparison note that the estimated fields in case 3 is even comparable to those in case 4 however a huge amount of geochemical data like case 4 is impractical in reality therefore combining sufficient geophysical data and a small amount of high precision geochemical data is a good alternative it can be easily implemented and can accurately depict the non gaussian fields the results can also be investigated by comparing the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of the non gaussian y ensembles for the initial fields and four cases with the cdf of the reference y field fig 5 the cdfs of the initial fields roughly illustrate the non gaussian character however their uncertainty is quite high and the ensemble mean is very different from the reference considering the geochemical data alone case 1 the dispersion of ensembles considerably declines but the ensemble mean cdf cannot match the reference well when using resistivity data alone case 2 the results suffer from an unacceptable huge uncertainty caused by the low resolution of ert by contrast the results in case 3 and 4 can better reconstruct the non gaussian structure with a lower uncertainty to quantitatively analyze the performance of these four cases the root mean square error rmse which is widely used to evaluate the performance of the inversion method e g chen and zhang 2006 jardani et al 2013 is applied as a criterion to measure the agreement between the estimated and reference distribution of y 16 rmse y 1 n g i 1 n g y r y a 2 where ng is the number of grids yr and ya represent the reference and the estimated ensemble mean distribution of loge hydraulic conductivity respectively optimally rmse should decline as the characterization improves fig 6 displays scatterplots the coefficient of determination r2 and the rmse of true versus estimated y for initial fields and four cases respectively these results indicate when using both geochemical and geophysical data sets case 3 and case 4 the updated fields can match the reference better than when just a single dataset is considered case 1 and case2 4 2 concentration data reproduction besides directly assessing the characterization of hydraulic conductivity we also evaluate the inversion results with the reproduction of concentration data based on the estimated y fields from these four cases the solute transport model is rerun to obtain the corresponding c distributions fig 7 demonstrates the ensemble mean ensemble variance and the cdf of plume distribution t 50 d for the initial fields and four cases note that the c distribution calculated from the initial fields does not exhibit any decent features shown by the reference field besides the variance and cdf maps demonstrate its uncertainty is quite high by contrast the results in case 1 4 can reflect the reference c distribution to some extent when a single dataset i e geochemical or geophysical data corresponding to case 1 and 2 respectively is used the esmda ds fail to characterize the fine architecture of the plumes moreover variance and cdf maps show both two cases still suffer from a relatively large uncertainty despite that the realizations slightly converge nevertheless considering both geochemical and geophysical datasets the results in case 3 can better reflect the plumes distribution with a lower uncertainty in addition the estimation accuracy achieved by combining multi source data is similar to the one achieved by using a large amount of drilling concentration data to quantitatively evaluate the capability of c reproduction for these four cases we calculate the rmse for ct 50d distributions table 3 it indicates the estimated c distribution in case 3 is more accurate than those in case 1 and 2 obviously integrating multi source datasets can preferably reproduce the concentration data all the computing work are run on a workstation with eight core 2 6 ghz cpu and 32 gb ram the computation time for the four cases are shown in table 3 the main cost of the total cpu time is spent by the forward groundwater model and geophysical model note that incorporating ert data case 2 and 3 requires additional calls of the forward ert model and therefore results in a longer computation time 5 discussion one important issue for the esmda ds algorithm is the optimization of the number of the pilot points therefore we performed a sensitivity analysis on the number of pilot points based on case 3 and discussed its influences on the inversion results fig 8 demonstrates the ensemble means of updated hydraulic conductivity using different number of pilot points with esmda ds i e npilot 100 300 900 and 3200 note that the ensemble mean is improved from npilot 100 to npilot 300 because the increasing number of pilot points help integrate more information from dynamic datasets also the uncertainty of the estimated y declines when the number of pilot points is further increased from 300 to 900 the ensemble variance further decreases however when npilot 900 the histogram shows less non gaussianity since the esmda will turn those points into gaussian distribution when all the nodes are pilot points npilot 3200 the esmda ds turns into esmda alone i e no ds is used for interpolation the ensemble mean map from esmda shows overfitting and the uncertainty of the conductivities is underestimated besides the histogram shows that after esmda assimilation the estimated y fields have almost become a gaussian distribution losing the bimodal distribution of the reference meanwhile based on the estimated y field by using different number of pilot points the solute transport model is rerun to obtain the corresponding c distributions fig 9 fig 9 illustrates that the uncertainty of the resulting concentration fields gradually declines with the elevated number of pilot points to make a quantitative comparison we calculate the rmse for y and ct 50d distributions table 4 when the number of pilot points increase from 100 to 300 both the estimations for y and ct 50d are improved on the other hand further increase in the number of pilot points might provide a worse estimation due to the loss of non gaussianity of the reference in summary a small amount of pilot points will not be enough to assimilate indirect data while a redundant number of pilot points will fail to preserve the non gaussian structure of the reference field therefore the number of pilot points should be carefully set to achieve a trade off between data assimilation and non gaussianity preservation see cao et al 2018 6 conclusions in order to overcome the difficulties due to a sparsity of observations from traditional hydrogeological investigations we developed a data assimilation framework integrating the coupled hydrogeological ert forward model and the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation direct sampling esmda ds method to inverse the non gaussian parameter field to test the performance of the proposed framework we conducted a synthetic salt tracer injection experiment in a non gaussian hydraulic conductivity field this injection experiment is monitored by simulating both hydrogeological sampling and time lapse ert quantitative comparisons for four cases are performed using the following constraints 1 a small amount of concentration data alone 2 resistivity data alone 3 both concentration and ert data 4 a large amount of concentration data alone then the solute transport predictions are performed to evaluate the reproductive capability of the estimated hydraulic conductivities the influence of the number of pilot points on the results are further discussed the results show that using a single dataset concentration or resistivity the heterogeneous aquifer can be roughly reconstructed however neither geochemical nor geophysical data alone can characterize the fine heterogeneous structure combining geochemical and geophysical datasets can provide more detailed information of the non gaussian field indeed these two datasets preferably complement each other ert provides low accuracy but sufficient data covering the entire study area as a supplement a small amount of highly accurate concentration data can successfully reduce the uncertainty of the non gaussian inversion incorporating multi source datasets can even achieve a similar estimation accuracy as using a large amount of concentration data also results from the solute transport predictions demonstrate that integrating geochemical and geophysical data can better delineate the morphology of the plumes for the first time the time lapse geophysical datasets are used to identify the non gaussian pattern of the hydraulic conductivity field as non intrusive low cost and high sampling density approaches time lapse geophysical methods will open up new opportunities to identify the complex non gaussian subsurface heterogeneity and characterize the contaminant plumes note that we used a simple synthetic 2d example with two lithofacies to illustrate effectiveness of proposed framework in this work in reality the aquifer could be 3d and multivariate non gaussian as a result solving 3d non gaussian inversion problem will be more time consuming but in principle this framework can be easily applied to realistic cases where the subsurface heterogeneity is more complicated moreover the esmda ds supports parallel computing which can effectively alleviate computational burden in addition the petrophysical models are assumed to be perfect in this study however these models may face some uncertainties in reality and the petrophysical uncertainty might have an impact on the inversion result linde et al 2017 brunetti and linde 2018 for instance the petrophysical parameters such as cementation exponent might show some heterogeneity just like the permeability linde and doetsch 2016 therefore further studies in this field should account for petrophysical uncertainty to obtain a more realistic uncertainty assessment of the coupled inversion note that the characterization of the hydraulic properties from tracing test only provides an accurate estimation of the highly permeable channels however it suffers from some uncertainty in the low permeable area thus to improve the characterization a future work will concern to further incorporate the induced polarization ip method due to its high sensitivity to the clay content and the

6167,air temperatures precipitation and river discharge have been steadily increasing in many river basins over the last century this is especially the case with north america s largest river basin the 3 2 million km2 mississippi river basin which comprises over 41 of the total land surface area in the contiguous usa yet we lack an understanding of how these changes will influence the export of terrigenous carbon through river systems into coastal waters and the atmosphere this study investigated concentrations and mass fluxes of doc dic and co2 during 2015 2018 in the lower mississippi river we found an annual riverine export of 3 95 tg c and 12 25 tg c for doc and dic into the gulf of mexico with 75 and 67 of their respective loads discharged during the wet season from january through july the riverine mass exports represent a flux rate of 1 4 g doc c m 2 and 4 2 g dic c 2 from the mississippi river basin which are considerably higher than those reported for other river basins surface water of the lower mississippi river was constantly supersaturated by dissolved co2 with its partial pressure pco2 ranging from 526 to 3961 µatm and an average outgassing rate of 654 g c m 2 yr 1 export of doc and pco2 measurements were substantially greater than estimates reported over ten years prior accompanied by significant increases in river discharge and air temperatures these findings strongly suggest that doc and co2 fluxes from the mississippi river basin into coastal waters and the atmosphere will very likely increase in the future due to increasing biological productivity and subsequent carbon export to rivers under increasing discharge and air temperatures keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon co2 outgassing delta c 13 climate change mississippi river 1 introduction terrestrial carbon export from river systems to estuarine and marine environments is a crucial component of the global carbon cycle carbon can be exported in both particulate e g organic debris and sediment bound matter and dissolved forms e g dissolved organic and inorganic carbons the latter of which is much more challenging to quantify especially in the longer term most recent global estimates of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon exports doc 199 360 tg yr 1 and dissolved inorganic carbon exports dic 381 410 tg yr 1 are both higher than estimates for particulate organic carbon exports poc 179 240 tg yr 1 and particulate inorganic carbon exports pic 170 tg yr 1 meybeck 1982 1992 hedges and keil 1995 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 li et al 2017 demonstrating the importance of accurately quantifying dissolved carbon export in global carbon accounting different dic species are utilized by phytoplankton and aquatic plants through photosynthesis while consumption and oxidation of doc is vital to the life cycle of aquatic organisms in both riverine and estuarine environments hope et al 1994 raymond and bauer 2001 for these reasons studying the transport and transformation of dissolved carbon in river systems is of great importance rivers not only transport carbon from land to ocean but can also release carbon into the atmosphere through a process known as carbon dioxide co2 outgassing in large rivers this phenomenon has been primarily attributed to an oversaturation of dissolved co2 in the water column in response to respiration of organic carbon and aquatic metabolism over powering in stream gross primary production richey 2003 however more recent research by duvert et al 2019 found ground water co2 input rates to streams can match and even exceed co2 outgassing rates many of the world s largest rivers function as a source of co2 to the atmosphere butman and raymond 2011 li et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2017 resulting in a large global river co2 flux to the atmosphere between 230 and 1800 tg each year cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 far greater than particulate carbon exports the large variation in global outgassing estimates stems not only from differing methods in outgassing calculations but also from limited spatiotemporal data availability as more research is showing that the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in rivers can vary spatially liu et al 2017 ran et al 2017 and temporally lynch et al 2010 ran et al 2015 reiman and xu 2019 due to land use lithology and seasonal variation in hydrologic inputs and biological processing long term high resolution data is beneficial in constraining uncertainties in river carbon accounting draining approximately 41 of the continental u s and discharging approximately 680 km3 of water annually into the gulf of mexico xu and delduco 2017 the mississippi atchafalaya river system is the largest river system in north america the flow volume represents 2 of the total global export of freshwater to oceans dai and trenberth 2002 despite the relevance of such a large river in regional and global carbon budgets few studies have analyzed both doc and dic transport in the lower reaches of the mississippi river s main channel furthermore existing studies are short term in nature with limited temporal data requiring interpretation of carbon dynamics over seasons and years studies by bianchi et al 2004 dubois et al 2010 shen et al 2012 and cai et al 2015 reported annual doc from the lower mississippi between 1 5 and 3 1 tg while cai 2003 cai et al 2015 estimated an annual dic export of 13 6 tg these estimates represent as much as approximately 2 and 4 of global doc and dic exports one study dubois et al 2010 analyzed annual co2 outgassing in the lower reaches of the river s main channel which found an average pco2 value of 1362 µatm std dev 267 nearly 20 years ago this study estimated pco2 using river alkalinity and ph measurements however a recent pilot study on diel variation of co2 in the lower mississippi river by reiman and xu 2019 using in situ pco2 measurements found a 7 25 diel range of pco values causing significantly lower co2 outgassing rates during daylight hours indicating the potential of a large underestimation by dubois et al 2010 while these studies have been helpful in estimating carbon fluxes for this large river system the data are well over a decade old discharge in the mississippi river and atmospheric temperatures within the river basin have been steadily increasing over the past century zhang and schilling 2006 qian et al 2007 raymond et al 2008 a us epa study on river water temperature found that both monthly and annual average temperatures in the mississippi river basin have increased since 1950 especially in the past 10 years tang et al 2015 the study predicted that by the end of the 21st century river water temperatures of the mississippi river basin would increase by 1 8 c tang s prediction is well in agreement with the findings by melillo et al 2014 and van vliet et al 2013 that global air and water temperature are expected to see large increases in coming years concurrently a modeling study by tao et al 2014 has projected that the mississippi river discharge will continue increasing throughout the 21st century by 11 60 influenced by changes in climate and land use it is currently unclear how carbon export from the mississippi river will respond to these discharge and temperature changes in the future a comprehensive review by regnier et al 2013 declared that anthropogenic disturbance of natural lands has drastically altered the global flux of carbon from land to water and in turn the atmosphere a recent study using the world s longest record of doc concentrations 130 years from the thames river basin in united kingdom showed that 90 of the long term rise in riverine doc was caused by urban development noacco et al 2017 although such long term doc measurements do not exist for the mississippi river modeling work by tian et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 suggest that fluxes of doc in the mississippi may have increased by as much as 40 over the last 100 years primarily due to land use change and land management practices raymond et al 2008 also reported a large increase in bicarbonate concentrations and fluxes from the mississippi river over the 20th century and attributed it to agriculture drainage altering land use practices paired with an increase in soil liming the modeling work by ren et al 2015 predicts dic fluxes in the river will increase by as much as 65 in the next 100 years due to increasing precipitation discharge and atmosphere temperature soil carbon is highly sensitive to soil temperature and moisture borken et al 1999 therefore higher temperatures and precipitation can also result in higher soil respiration rates thus greater co2 production and doc leaching borken et al 2002 2004 under these predicted changes in river chemistry due to climate and land use changes an update on carbon dynamics in the mississippi river would 1 illuminate how dissolved carbon export has changed over the past decades 2 validate the former mentioned carbon cycle model predictions and 3 provide data necessary to improve future modeling efforts more specifically a longer term dissolved carbon dataset in the mississippi river would help in identifying the dominant physical and biogeochemical controls on dissolved carbon species in the mississippi river alluding to how carbon exports may continue to change with our rapidly changing climate with these motives in mind this study collected monthly water samples for analysis of doc and dic concentrations and their carbon 13 isotopes δ13c conducted instream measurements of pco2 and other ambient water parameters and quantified doc and dic fluxes and co2 outgassing in the lower mississippi river from may 2015 to september 2018 the primary objective of this study was to provide a much needed update on dissolved carbon dynamics and transport in this large river system under increasing discharge and temperatures by doing so this study tested the hypothesis that dissolved carbon loads in the lower mississippi river in recent years have increased beyond what was predicted in previous carbon models of the river system 2 material and methods 2 1 mississippi river basin and study site this study selected a single location on the mississippi river at baton rouge louisiana in the southern united states n 30 26 44 4 w 91 11 29 6 the same site studied by cai et al 2015 the site was approximately 368 river kilometers upstream of the river s outlet to the northern gulf of mexico fig 1 and 140 river kilometers downstream of the old river control structure in tarbert landing ms which diverts 25 of the discharge from the mississippi river west to form the atchafalaya river both daily discharge records and field data were collected at this location the study site was strategically selected for several reasons the river at the study location receives runoff from a land surface area of 2 915 834 km2 united states geological survey gauge 07374000 https waterdata usgs gov la nwis nwismap site no 07374000 agency cd usgs capturing drainage from nearly the entire basin making it an ideal location for quantifying total dissolved carbon export from the mississippi river basin additionally this site has no potential of salinity influence tidal interference or hydraulic pooling that could occur when sampling at the river s mouth as many previous studies have cai 2003 bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 lastly focusing field collection on one single site rather than across the basin enabled compilation of a large dataset for seasonal analysis the mississippi river drains land from part or all of 31 u s states and two canadian provinces and is the world s fourth largest river basin the basin is comprised of six tributary basins including the arkansas white red lower mississippi missouri ohio tennessee and upper mississippi due to the vast drainage area climate and land use are highly variable across the basin the northernmost reaches of the basin experience a temperate climate with warm summers cold extended winters and large amounts of snowmelt runoff in the spring climate becomes more sub tropical in the southern basin characterized by short mild winters paired with humid hot summer months the entire basin is generally described as humid and rainy with an annual average precipitation of 765 mm and an annual average air temperature of 13 c lakshmi et al 2018 land use in the mississippi river basin is highly heterogeneous however land use is slightly dominated by agriculture located in the missouri upper mississippi and ohio river basins the dominance of agricultural land across the basin has significantly altered nutrient antweiler et al 1995 mitsch et al 2001 and carbon raymond et al 2008 ren et al 2016 concentrations in the mississippi river over the last century more than 70 million citizens reside within the mississippi river basin with approximately 20 million relying on the river as a drinking water source climate nexus accessed 2019 the river receives a substantial amount of point sources primarily wastewater discharges which have been reported to have contributed a large quantity of nitrogen and phosphorus turner and rabalais 2003 usepa 2007 jacobson et al 2011 according to the upper mississippi river basin commission 278 facilities discharge wastewater into the river within this sub basin alone upper mississippi river basin commission http www umrba org facts htm although no report exists on dissolved carbon from wastewater treatment plants in the mississippi river basin the quantity is likely to be substantial as treatment plants are not required to remove carbon from their effluent therefore discharges can contain a significant amount of dissolved organic carbon doc following primary and secondary treatment nishijima et al 2003 katsoyiannis and samara 2007 2 2 river water sampling and measurements water grab samples and field measurements were conducted monthly over a wide range of flow conditions between may 2015 to may 2016 and december 2016 to september 2018 in the lower mississippi river fig 2 thirty four out of thirty nine trips were conducted between 14 00 18 30 us central standard time cst additional field trips were conducted either weekly or bi weekly during a flood pulse between may and june 2017 to assess the influence of flood pulses on carbon transport and co2 outgassing all samples were collected in well flowing water at a depth of 30 50 cm below the surface from a publicly accessible boat ramp using a 3 7 meter aluminum pole with a high density polyethylene bottle hdpe attached to the end of the pole while in general water chemistry in large rivers like the mississippi is commonly considered well mixed because of the fast flow of the water a minimum of three samples were gathered and mixed to ensure a representative composite sample during each field trip samples were then distributed to their appropriate container samples for doc analysis were first stored in 250 ml hdpe bottles and filtered the same day into 60 ml hdpe bottles through a single use 0 2 µm nylon filter environmental express charleston sc usa samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic analysis were collected in 20 ml glass vials filled with no headspace all water samples were stored in darkness on wet ice during transportation doc samples were frozen until analysis while dic samples were kept in a refrigerator all hdpe bottles were thoroughly acid washed prior to each field campaign duplicate dic and doc samples were gathered during each field trip for quality control purposes water samples for doc and dic analysis were not collected the last three months of sampling due to funding constraints beginning in december 2015 in situ pco2 of river water was recorded with a c sensetm sensor turner designs san jose ca usa water temperature specific conductance dissolved oxygen and ph were measured using a ysi 556 multi probe meter ysi inc yellow springs oh usa a hach 2100p turbidimeter hach company loveland co usa was used to measure turbidity from december 2015 to january 2017 for all subsequent months an oakton t100 turbidimeter oakton instruments vernon hills il usa was used phycocyanin bacteria and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements began in july 2017 while colored dissolved organic matter cdom fluorescence measurements began in september 2017 fluorescence measurements were gathered using a handheld aquafluor fluorometer turner designs san jose ca usa river discharge and water temperature data for the mississippi river at baton rouge were downloaded from the u s geological survey s gauging station 07374000 2 3 doc and dic concentration analysis all water samples were analyzed for doc and dic concentrations and respective δ13c stable isotopic composition at the university of california davis stable isotope facility ucdsif https stableisotopefacility ucdavis edu within four months of sample collection water samples were shipped to ucdsif on ice samples of doc were analyzed using an o i analytical model 1030 toc analyzer xylem analytics college station tx interfaced to a pdz europa 20 20 isotope ratio mass spectrometer sercon ltd cheshire uk samples were acidified and purged offline to remove all dic then heated and mixed with sodium persulfate na2s2o8 to convert doc into co2 reference standards on average yielded an error of less than 5 samples of dic were analyzed using a gasbench ii system interfaced with a delta v plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo scientific bremen germany water samples were injected into helium filled 12 ml septum capped vials containing 1 ml 85 phosphoric acid to convert any dissolved co2 or h2co3 to gaseous co2 all equilibrated gaseous co2 is then transferred into a helium carrier stream and sampled using a six port rotary valve comparison of measured dic concentrations with reference standards on average yielded an error of less than 3 2 4 δ13c isotope analysis carbon 13 δ13c isotope values of doc and dic are expressed as deviations per mil from the international standard vienna peedee belemnite vpdb using the following formula δ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 where r is the ratio of 13c to 12c isotopes in the sample and the vpdb reference standard coplen 2011 stable isotopes of carbon have been used extensively to infer the processes controlling sources of carbon in aquatic systems raymond and bauer 2001 mayorga et al 2005 wu et al 2007 carbonate minerals have an isotopic composition near 0 while co2 produced from soil respiration is reflective of the source organic material which can range between 14 and 35 depending on photosynthetic pathway of the plant mook et al 1974 o leary 1988 therefore dic derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals by dissolved co2 will have an isotopic composition between these two values dubois et al 2010 calculated a theoretical δ13c value of bicarbonate in the mississippi river near 7 3 and theoretical value of organic material across the basin 23 5 based on a 73 27 relative distribution of c3 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 outgassing of co2 into the atmospheric can also enrich isotopic composition doctor et al 2008 identifying the specific process influencing carbon at a specific point in time is difficult due to the homogenous mixing nature of isotopes from source sink mechanisms however isotopes are helpful in tracking the changes in biogeochemical carbon processes temporally 2 5 doc and dic mass transport and co2 outgassing calculations a flow duration curve of average daily discharge in the mississippi river at baton rouge over the last 14 water years october 2003 september 2017 was compiled to group data into a wet and a dry season not shown all data in months where average daily discharge was greater than 50 exceedance probability 16 594 m3 s 1 were grouped as wet while all others were grouped as dry monthly average daily river discharge was greater than 50 exceedance probability during the months of january july therefore these months were classified as wet season while august december were classified as dry season monthly load estimates of doc and dic were calculated to estimate total annual loads of doc and dic using the following flow weighted equation l annual month q l daily q daily where lannual is the total annual load of doc or dic tg c yr 1 q is the average total discharge of each month between may 2015 to april 2018 km3 mo 1 ldaily is daily doc or dic load of samples collected in the respective month tg c d 1 and qdaily is the total daily discharge on days of sample collection in the respective month km3 d 1 the rate of co2 outgassing from the surface water to the atmosphere fco2 in g c m 2 d 1 for all samples was calculated using a well established equation published by cai and wang 1998 f co 2 k t k h pco 2 water pco 2 air where k t is a gas transfer coefficient m d 1 k h is a solubility constant mol l 1 atm pco2water and pco2air are the partial pressure of dissolved co2 in the water column and atmosphere µatm respectively a k t value of 3 9 m d 1 was used similar to the only previously pco2 study in the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 this gas transfer coefficient is much lower than the reported global average of rivers 5 7 m d 1 raymond et al 2013 and that reported of large low land river 4 3 m d 1 alin et al 2011 therefore our estimates likely represents a conservative estimate of co2 outgassing weiss 1974 developed the following equation used to calculate solubility constants lnk h a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 l n t 100 s b 1 b 2 t 100 b 3 t 100 2 where a1 58 0931 a2 90 5069

entirely freshwater atmospheric partial pressure of co2 was fixed at 400 µatm for the study period based on noaa global monitoring division data monthly co2 outgassing rates were calculated by multiplying the average daily outgassing rate for each month with the number of days in each month g c m 2 mo 1 monthly co2 outgassing rates were then summed to obtain the annual flux of co2 to the atmosphere g c m 2 yr 1 it should be noted that our pilot study on diel fluctuation of co2 reiman and xu 2019 found that pco2 in the mississippi river showed a significant diurnal cycle in spring and summer months with lowest levels around 15 00 18 00 cst as the majority of samples were collected between 14 00 and 18 30 cst pco2 measurements and co2 outgassing calculations presented are likely very conservative estimates the surface area of the mississippi river between baton rouge la and its confluence with the northern gulf of mexico was calculated using aerial photographs in arcmap 10 3 the total annual co2 outgassing rate was multiplied by the identified surface area of the river 298 687 907 m2 to calculate the total amount of co2 outgassed between the study site and the northern gulf of mexico g c yr 1 2 6 statistical analysis all data were first tested for normality under the shapiro wilk test data not following a normal distribution were compared using a wilcox non parametric one way comparison of means normally distributed data were compared using student s unpaired and paired t test to avoid a potential skewing of data due to the disproportionate number of samples collected in may and june 2017 a single average of data collected in may 2017 and june 2017 was used to calculate annual discharge weighted averages and monthly loads and outgassing rates pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore relationships between all carbon ambient water chemistry and fluorescence data further linear regression analysis was used to more strongly confirm relationships between parameters a significance level of 0 05 was used for all statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using sas 9 4 software 3 results 3 1 discharge and ambient water parameters during the 41 months from may 2015 to september 2018 mississippi river discharge at baton rouge averaged 17 103 m3 s 1 std dev 7983 fig 2 11 higher than the average discharge over the last fourteen years at the same location i e 15 422 4788 m3 s 1 t test p 0 0001 and 24 higher than the average discharge at tarbert landing between 1930 and 2014 13 787 8005 m3 s 1 t test p 0

floods exceeding 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred during the 3 year study period with all except one occurring in spring or early summer months the flood pulse analyzed in this study reached 34 546 m3 s 1 after a 32 day rising limb in the summer of 2017 the event was a result of multiple days of heavy precipitation upstream in the mid western united states despite several periods of elevated river discharge during the study period multiple samples were collected at lower river discharge reaching as low as 5923 m3 s 1 in october 2017 river discharge tended to be lowest during late fall months water

temperature variation mirrored typical seasonal atmospheric temperatures fig 3 a specific conductance averaged 404 µs cm 1 70 and had a strong inverse relationship with river discharge fig 3b table 1 dissolved oxygen varied greatly during the study period fig 3c averaging 8 15 mg l 1 2 94 and demonstrated a strong inverse relationship with water temperature river water at baton rouge showed moderate variation in ph 7 60 0 34 fig 3d and turbidity 71 45 ntus the latter of which tended to be highest on the initial rising limb of high water events and lowest while discharge was at its peak fig 3e the river water showed an average cyanobacteria fluorescence value of 66 afus 23 and an average chlorophyll a fluorescence of 179 afus 70 fig 3f cdom fluorescence averaged 59 afus 7 3 2 doc and dic concentrations river water of the lower mississippi at baton rouge showed a discharge weighted mean doc concentration of 604 µmol l 1 158 during the study period concentrations of doc had a large range 354 1175 µmol l 1 with the highest measurements during the wet season fig 4 a however no statistically significant relationship existed between doc concentrations and river discharge consequently doc concentrations showed no clear response during the 2017 flood pulse supplementary material 1 the two highest doc concentrations recorded during the study period 1175 and 969 µmol l 1 occurred following local precipitation events in early summer likely due to localized surface runoff carbon 13 values of doc ranged between 30 51 and 27 14 with a discharge weighted average of 28 20 0 76 during the study period fig 4b measurements of δ13cdoc correlated inversely with doc concentrations table 1 resulting in a similar but non distinguishable variation during the study period dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations had a discharge weighted average of 1782 µmol l 1 585 over the study period fig 4a concentrations of dic had a strong inverse relationship with river discharge fig 5 a resulting in significantly lower concentrations during the wet season months p 0 0067 lowest dic measurements of 797 µmol l 1 occurred in april 2018 and the highest 3451 µmol l 1 were collected in december 2016 the discharge dilution effect resulted in 580 µmol l 1 decrease in dic concentrations over the rising limb of the flood supplementary material 1 concentrations rose slowly over the crest and falling limb however were still 390 µmol l 1 less than pre flood concentrations positive relationships were also found between dic concentration and specific conductance and ph which both had inverse correlations with river discharge table 1 carbon 13 measurements of dic had a discharge weighted average of 12 17 0 94 with a large range fig 4b the most enriched δ13cdic sample 9 84 did correspond with the most concentrated dic sample however no relationship was found between dic concentration and its respective stable isotope a strong negative relationship was found between δ13cdic and discharge fig 5b consequently stable isotope measurements were significantly more depleted during the wet season p 0 0107 the lowest recorded isotope values during the study period occurred during the rising limb of the flood yet by the end of the flood dic isotope values had returned to levels similar to prior flood values showing a quicker recovery response than dic concentrations supplementary material 1 stable isotope measurements also related to specific conductance and dissolved oxygen 3 3 partial pressure of dissolved co2 partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge showed a discharge weighted mean of 1500 µatm 743 between december 2015 and september 2018 river water was constantly supersaturated with pco2 i e greater than 400 µatm during all measurements pco2 measurements varied greatly in the river ranging as high as 3961 µatm following the 2017 summer flood pulse and as low as 526 µatm in april 2016 wet season pco2 values were on average 805 µatm higher than the dry season and a significant p 0 0364 difference was found between seasons using wilcox non parametric one way comparison of means test significant linear relationships were found between pco2 and river discharge and river water temperature fig 6 a and b during the flood pulse pco2 more than doubled over the rising limb of the flood and gradually dropped over the crest and falling limb supplementary material 1 no pco2 measurements were conducted during july september 2017 due to technical issues with the c sense sampling probe 3 4 dissolved carbon mass exports from 2015 to 2018 doc exports from the lower mississippi river to the northern gulf of mexico averaged 3 95 tg yr 1 table 2 approximately three quarters of the total doc load 2 95 tg was exported during the wet season i e january july this ratio was consistent with river discharge where 73 of the total annual river discharge occurred during the wet season monthly loads of doc closely followed the monthly temporal trend of river discharge supplementary material 2 dividing the annual doc export by the drainage area of the mississippi river main channel above the baton rouge site 2 915 834 km2 produces a basin doc flux of 1 4 g doc c m 2 it is to note that about 25 of the mississippi river s water is diverted into the atchafalaya river about 140 km upstream of baton rouge hence the actual doc flux from the mississippi basin should be higher on average the mississippi river at baton rouge discharged 12 25 tg dic each year into the northern gulf of mexico which is three times that of the average annual doc export two third of the average annual dic export 8 22 tg occurred during the wet season slightly less than that of river discharge in total the mississippi river delivered 16 20 tg of dissolved carbon to the northern gulf of mexico annually with a basin flux rate of 4 2 g dic c m 2 on average the mississippi river at baton rouge outgassed 654 g c m 2 into the atmosphere annually approximately 70 of co2 outgassed 457 g c m 2 occurred during the wet season monthly outgassing of co2 from river water of the lower mississippi at baton rouge showed a much larger variation than doc and dic monthly exports supplementary material 2 in general monthly outgassing rates followed that of river discharge with the exception of april and august where rates were much lower proportional to monthly discharge the low rate in april can likely be explained by the lowest pco2 value collected in april 2016 526 µatm drawing down the monthly outgassing drawing down the average the reason for such a lower pco2 value could not be specifically identified therefore this potential outlier was not removed only one pco2 sample was collected in august 2018 while river discharge was very low following a small pulse on the hydrograph fig 2 consequently pco2 in the river was very low resulting in a low outgassing rate in august multiplying the annual outgassing rates with a surface area of the lower mississippi river from baton rouge to its gulf outlet head of the passes 298 687 907 m2 we estimated the mississippi outgasses 195 gg c yr 1 into the atmosphere in its final 368 river kilometer reach before emptying into the gulf of mexico 4 discussion 4 1 effects of greater temperature and discharge on doc average concentrations of doc in the mississippi at baton rouge during the study period were between 115 and 308 µmol l 1 higher than past studies with a much greater variation than previously reported table 3 air temperature has continued to increase in each of the mississippi s tributary basins over the last 20 years with even larger increases during the growing season months fig 7 average annual air temperature in the mississippi s sub basins between 2015 and 2017 were 0 2 0 4 c warmer than their respective 5 year average ten years ago during the cai et al 2015 and shen et al 2012 studies and 0 8 1 1 c warmer than twenty years ago during bianchi s et al s study table 4 with a significant p 0 0001 increase in average air temperatures basin wide over the 20 year period using a paired t test greater air temperatures increase soil temperatures zheng et al 1993 increasing soil mineralization resulting in greater production of doc in soils moore and dalva 2001 wallenstein and weintraub 2008 which can be laterally transported to rivers modeling work in the mississippi river basin strongly supports this theory as greater temperatures have shown to predict higher doc leaching to the river s tributaries tian et al 2015a resulting in higher concentrations discharge in the mississippi river has also increased largely namely 34 over the past 80 years fig 8 river discharge has been predicted to continue increasing by another 11 60 by the end of the 21st century tao et al 2014 our study found a continued increase in discharge with several high flow events during the past 41 months suggesting increased surface and subsurface runoff from the tributary basins though doc showed no significant relationship with discharge increased runoff volume can produce significant higher quantity of soil doc in headwater catchments as evidenced by others studies raymond and saiers 2010 inamdar et al 2011 models by both tian et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 suggest that significant doc leaching occurs in the river s headwater tributaries due to localized flooding therefore it is likely a combination of greater temperatures and precipitation in the mississippi s headwaters producing higher doc concentrations at the downstream study site during the study period average annual river discharge during the study period was greater than all recent doc export studies with the exception of ren et al 2015 which measured doc concentrations in the river s low salinity mixing zone on the gulf of mexico the elevated concentrations paired with unprecedented high annual discharge resulted in our annual doc load estimate of 3 95 tg c yr 1 between 0 85 and 2 44 tg c yr 1 27 162 higher than previously reported our significantly higher annual doc load estimates strongly support our initial hypothesis of increasing carbon exports while two studies duan et al 2013 cai et al 2015 in the lower reaches of the mississippi river have documented smaller variability in doc concentrations the large variation found in this study is more similar to that found by bianchi et al 2004 who attributed seasonal doc variability to the process of in situ co metabolism where an increase in more bioavailable doc to the river can cause a large increase in the remineralization of recalcitrant doc found in the river we should note that bianchi also collected doc samples from the tidal freshwater outlet of the river which could be subject to hydraulic pooling and significant biological processing as bianchi et al 2013 found in the mississippi river s coastal plume following a flood pulse on the river in 2011 while the co metabolism hypothesis cannot be directly tested in this study analysis of our pco2 data see next section reveals the importance of in situ biological processes in the lower reach of this large river riverine organic material variability has also been attributed to seasonal climate soil temperature and discharge variability köhler et al 2008 hytteborn et al 2015 noacco et al 2018 from a modeling study tian et al 2015a concluded that climate variability and flood drought cycles strongly regulate seasonal variability in doc export from the mississippi a substantial increase in doc export over the past 130 years in the thames river the longest riverine doc records in the world was also paired with a greater variation in doc in the recent decades noacco et al 2018 a recent study yigzaw and hossain 2016 reported that many tributary watersheds within the mississippi river basin experienced rapid urbanization in the past two decades it is not clear if the urban development has increased dissolved carbon discharge from wastewater treatments studies on discharge of carbon from households are needed to analyze individual contributions of environmental and anthropogenic factor to riverine doc increase nonetheless the large discrepancy in seasonal variation between studies yet consistent disconnect between doc concentrations and discharge highlight the need for further research into the factors influencing doc export from large river systems 4 2 variability of pco2 and co2 outgassing this study is among the very few studies to have actually measured pco2 of rivers longer than two years it is also the first attempt to analyze seasonal trends of dissolved co2 in the main stem of the lower mississippi river as may previous studies have focused on louisiana s coastal shelf green et al 2006 bianchi et al 2013 the findings gained not only help improve the current co2 evasion estimation from global rivers but also provide important insights into the physical and biogeochemical factors driving riverine co2 outgassing variation the relationships found between pco2 and several ambient water parameters suggest a combination of hydrologic and biological controls on seasonality in co2 outgassing concurrently pco2 showed an inverse relationship with δ13cdic fig 9 indicating significant inputs of co2 sourced from organic materials rather than from the atmosphere while this relationship is clear and statistically significant the weak correlation suggests that organic inputs are not the exclusive inputs of pco2 the riverine carbon cycle is a highly dynamic environment with varying source and sink processes occurring concurrently richey 2003 making it difficult to constrain precise sources though a seasonal dominance of biogenic derived riverine pco2 is consistent with findings in the amazon richey 2003 sawakuchi et al 2017 and yellow rivers ran et al 2015 all pco2 measurements across all seasons were supersaturated in pco2 with respect to the atmosphere 400 µatm confirming that atmospheric inputs are at most minimal due to the air water co2 pressure gradient backwardstepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that a combination of river temperature and discharge was able to explain 63 of pco2 variation demonstrating a positive relationship with both variables table 5 consequently pco2 tended to be highest in the warm early summer months following the annual spring discharge flush such a similar seasonal pco2 trend has been also found in several large rivers around the world raymond et al 1997 wang et al 2007 ran et al 2015 sawakuchi et al 2017 there are two possible reasons explaining the trend 1 an increase in net heterotrophy because of higher temperature and or 2 an increase in soil pore water co2 into the river channel because of increased mineralization and leaching of soil organic matter first warm summer temperatures paired with lower turbidity levels following the rising river discharge in spring results in an aquatic environment conducive of biological processing the increase in pco2 under these conditions suggests that the lower mississippi river is a heterotrophic system over a two year study on the lower mississippi river s aquatic metabolism dodds et al 2013 concluded the mississippi is an unequivocally heterotrophic system especially in summer months they also found a strong relationship between respiration and river discharge which they hypothesized was due to an increase in more biologically available carbon in the river as discharge increases dodd s findings are consistent with bianchi s et al 2013 noting an increasing in doc export and biological production of co2 along louisiana s coast following flooding though doc concentrations followed no direct relationship with discharge in this study shen et al 2012 found that the composition of organic material in the lower mississippi river does vary with discharge pco2 s inverse relationships with dissolved oxygen ph and chlorophyll a fluorescence table 1 further supports the dominance of in situ respiration of organic matter as a driver of pco2 a second potential explanation is driven by river hydrology as much as 50 of riverine pco2 is sourced from washing in of pco2 dissolved in soil pore water as a byproduct of organic matter decomposition in stream decomposition of organic matter and root respiration richey et al 2002 as a result pco2 dynamics in rivers closely reflect soil pore pco2 dynamics within the catchment they drain hope et al 2004 a number of studies have shown that soil pco2 is positively correlated to seasonal changes in atmospheric temperature soil temperature and precipitation e g davidson et al 2000 hope et al 2004 jassal et al 2004 where warm wet soils result in soil co2 concentrations generally much greater than atmospheric pco2 borken et al 1999 finlay 2003 draining of highly co2 enriched soil pore waters via baseflow and interflow in early summer may have resulted in high concentrations of mississippi river pco2 moving into winter months discharge water temperatures and biological processing are all low dodds et al 2013 resulting in less co2 inputs all while pco2 is gradually lost to atmosphere via outgassing producing more enriched δ13cdic values highly co2 enriched groundwater has also recently shown to significantly contribute to co2 outgassing in tropical rivers duvert et al 2019 unfortunately stable isotopes and ambient water data alone cannot decipher which process is driving the pco2 variation though it is likely a combination of processes as has been also suggested in the amazon and yangtze rivers mayorga et al 2005 ran et al 2017 only one past study has reported pco2 in the lower most main channel of the mississippi river which calculated pco2 utilizing monthly to bi monthly ph temperature and alkalinity measurements from may 2000 to may 2001 dubois et al 2010 our pco2 measurements in the present study were on average 138 µatm higher with a drastically greater variation than those calculated by dubois et al 2010 for the river at st francisville la 57 river kilometers upstream 20 years ago the higher pco2 in the lower mississippi river was very likely driven by the greater temperatures and discharge during this study period promoting production and dissolution of soil co2 or a greater flushing of organic material upstream which is mineralized in transit dubois s temperature measurements include the atchafalaya and arkansas river s temperatures therefore we could not directly compare temperature results though river water temperatures at baton rouge during the study period were 1 c higher than the average over the prior fourteen years and annual river discharge during the study period averaged 174 km3 greater than in 2000 2001 table 3 our study also showed a much greater variation in pco2 when compared with those reported by dubois et al which can be attributed to one or a combination of the following 1 the lack of ph variation reported in the river by dubois 7 6 0 1 which is one of the most sensitive variables in calculating pco2 using henry s law 2 the limited data collected by dubois and 3 the large range of discharge in this study despite greater pco2 values the annual outgassing rate calculated in this study was 382 g c less than previously reported at st francisville likely due to differing methods as it is unclear the calculation dubois use for their annual outgassing estimate we advocate calculating annual outgassing using average monthly fco2 estimates accurately captures seasonal variation these differences highlight the need for future studies utilizing high resolution measurements of in stream and atmospheric co2 to most accurately quantify annual co2 fluxes and variability from the lower reaches of the mississippi river 4 3 isotopic signature for dissolved carbon stable isotopic signature of dic during the study period had a significant inverse relationship with discharge fig 5b this relationship resulted in significantly more depleted δ13cdic values during the wet season p 0 0107 and an average value 2 2 4 7 lower than that reported by cai et al 2015 and dubois et al 2010 due to the significantly greater discharge during the study period table 3 the depletion of δ13cdic values is indicative of an increase in dic derived from the respiration of organic material as co2 produced from respiration will have an isotopic value reflecting that of its source organic material the theoretical value of organic material across the basin is 23 5 dubois et al 2010 based on a 73 27 relative distribution of c3 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 mayorga et al 2005 attributed highly depleted δ13cdic values in the amazon river to flushing of terrestrially produced soil co2 and or the autochthonous respiration of plentiful organic material in the water column this theory is further reflected in the convergence of doc and dic isotope values with increasing river discharge fig 10 similar to that found by cai et al s study and the relationship between discharge and pco2 previously discussed concentrations of dic were on average 638 µmol l 1 lower than those reported by cai et al 2015 over a decade ago and over 400 µmol l 1 lower than the average bicarbonate concentration in the river between 1980 and 2005 raymond et al 2008 likely owing to a dilution effect in dissolved ions aucour et al 1999 chen et al 2002 finlay 2003 raymond et al 2004 guo et al 2010 khadka et al 2014 i the dilution effect was strong enough to result in 5 lower proportion of the dic loads transported during the wet season than cai et al 2015 lower concentrations during the study period produced an annual dic load estimate 1 3 tg 10 lower than that reported more than a decade ago despite an average annual discharge 91 km3 20 greater to our surprise our findings on dic loads appear contradictory to the recent model prediction by ren et al 2015 that dic loads in the mississippi river would increase due to climate change our findings indicate that an increase in discharge does not necessarily correlate with an increase in dic export however it can significantly alter the carbon 13 composition of riverine dic signifying a shift in source of dic to the river changes of dic speciation in large rivers could significantly influence carbon dynamics in end member coastal systems and is a hypothesis that requires further investigation 4 4 implications for future dissolved carbon transport in rivers the findings of this study have crucial implications for the future river export of dissolved carbon under global climate change in the mississippi river and relative contribution of terrestrial carbon to the global carbon budget warmer temperatures and increases in precipitation have been projected for the mississippi river basin throughout this century these are very likely to continue accelerating terrestrial biogeochemical processes resulting in an increase in soil doc production and leaching tian et al 2015a oxidation of organic material producing co2 hope et al 2004 falkowski and raven 2007 and mineral weathering rates releasing bicarbonate berner et al 1983 lasaga et al 1994 consequently recent modeling efforts predict large increases in both doc and dic over the next century ren et al 2015 ren et al 2016 the large increases in pco2 and doc export and changes in dic composition variability under greater river discharge and air temperatures over recent years strongly align with ren et al s 2015 model predictions indicating the mississippi s response to the changing climate in the river basin the increase in riverine carbon exports will likely have consequences to their receiving estuaries and the atmosphere canuel et al 2012 increases in doc export to the coast will provide more nutrients available for incorporation into biological food webs and oxidation which in turn would also increase co2 fluxes from the northern gulf of mexico greater export of pco2 to the river will inevitably result in a greater flux of co2 to atmosphere if not balanced by rises in atmospheric co2 in our current study of the 2019 mississippi river unprecedented flood on pco2 we recorded much higher values over the summer months 2800 4000 µatm unpublished data when compared to those found in this study 1500 743 µatm however our dic loading findings appear to be contradictory to recent model predictions that dic fluxes will continue increasing in the mississippi river due to climate change ren et al 2015 the dilution effect on dic concentrations due an increase in discharge appears to overpower the large fluxes of water resulting in lower dic loads despite the potential increases in chemical weathering climate change is also expected to bring not only more precipitation but more frequent heavy precipitation events melillo et al 2014 similar to what was found in this study which could further increase doc leaching and co2 outgassing in the upper reaches of the basin due to localized flooding ren et al 2016 khadka et al 2014 it is also believed that human alteration of the natural landscape through changes in land use and land management practices and urbanization have and will continue to significantly altered the global cycle of carbon between land aquatic environmental and the atmosphere regnier et al 2013 butman et al 2014 nonetheless it is apparent that an increase in both river discharge and temperature can produce noticeable effects on carbon transport in the mississippi river as well as other river basins under a similar climate changing trend globally 5 conclusions this study monitored dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations carbon 13 stable isotopes and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge from may 2015 to september 2018 providing a needed update on estimated dissolved carbon fluxes and co2 outgassing in the world s fourth largest river basin this study presents one of the largest timeseries data sets including both organic and inorganic carbon data on the lower mississippi in recent years allowing for a comprehensive analysis of seasonal trends and the physical and biogeochemical controls on their export in the lower reaches of a large sub tropical river we found considerably higher doc concentrations 607 158 µmol l 1 in the past 41 months when compared to those reported 5 15 years ago 296 489 µmol l 1 reflective of the increase in air and water temperatures in the mississippi river basin the higher doc concentration also paired with higher river flow in recent years resulting in a much greater annual export of total dissolved carbon 16 2 tg c from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico than those collected by cai et al 2015 seven years ago 15 5 tg c partial pressure of co2 in the river was also elevated during the study period 1500 743 µatm compared to the only previous pco2 study on the river and its tributaries 15 years prior which was conducted at near neutral ph 1335 129 µatm dubois et al 2010 seasonal pco2 variation was strongly predicted by river temperature and discharge with carbon 13 isotope composition suggesting a significant contribution of organic matter to the riverine pco2 pool high pco2 resulted in a large quantity of carbon released annually from the last 368 km of the mississippi into the atmosphere i e 195 gg c yr 1 demonstrating the importance of quantifying co2 outgassing in the low reaches of the world s rivers while dic loads showed no increase compared to years past stable isotopic signatures of dic revealed a substantially greater contribution of organic matter on the dic pool due to the elevated discharge and temperatures as atmospheric temperatures precipitation river discharge and flooding events are expected to increase across the 21st century we have shown that riverine carbon exports to coastal environments and into the atmosphere will also increase considerably in the future shifting the balance of riverine and coastal carbon cycles additionally many tributary watersheds within the mississippi river basin experienced rapid urbanization in the past two decades and the trend will likely remain studies on carbon discharge from sewage effluents and industrial wastewaters across the mississippi river basin are needed to discern how population growth play a role in riverine doc the information can help analyze individual

6167,air temperatures precipitation and river discharge have been steadily increasing in many river basins over the last century this is especially the case with north america s largest river basin the 3 2 million km2 mississippi river basin which comprises over 41 of the total land surface area in the contiguous usa yet we lack an understanding of how these changes will influence the export of terrigenous carbon through river systems into coastal waters and the atmosphere this study investigated concentrations and mass fluxes of doc dic and co2 during 2015 2018 in the lower mississippi river we found an annual riverine export of 3 95 tg c and 12 25 tg c for doc and dic into the gulf of mexico with 75 and 67 of their respective loads discharged during the wet season from january through july the riverine mass exports represent a flux rate of 1 4 g doc c m 2 and 4 2 g dic c 2 from the mississippi river basin which are considerably higher than those reported for other river basins surface water of the lower mississippi river was constantly supersaturated by dissolved co2 with its partial pressure pco2 ranging from 526 to 3961 µatm and an average outgassing rate of 654 g c m 2 yr 1 export of doc and pco2 measurements were substantially greater than estimates reported over ten years prior accompanied by significant increases in river discharge and air temperatures these findings strongly suggest that doc and co2 fluxes from the mississippi river basin into coastal waters and the atmosphere will very likely increase in the future due to increasing biological productivity and subsequent carbon export to rivers under increasing discharge and air temperatures keywords dissolved organic carbon dissolved inorganic carbon co2 outgassing delta c 13 climate change mississippi river 1 introduction terrestrial carbon export from river systems to estuarine and marine environments is a crucial component of the global carbon cycle carbon can be exported in both particulate e g organic debris and sediment bound matter and dissolved forms e g dissolved organic and inorganic carbons the latter of which is much more challenging to quantify especially in the longer term most recent global estimates of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon exports doc 199 360 tg yr 1 and dissolved inorganic carbon exports dic 381 410 tg yr 1 are both higher than estimates for particulate organic carbon exports poc 179 240 tg yr 1 and particulate inorganic carbon exports pic 170 tg yr 1 meybeck 1982 1992 hedges and keil 1995 aitkenhead and mcdowell 2000 li et al 2017 demonstrating the importance of accurately quantifying dissolved carbon export in global carbon accounting different dic species are utilized by phytoplankton and aquatic plants through photosynthesis while consumption and oxidation of doc is vital to the life cycle of aquatic organisms in both riverine and estuarine environments hope et al 1994 raymond and bauer 2001 for these reasons studying the transport and transformation of dissolved carbon in river systems is of great importance rivers not only transport carbon from land to ocean but can also release carbon into the atmosphere through a process known as carbon dioxide co2 outgassing in large rivers this phenomenon has been primarily attributed to an oversaturation of dissolved co2 in the water column in response to respiration of organic carbon and aquatic metabolism over powering in stream gross primary production richey 2003 however more recent research by duvert et al 2019 found ground water co2 input rates to streams can match and even exceed co2 outgassing rates many of the world s largest rivers function as a source of co2 to the atmosphere butman and raymond 2011 li et al 2013 sawakuchi et al 2017 resulting in a large global river co2 flux to the atmosphere between 230 and 1800 tg each year cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 regnier et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 far greater than particulate carbon exports the large variation in global outgassing estimates stems not only from differing methods in outgassing calculations but also from limited spatiotemporal data availability as more research is showing that the partial pressure of co2 pco2 in rivers can vary spatially liu et al 2017 ran et al 2017 and temporally lynch et al 2010 ran et al 2015 reiman and xu 2019 due to land use lithology and seasonal variation in hydrologic inputs and biological processing long term high resolution data is beneficial in constraining uncertainties in river carbon accounting draining approximately 41 of the continental u s and discharging approximately 680 km3 of water annually into the gulf of mexico xu and delduco 2017 the mississippi atchafalaya river system is the largest river system in north america the flow volume represents 2 of the total global export of freshwater to oceans dai and trenberth 2002 despite the relevance of such a large river in regional and global carbon budgets few studies have analyzed both doc and dic transport in the lower reaches of the mississippi river s main channel furthermore existing studies are short term in nature with limited temporal data requiring interpretation of carbon dynamics over seasons and years studies by bianchi et al 2004 dubois et al 2010 shen et al 2012 and cai et al 2015 reported annual doc from the lower mississippi between 1 5 and 3 1 tg while cai 2003 cai et al 2015 estimated an annual dic export of 13 6 tg these estimates represent as much as approximately 2 and 4 of global doc and dic exports one study dubois et al 2010 analyzed annual co2 outgassing in the lower reaches of the river s main channel which found an average pco2 value of 1362 µatm std dev 267 nearly 20 years ago this study estimated pco2 using river alkalinity and ph measurements however a recent pilot study on diel variation of co2 in the lower mississippi river by reiman and xu 2019 using in situ pco2 measurements found a 7 25 diel range of pco values causing significantly lower co2 outgassing rates during daylight hours indicating the potential of a large underestimation by dubois et al 2010 while these studies have been helpful in estimating carbon fluxes for this large river system the data are well over a decade old discharge in the mississippi river and atmospheric temperatures within the river basin have been steadily increasing over the past century zhang and schilling 2006 qian et al 2007 raymond et al 2008 a us epa study on river water temperature found that both monthly and annual average temperatures in the mississippi river basin have increased since 1950 especially in the past 10 years tang et al 2015 the study predicted that by the end of the 21st century river water temperatures of the mississippi river basin would increase by 1 8 c tang s prediction is well in agreement with the findings by melillo et al 2014 and van vliet et al 2013 that global air and water temperature are expected to see large increases in coming years concurrently a modeling study by tao et al 2014 has projected that the mississippi river discharge will continue increasing throughout the 21st century by 11 60 influenced by changes in climate and land use it is currently unclear how carbon export from the mississippi river will respond to these discharge and temperature changes in the future a comprehensive review by regnier et al 2013 declared that anthropogenic disturbance of natural lands has drastically altered the global flux of carbon from land to water and in turn the atmosphere a recent study using the world s longest record of doc concentrations 130 years from the thames river basin in united kingdom showed that 90 of the long term rise in riverine doc was caused by urban development noacco et al 2017 although such long term doc measurements do not exist for the mississippi river modeling work by tian et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 suggest that fluxes of doc in the mississippi may have increased by as much as 40 over the last 100 years primarily due to land use change and land management practices raymond et al 2008 also reported a large increase in bicarbonate concentrations and fluxes from the mississippi river over the 20th century and attributed it to agriculture drainage altering land use practices paired with an increase in soil liming the modeling work by ren et al 2015 predicts dic fluxes in the river will increase by as much as 65 in the next 100 years due to increasing precipitation discharge and atmosphere temperature soil carbon is highly sensitive to soil temperature and moisture borken et al 1999 therefore higher temperatures and precipitation can also result in higher soil respiration rates thus greater co2 production and doc leaching borken et al 2002 2004 under these predicted changes in river chemistry due to climate and land use changes an update on carbon dynamics in the mississippi river would 1 illuminate how dissolved carbon export has changed over the past decades 2 validate the former mentioned carbon cycle model predictions and 3 provide data necessary to improve future modeling efforts more specifically a longer term dissolved carbon dataset in the mississippi river would help in identifying the dominant physical and biogeochemical controls on dissolved carbon species in the mississippi river alluding to how carbon exports may continue to change with our rapidly changing climate with these motives in mind this study collected monthly water samples for analysis of doc and dic concentrations and their carbon 13 isotopes δ13c conducted instream measurements of pco2 and other ambient water parameters and quantified doc and dic fluxes and co2 outgassing in the lower mississippi river from may 2015 to september 2018 the primary objective of this study was to provide a much needed update on dissolved carbon dynamics and transport in this large river system under increasing discharge and temperatures by doing so this study tested the hypothesis that dissolved carbon loads in the lower mississippi river in recent years have increased beyond what was predicted in previous carbon models of the river system 2 material and methods 2 1 mississippi river basin and study site this study selected a single location on the mississippi river at baton rouge louisiana in the southern united states n 30 26 44 4 w 91 11 29 6 the same site studied by cai et al 2015 the site was approximately 368 river kilometers upstream of the river s outlet to the northern gulf of mexico fig 1 and 140 river kilometers downstream of the old river control structure in tarbert landing ms which diverts 25 of the discharge from the mississippi river west to form the atchafalaya river both daily discharge records and field data were collected at this location the study site was strategically selected for several reasons the river at the study location receives runoff from a land surface area of 2 915 834 km2 united states geological survey gauge 07374000 https waterdata usgs gov la nwis nwismap site no 07374000 agency cd usgs capturing drainage from nearly the entire basin making it an ideal location for quantifying total dissolved carbon export from the mississippi river basin additionally this site has no potential of salinity influence tidal interference or hydraulic pooling that could occur when sampling at the river s mouth as many previous studies have cai 2003 bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 lastly focusing field collection on one single site rather than across the basin enabled compilation of a large dataset for seasonal analysis the mississippi river drains land from part or all of 31 u s states and two canadian provinces and is the world s fourth largest river basin the basin is comprised of six tributary basins including the arkansas white red lower mississippi missouri ohio tennessee and upper mississippi due to the vast drainage area climate and land use are highly variable across the basin the northernmost reaches of the basin experience a temperate climate with warm summers cold extended winters and large amounts of snowmelt runoff in the spring climate becomes more sub tropical in the southern basin characterized by short mild winters paired with humid hot summer months the entire basin is generally described as humid and rainy with an annual average precipitation of 765 mm and an annual average air temperature of 13 c lakshmi et al 2018 land use in the mississippi river basin is highly heterogeneous however land use is slightly dominated by agriculture located

river within this sub basin alone upper mississippi river basin commission http www umrba org facts htm although no report exists on dissolved carbon from wastewater treatment plants in the mississippi river basin the quantity is likely to be substantial as treatment plants are not required to remove carbon from their effluent therefore discharges can contain a significant amount of dissolved organic carbon doc following primary and secondary treatment nishijima et al 2003 katsoyiannis and samara 2007 2 2 river water sampling and measurements water grab samples and field measurements were conducted monthly over a wide range of flow conditions between may 2015 to may 2016 and december 2016 to september 2018 in the lower mississippi river fig 2 thirty four out of thirty nine trips were conducted between 14 00 18 30 us central standard time cst additional field trips were conducted either weekly or bi weekly during a flood pulse between may and june 2017 to assess the influence of flood pulses on carbon transport and co2 outgassing all samples were collected in well flowing water at a depth of 30 50 cm below the surface from a publicly accessible boat ramp using a 3 7 meter aluminum pole with a high density polyethylene bottle hdpe attached to the end of the pole while in general water chemistry in large rivers like the mississippi is commonly considered well mixed because of the fast flow of the water a minimum of three samples were gathered and mixed to ensure a representative composite sample during each field trip samples were then distributed to their appropriate container samples for doc analysis were first stored in 250 ml hdpe bottles and filtered the same day into 60 ml hdpe bottles through a single use 0 2 µm nylon filter environmental express charleston sc usa samples for dissolved inorganic carbon dic analysis were collected in 20 ml glass vials filled with no headspace all water samples were stored in darkness on wet ice during transportation doc samples were frozen until analysis while dic samples were kept in a refrigerator all hdpe bottles were thoroughly acid washed prior to each field campaign duplicate dic and doc samples were gathered during each field trip for quality control purposes water samples for doc and dic analysis were not collected the last three months of sampling due to funding constraints

samples were analyzed for doc and dic concentrations and respective δ13c stable isotopic composition at the university of california davis stable isotope facility ucdsif https stableisotopefacility ucdavis edu within four months of sample collection water samples were shipped to ucdsif on ice samples of doc were analyzed using an o i analytical model 1030 toc analyzer xylem analytics college

standards on average yielded an error of less than 3 2 4 δ13c isotope analysis carbon 13 δ13c isotope values of doc and dic are expressed as deviations per mil from the international standard vienna peedee belemnite vpdb using the following formula δ 13 c r sample r standard 1 1000 where r is the ratio of 13c to 12c isotopes in the sample and the vpdb reference standard coplen 2011 stable isotopes of carbon have been used extensively to infer the processes controlling sources of carbon in aquatic systems raymond and bauer 2001 mayorga et al 2005 wu et al 2007 carbonate minerals have an isotopic composition near 0 while co2 produced from soil respiration is reflective of the source organic material which can range between 14 and 35 depending on photosynthetic pathway of the plant mook et al 1974 o leary 1988 therefore dic derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals by dissolved co2 will have an isotopic composition between these two values dubois et al 2010 calculated a theoretical δ13c value of bicarbonate in the mississippi river near 7 3 and theoretical value of organic material across the basin 23 5 based on a 73 27 relative distribution of c3 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 outgassing of co2 into the atmospheric can also enrich isotopic composition doctor et al 2008 identifying the specific process influencing carbon at a specific point in time is difficult due to the homogenous mixing nature of isotopes from source sink mechanisms however isotopes are helpful in tracking the changes in biogeochemical carbon processes temporally 2 5 doc and dic mass transport and co2 outgassing calculations a flow duration curve of average daily discharge in the mississippi river at baton rouge over the last 14 water years october 2003 september 2017 was compiled to group data into a wet and a dry season not shown all data in months where average daily discharge was greater than 50 exceedance probability 16 594 m3 s 1 were grouped as wet while all others were grouped as dry monthly average daily river discharge was greater than 50 exceedance probability during the months of january july therefore these months were classified as wet season while august december were classified as dry season monthly load estimates of doc and dic were calculated to estimate total annual loads of doc and dic using the following flow weighted equation l annual month q l daily q daily where lannual is the total annual load of doc or dic tg c yr 1 q is the average total discharge of each month between may 2015 to april 2018 km3 mo 1 ldaily is daily doc or dic load of samples collected in the respective month tg c d 1 and qdaily is the total daily discharge on days of sample collection in the respective month km3 d 1 the rate of co2 outgassing from the surface water to the atmosphere fco2 in g c m 2 d 1 for all samples was calculated using a well established equation published by cai and wang 1998 f co 2 k t k h pco 2 water pco 2 air where k t is a gas transfer coefficient m d 1 k h is a solubility constant mol l 1 atm pco2water and pco2air are the partial pressure of dissolved co2 in the water column and atmosphere µatm respectively a k t value of 3 9 m d 1 was used similar to the only previously pco2 study in the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 this gas transfer coefficient is much lower than the reported global average of rivers 5 7 m d 1 raymond et al 2013 and that reported of large low land river 4 3 m d 1 alin et al 2011 therefore our estimates likely represents a conservative estimate of co2 outgassing weiss 1974 developed the following equation used to calculate solubility constants lnk h a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 l n t 100 s b 1 b 2 t 100 b 3 t 100 2 where a1 58 0931 a2 90 5069 a3 22 2940 b1 0 027766 b2 0 025888 b3 0 0050578 t is the absolute temperature of water in kelvin and s is salinity an s of 0 was used for calculating kh as this portion of the mississippi river is entirely freshwater atmospheric partial pressure of co2 was fixed at 400 µatm for the study period based on noaa global monitoring division data monthly co2 outgassing rates were calculated by multiplying the average daily outgassing rate for each month with the number of days in each month g c m 2 mo 1 monthly co2 outgassing rates were then summed to obtain the annual flux of co2 to the atmosphere g c m 2 yr 1 it should be noted that our pilot study on diel fluctuation of co2 reiman and xu 2019 found that pco2 in the mississippi river showed a significant diurnal cycle in spring and summer months with lowest levels around 15 00 18 00 cst as the majority of samples were collected between 14 00 and 18 30 cst pco2 measurements and co2 outgassing calculations presented are likely very conservative estimates the surface area of the mississippi river between baton rouge la and its confluence with the northern gulf of mexico was calculated using aerial photographs in arcmap 10 3 the total annual co2 outgassing rate was multiplied by the identified surface area of the river 298 687 907 m2 to calculate the total amount of co2 outgassed between the study site and the northern gulf of mexico g c yr 1 2 6 statistical analysis all data were first tested for normality under the shapiro wilk test data not following a normal distribution were compared using a wilcox non parametric one way comparison of means normally distributed data were compared using student s unpaired and paired t test to avoid a potential skewing of data due to the disproportionate number of samples collected in may and june 2017 a single average of data collected in may 2017 and june 2017 was used to calculate annual discharge weighted averages and monthly loads and outgassing rates pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to explore relationships between all carbon ambient water chemistry and fluorescence data further linear regression analysis was used to more strongly confirm relationships between parameters a significance level of 0 05 was used for all statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using sas 9 4 software 3 results 3 1 discharge and ambient water parameters during the 41 months from may 2015 to september 2018 mississippi river discharge at baton rouge averaged 17 103 m3 s 1 std dev 7983 fig 2 11 higher than the average discharge

0001 116 river kilometers upstream of the sample site usace gauge 01100q annual discharge for each of the three study years was greater than the long term average annual discharge for the river five floods exceeding 30 000 m3 s 1 occurred during the 3 year study period with all except one occurring in spring or early summer months the flood pulse analyzed in this study reached 34 546 m3 s 1 after a 32 day rising limb in the summer of 2017 the event was a result of multiple days of heavy precipitation upstream in the mid western united states despite several periods of elevated river discharge during the study period multiple samples were collected at lower river discharge reaching as low as 5923 m3 s 1 in october 2017 river discharge tended to be lowest during late fall months water

temperature variation mirrored typical seasonal atmospheric temperatures fig 3 a specific conductance averaged 404 µs cm 1 70 and had a strong inverse relationship with river discharge fig 3b table 1 dissolved oxygen varied greatly during the study period fig 3c averaging 8 15 mg l 1 2 94 and demonstrated a strong inverse relationship with water temperature river water at baton rouge showed moderate variation in ph 7 60 0 34 fig 3d and turbidity 71 45 ntus the latter of which tended to be highest on the initial rising limb of high water events and lowest while discharge was at its peak fig 3e the river water showed an average cyanobacteria fluorescence value of 66 afus 23 and an average chlorophyll a fluorescence of 179 afus 70 fig 3f cdom fluorescence averaged 59 afus 7 3 2 doc and dic concentrations river water of the lower mississippi at baton rouge showed a discharge weighted mean doc concentration of 604 µmol l 1 158 during the study period concentrations of doc had a large range 354 1175 µmol l 1 with the highest measurements during the wet season fig 4 a however no statistically significant relationship existed between doc concentrations and river discharge consequently doc concentrations showed no clear response during the 2017 flood pulse supplementary material 1 the two highest doc concentrations recorded during the study period 1175 and 969 µmol l 1 occurred following local precipitation events in early summer likely due to localized surface runoff carbon 13 values of doc ranged between 30 51 and 27 14 with a discharge weighted average of 28 20 0 76 during the study period fig 4b measurements of δ13cdoc correlated inversely with doc concentrations table 1 resulting in a similar but non distinguishable variation during the study period dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations had a discharge weighted average of 1782 µmol l 1 585 over the study period fig 4a concentrations of dic had a strong inverse relationship with river discharge fig 5 a resulting in significantly lower concentrations during the wet season months p 0 0067 lowest dic measurements of 797 µmol l 1 occurred in april 2018 and the highest 3451 µmol l 1 were collected in december 2016 the discharge dilution effect resulted in 580 µmol l 1 decrease in dic concentrations over the rising limb of the flood supplementary material 1 concentrations rose slowly over the crest and falling limb however were still 390 µmol l 1 less than pre flood concentrations positive relationships were also found between dic concentration and specific conductance and ph which both had inverse correlations with river discharge table 1 carbon 13 measurements of dic had a discharge weighted average of 12 17 0 94 with a large range fig 4b the most enriched δ13cdic sample 9 84 did correspond with the most concentrated dic sample however no relationship was found between dic concentration and its respective stable isotope a strong negative relationship was found between δ13cdic and discharge fig 5b consequently stable isotope measurements were significantly more depleted during the wet season p 0 0107 the lowest recorded isotope values during the study period occurred during the rising limb of the flood yet by the end of the flood dic isotope values had returned to levels similar to prior flood values showing a quicker recovery response than dic concentrations supplementary material 1 stable isotope measurements also related to specific conductance and dissolved oxygen 3 3 partial pressure of dissolved co2 partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge showed a discharge weighted mean of 1500 µatm 743 between december 2015 and september 2018 river water was constantly supersaturated with pco2 i e greater than 400 µatm during all measurements pco2 measurements varied greatly in the river ranging as high as 3961 µatm following the 2017 summer flood pulse and as low as 526 µatm in april 2016 wet season pco2 values were on average 805 µatm higher than the dry season and a significant p 0 0364 difference was found between seasons using wilcox non parametric one way comparison of means test significant linear relationships were found between pco2 and river discharge and river water temperature fig 6 a and b during the flood pulse pco2 more than doubled over the rising limb of the flood and gradually dropped over the crest and falling limb supplementary material 1 no pco2 measurements were conducted during july september 2017 due to technical issues with the c sense sampling probe 3 4 dissolved carbon mass exports from 2015 to 2018 doc exports from the lower mississippi river to the northern gulf of mexico averaged 3 95 tg yr 1 table 2 approximately three quarters of the total doc load 2 95 tg was exported during the wet season i e january july this ratio was consistent with river discharge where 73 of the total annual river discharge occurred during the wet season monthly loads of doc closely followed the monthly temporal trend of river discharge supplementary material 2 dividing the annual doc export by the drainage area of the mississippi river main channel above the baton rouge site 2 915 834 km2 produces a basin doc flux of 1 4 g doc c m 2 it is to note that about 25 of the mississippi river s water is diverted into the atchafalaya river about 140 km upstream of baton rouge hence the actual doc flux from the mississippi basin should be higher on average the mississippi river at baton rouge discharged 12 25 tg dic each year into the northern gulf of mexico which is three times that of the average annual doc export two third of the average annual dic export 8 22 tg occurred during the wet season slightly less than that of river discharge in total the mississippi river delivered 16 20 tg of dissolved carbon to the northern gulf of mexico annually with a basin flux rate of 4 2 g dic c m 2 on average the mississippi river at baton rouge outgassed 654 g c m 2 into the atmosphere annually approximately 70 of co2 outgassed 457 g c m 2 occurred during the wet season monthly outgassing of co2 from river water of the lower mississippi at baton rouge showed a much larger variation than doc and dic monthly exports supplementary material 2 in general monthly outgassing rates followed that of river discharge with the exception of april and august where rates were much lower proportional to monthly discharge the low rate in april can likely be explained by the lowest pco2 value collected in april 2016 526 µatm drawing down the monthly outgassing drawing down the average the reason for such a lower pco2 value could not be specifically identified therefore this potential outlier was not removed only one pco2 sample was collected in august 2018 while river discharge was very low following a small pulse on the hydrograph fig 2 consequently pco2 in the river was very low resulting in a low outgassing rate in august multiplying the annual outgassing rates with a surface area of the lower mississippi river from baton rouge to its gulf outlet head of the passes 298 687 907 m2 we estimated the mississippi outgasses 195 gg c yr 1 into the atmosphere in its final 368 river kilometer reach before emptying into the gulf of mexico 4 discussion 4 1 effects of greater temperature and discharge on doc average concentrations of doc in the mississippi at baton rouge during the study period were between 115 and 308 µmol l 1 higher than past studies with a much greater variation than previously reported table 3 air temperature has continued to increase in each of the mississippi s tributary basins over the last 20 years with even larger increases during the growing season months fig 7 average annual air temperature in the mississippi s sub basins between 2015 and 2017 were 0 2 0 4 c warmer than their respective 5 year average ten years ago during the cai et al 2015 and shen et al 2012 studies and 0 8 1 1 c warmer than twenty years ago during bianchi s et al s study table 4 with a significant p 0 0001 increase in average air temperatures basin wide over the 20 year period using a paired t test greater air temperatures increase soil temperatures zheng et al 1993 increasing soil mineralization resulting in greater production of doc in soils moore and dalva 2001 wallenstein and weintraub 2008 which can be laterally transported to rivers modeling work in the mississippi river basin strongly supports this theory as greater temperatures have shown to predict higher doc leaching to the river s tributaries tian et al 2015a resulting in higher concentrations discharge in the mississippi river has also increased largely namely 34 over the past 80 years fig 8 river discharge has been predicted to continue increasing by another 11 60 by the end of the 21st century tao et al 2014 our study found a continued increase in discharge with several high flow events during the past 41 months suggesting increased surface and subsurface runoff from the tributary basins though doc showed no significant relationship with discharge increased runoff volume can produce significant higher quantity of soil doc in headwater catchments as evidenced by others studies raymond and saiers 2010 inamdar et al 2011 models by both tian et al 2015a and ren et al 2016 suggest that significant doc leaching occurs in the river s headwater tributaries due to localized flooding therefore it is likely a combination of greater temperatures and precipitation in the mississippi s headwaters producing higher doc concentrations at the downstream study site during the study period average annual river discharge during the study period was greater than all recent doc export studies with the exception of ren et al 2015 which measured doc concentrations in the river s low salinity mixing zone on the gulf of mexico the elevated concentrations paired with unprecedented high annual discharge resulted in our annual doc load estimate of 3 95 tg c yr 1 between 0 85 and 2 44 tg c yr 1 27 162 higher than previously reported our significantly higher annual doc load estimates strongly support our initial hypothesis of increasing carbon exports while two studies duan et al 2013 cai et al 2015 in the lower reaches of the mississippi river have documented smaller variability in doc concentrations the large variation found in this study is more similar to that found by bianchi et al 2004 who attributed seasonal doc variability to the process of in situ co metabolism where an increase in more bioavailable doc to the river can cause a large increase in the remineralization of recalcitrant doc found in the river we should note that bianchi also collected doc samples from the tidal freshwater outlet of the river which could be subject to hydraulic pooling and significant biological processing as bianchi et al 2013 found in the mississippi river s coastal plume following a flood pulse on the river in 2011 while the co metabolism hypothesis cannot be directly tested in this study analysis of our pco2 data see next section reveals the importance of in situ biological processes in the lower reach of this large river riverine organic material variability has also been attributed to seasonal climate soil temperature and discharge variability köhler et al 2008 hytteborn et al 2015 noacco et al 2018 from a modeling study tian et al 2015a concluded that climate variability and flood drought cycles strongly regulate seasonal variability in doc export from the mississippi a substantial increase in doc export over the past 130 years in the thames river the longest riverine doc records in the world was also paired with a greater variation in doc in the recent decades noacco et al 2018 a recent study yigzaw and hossain 2016 reported that many tributary watersheds within the mississippi river basin experienced rapid urbanization in the past two decades it is not clear if the urban development has increased dissolved carbon discharge from wastewater treatments studies on discharge of carbon from households are needed to analyze individual contributions of environmental and anthropogenic factor to riverine doc increase nonetheless the large discrepancy in seasonal variation between studies yet consistent disconnect between doc concentrations and discharge highlight the need for further research into the factors influencing doc export from large river systems 4 2 variability of pco2 and co2 outgassing this study is among the very few studies to have actually measured pco2 of rivers longer than two years it is also the first attempt to analyze seasonal trends of dissolved co2 in the main stem of the lower mississippi river as may previous studies have focused on louisiana s coastal shelf green et al 2006 bianchi et al 2013 the findings gained not only help improve the current co2 evasion estimation from global rivers but also provide important insights into the physical and biogeochemical factors driving riverine co2 outgassing variation the relationships found between pco2 and several ambient water parameters suggest a combination of hydrologic and biological controls on seasonality in co2 outgassing concurrently pco2 showed an inverse relationship with δ13cdic fig 9 indicating significant inputs of co2 sourced from organic materials rather than from the atmosphere while this relationship is clear and statistically significant the weak correlation suggests that organic inputs are not the exclusive inputs of pco2 the riverine carbon cycle is a highly dynamic environment with varying source and sink processes occurring concurrently richey 2003 making it difficult to constrain precise sources though a seasonal dominance of biogenic derived riverine pco2 is consistent with findings in the amazon richey 2003 sawakuchi et al 2017 and yellow rivers ran et al 2015 all pco2 measurements across all seasons were supersaturated in pco2 with respect to the atmosphere 400 µatm confirming that atmospheric inputs are at most minimal due to the air water co2 pressure gradient backwardstepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that a combination of river temperature and discharge was able to explain 63 of pco2 variation demonstrating a positive relationship with both variables table 5 consequently pco2 tended to be highest in the warm early summer months following the annual spring discharge flush such a similar seasonal pco2 trend has been also found in several large rivers around the world raymond et al 1997 wang et al 2007 ran et al 2015 sawakuchi et al 2017 there are two possible reasons explaining the trend 1 an increase in net heterotrophy because of higher temperature and or 2 an increase in soil pore water co2 into the river channel because of increased mineralization and leaching of soil organic matter first warm summer temperatures paired with lower turbidity levels following the rising river discharge in spring results in an aquatic environment conducive of biological processing the increase in pco2 under these conditions suggests that the lower mississippi river is a heterotrophic system over a two year study on the lower mississippi river s aquatic metabolism dodds et al 2013 concluded the mississippi is an unequivocally heterotrophic system especially in summer months they also found a strong relationship between respiration and river discharge which they hypothesized was due to an increase in more biologically available carbon in the river as discharge increases dodd s findings are consistent with bianchi s et al 2013 noting an increasing in doc export and biological production of co2 along louisiana s coast following flooding though doc concentrations followed no direct relationship with discharge in this study shen et al 2012 found that the composition of organic material in the lower mississippi river does vary with discharge pco2 s inverse relationships with dissolved oxygen ph and chlorophyll a fluorescence table 1 further supports the dominance of in situ respiration of organic matter as a driver of pco2 a second potential explanation is driven by river hydrology as much as 50 of riverine pco2 is sourced from washing in of pco2 dissolved in soil pore water as a byproduct of organic matter decomposition in stream decomposition of organic matter and root respiration richey et al 2002 as a result pco2 dynamics in rivers closely reflect soil pore pco2 dynamics within the catchment they drain hope et al 2004 a number of studies have shown that soil pco2 is positively correlated to seasonal changes in atmospheric temperature soil temperature and precipitation e g davidson et al 2000 hope et al 2004 jassal et al 2004 where warm wet soils result in soil co2 concentrations generally much greater than atmospheric pco2 borken et al 1999 finlay 2003 draining of highly co2 enriched soil pore waters via baseflow and interflow in early summer may have resulted in high concentrations of mississippi river pco2 moving into winter months discharge water temperatures and biological processing are all low dodds et al 2013 resulting in less co2 inputs all while pco2 is gradually lost to atmosphere via outgassing producing more enriched δ13cdic values highly co2 enriched groundwater has also recently shown to significantly contribute to co2 outgassing in tropical rivers duvert et al 2019 unfortunately stable isotopes and ambient water data alone cannot decipher which process is driving the pco2 variation though it is likely a combination of processes as has been also suggested in the amazon and yangtze rivers mayorga et al 2005 ran et al 2017 only one past study has reported pco2 in the lower most main channel of the mississippi river which calculated pco2 utilizing monthly to bi monthly ph temperature and alkalinity measurements from may 2000 to may 2001 dubois et al 2010 our pco2 measurements in the present study were on average 138 µatm higher with a drastically greater variation than those calculated by dubois et al 2010 for the river at st francisville la 57 river kilometers upstream 20 years ago the higher pco2 in the lower mississippi river was very likely driven by the greater temperatures and discharge during this study period promoting production and dissolution of soil co2 or a greater flushing of organic material upstream which is mineralized in transit dubois s temperature measurements include the atchafalaya and arkansas river s temperatures therefore we could not directly compare temperature results though river water temperatures at baton rouge during the study period were 1 c higher than the average over the prior fourteen years and annual river discharge during the study period averaged 174 km3 greater than in 2000 2001 table 3 our study also showed a much greater variation in pco2 when compared with those reported by dubois et al which can be attributed to one or a combination of the following 1 the lack of ph variation reported in the river by dubois 7 6 0 1 which is one of the most sensitive variables in calculating pco2 using henry s law 2 the limited data collected by dubois and 3 the large range of discharge in this study despite greater pco2 values the annual outgassing rate calculated in this study was 382 g c less than previously reported at st francisville likely due to differing methods as it is unclear the calculation dubois use for their annual outgassing estimate we advocate calculating annual outgassing using average monthly fco2 estimates accurately captures seasonal variation these differences highlight the need for future studies utilizing high resolution measurements of in stream and atmospheric co2 to most accurately quantify annual co2 fluxes and variability from the lower reaches of the mississippi river 4 3 isotopic signature for dissolved carbon stable isotopic signature of dic during the study period had a significant inverse relationship with discharge fig 5b this relationship resulted in significantly more depleted δ13cdic values during the wet season p 0 0107 and an average value 2 2 4 7 lower than that reported by cai et al 2015 and dubois et al 2010 due to the significantly greater discharge during the study period table 3 the depletion of δ13cdic values is indicative of an increase in dic derived from the respiration of organic material as co2 produced from respiration will have an isotopic value reflecting that of its source organic material the theoretical value of organic material across the basin is 23 5 dubois et al 2010 based on a 73 27 relative distribution of c3 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 mayorga et al 2005 attributed highly depleted δ13cdic values in the amazon river to flushing of terrestrially produced soil co2 and or the autochthonous respiration of plentiful organic material in the water column this theory is further reflected in the convergence of doc and dic isotope values with increasing river discharge fig 10 similar to that found by cai et al s study and the relationship between discharge and pco2 previously discussed concentrations of dic were on average 638 µmol l 1 lower than those reported by cai et al 2015 over a decade ago and over 400 µmol l 1 lower than the average bicarbonate concentration in the river between 1980 and 2005 raymond et al 2008 likely owing to a dilution effect in dissolved ions aucour et al 1999 chen et al 2002 finlay 2003 raymond et al 2004 guo et al 2010 khadka et al 2014 i the dilution effect was strong enough to result in 5 lower proportion of the dic loads transported during the wet season than cai et al 2015 lower concentrations during the study period produced an annual dic load estimate 1 3 tg 10 lower than that reported more than a decade ago despite an average annual discharge 91 km3 20 greater to our surprise our findings on dic loads appear contradictory to the recent model prediction by ren et al 2015 that dic loads in the mississippi river would increase due to climate change our findings indicate that an increase in discharge does not necessarily correlate with an increase in dic export however it can significantly alter the carbon 13 composition of riverine dic signifying a shift in source of dic to the river changes of dic speciation in large rivers could significantly influence carbon dynamics in end member coastal systems and is a hypothesis that requires further investigation 4 4 implications for future dissolved carbon transport in rivers the findings of this study have crucial implications for the future river export of dissolved carbon under global climate change in the mississippi river and relative contribution of terrestrial carbon to the global carbon budget warmer temperatures and increases in precipitation have been projected for the mississippi river basin throughout this century these are very likely to continue accelerating terrestrial biogeochemical processes resulting in an increase in soil doc production and leaching tian et al 2015a oxidation of organic material producing co2 hope et al 2004 falkowski and raven 2007 and mineral weathering rates releasing bicarbonate berner et al 1983 lasaga et al 1994 consequently recent modeling efforts predict large increases in both doc and dic over the next century ren et al 2015 ren et al 2016 the large increases in pco2 and doc export and changes in dic composition variability under greater river discharge and air temperatures over recent years strongly align with ren et al s 2015 model predictions indicating the mississippi s response to the changing climate in the river basin the increase in riverine carbon exports will likely have consequences to their receiving estuaries and the atmosphere canuel et al 2012 increases in doc export to the coast will provide more nutrients available for incorporation into biological food webs and oxidation which in turn would also increase co2 fluxes from the northern gulf of mexico greater export of pco2 to the river will inevitably result in a greater flux of co2 to atmosphere if not balanced by rises in atmospheric co2 in our current study of the 2019 mississippi river unprecedented flood on pco2 we recorded much higher values over the summer months 2800 4000 µatm unpublished data when compared to those found in this study 1500 743 µatm however our dic loading findings appear to be contradictory to recent model predictions that dic fluxes will continue increasing in the mississippi river due to climate change ren et al 2015 the dilution effect on dic concentrations due an increase in discharge appears to overpower the large fluxes of water resulting in lower dic loads despite the potential increases in chemical weathering climate change is also expected to bring not only more precipitation but more frequent heavy precipitation events melillo et al 2014 similar to what was found in this study which could further increase doc leaching and co2 outgassing in the upper reaches of the basin due to localized flooding ren et al 2016 khadka et al 2014 it is also believed that human alteration of the natural landscape through changes in land use and land management practices and urbanization have and will continue to significantly altered the global cycle of carbon between land aquatic environmental and the atmosphere regnier et al 2013 butman et al 2014 nonetheless it is apparent that an increase in both river discharge and temperature can produce noticeable effects on carbon transport in the mississippi river as well as other river basins under a similar climate changing trend globally 5 conclusions this study monitored dissolved organic and inorganic carbon concentrations carbon 13 stable isotopes and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge from may 2015 to september 2018 providing a needed update on estimated dissolved carbon fluxes and co2 outgassing in the world s fourth largest river basin this study presents one of the largest timeseries data sets including both organic and inorganic carbon data on the lower mississippi in recent years allowing for a comprehensive analysis of seasonal trends and the physical and biogeochemical controls on their export in the lower reaches of a large sub tropical river we found considerably higher doc concentrations 607 158 µmol l 1 in the past 41 months when compared to those reported 5 15 years ago 296 489 µmol l 1 reflective of the increase in air and water temperatures in the mississippi river basin the higher doc concentration also paired with higher river flow in recent years resulting in a much greater annual export of total dissolved carbon 16 2 tg c from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico than those collected by cai et al 2015 seven years ago 15 5 tg c partial pressure of co2 in the river was also elevated during the study period 1500 743 µatm compared to the only previous pco2 study on the river and its tributaries 15 years prior which was conducted at near neutral ph 1335 129 µatm dubois et al 2010 seasonal pco2 variation was strongly predicted by river temperature and discharge with carbon 13 isotope composition suggesting a significant contribution of organic matter to the riverine pco2 pool high pco2 resulted in a large quantity of carbon released annually from the last 368 km of the mississippi into the atmosphere i e 195 gg c yr 1 demonstrating the importance of quantifying co2 outgassing in the low reaches of the world s rivers while dic loads showed no increase compared to years past stable isotopic signatures of dic revealed a substantially greater contribution of organic matter on the dic pool due to the elevated discharge and temperatures as atmospheric temperatures precipitation river discharge and flooding events are expected to increase across the 21st century we have shown that riverine carbon exports to coastal environments and into the atmosphere will also increase considerably in the future shifting the balance of riverine and coastal carbon cycles additionally many tributary watersheds within the mississippi river basin experienced rapid urbanization in the past two decades and the trend will likely remain studies on carbon discharge from sewage effluents and industrial wastewaters across the mississippi river basin are needed to discern how population growth play a role in riverine doc the information can help analyze individual

6168,groundwater as an open access and a common pool resource cpr among several beneficiaries faces overexploitation especially in arid and semi arid regions to tackle such problems cooperative management method using game theory concepts could be considered as an effective approach in operating a cpr this study examines the effect of cooperation and internalization of environmental damages on managing the groundwater resources in namdan aquifer located in fars province iran for this purpose an evolutionary hydro economic simulation optimization model has been developed and various cooperation and environmental damages internalization scenarios have been considered to the study area over a planning horizon of 30 years continuous ant colony optimization caco algorithm which is an innovative application in this area of study has been applied to the simulation optimization model some cooperative game theory methods have been used to allocate the obtained net benefits the results indicate that under the full cooperation scenario the highest value of the sum of net benefits has been gained for any value of environmental damages moreover internalizing the environmental damages has caused increase in the sum of net benefits among all cooperation scenarios a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the effect of changing the environmental damages value and also the importance factor of extraction externalities the results of these analysis indicate that the cooperation conditions are independent of the value of environmental damages and also the intensity of extraction externalities the methodology presented in this study provides water resource managers with a cooperative management platform in order to evaluate the possibilities of sustainable development of groundwater resources in more realistic conditions the application of an efficient evolutionary algorithm provides a variety of realistic problems with an opportunity to overcome the

7 6 billion people in 2017 to 9 8 billion people in 2050 growing food demand development of agriculture urban expansion and advancement of industries and technologies will make human being more dependent on natural resources especially on water resources more than before madani and dinar 2012 un 2017 flörke et al 2018 this increase in water demands along with decrease in precipitation and surface flows imposes more pressure on groundwater resources sometimes considered as the only available resource for supplying water especially in arid and semi arid regions furthermore being a common pool resource cpr among several beneficiaries makes these valuable resources face overexploitation ostrom 1990 esteban and dinar 2013 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 huang et al 2016 therefore assessing suchproblems and trying to solve them are the main keys to achieve the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this regard several approaches such as developing property rights imposing taxes and penalties and arranging cooperation through internalizing the externalities arisen from overexploitation have been developed in the absence of any regulations on extraction users do not consider the externalities they impose on the other beneficiaries therefore the groundwater resource faces overexploitation that causes depletion and drop in water elevation and also contamination issues provencher and burt 1993 raquel et al 2007 esteban and dinar 2013 singh and panda 2013 depletion in groundwater level damages the environment linked to the resource and also increases the cost of extraction for encountered beneficiaries due to increase in pumping depth provencher and burt 1993 in such cases cooperative management considered in the previous studies e g nakas et al 2002 esteban and dinar 2013 could be an effective approach to tackle overexploitation problems maximizing the economic gains using hydro economic models and cooperative game theory cgt tools is one of the efficient approaches to address the tendency to cooperate which were applied in nakas et al 2002 loáiciga 2002 2004 raquel et al 2007 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 zekri et al 2014 and moridi et al 2018 table 1 provides a summary of these studies these applications aimed to address sustainable groundwater management and obtain more economic gains for the users of cprs through a cooperative approach in order to achieve these goals optimization solutions with the objective of maximizing economic gains have been applied as summarized in table 1 cooperative groundwater management cgm studies have used various linear and non linear programming methods to solve optimization problems such as linear programming in raquel et al 2007 and nonlinear programming in moridi et al 2018 while there are no extensive applications of evolutionary algorithms ea in this area of research eas as global optimization methods are more efficient than traditional ones especially when it comes to real world and large scale applications in terms of handling a large number of decision variables difficulty or fail in finding the global optimum without being trapped in local optimums and establishing the connection between objective function and those constraints containing non linear non convex and non differentiable differential equations like groundwater flow equations that are too complex or maybe impossible to be solved by traditional methods ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c many eas has been developed in recent decades and most of them have been applied to groundwater resources problems such as applying continuous ant colony optimization caco and particle swarm optimization pso for coastal groundwater management problems in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c and genetic algorithms ga for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources in parsapour moghadam et al 2015 caco has been recommended by ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b c and rajabi and ketabchi 2017 as an efficient and robust optimization tool for groundwater management problems in terms of results quality required computational time and easy parameter setting caco has been employed in some other water resources problems like optimal reservoir operation afshar et al 2006 schedule the environmental flow management szemis et al 2012 water quality prediction azad et al 2018 and coastal groundwater management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b c the present study is the first application of caco in the cgm area of research hydro economic models with environmental considerations via linear functions for estimating the damages of depletion in esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 or qualitative models such as gleams in raquel et al 2007 were used to simulate the economic gains in objective functions also several methods such as adaptations of the groundwater balance equations nakas et al 2002 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 theis equation loáiciga 2002 2004 madani and dinar 2012 and modflow code moridi et al 2018 were applied to simulate the groundwater responses to different scenarios in some studies using balance equation concepts the exchanges of groundwater flow between adjacent users and also boundary interactions have not been considered while in some other studies using simple management approaches for example between two farmer the effect of groundwater drawdown in a single well on an adjacent well was modeled using theis equation theis 1935 moridi et al 2018 used the calibrated modflow code which considers boundary conditions and internal hydraulic interaction features although the simulation and optimization models have not been linked together in their study the table 1 also represents a brief information about size and resolution of the previous studies the degradation caused by a user due to overexploitation of a cpr can endanger economic gains of adjacent users madani 2010 moridi et al 2018 this property of cprs can be used as an enforcement to make the tendency to cooperate by forming inter relationships between users ostrom 1990 in nakas et al 2002 raquel et al 2007 and zekri et al 2014 cooperation were established by maximizing the sum of net benefits that causes a decrease in extraction costs and depletion of the aquifer and also leads to optimal extraction rates in the other studies such as loáiciga 2002 2004 madani and dinar 2012 and moridi et al 2018 withdrawal planning was made considering the groundwater elevation drawdown constraints the results of the reviewed studies indicate that collaborative actions in cooperative approaches make more benefits than individual actions in non cooperative approaches and also extends the life of cprs for example nakas et al 2002 esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 indicated that the sum of net benefits increased by 2 3 17 and 0 6 under cooperation of all their cprs users respectively moreover considering the environmental damages the sum of net benefits increased by 4 and 4 8 in esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 respectively in conclusion the reviewed studies made a great effort to implement the cooperative management approach to groundwater problems using optimization tools groundwater simulation models and cooperative solution methods of game theory nakas et al 2002 loáiciga 2002 2004 raquel et al 2007 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 zekri et al 2014 moridi et al 2018 however these methods were applied in hypothetical or simplified cases in some studies a simple groundwater simulation model has been linked to an optimization model to calculate the groundwater elevation fluctuations while the groundwater simulation model has not been calibrated and the obtained results have been more uncertain esteban and dinar 2013 on the other hand in the case of using a calibrated groundwater flow model e g modflow code the model has not been linked to the optimization model due to avoid the complexities of linking and long computation time moridi et al 2018 and other developed or expandable groundwater simulation models that can be linked to the optimization part have not been used yet regarding optimization tools several methods have been applied nakas et al 2002 raquel et al 2007 esteban and dinar 2013 moridi et al 2018 but there is no widespread application of eas the main objective of this paper is to assess the possibility and effect of cooperation and also internalization of some considerations such as environmental damages on managing the groundwater resources of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran for this purpose a hydro economic simulation optimization model applying a caco algorithm has been developed this model contains some facilities including a numerical simulation of groundwater flow optimization model various cooperation arrangements and environmental damages considerations the optimization and the groundwater simulation models are linked and work simultaneously the optimal solutions are obtained using caco tool which is an innovative ea in such studies using this algorithm the current study is applied to a real case the groundwater simulation model have been calibrated and validated using the observed annual data in the period of 10 years from the year 2006 to 2015 the study area has been divided into three region and then various cooperation scenarios under internalization and no internalization of environmental damages have been applied and examined over a planning horizon of 30 years 2 material and methods the process of modeling is described in the flowchart shown in fig 1 first of all the simulation optimization model is conceptualized the hydro economic model works in conjunction with the optimization model in the way that the optimization model first calls the hydro economic model repeatedly to verify the constraints and computes the objective function values then the optimization model updates the decision variables and repeats the whole process until meeting the stopping criteria and obtaining the best answers after achieving the best answer the economic gains are allocated to the beneficiaries and the stability of the allocations are assessed using cgt solution methods the main advantage of the developed approach is the application of a calibrated groundwater simulation model to obtain the aquifer behavior under various spatial and temporal conditions in conjunction with an ea of caco which gives the model the option of simulating and optimizing simultaneously this innovation distinguishes the applied methodology from the traditional approaches and provides an ability to consider more realistic and complex conditions 2 1 groundwater simulation model the developed groundwater simulation model is based on the continuity relation and darcy s law in the structure of a finite difference model for unconfined aquifers the area is separated into several cells which are selected considering the land use hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer and boundary interactions the developed model for groundwater flow in each cell is described in eq 1 and the related conceptual model is shown in the fig 2 1 h j t 1 h j t k w kj t kj t l kj h k t h j t q j r j α 1 ex t a j sy j h j 0 h 0 j where t is the time step h j t 1 is the groundwater elevation of time step t 1 h j t is the groundwater elevation of time step t in the cell j w kj t kj t and l kj are the length of the boundary transmissivity and the distance between centers of the two adjacent cells k and j respectively h k t represents the groundwater elevation of time step t for the adjacent cell k q j is the boundary flow in positive or out negative into or out from the cell j r j is the recharge from precipitation in cell j α is the fraction of extraction which reaches the groundwater return flow from irrigated agriculture in this study ex t is the extraction from the groundwater in time step t for the cell j a j is the area of the cell j and syj is the storativity in the cell j the h j 0 is the groundwater elevation at the time step zero and the h0 j is the initial groundwater elevation for the cell j uncertain parameters of the model such as recharge rates and hydraulic conductivities are calibrated using a trial and error method and also an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of square errors of simulated groundwater elevations using an evolutionary caco algorithm eq 2 2 minimize t 1 t j 1 j h j obs t h j sim t 2 where the t is the time horizon of simulation planning horizon j 1 j is the cell number h j obs t and h j sim t are observed and simulated groundwater elevation in time step t respectively 2 2 hydro economic optimization model the developed hydro economic optimization model has been adopted and modified based on the empirical model of esteban and dinar 2013 that combines economic environmental agronomic and hydrologic variables the annual revenue function is the per hectare revenue of selling crop multiplied by the area of each crop eq 3 the revenue function in each region is defined as follows 3 rv r ha i r t i 1 i ha i r b i b i y i p i where rv r ha i r t is the annual revenue function ha r i is the crop area b i is the crop revenue per hectare which will be obtained from multiplying the crop yield y i by revenue per unit of weight of crop p i the index i 1 i represents the crop type pattern and the index r 1 r represents the region the model is considered to be flexible about allocating the area of each cell to cropping area from 0 ha to the whole cell area and also for each type of crops the annual cost function contains crop production and water extractions costs is defined as eq 4 4 c r ha i r h r t t i 1 i c 0 i ha i r c 1 1 ε tl r h r t i 1 i ha i r w i r c 1 ρ gc e θ 3 6 10 6 where c r ha i r h r t t is the annual cost function c 0 i is the crop production cost per hectare for crop type i c 1 is the constant cost of energy consumption ε is the coefficient of repair and maintenance of extraction process tl r is the elevation of top level ground h r t is the groundwater elevation in the time step t and the term tl r h r t is the pumping depth w i r is the extracted water for cropping per hectare of the crop type i in the region r ρ is the density of the water g is the gravitational acceleration c e is the cost of per kilowatt hour kwh of energy consumption θ is the pumping efficiency and the value 3 6 10 6 is the value of joule to kwh conversion as the unit of per unit of energy cost is irr kwh it is assumed that pumping systems irrigation systems and the w i r are different cell by cell but are fix over the planning horizon which means that farmers do not change their pumping and irrigation systems over the planning horizon the annual revenue cost function is defined as the difference between annual revenue and cost functions which is represented in eq 5 5 rc r ha i r t h r t t rv r ha i r t c r ha i r h r t t where r c r ha i r t h r t t is the annual revenue cost function in the current model the relationship between the environmental damages and groundwater elevation considered to be linear and the annual environmental damage assumed to be calculated using depleted volume of the aquifer comparing to the initial level h r 0 h r t eq 6 6 d r h r t t β a r sy r h r 0 h r t if h r 0 h r t 0 if h r 0 h r t where d r h r t t is the annual environmental damage function β is the environmental damage of a unit depleted volume of groundwater a r is the area of the region r sy r is the storativity of the region r h r 0 is the initial groundwater elevation of region r and h r t is the groundwater elevation in the region r and time step t the consequences of groundwater overexploitation for each beneficiary is defined as the extraction externalities that the beneficiary brings on the others since agricultural activities are the main reasons for the extraction of water in this study the extraction externality function is defined as a fraction of the extraction cost function eq 7 7 e r ha r i h r t t c 1 1 ε tl r h r t i 1 i ha i r w i r σ r φ where the e r h a i r h r t t is the annual extraction externality function σ r is the weight of extraction cost which is calculated following the theory of vessels gura and maschler 2008 and φ is the importance factor of extraction externality the other parameters has been described earlier the σ r is defined as follow eq 8 8 σ r i r ha i r w i r aw r t where aw r t is the available groundwater in region r in time step t the σ r represents the impact that the adjacent regions suffer due to water extractions in region r the benefit function for all types of crops in total study area over the planning horizon is formulated as 9 bn t 0 t r 1 r i 1 i 1 1 dr t rc r ha r i h r t t where bn is the benefit function dr is the discount rate considering the environmental damages and extraction externalities the total net benefits function is defined as follow eq 10 10 nb t 0 t r 1 r i 1 i 1 1 dr t rc r ha r i h r t t e r ha r i h r t t d r h r t t where nb is the net benefits function the optimization problems may vary according to the scenario type in terms of considering environmental damages or and extraction externalities the objective function is maximizing the sum of net benefits objective function max nb which represents the full cooperation scenario with internalization of environmental damages in the no internalization of environmental damages scenarios the term d r h r t t will be ignored also in the case of the non cooperation scenario the term e r ha r i h r t t will be removed for all beneficiaries and in case of partial cooperation scenarios the term e r ha r i h r t t related to the individual beneficiary will be discarded there are two constraints restricting the optimization process the first constraint is about total available area to cultivate eq 11 the other constraint concerns the available water being defined as eq 12 11 i 1 i ha r i a r 12 r 1 r i 1 i ha r i w r i r 1 r aw r the total available water a w is defined as eq 13 fao 2003 13 r 1 r aw r r 1 r q r r r α i 1 i ha r i w r i in eq 13 the available water is the long term sum of annual boundary flows q r recharge from precipitation r r and return flows from extractions α i 1 i ha r i w r i in the study area 2 3 continuous ant colony optimization caco evolutionary algorithms as meta heuristic search methods explore a set of potential solutions and find the optimal solution through different search techniques and rules fogel et al 1966 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b as the ant colony is one of the well known types of swarm intelligence due to their behavior of finding shorter paths between food sources and their nest the ant colony optimization aco which was first represented by dorigo 1992 was implemented to reach the optimum answer of discrete optimization problems inspiring to the behavior of the ant colony bilchev and parmee 1995 extended the aco to continuous search space of decision variables which called caco the caco solution idea is based on the pheromone based probabilistic choice of solutions fig 3 shows a flowchart representing the caco process the probability density function is generally used for determining pheromone information which the normal distribution for calculating pheromone information is eq 14 14 τ x 1 2 σ π e x x best 2 2 σ 2 where x best is the best solution in the previous generation and σ is the weighted standard deviation of the normal probability density function the σ is defined as follows ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b eq 15 15 σ a 1 pop 1 f a f opt x a x opt 2 a 1 pop 1 f a f opt where pop is the number of ants the index a represents the ant x a is the decision variable selected by ant a solution f a is the value of the objective function for solution a x opt is the best decision variable and f opt is the best objective function value from the previous generation 2 4 cooperative game theory approach in this study the long term benefits of cooperation are considered which should be allocated fairly and efficiently among involved beneficiaries madani and dinar 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 this long term period is defined as the cpr s planning and management horizon therefore some cooperative solution methods are applied to the results of cooperative gains to estimate the fair shares of the beneficiaries and also evaluate the stability and acceptability of cooperation chalkiadakis et al 2011 madani and dinar 2012 dinar and hogarth 2015 in this study some cooperative solution methods have been applied including the shapley and the nash harsanyi n h to share the benefits among the beneficiaries fairly and also the core the loehman stability index and the propensity to disrupt ptd index to evaluate the stability and acceptability of the shares madani and dinar 2012 kahil et al 2016 gately 1974 the shapley value is based on the weighted average of beneficiaries contributions to all possible coalitions shapley 1953 the shapley value is defined as follows eq 16 16 φ p j c n s s 1 n v s v s p where φ p is the shapley value for the player p n 1 2 n is the set of beneficiaries as the players of the game or members of coalitions s is a feasible coalition group of collaborating beneficiaries in the game s is the number of members of coalition s n is the total number of beneficiaries in the game v s is the total obtainable benefits by the members of coalition s and v s p is the total obtainable benefits of the coalition s without contributing the member p in the shapley value it is assumed that all possible coalitions occur however in many cases some coalitions are not possible to be formed due to many reasons such as the case of non adjacent beneficiaries there are several approaches to deal with this situation like assuming that members act individually in the impossible coalition like non cooperation status siehlow et al 2012 the other solution concept is the n h which is an extension of the nash bargaining solution for a two player bargaining game nash 1950 harsanyi 1959 eq 17 17 max p n h j v p subject to the individual rationality and the efficiency conditions of the core conditions where h p is the n h allocation that satisfies the core conditions and v p is the value of the non cooperative coalition of player p a fair and efficient allocation should satisfy the core conditions 1 the individual rationality 2 the group rationality and 3 the efficiency chalkiadakis et al 2011 madani and dinar 2012 dinar and hogarth 2015 the first condition means that the cooperative solution should be preferred to the non cooperation individual case for each member of the coalition the second condition is that the allocated share of the grand coalition should be preferred to any allocation in any possible sub coalition finally the third condition is that the total obtainable benefits under the grand coalition should be fully allocated to the members of that coalition dinar and hogarth 2015 the core conditions are represented in eqs 18 20 18 u p v p individual rationality 19 p s u p v s group rationality 20 p n u p v n efficiency where u p is the allocated value under cooperation and v n is the value of the grand coalition the other selected method for measuring the stability of a cooperative game is the loehman stability index loehman et al 1979 the loehman index l i compares the obtained benefits to a beneficiary with the obtained benefits in the coalition which is described as the eq 21 21 l i u p v p p n u p v p p n p n l i 1 where u p is the allocated share to member p the power index illustrates the acceptability and stability of the allocation solution which is defined as s l σ l l 0 s l 1 the coefficient of variation calculated over all members in a given allocation solution the less the value of s l the larger the stability of the allocation solution there are some conditions in which the beneficiary is not satisfied with the allocated gains and may leave the coalition gately 1974 proposed a new index to more intuitively determination of solution stability in which evaluates the loss ratio of the other beneficiaries if one refuse to cooperate and also represents to what extent the coalition will disrupt this index is defined as propensity to disrupt ptd which is described as the eq 22 22 ptd p p z n z p u p v s p u p v p in case of positive values of ptd the beneficiary has a strong threat to leave the grand coalition unless its gain is improved a negative value refers to hyper enthusiasm of the beneficiary for taking part in such coalition while an infinite value reflects the beneficiary s refusal to cooperate finally zero value of ptd indicates the unwillingness to refuse to cooperate 2 5 study area the namdan study area located between 52 0 e to 52 55 e and 30 25 n to 31 15 n in the north of the tashk bakhtegan basin fars

recorded climatic data the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evaporation are approximately 318 8 mm yr 10 6 c and 1515 6 mm yr respectively frwo 2016 the namdan study area consists of a synclinal thick alluvium layer and is a part of the zagros structural zone which is mostly composed of karstic jurassic carbonate cretaceous and eocene calcareous structures the aquifer thickness and groundwater elevation maps and the location of boreholes piezometers and operation wells are illustrated in fig 5 the complementary information obtained from these wells are demonstrated in tables 2 and 3 frwo 2016 the groundwater in the namdan study area flows from north west to south east and according to the data of a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2015 the groundwater elevation varies between 2267 m in the south east and 2400 m in north west parts of the plain fig 5 a 3 application 3 1 groundwater model calibration the groundwater model has been calibrated and verified using observed annual data of groundwater elevation and precipitation during a period of 10 years between 2006 and 2015 hydrologic years frwo 2016 the simulation time step is monthly the observed annual groundwater elevation data in a period of 7 years from 2006 to 2012 have been applied for the calibration and the rest of the data the period of 3 years from 2013 to 2015 for the verification hydraulic conductivity return flow from extraction and recharge from precipitation rates are the selected calibration parameters that their variation ranges are mentioned in table 3 these ranges have been determined using the physical data which were obtained from boreholes and piezometers table 2 considering the soil type and soil texture land use map and return flow and recharge rates zones the study area has been discretized into 50 homogenous cells in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients topographic levels groundwater elevations and return flow and recharge rates these cells are not uniform in terms of size and their size varies between 7 and 70 km2 the return flow from extraction and the recharge from precipitation rates have been calibrated using trial and error method and hydraulic conductivity have been automatically calibrated by the optimization model mentioned in eq 2 the return and recharge rates have been calibrated under the mentioned 50 cells which are shown in fig 6 the simulated and observed data are compared in fig 7 3 2 input data according to sci 2016 there are three rural districts extending over the namdan study area fig 2 khosroshirin ks shahrmian sm and khonjesht kj which have been considered to be the three beneficiary regions extracting groundwater in the study area all the management problems and cooperation scenarios have been implemented among these three regions the input data of the model are described in the table 4 there are 1630 active operation wells in the namdan study area with the annual extraction of 328 3 million cubic meters mcm that supply agricultural demands frwo 2016 a number of these wells are pumped using fossil fuels like diesel 990 wells and the rest of them are pumped using electricity 640 wells frwo 2016 the cost of per unit of electricity consumption for agricultural purposes kwh is 128 irr kwh and for per unit of diesel fuel liter is 326 irr kwh moe 2014 niopdc 2014 therefore the average cost of a kwh energy consumption for agricultural purposes will be 248 irr kwh the pumping efficiency varies from 24 in diesel powered pumps to 88 in electric powered pumps new and schneider 1988 hence in this study the average pumping efficiency is considered to be 30 and 60 for diesel powered and electric powered pumps respectively according to undp 2014 the average cost of reserving one cubic meter of groundwater is estimated based on replacement costs of each cubic meter of groundwater by aquifer management and flood dispersion projects this cost has been estimated to be 1250 irr per cubic meter

that the most appropriate population size ranges between 30 and 200 ants for groundwater optimization problems ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b the proposed ant population size for the current study set to a range between 30 and 200 ants then the simulation optimization model was run upon several trials and the suitable population size and the number of generations were found based on the convergence rate of the objective function values ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b for stopping criterion computations are stopped after the fixed number of simulations satisfying two following criteria 1 the n n n t the ratio should not exceed 10 where n n is the number of generations with no improvement in the objective function value and n t is the number of total generations from the beginning of computation 2 the difference of the objective function values of two consecutive generations should be less than 0 01 such types of stopping criteria were applied by ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b according to some preliminary runs and analyses the population size of 150 ants and iteration size of 500 75000 generations have been considered to set for the caco model in this study the time required for each run until obtaining optimal result is approximately 6 1 h using a computer system with a 3 4 ghz core i7 processor and 8 gb ram there will be 10 20 individual runs for each scenario 3 4 policies scenarios the status quo scenario has been defined as the simulation of the current condition of the study area in terms of cultivated area crop types and groundwater extraction volume which are based on the observed data and also information obtained from moa 2013 wri 2016 and frwo 2016 to assess the possibility of cooperation four possible cooperation scenarios have been defined 1 non cooperation 2 partial cooperation of ks sm 3 partial cooperation of sm kj and 4 full cooperation all these scenarios are evaluated under internalization of environmental damages and except the status quo scenario they are called by a specific number from 1 to 8 hereafter table 5 in the non cooperation scenario scenarios 1 and 5 each region acts individually by maximizing own economic gains without considering the extraction externality in the partial cooperation scenarios scenarios 2 3 6 and 7 adjacent regions make a coalition by taking their extraction externalities into account while the other regions act individually in the scenarios 2 and 6 the two adjacent regions ks and sm form a coalition while the region kj acts individually similarly in the scenarios 3 and 7 the two adjacent regions sm and kj form a coalition while the region ks is the individual one finally under full cooperation scenario scenarios 4 and 8 which is so called grand coalition all three regions cooperate with each other by taking their extraction externalities into account considering the status quo scenario there are nine scenarios that will be evaluated over a planning horizon of 30 years table 5 as the extraction externalities are calculated based on the theory of vessels the coalition of ks and kj is impossible to form owing to that they are not adjacent together since the sm region locates between two other regions ks and kj it imports the extraction externality to both of them therefore in the partial cooperation case the half of extraction externality of the sm region is considered such approaches were applied by esteban and albiac 2011 and esteban and dinar 2013 4 results 4 1 general results table 6 shows the sum of net benefits and environmental damages among cooperation scenarios when the environmental damages are internalized and not internalized the sum of net benefits of the status quo scenario and also scenarios 1 and 5 has been represented to make a comparison with the other cooperative scenarios the results show that if the status quo condition continues the sum of the net benefits and environmental damages over the planning horizon will be 6397 and 1078 billion irr respectively the results also show that the highest and the lowest levels of the sum of net benefits are obtained under the scenario 4 11967 billion irr and the scenario 2 7959 billion irr respectively while the scenario 3 gains 9109 billion irr as it can be seen in the table 6 the two partial cooperation scenarios 2 and 3 obtain the lowest sum of net benefits compared to scenarios 1 and 4 this lies in the fact that when two regions collaborate together the third one acts individually and operates the unused amount of groundwater degrading by the two other regions which they ignore due to cooperate with each other the results also represent that the highest and the lowest sum of environmental damages over the planning horizon are incurred in scenarios 1 and 4 by 1733 billion irr and 887 billion irr respectively in scenario 4 the sum of net benefits increases by 20 5 about 2035 billion irr while the sum of environmental damages decreases by 48 8 about 846 billion irr both compared to scenario 1 owing to internalizing the environmental damages in scenarios 5 to 8 the sum of net benefits increases by an average of 9 2 which the highest and the lowest increments occur in scenario 5 by 14 and scenario 8 by 3 3 respectively the sum of environmental damages decreases by an average of 34 which the highest and the lowest decrements occur in the scenario 8 by 72 2 and the scenario 6 by 10 6 respectively table 6 in conclusion the results suggest that collaboration of all regions in scenarios 4 and 8 reaches the highest level of economic gains and provides less damage to the environment furthermore considering the environmental damages in long term planning leads to increase the sum of net benefits in addition to reducing these damages many other water resources related studies such as kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2004 siehlow et al 2012 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 kahil et al 2016 and mohammadpour and bagheri 2017 have reached to similar results and highlighted that full cooperative arrangements grand coalition obtain higher levels of economic gains than unilateral actions for example the results of esteban and dinar 2013 indicated that the sum of net benefits increases 0 6 in full cooperation scenario comparing to non cooperation scenario kahil et al 2016 in another study has reached to similar results which the sum of net benefits increases between 4 and 7 under different climatic scenarios the results of esteban and dinar 2013 and kahil et al 2016 in terms of environmental consideration also indicated that internalization of environmental damages affects the sum of net benefits and the total value of these damages while in esteban and dinar 2013 the sum of net benefits increases by 5 and the the sum of environmental damages reduced by 3 both in full cooperation scenario similar results were obtained in kahil et al 2016 as the sum of net benefits increases by 21 and the environmental damages decreased between 4 and 7 4 2 sensitivity analysis the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion value β 1250 irr m 3 applied in this study is an average value for iran and may vary from region to region so as the value is non exclusive for the namdan study area the sensitivity of the model should be analyzed under different values of β in addition to environmental damage the developed model may be sensitive to intensity of considering the extraction externality due to applying some assumptions like the theory of vessels and also the importance factor in calculation of the extraction externality therefore the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β and the importance factor of extraction externality φ have been subjected to sensitivity analysis the results of the environmental damages sensitivity analysis are demonstrated in tables 6 and the results of the extraction externality sensitivity analysis are illustrated in tables 7 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis of β for sensitivity analyzing of the environmental damages halved and doubled value of the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β is applied to the model 625 and 2500 irr m 3 respectively the results show that the cooperation scenarios are affected by changes in the β value but the order of scenarios in terms of the sum of net benefits is not altered and as already obtained the highest levels of the sum of net benefits is gained in the scenarios 4 and 8 full cooperation scenarios and the lowest values in scenarios 2 and 6 partial cooperation ks sm scenarios the scenarios 1 and 5 non cooperation scenarios gain more benefits than the scenarios 2 3 6 and 7 partial cooperation scenarios the results also represent that with a 50 drop in β from 1250 to 625 irr m 3 the environmental damages decrease between 7 8 and 48 8 19 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 642 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively while with doubling the β from 1250 to 2500 irr m 3 the environmental damages increase between 28 and 85 3 341 billion irr in the scenario 7 and 1122 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively by reducing the unit environmental damage the sum of net benefits increases between 1 4 and 6 1 175 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 530 billion irr in the scenario 6 respectively on the other hand doubling the β reduces the sum of net benefits by a range between 0 7 and 9 3 91 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 1055 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively table 6 it should be mentioned that it has been not defined any scenario number for sensitivity analysis and the scenarios 5 to 8 has been evaluated under this analysis so all the comparison are about these scenarios to sum up decreasing the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β value reduces the sum of environmental damages while increases the sum of net benefits on the other hand increasing the unit environmental damage value causes an increment in the sum of environmental damages while reduces the sum of net benefits 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis of φ in the case of extraction externality 25 change in the importance factor φ φ 75 and 125 respectively has been considered to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the variation of this parameter this sensitivity analysis has been done under both internalization and no internalization of the environmental damages and the obtained results are represented in table 7 similar to the previous analysis the cooperation scenarios are affected by changes in the importance factor of extraction externality value but as already occurred the order of cooperation scenarios does not change the results suggest that with the 25 decrease in value of the importance factor φ 75 the sum of net benefits increases in the range of 29 to 59 3457 billion irr in the scenario 4 and 4694 billion irr in the scenario 2 respectively compared to the default value of φ φ 100 furthermore reducing in the value of the importance factor increases the sum of environmental damages between 1 9 and 38 5 32 billion irr in the scenario 3 and 342 billion irr in the scenario 4 respectively in the case of 25 increase in the value of importance factor φ 125 the sum of net benefits reduces in the range of 17 6 to 63 8 2109 billion irr in the scenario 4 and 5077 billion irr in the scenario 2 respectively comparing to the default value of φ φ 100 also the sum of environmental damages decreases between 6 6 and 68 5 113 billion irr in the scenario 3 and 607 billion irr in the scenario 4 respectively the internalization of environmental damages has no effect on the order of the cooperation scenarios and only caused increase in the sum of net benefits and decrease in the sum of environmental damages similar to the general results in conclusion reduction in the value of importance factor causes increase in both the sum of net benefits and the sum of environmental damages on the other hand the increase in the value of importance factor reduces both the sum of net benefits and the sum of environmental damages in cooperative management approaches novel methodologies which have been employed in the current study can be applied to complex real world problems along with such sensitivity analysis to provide an overview of the effects of prices costs and penalties on beneficiaries tendency to cooperate the environmental damage and extraction externality considered in this study are significant approximate values hence precise estimation of these values considering economic social political and any other considerable aspects would be helpful to achieve more accurate results improve models and also be more applicable to complex real world problems 4 3 allocations of the cooperative gains one of the most important issues in cooperative approaches is finding the fairest way to allocate the obtained economic gains among the beneficiaries in this regard the cgt concepts and solution methods have been applied to this study the cooperative gains have been allocated using the n h and the shapley value methods and then the stability of the allocated gains have been measured by the core conditions the loehman stability index and the ptd index the results of the allocated cooperative gains and the stability of these allocations are illustrated in tables 8 and 9 the allocation results of no internalization of environmental damages and internalization of the various environmental damages values for sensitivity analysis are shown in table 8 the results represent that only the cooperative gains allocated by the n h satisfy the core conditions the loehman stability index shows that the allocated values by the shapley are not stable and do not meet the core conditions the low positive ptd index values also indicates that all of the regions have the potential to threat the two other regions to leave the grand coalition but the intention of this threat is different among them the impossibility of arranging some sub coalitions affects the allocated gains obtained from shapley solution and also the related core results dinar et al 1992 as the results show the allocated gains by the shapley solution method exceeds the core s first condition individual rationality when it comes to region sm which the allocated value to this region is less than what it earns without participating in any coalition under non cooperative form tables 8 and 9 this has caused by the impossibility of forming the partial cooperation between ks and kj due to lack of direct hydraulic connection and also the applied assumption which considered the non cooperation values instead of impossible partial cooperation form of ks and kj similar results in dinar et al 1992 indicated that allocated gains and the derived core are heavily dependent on probabilities of coalitions formation in the shapley value while the n h produces more stable and acceptable results williams 1988 compared several cgt solutions over allocation of 14 project costs and benefits results and concluded that in case the shapley is outside the core the other cgt solutions performance are much stronger the values allocated by the shapley obtains the highest level of cooperative gains for the ks and kj regions while this occurs for the sm region using the n h in case of ks and kj regions the lower ptd index value of the shapley compared to the n h and over all values of β indicates that these two regions tend to be allocated by the shapley the higher ptd index value of the shapley compared to n h in case of the region sm represents that this region tends to be gained by n h method table 8 further the results presented in table 8 suggest that by increasing the value of environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β the cooperative gains of the ks and kj regions that have been allocated by the shapley solution method reduce in the case of the n h method the allocated values to the ks and kj regions increase and then decrease to the sm region the allocated values of cooperative gains increase in both the n h and the shapley methods the results of the allocation of the cooperative gains under the sensitivity analysisof the importance factor φ of the extraction externality are illustrated in the table 9 the results suggest that if the importance factor increases by 25 φ 125 the values allocated by the shapley and also the n h will not observe the core conditions while the values of the ptd index indicate that as well on the other hand in the case of reducing the importance factor by 25 φ 75 the values allocated by both of the shapley and the n h solutions are meet the core conditions and the loehman stability index for the shapley value is obtained by 0 22 which indicates that the solution is stable furthermore the values allocated by the shapley and the n h are higher than the obtained values under the default value of φ φ 100 for the all three regions ks sm and kj in the case of internalization of environmental damages the pdt index values are lower for the shapley compare to the n h for the ks and kj regions the lower pdt index values are obtained using the n h for the sm region table 9 the ptd values also indicate that the all three regions threaten to leave the coalition owing to take advantage of such threat to impose a negotiation condition with the aim of obtaining a greater share in conclusion despite the weakness of the shapley value due to impossibility of forming the partial cooperation between ks and kj reduction of the intention of extraction externality placed the values of the shapley in the core however there are many other cgt solution methods that can be employed and be compared to each other using most efficient and powerful stability indexes like the loehman and the ptd these indexes will provide an overview of stakeholders negotiation position in such study areas with such physical orientation that is recommended to the future research studies and government projects especially with the purpose of arranging and instituting cooperative approaches and forming real coalitions in related to real world problems 4 4 the groundwater status as in this study the simulation model of the groundwater flow has been applied various hydraulic outputs of the scenarios are available to present however due to saving space only the results of annual groundwater depletion the hydrograph of the scenarios 4 and 8 and the elevations contour maps of the scenarios 1 and 8 are shown in table 10 figs 7 and 8 respectively the results of the groundwater simulation model for the planning horizon show that without internalization of environmental damages the highest annual depletions occur in the scenarios 1 and 8 by 17 9 and 19 5 mcm per year respectively 0 21 and 0 23 m per year drop in groundwater elevation and the groundwater elevation will drop by 6 2 and 6 7 till the end of the period while the lowest annual depletion occurs in the scenario 2 by 5 2 mcm per year 0 06 m per year drop in groundwater elevation considering the environmental damages the annual depletion reduces in the scenarios 7 and 8 by 22 3 and 71 8 respectively while the annual depletion in the scenarios 1 and 2 increases by 22 9 and 13 5 in the same order table 10 this lies in some reasons like the geographic situations of the regions total area of each of them and also the role of region ks which is located in the upstream of the two other regions and affects them hydraulically fig 8 the groundwater hydrographs and elevation contour maps of each scenario for the total area and each of the regions are ignored to show due to lack of enough space however examples of both hydrographs and contour maps are presented in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 illustrates the groundwater hydrograph of scenarios 4 and 8 the results show that by internalizing the environmental damages and cooperation of all three regions under the scenario 8 which obtains the best groundwater conditions in terms of the elevation and annual depletion the groundwater elevation rises by 4 8 m comparing to the scenario 4 till the end of the planning horizon the groundwater elevation contour maps of the scenarios 1 and 8 are given in fig 8 this figure shows that comparing the scenario 8 with the scenario 1 the groundwater elevation drops in the region ks while rises in the regions sm and kj 5 conclusion nowadays the groundwater resources are known as cprs due to being open access among all water consumers and the subsequent related overexploitation issues especially in farmlands and irrigated areas located in arid and semi arid regions which impose more pressures on this nonrenewable resources in this regard distinguishing and evaluation of such issues are the main challenges that the policy decision makers managers are faced in this study an evolutionary hydro economic simulation optimization model including a calibrated numerical simulation model of groundwater flow was developed to assess potential policies through cooperative arrangements which is an innovation in such area of research the optimal solutions are obtained through caco tool for the first time in this field the developed model was applied to an aquifer divided into three regions and then various cooperation scenarios with the possibility of considering the environmental damages were applied between these regions over a planning horizon of 30 years the applied case study is the namdan aquifer which is located in the north of the tashk bakhtegan basin fars province iran the results of this study suggest that it is more beneficial for the beneficiaries who are farmers in this study to cooperate and if all of them participates into grand coalition the sum of net benefits increases by 20 5 further by taking the environmental damages into account the sum of the net benefits increases by at least 3 up to 14 and the full cooperation of all parties pays off more than the other cooperative arrangements same as the scenarios without internalization of the environmental damages however the tendency to cooperate depends on damage prices and also highly depends on the intensity of consideration of the extraction externalities these results were obtained from the cgt allocation solutions the n h and the shapley value and also stability analysis the core the loehman stability index and the ptd index the results indicate that only the region sm is unwilling to be allocated by the shapley value solution conversely to the two other regions on the other hand all of the three regions are more inclined to be allocated by the n h method comparing to the shapley which is also indicated by the ptd values this is probably because of some technical assumptions mainly the cooperation formations in which in the case of some partial cooperation it was assumed that all three regions act individually similar to the non cooperation scenario owing to the impossibility of forming a coalition between two non adjacent regions the ptd index values have also shown that each of three regions found the threat of leaving the coalition advantageous to persuade the other two regions to grant them a larger share of the total gain therefore it is important to pay attention to the players positions and also the possibilities of establishment of various cooperation arrangements such analyses also give a good perspective to policy and decision makers on pricing fines and taxes values to impose on the groundwater operators and consumers in order to reach a sustainable operation of the cpr the results of the simulation model of the groundwater flow show that under full cooperation scenario grand coalition with the internalization of the environmental damages the groundwater condition of the study areas improves in the mentioned scenario the groundwater elevation rises by 4 8 m and the annual depletion reduces by 14 mcm the results also indicate that in the non cooperation and both partial cooperation scenarios each individual region tries to extract the maximum volume of groundwater that it can which under these competitive conditions the groundwater resource may suffer more pressure and the sum of net benefits decreases by increase in the extraction costs and environmental damages lastly this study shows that the cooperation approach and environmental considerations can improve the economic gains and also the groundwater resource condition it is proposed to find and apply more accurate ways to compute extraction externalities and environmental damages and also implementing the methodology to small scale cases and assessing the social and

6168,groundwater as an open access and a common pool resource cpr among several beneficiaries faces overexploitation especially in arid and semi arid regions to tackle such problems cooperative management method using game theory concepts could be considered as an effective approach in operating a cpr this study examines the effect of cooperation and internalization of environmental damages on managing the groundwater resources in namdan aquifer located in fars province iran for this purpose an evolutionary hydro economic simulation optimization model has been developed and various cooperation and environmental damages internalization scenarios have been considered to the study area over a planning horizon of 30 years continuous ant colony optimization caco algorithm which is an innovative application in this area of study has been applied to the simulation optimization model some cooperative game theory methods have been used to allocate the obtained net benefits the results indicate that under the full cooperation scenario the highest value of the sum of net benefits has been gained for any value of environmental damages moreover internalizing the environmental damages has caused increase in the sum of net benefits among all cooperation scenarios a sensitivity analysis has been conducted to assess the effect of changing the environmental damages value and also the importance factor of extraction externalities the results of these analysis indicate that the cooperation conditions are independent of the value of environmental damages and also the intensity of extraction externalities the methodology presented in this study provides water resource managers with a cooperative management platform in order to evaluate the possibilities of sustainable development of groundwater resources in more realistic conditions the application of an efficient evolutionary algorithm provides a variety of realistic problems with an opportunity to overcome the

pool resource cpr among several beneficiaries makes these valuable resources face overexploitation ostrom 1990 esteban and dinar 2013 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 huang et al 2016 therefore assessing suchproblems and trying to solve them are the main keys to achieve the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this regard several approaches such as developing property rights imposing taxes and penalties and arranging cooperation through internalizing the externalities arisen from overexploitation have been developed in the absence of any regulations on extraction users do not consider the externalities they impose on the other beneficiaries therefore the groundwater resource faces overexploitation that causes depletion and drop in water elevation and also contamination issues provencher and burt 1993 raquel et al 2007 esteban and dinar 2013 singh and panda 2013 depletion in groundwater level damages the environment linked to the resource and also increases the cost of extraction for encountered beneficiaries due to increase in pumping depth provencher and burt 1993 in such cases cooperative management considered in the previous studies e g nakas et al 2002 esteban and dinar 2013 could be an effective approach to tackle overexploitation problems maximizing the economic gains using hydro economic models and cooperative game theory cgt tools is one of the efficient approaches to address the tendency to cooperate which were applied in nakas et al 2002 loáiciga 2002 2004 raquel et al 2007 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 zekri et al 2014 and moridi et al 2018 table 1 provides a summary of these studies these applications aimed to address sustainable groundwater management and obtain more economic gains for the users of cprs through a cooperative approach in order to achieve these goals optimization solutions with the objective of maximizing economic gains have been applied as summarized in table 1 cooperative groundwater management cgm studies have used various linear and non linear programming methods to solve optimization problems such as linear programming in raquel et al 2007 and nonlinear programming in moridi et al 2018 while there are no extensive applications of evolutionary algorithms ea in this area of research eas as global optimization methods are more efficient than traditional ones especially when it comes to real world and large scale applications in terms of handling a large number of decision variables difficulty or fail in finding the global optimum without being trapped in local optimums and establishing the connection between objective function and those constraints containing non linear non convex and non differentiable differential equations like groundwater flow equations that are too complex or maybe impossible to be solved by traditional methods ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c many eas has been developed in recent decades and most of them have been applied to groundwater resources problems such as applying continuous ant colony optimization caco and particle swarm optimization pso for coastal groundwater management problems in ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015c and genetic algorithms ga for conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources in parsapour moghadam et al 2015 caco has been recommended by ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b c and rajabi and ketabchi 2017 as an efficient and robust optimization tool for groundwater management problems in terms of results quality required computational time and easy parameter setting caco has been employed in some other water resources problems like optimal reservoir operation afshar et al 2006 schedule the environmental flow management szemis et al 2012 water quality prediction azad et al 2018 and coastal groundwater management ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b c the present study is the first application of caco in the cgm area of research hydro economic models with environmental considerations via linear functions for estimating the damages of depletion in esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 or qualitative models such as gleams in raquel et al 2007 were used to simulate the economic gains in objective functions also several methods such as adaptations of the groundwater balance equations nakas et al 2002 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 theis equation loáiciga 2002 2004 madani and dinar 2012 and modflow code moridi et al 2018 were applied to simulate the groundwater responses to different scenarios in some studies using balance equation concepts the exchanges of groundwater flow between adjacent users and also boundary interactions have not been considered while in some other studies using simple management approaches for example between two farmer the effect of groundwater drawdown in a single well on an adjacent well was modeled using theis equation theis 1935 moridi et al 2018 used the calibrated modflow code which considers boundary conditions and internal hydraulic interaction features although the simulation and optimization models have not been linked together in their study the table 1 also represents a brief information about size and resolution of the previous studies the degradation caused by a user due to overexploitation of a cpr can endanger economic gains of adjacent users madani 2010 moridi et al 2018 this property of cprs can be used as an enforcement to make the tendency to cooperate by forming inter relationships between users ostrom 1990 in nakas et al 2002 raquel et al 2007 and zekri et al 2014 cooperation were established by maximizing the sum of net benefits that causes a decrease in extraction costs and depletion of the aquifer and also leads to optimal extraction rates in the other studies such as loáiciga 2002 2004 madani and dinar 2012 and moridi et al 2018 withdrawal planning was made considering the groundwater elevation drawdown constraints the results of the reviewed studies indicate that collaborative actions in cooperative approaches make more benefits than individual actions in non cooperative approaches and also extends the life of cprs for example nakas et al 2002 esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 indicated that the sum of net benefits increased by 2 3 17 and 0 6 under cooperation of all their cprs users respectively moreover considering the environmental damages the sum of net benefits increased by 4 and 4 8 in esteban and albiac 2012 and esteban and dinar 2013 respectively in conclusion the reviewed studies made a great effort to implement the cooperative management approach to groundwater problems using optimization tools groundwater simulation models and cooperative solution methods of game theory nakas et al 2002 loáiciga 2002 2004 raquel et al 2007 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 zekri et al 2014 moridi et al 2018 however these methods were applied in hypothetical or simplified cases in some studies a simple groundwater simulation model has been linked to an optimization model to calculate the groundwater elevation fluctuations while the groundwater simulation model has not been calibrated and the obtained results have been more uncertain esteban and dinar 2013 on the other hand in the case of using a calibrated groundwater flow model e g modflow code the model has not been linked to the optimization model due to avoid the complexities of linking and long computation time moridi et al 2018 and other developed or expandable groundwater simulation models that can be linked to the optimization part have not been used yet regarding optimization tools several methods have been applied nakas et al 2002 raquel et al 2007 esteban and dinar 2013 moridi et al 2018 but there is no widespread application of eas the main objective of this paper is to assess the possibility and effect of cooperation and also internalization of some considerations such as environmental damages on managing the groundwater resources of namdan aquifer located in fars province iran for this purpose a hydro economic simulation optimization model applying a caco algorithm has been developed this model contains some facilities including a numerical simulation of groundwater flow optimization model various cooperation arrangements and environmental damages considerations the optimization and the groundwater simulation models are linked and work simultaneously the optimal solutions are obtained using caco tool which is an innovative ea in such studies using this algorithm the current study is applied to a real case the groundwater simulation model have been calibrated and validated using the observed annual data in the period of 10 years from the year 2006 to 2015 the study area has been divided into three region and then various cooperation scenarios under internalization and no internalization of environmental damages have been applied and examined over a planning horizon of 30 years 2 material and methods the process of modeling is described in the flowchart shown in fig 1 first of all the simulation optimization model is conceptualized the hydro economic model works in conjunction with the optimization model in the way that the optimization model first calls the hydro economic model repeatedly to verify the constraints and computes the objective function values then the optimization model updates the decision variables and repeats the whole process until meeting the stopping criteria and obtaining the best answers after achieving the best answer the economic gains are allocated to the beneficiaries and the stability of the allocations are assessed using cgt solution methods the main advantage of the developed approach is the application of a calibrated groundwater simulation model to obtain the aquifer behavior under various spatial and temporal conditions in conjunction with an ea of caco which gives the model the option of simulating and optimizing simultaneously this innovation distinguishes the applied methodology from the traditional approaches and provides an ability to consider more realistic and complex conditions 2 1 groundwater simulation model the developed groundwater simulation model is based on the continuity relation and darcy s law in the structure of a finite difference model for unconfined aquifers the area is separated into several cells which are selected considering the land use hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics of the aquifer and boundary interactions the developed model for groundwater flow in each cell is described in eq 1 and the related conceptual model is shown in the fig 2 1 h j t 1 h j t k w kj t kj t l kj h k t h j t q j r j α 1 ex t a j sy j h j 0 h 0 j where t is the time step h j t 1 is the groundwater elevation of time step t 1 h j t is the groundwater elevation of time step t in the cell j w kj t kj t and l kj are the length of the boundary transmissivity and the distance between centers of the two adjacent cells k and j respectively h k t represents the groundwater elevation of time step t for the adjacent cell k q j is the boundary flow in positive or out negative into or out from the cell j r j is the recharge from precipitation in cell j α is the fraction of extraction which reaches the groundwater return flow from irrigated agriculture in this study ex t is the extraction from the groundwater in time step t for the cell j a j is the area of the cell j and syj is the storativity in the cell j the h j 0 is the groundwater elevation at the time step zero and the h0 j is the initial groundwater elevation for the cell j uncertain parameters of the model such as recharge rates and hydraulic conductivities are calibrated using a trial and error method and also an optimization problem with the objective of minimizing the sum of square errors of simulated groundwater elevations using an evolutionary caco algorithm eq 2 2 minimize t 1 t j 1 j h j obs t h j sim t 2 where the t is the time horizon of simulation planning horizon j 1 j is the cell number h j obs t and h j sim t are observed and simulated groundwater elevation in time step t respectively 2 2 hydro economic optimization model the developed hydro economic optimization model has been adopted and modified based on the empirical model of esteban and dinar 2013 that combines economic environmental agronomic and hydrologic variables the annual revenue function is the per hectare revenue of selling crop multiplied by the area of each crop eq 3 the revenue function in each region is defined as follows 3 rv r ha i r t i 1 i ha i r b i b i y i p i where rv r ha i r t is the annual revenue function ha r i is the crop area b i is the crop revenue per hectare which will be obtained from multiplying the crop yield y i by revenue per unit of weight of crop p i the index i 1 i represents the crop type pattern and the index r 1 r represents the region the model is considered to be flexible about allocating the area of each cell to cropping area from 0 ha to the whole cell area and also for each type of crops the annual cost function contains crop production and water extractions costs is defined as eq 4 4 c r ha i r h r t t i 1 i c 0 i ha i r c 1 1 ε tl r h r t i 1 i ha i r w i r c 1 ρ gc e θ 3 6 10 6 where c r ha i r h r t t is the annual cost function c 0 i is the crop production cost per hectare for crop type i c 1 is the constant cost of energy consumption ε is the coefficient of repair and maintenance of extraction process tl r is the elevation of top level ground h r t is the groundwater elevation in the time step t and the term tl r h r t is the pumping depth w i r is the extracted water for cropping per hectare of the crop type i in the region r ρ is the density of the water g is the gravitational acceleration c e is the cost of per kilowatt hour kwh of energy consumption θ is the pumping efficiency and the value 3 6 10 6 is the value of joule to kwh conversion as the unit of per unit of energy cost is irr kwh it is assumed that pumping systems irrigation systems and the w i r are different cell by cell but are fix over the planning horizon which means that farmers do not change their pumping and irrigation systems over the planning horizon the annual revenue cost function is defined as the difference between annual revenue and cost functions which is represented in eq 5 5 rc r ha i r t h r t t rv r ha i r t c r ha i r h r t t where r c r ha i r t h r t t is the annual revenue cost function in the current model the relationship between the environmental damages and groundwater elevation considered to be linear and the annual environmental damage assumed to be calculated using depleted volume of the aquifer comparing to the initial level h r 0 h r t eq 6 6 d r h r t t β a r sy r h r 0 h r t if h r 0 h r t 0 if h r 0 h r t where d r h r t t is the annual environmental damage function β is the environmental damage of a unit depleted volume of groundwater a r is the area of the region r sy r is the storativity of the region r h r 0 is the initial groundwater elevation of region r and h r t is the groundwater elevation in the region r and time step t the consequences of groundwater overexploitation for each beneficiary is defined as the extraction externalities that the beneficiary brings on the others since agricultural activities are the main reasons for the extraction of water in this study the extraction externality function is defined as a fraction of the extraction cost function eq 7 7 e r ha r i h r t t c 1 1 ε tl r h r t i 1 i ha i r w i r σ r φ where the e r h a i r h r t t is the annual extraction externality function σ r is the weight of extraction cost which is calculated following the theory of vessels gura and maschler 2008 and φ is the importance factor of extraction externality the other parameters has been described earlier the σ r is defined as follow eq 8 8 σ r i r ha i r w i r aw r t where aw r t is the available groundwater in region r in time step t the σ r represents the impact that the adjacent regions suffer due to water extractions in region r the benefit function for all types of crops in total study area over the planning horizon is formulated as 9 bn t 0 t r 1 r i 1 i 1 1 dr t rc r ha r i h r t t where bn is the benefit function dr is the discount rate considering the environmental damages and extraction externalities the total net benefits function is defined as follow eq 10 10 nb t 0 t r 1 r i 1 i 1 1 dr t rc r ha r i h r t t e r ha r i h r t t d r h r t t where nb is the net benefits function the optimization problems may vary according to the scenario type in terms of considering environmental damages or and extraction externalities the objective function is maximizing the sum of net benefits objective function max nb which represents the full cooperation scenario with internalization of environmental damages in the no internalization of environmental damages scenarios the term d r h r t t will be ignored also in the case of the non cooperation scenario the term e r ha r i h r t t will be removed for all beneficiaries and in case of partial cooperation scenarios the term e r ha r i h r t t related to the individual beneficiary will be discarded there are two constraints restricting the optimization process the first constraint is about total available area to cultivate eq 11 the other constraint concerns the available water being defined as eq 12 11 i 1 i ha r i a r 12 r 1 r i 1 i ha r i w r i r 1 r aw r the total available water a w is defined as eq 13 fao 2003 13 r 1 r aw r r 1 r q r r r α i 1 i ha r i w r i in eq 13 the available water is the long term sum of annual boundary flows q r recharge from precipitation r r and return flows from extractions α i 1 i ha r i w r i in the study area 2 3 continuous ant colony optimization caco evolutionary algorithms as meta heuristic search methods explore a set of potential solutions and find the optimal solution through different search techniques and rules fogel et al 1966 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b as the ant colony is one of the well known types of swarm intelligence due to their behavior of finding shorter paths between food sources and their nest the ant colony optimization aco which was first represented by dorigo 1992 was implemented to reach the optimum answer of discrete optimization problems inspiring to the behavior of the ant colony bilchev and parmee 1995 extended the aco to continuous search space of decision variables which called caco the caco solution idea is based on the pheromone based probabilistic choice of solutions fig 3 shows a flowchart representing the caco process the probability density function is generally used for determining pheromone information which the normal distribution for calculating pheromone information is eq 14 14 τ x 1 2 σ π e x x best 2 2 σ 2 where x best is the best solution in the previous generation and σ is the weighted standard deviation of the normal probability density function the σ is defined as follows ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b eq 15 15 σ a 1 pop 1 f a f opt x a x opt 2 a 1 pop 1 f a f opt where pop is the number of ants the index a represents the ant x a is the decision variable selected by ant a solution f a is the value of the objective function for solution a x opt is the best decision variable and f opt is the best objective function value from the previous generation 2 4 cooperative game theory approach in this study the long term benefits of cooperation are considered which should be allocated fairly and efficiently among involved beneficiaries madani and dinar 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 this long term period is defined as the cpr s planning and management horizon therefore some cooperative solution methods are applied to the results of cooperative gains to estimate the fair shares of the beneficiaries and also evaluate the stability and acceptability of cooperation chalkiadakis et al 2011 madani and dinar 2012 dinar and hogarth 2015 in this study some cooperative solution methods have been applied including the shapley and the nash harsanyi n h to share the benefits among the beneficiaries fairly and also the core the loehman stability index and the propensity to disrupt ptd index to evaluate the stability and acceptability of the shares madani and dinar 2012 kahil et al 2016 gately 1974 the shapley value is based on the weighted average of beneficiaries contributions to all possible coalitions shapley 1953 the shapley value is defined as follows eq 16 16 φ p j c n s s 1 n v s v s p where φ p is the shapley value for the player p n 1 2 n is the set of beneficiaries as the players of the game or members of coalitions s is a feasible coalition group of collaborating beneficiaries in the game s is the number of members of coalition s n is the total number of beneficiaries in the game v s is the total obtainable benefits by the members of coalition s and v s p is the total obtainable benefits of the coalition s without contributing the member p in the shapley value it is assumed that all possible coalitions occur however in many cases some coalitions are not possible to be formed due to many reasons such as the case of non adjacent beneficiaries there are several approaches to deal with this situation like assuming that members act individually in the impossible coalition like non cooperation status siehlow et al 2012 the other solution concept is the n h which is an extension of the nash bargaining solution for a two player bargaining game nash 1950 harsanyi 1959 eq 17 17 max p n h j v p subject to the individual rationality and the efficiency conditions of the core conditions where h p is the n h allocation that satisfies the core conditions and v p is the value of the non cooperative coalition of player p a fair and efficient allocation should satisfy the core conditions 1 the individual rationality 2 the group rationality and 3 the efficiency chalkiadakis et al 2011 madani and dinar 2012 dinar and hogarth 2015 the first condition means that the cooperative solution should be preferred to the non cooperation individual case for each member of the coalition the second condition is that the allocated share of the grand coalition should be preferred to any allocation in any possible sub coalition finally the third condition is that the total obtainable benefits under the grand coalition should be fully allocated to the members of that coalition dinar and hogarth 2015 the core conditions are represented in eqs 18 20 18 u p v p individual rationality 19 p s u p v s group rationality 20 p n u p v n efficiency where u p is the allocated value under cooperation and v n is the value of the grand coalition the other selected method for measuring the stability of a cooperative game is the loehman stability index loehman et al 1979 the loehman index l i compares the obtained benefits to a beneficiary with the obtained benefits in the coalition which is described as the eq 21 21 l i u p v p p n u p v p p n p n l i 1 where u p is the allocated share to member p the power index illustrates the acceptability and stability of the allocation solution which is defined as s l σ l l 0 s l 1 the coefficient of variation calculated over all members in a given allocation solution the less the value of s l the larger the stability of the allocation solution there are some conditions in which the beneficiary is not satisfied with the allocated gains and may leave the coalition gately 1974 proposed a new index to more intuitively determination of solution stability in which evaluates the loss ratio of the other beneficiaries if one refuse to cooperate and also represents to what extent the coalition will disrupt this index is defined as propensity to disrupt ptd which is described as the eq 22 22 ptd p p z n z p u p v s p u p v p in case of positive values of ptd the beneficiary has a strong threat to leave the grand coalition unless its gain is improved a negative value refers to hyper enthusiasm of the beneficiary for taking part in such coalition while an infinite value reflects the beneficiary s refusal to cooperate finally zero value of ptd indicates the unwillingness to refuse to cooperate 2 5 study area the namdan study area located between 52 0 e to 52 55 e and 30 25 n to 31 15 n in the north of the tashk bakhtegan basin fars province iran fig 4 the study area extends over 1324 k m 2 of the namdan aquifer which is surrounded by high altitudes with the maximum of 3493 m and the average of 2431 m at the plain the 85 of the namdan study area s land cover consists of rangelands 44 and agriculture 41 and the remained 15 is covered by forests rural districts and bare lands the irrigated areas consuming groundwater resources extend over 32 215 ha approximately 67 of total agricultural areas consisting of 6 categories of crops wheat 64 watermelon 12 alfalfa 8 beans 7 sugar beet 5 and other crops potato barley corn lentil onion and rapeseed which have been merged into one category considering the weighted average for their characteristics in this study 4 which their yield varies between 3535 and 47056 kg ha for beans and watermelon respectively the per hectare crop revenue in the study area varies from 50 7 to 237 4 million irr 1 iranian rial the official currency of the islamic republic of iran 1 irr 2 4 10 5 usd 11 18 2018xe com inc 1 and the per hectare crop production costs ranges between 35 4 and 85 3 million irr moa 2013 wri 2016 frwo 2016 the namdan climate is semi arid based on a period of 40 years of recorded climatic data the mean annual precipitation temperature and potential evaporation are approximately 318 8 mm yr 10 6 c and 1515 6 mm yr respectively frwo 2016 the namdan study area consists of a synclinal thick alluvium layer and is a part of the zagros structural zone which is mostly composed of karstic jurassic carbonate cretaceous and eocene calcareous structures the aquifer thickness and groundwater elevation maps and the location of boreholes piezometers and operation wells are illustrated in fig 5 the complementary information obtained from these wells are demonstrated in tables 2 and 3 frwo 2016 the groundwater in the namdan study area flows from north west to south east and according to the data of a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2015 the groundwater elevation varies between 2267 m in the south east and 2400 m in north west parts of the plain fig 5 a 3 application 3 1 groundwater model calibration the groundwater model has been calibrated and verified using observed annual data of groundwater elevation and precipitation during a period of 10 years between 2006 and 2015 hydrologic years frwo 2016 the simulation time step is monthly the observed annual groundwater elevation data in a period of 7 years from 2006 to 2012 have been applied for the calibration and the rest of the data the period of 3 years from 2013 to 2015 for the verification hydraulic conductivity return flow from extraction and recharge from precipitation rates are the selected calibration parameters that their variation ranges are mentioned in table 3 these ranges have been determined using the physical data which were obtained from boreholes and piezometers table 2 considering the soil type and soil texture land use map and return flow and recharge rates zones the study area has been discretized into 50 homogenous cells in terms of the hydrodynamic coefficients topographic levels groundwater elevations and return flow and recharge rates these cells are not uniform in terms of size and their size varies between 7 and 70 km2 the return flow from extraction and the recharge from precipitation rates have been calibrated using trial and error method and hydraulic conductivity have been automatically calibrated by the optimization model mentioned in eq 2 the return and recharge rates have been calibrated under the mentioned 50 cells which are shown in fig 6 the simulated and observed data are compared in fig 7 3 2 input data according to sci 2016 there are three rural districts extending over the namdan study area fig 2 khosroshirin ks shahrmian sm and khonjesht kj which have been considered to be the three beneficiary regions extracting groundwater in the study area all the management problems and cooperation scenarios have been implemented among these three regions the input data of the model are described in the table 4 there are 1630 active operation wells in the namdan study area with the annual extraction of 328 3 million cubic meters mcm that supply agricultural demands frwo 2016 a number of these wells are pumped using fossil fuels like diesel 990 wells and the rest of them are pumped using electricity 640 wells frwo 2016 the cost of per unit of electricity consumption for agricultural purposes kwh is 128 irr kwh and for per unit of diesel fuel liter is 326 irr kwh moe 2014 niopdc 2014 therefore the average cost of a kwh energy consumption for agricultural purposes will be 248 irr kwh the pumping efficiency varies from 24 in diesel powered pumps to 88 in electric powered pumps new and schneider 1988 hence in this study the average pumping efficiency is considered to be 30 and 60 for diesel powered and electric powered pumps respectively according to undp 2014 the average cost of reserving one cubic meter of groundwater is estimated based on replacement costs of each cubic meter of groundwater by aquifer management and flood dispersion projects this cost has been estimated to be 1250 irr per cubic meter of groundwater for iran that has been selected for the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β in this study as it has been mentioned before due to the data and information obtained from moa 2013 the 6 crop types wheat wht watermelon won alfalfa alf beans b sugar beet sb and others ot are the major crops of the study area in terms of area size and their per hectare

n a l f b s b a n d o t 3 3 problem setup and parameter settings for caco in order to obtain the most appropriate parameter values of caco 1200 preliminary experiments were done and it is obtained that the most appropriate population size ranges between 30 and 200 ants for groundwater optimization problems ataie ashtiani and ketabchi 2011 ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b the proposed ant population size for the current study set to a range between 30 and 200 ants then the simulation optimization model was run upon several trials and the suitable population size and the number of generations were found based on the convergence rate of the objective function values ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015b for stopping criterion computations are stopped after the fixed number of simulations satisfying two following criteria 1 the n n n t the ratio should not exceed 10 where n n is the number of generations with no improvement in the objective function value and n t is the number of total generations from the beginning of computation 2 the difference of the objective function values of two consecutive generations should be less than 0 01 such types of stopping criteria were applied by ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015a b according to some preliminary runs and analyses the population size of 150 ants and iteration size of 500 75000 generations have been considered to set for the caco model in this study the time required for each run until obtaining optimal result is approximately 6 1 h using a computer system with a 3 4 ghz core i7 processor and 8 gb ram there will be 10 20 individual runs for each scenario 3 4 policies scenarios the status quo scenario has been defined as the simulation of the current condition of the study area in terms of cultivated area crop types and groundwater extraction volume which are based on the observed data and also information obtained from moa 2013 wri 2016 and frwo 2016 to assess the possibility of cooperation four possible cooperation scenarios have been defined 1 non cooperation 2 partial cooperation of ks sm 3 partial cooperation of sm kj and 4 full cooperation all these scenarios are evaluated under internalization of environmental damages and except the status quo scenario they are called by a specific number from 1 to 8 hereafter table 5 in the non cooperation scenario scenarios 1 and 5 each region acts individually by maximizing own economic gains without considering the extraction externality in the partial cooperation scenarios scenarios 2 3 6 and 7 adjacent regions make a coalition by taking their extraction externalities into account while the other regions act individually in the scenarios 2 and 6 the two adjacent regions ks and sm form a coalition while the region kj acts individually similarly in the scenarios 3 and 7 the two adjacent regions sm and kj form a coalition while the region ks is the individual one finally under full cooperation scenario scenarios 4 and 8 which is so called grand coalition all three regions cooperate with each other by taking their extraction externalities into account considering the status quo scenario there are nine scenarios that will be evaluated over a planning horizon of 30 years table 5 as the extraction externalities are calculated based on the theory of vessels the coalition of ks and kj is impossible to form owing to that they are not adjacent together since the sm region locates between two other regions ks and kj it imports the extraction externality to both of them therefore in the partial cooperation case the half of extraction externality of the sm region is considered such approaches were applied by esteban and albiac 2011 and esteban and dinar 2013 4 results 4 1 general results table 6 shows the sum of net benefits and environmental damages among cooperation scenarios when the environmental damages are internalized and not internalized the sum of net benefits of the status quo scenario and also scenarios 1 and 5 has been represented to make a comparison with the other cooperative scenarios the results show that if the status quo condition continues the sum of the net benefits and environmental damages over the planning horizon will be 6397 and 1078 billion irr respectively the results also show that the highest and the lowest levels of the sum of net benefits are obtained under the scenario 4 11967 billion irr and the scenario 2 7959 billion irr respectively while the scenario 3 gains 9109 billion irr as it can be seen in the table 6 the two partial cooperation scenarios 2 and 3 obtain the lowest sum of net benefits compared to scenarios 1 and 4 this lies in the fact that when two regions collaborate together the third one acts individually and operates the unused amount of groundwater degrading by the two other regions which they ignore due to cooperate with each other the results also represent that the highest and the lowest sum of environmental damages over the planning horizon are incurred in scenarios 1 and 4 by 1733 billion irr and 887 billion irr respectively in scenario 4 the sum of net benefits increases by 20 5 about 2035 billion irr while the sum of environmental damages decreases by 48 8 about 846 billion irr both compared to scenario 1 owing to internalizing the environmental damages in scenarios 5 to 8 the sum of net benefits increases by an average of 9 2 which the highest and the lowest increments occur in scenario 5 by 14 and scenario 8 by 3 3 respectively the sum of environmental damages decreases by an average of 34 which the highest and the lowest decrements occur in the scenario 8 by 72 2 and the scenario 6 by 10 6 respectively table 6 in conclusion the results suggest that collaboration of all regions in scenarios 4 and 8 reaches the highest level of economic gains and provides less damage to the environment furthermore considering the environmental damages in long term planning leads to increase the sum of net benefits in addition to reducing these damages many other water resources related studies such as kucukmehmetoglu and guldmann 2004 siehlow et al 2012 madani and dinar 2012 esteban and dinar 2013 kahil et al 2016 and mohammadpour and bagheri 2017 have reached to similar results and highlighted that full cooperative arrangements grand coalition obtain higher levels of economic gains than unilateral actions for example the results of esteban and dinar 2013 indicated that the sum of net benefits increases 0 6 in full cooperation scenario comparing to non cooperation scenario kahil et al 2016 in another study has reached to similar results which the sum of net benefits increases between 4 and 7 under different climatic scenarios the results of esteban and dinar 2013 and kahil et al 2016 in terms of environmental consideration also indicated that internalization of environmental damages affects the sum of net benefits and the total value of these damages while in esteban and dinar 2013 the sum of net benefits increases by 5 and the the sum of environmental damages reduced by 3 both in full cooperation scenario similar results were obtained in kahil et al 2016 as the sum of net benefits increases by 21 and the environmental damages decreased between 4 and 7 4 2 sensitivity analysis the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion value β 1250 irr m 3 applied in this study is an average value for iran and may vary from region to region so as the value is non exclusive for the namdan study area the sensitivity of the model should be analyzed under different values of β in addition to environmental damage the developed model may be sensitive to intensity of considering the extraction externality due to applying some assumptions like the theory of vessels and also the importance factor in calculation of the extraction externality therefore the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β and the importance factor of extraction externality φ have been subjected to sensitivity analysis the results of the environmental damages sensitivity analysis are demonstrated in tables 6 and the results of the extraction externality sensitivity analysis are illustrated in tables 7 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis of β for sensitivity analyzing of the environmental damages halved and doubled value of the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β is applied to the model 625 and 2500 irr m 3 respectively the results show that the cooperation scenarios are affected by changes in the β value but the order of scenarios in terms of the sum of net benefits is not altered and as already obtained the highest levels of the sum of net benefits is gained in the scenarios 4 and 8 full cooperation scenarios and the lowest values in scenarios 2 and 6 partial cooperation ks sm scenarios the scenarios 1 and 5 non cooperation scenarios gain more benefits than the scenarios 2 3 6 and 7 partial cooperation scenarios the results also represent that with a 50 drop in β from 1250 to 625 irr m 3 the environmental damages decrease between 7 8 and 48 8 19 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 642 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively while with doubling the β from 1250 to 2500 irr m 3 the environmental damages increase between 28 and 85 3 341 billion irr in the scenario 7 and 1122 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively by reducing the unit environmental damage the sum of net benefits increases between 1 4 and 6 1 175 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 530 billion irr in the scenario 6 respectively on the other hand doubling the β reduces the sum of net benefits by a range between 0 7 and 9 3 91 billion irr in the scenario 8 and 1055 billion irr in the scenario 5 respectively table 6 it should be mentioned that it has been not defined any scenario number for sensitivity analysis and the scenarios 5 to 8 has been evaluated under this analysis so all the comparison are about these scenarios to sum up decreasing the environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β value reduces the sum of environmental damages while increases the sum of net benefits on the other hand increasing the unit environmental damage value causes an increment in the sum of environmental damages while reduces the sum of net benefits 4 2 2 sensitivity analysis of φ in the case of extraction externality 25 change in the importance factor φ φ 75 and 125 respectively has been considered to evaluate the sensitivity of the model to the variation of this parameter this sensitivity analysis has been done under both internalization and no internalization of the environmental damages and the obtained results are represented in table 7 similar to the previous analysis the cooperation scenarios are affected by changes in the importance factor of extraction externality value but as already occurred the order of cooperation scenarios does not change the results suggest that with the 25 decrease in value of the importance factor φ 75 the sum of net benefits increases in the range of 29 to 59 3457 billion irr in the scenario 4 and 4694 billion irr in the scenario 2 respectively compared to the default value of φ φ 100 furthermore reducing in the value of the importance factor increases the sum of environmental damages between 1 9 and 38 5 32 billion irr in the scenario 3 and 342 billion irr in the scenario 4 respectively in the case of 25 increase in the value of importance factor φ 125 the sum of net benefits reduces in the range of 17 6 to 63 8 2109 billion irr in the scenario 4 and 5077 billion irr in the scenario 2 respectively comparing to the default value of φ φ 100 also the sum of environmental damages decreases between 6 6 and 68 5 113 billion irr in the scenario 3 and 607 billion irr in the scenario 4 respectively the internalization of environmental damages has no effect on the order of the cooperation scenarios and only caused increase in the sum of net benefits and decrease in the sum of environmental damages similar to the general results in conclusion reduction in the value of importance factor causes increase in both the sum of net benefits and the sum of environmental damages on the other hand the increase in the value of importance factor reduces both the sum of net benefits and the sum of environmental damages in cooperative management approaches novel methodologies which have been employed in the current study can be applied to complex real world problems along with such sensitivity analysis to provide an overview of the effects of prices costs and penalties on beneficiaries tendency to cooperate the environmental damage and extraction externality considered in this study are significant approximate values hence precise estimation of these values considering economic social political and any other considerable aspects would be helpful to achieve more accurate results improve models and also be more applicable to complex real world problems 4 3 allocations of the cooperative gains one of the most important issues in cooperative approaches is finding the fairest way to allocate the obtained economic gains among the beneficiaries in this regard the cgt concepts and solution methods have been applied to this study the cooperative gains have been allocated using the n h and the shapley value methods and then the stability of the allocated gains have been measured by the core conditions the loehman stability index and the ptd index the results of the allocated cooperative gains and the stability of these allocations are illustrated in tables 8 and 9 the allocation results of no internalization of environmental damages and internalization of the various environmental damages values for sensitivity analysis are shown in table 8 the results represent that only the cooperative gains allocated by the n h satisfy the core conditions the loehman stability index shows that the allocated values by the shapley are not stable and do not meet the core conditions the low positive ptd index values also indicates that all of the regions have the potential to threat the two other regions to leave the grand coalition but the intention of this threat is different among them the impossibility of arranging some sub coalitions affects the allocated gains obtained from shapley solution and also the related core results dinar et al 1992 as the results show the allocated gains by the shapley solution method exceeds the core s first condition individual rationality when it comes to region sm which the allocated value to this region is less than what it earns without participating in any coalition under non cooperative form tables 8 and 9 this has caused by the impossibility of forming the partial cooperation between ks and kj due to lack of direct hydraulic connection and also the applied assumption which considered the non cooperation values instead of impossible partial cooperation form of ks and kj similar results in dinar et al 1992 indicated that allocated gains and the derived core are heavily dependent on probabilities of coalitions formation in the shapley value while the n h produces more stable and acceptable results williams 1988 compared several cgt solutions over allocation of 14 project costs and benefits results and concluded that in case the shapley is outside the core the other cgt solutions performance are much stronger the values allocated by the shapley obtains the highest level of cooperative gains for the ks and kj regions while this occurs for the sm region using the n h in case of ks and kj regions the lower ptd index value of the shapley compared to the n h and over all values of β indicates that these two regions tend to be allocated by the shapley the higher ptd index value of the shapley compared to n h in case of the region sm represents that this region tends to be gained by n h method table 8 further the results presented in table 8 suggest that by increasing the value of environmental damage of a unit groundwater depletion β the cooperative gains of the ks and kj regions that have been allocated by the shapley solution method reduce in the case of the n h method the allocated values to the ks and kj regions increase and then decrease to the sm region the allocated values of cooperative gains increase in both the n h and the shapley methods the results of the allocation of the cooperative gains under the sensitivity analysisof the importance factor φ of the extraction externality are illustrated in the table 9 the results suggest that if the importance factor increases by 25 φ 125 the values allocated by the shapley and also the n h will not observe the core conditions while the values of the ptd index indicate that as well on the other hand in the case of reducing the importance factor by 25 φ 75 the values allocated by both of the shapley and the n h solutions are meet the core conditions and the loehman stability index for the shapley value is obtained by 0 22 which indicates that the solution is stable furthermore the values allocated by the shapley and the n h are higher than the obtained values under the default value of φ φ 100 for the all three regions ks sm and kj in the case of internalization of environmental damages the pdt index values are lower for the shapley compare to the n h for the ks and kj regions the lower pdt index values are obtained using the n h for the sm region table 9 the ptd values also indicate that the all three regions threaten to leave the coalition owing to take advantage of such threat to impose a negotiation condition with the aim of obtaining a greater share in conclusion despite the weakness of the shapley value due to impossibility of forming the partial cooperation between ks and kj reduction of the intention of extraction externality placed the values of the shapley in the core however there are many other cgt solution methods that can be employed and be compared to each other using most efficient and powerful stability indexes like the loehman and the ptd these indexes will provide an overview of stakeholders negotiation position in such study areas with such physical orientation that is recommended to the future research studies and government projects especially with the purpose of arranging and instituting cooperative approaches and forming real coalitions in related to real world problems 4 4 the groundwater status as in this study the simulation model of the groundwater flow has been applied various hydraulic outputs of the scenarios are available to present however due to saving space only the results of annual groundwater depletion the hydrograph of the scenarios 4 and 8 and the elevations contour maps of the scenarios 1 and 8 are shown in table 10 figs 7 and 8 respectively the results of the groundwater simulation model for the planning horizon show that without internalization of environmental damages the highest annual depletions occur in the scenarios 1 and 8 by 17 9 and 19 5 mcm per year respectively 0 21 and 0 23 m per year drop in groundwater elevation and the groundwater elevation will drop by 6 2 and 6 7 till the end of the period while the lowest annual depletion occurs in the scenario 2 by 5 2 mcm per year 0 06 m per year drop in groundwater elevation considering the environmental damages the annual depletion reduces in the scenarios 7 and 8 by 22 3 and 71 8 respectively while the annual depletion in the scenarios 1 and 2 increases by 22 9 and 13 5 in the same order table 10 this lies in some reasons like the geographic situations of the regions total area of each of them and also the role of region ks which is located in the upstream of the two other regions and affects them hydraulically fig 8 the groundwater hydrographs and elevation contour maps of each scenario for the total area and each of the regions are ignored to show due to lack of enough space however examples of both hydrographs and contour maps are presented in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 illustrates the groundwater hydrograph of scenarios 4 and 8 the results show that by internalizing the environmental damages and cooperation of all three regions under the scenario 8 which obtains the best groundwater conditions in terms of the elevation and annual depletion the groundwater elevation rises by 4 8 m comparing to the scenario 4 till the end of the planning horizon the groundwater elevation contour maps of the scenarios 1 and 8 are given in fig 8 this figure shows that comparing the scenario 8 with the scenario 1 the groundwater elevation drops in the region ks while rises in the regions sm and kj 5 conclusion nowadays the groundwater resources are known as cprs due to being open access among all water consumers and the subsequent related overexploitation issues especially in farmlands and irrigated areas located in arid and semi arid regions which impose more pressures on this nonrenewable resources in this regard distinguishing and evaluation of such issues are the main challenges that the policy decision makers managers are faced in this study an evolutionary hydro economic simulation optimization model including a calibrated numerical simulation model of groundwater flow was developed to assess potential policies through cooperative arrangements which is an innovation in such area of research the optimal solutions are obtained through caco tool for the first time in this field the developed model was applied to an aquifer divided into three regions and then various cooperation scenarios with the possibility of considering the environmental damages were applied between these regions over a planning horizon of 30 years the applied case study is the namdan aquifer which is located in the north of the tashk bakhtegan basin fars province iran the results of this study suggest that it is more beneficial for the beneficiaries who are farmers in this study to cooperate and if all of them participates into grand coalition the sum of net benefits increases by 20 5 further by taking the environmental damages into account the sum of the net benefits increases by at least 3 up to 14 and the full cooperation of all parties pays off more than the other cooperative arrangements same as the scenarios without internalization of the environmental damages however the tendency to cooperate depends on damage prices and also highly depends on the intensity of consideration of the extraction externalities these results were obtained from the cgt allocation solutions the n h and the shapley value and also stability analysis the core the loehman stability index and the ptd index the results indicate that only the region sm is unwilling to be allocated by the shapley value solution conversely to the two other regions on the other hand all of the three regions are more inclined to be allocated by the n h method comparing to the shapley which is also indicated by the ptd values this is probably because of some technical assumptions mainly the cooperation formations in which in the case of some partial cooperation it was assumed that all three regions act individually similar to the non cooperation scenario owing to the impossibility of forming a coalition between two non adjacent regions the ptd index values have also shown that each of three regions found the threat of leaving the coalition advantageous to persuade the other two regions to grant them a larger share of the total gain therefore it is important to pay attention to the players positions and also the possibilities of establishment of various cooperation arrangements such analyses also give a good perspective to policy and decision makers on pricing fines and taxes values to impose on the groundwater operators and consumers in order to reach a sustainable operation of the cpr the results of the simulation model of the groundwater flow show that under full cooperation scenario grand coalition with the internalization of the environmental damages the groundwater condition of the study areas improves in the mentioned scenario the groundwater elevation rises by 4 8 m and the annual depletion reduces by 14 mcm the results also indicate that in the non cooperation and both partial cooperation scenarios each individual region tries to extract the maximum volume of groundwater that it can which under these competitive conditions the groundwater resource may suffer more pressure and the sum of net benefits decreases by increase in the extraction costs and environmental damages lastly this study shows that the cooperation approach and environmental considerations can improve the economic gains and also the groundwater resource condition it is proposed to find and apply more accurate ways to compute extraction externalities and environmental damages and also implementing the methodology to small scale cases and assessing the social and

6169,the impacts of human activities on the natural water cycle have become increasingly severe due to population growth and economic development therefore it is important to evaluate the contributions of different human activities e g land use change industrial water use and domestic water use on different hydrological variables however existing attribution methods have shortcomings when attributing the impacts of different human activities for instance human activities may only be considered as one impact factor and the total impact of all factors may not be guaranteed to equal 100 of the total change a new approach using multiple scenario simulations from a distributed model was developed in this study to overcome these shortcomings all potential contributions for one impact factor were calculated by fixing the other impact factors at different statuses and the arithmetic mean of all potential contributions was presented as the final result this method ensures that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals the total change in hydrological variables between two periods which was demonstrated mathematically a case study of the wei river basin was used to evaluate the proposed methodology which attributed four impact factors climate change land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use to three hydrological variables evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river the results showed that the new method could attribute the impacts of the four factors to the changes of the three annual average hydrological variables between the period 1956 1980 and the period 1981 2005 these four factors accounted for 373 3 33 3 133 3 and 106 7 of the change in evapotranspiration 129 8 2 2 3 5 and 24 1 of the change in rainfall infiltration and 75 2 4 4 13 4 and 7 0 of the change in streamflow drainage into the yellow river respectively moreover the sum of the relative contributions of the four impact factors to the three hydrological variables was equal to 100 at an annual time scale to avoid the limitations of existing methods we recommend adopting the newly proposed method for evaluating the impacts of climate change and multiple human activities on water cycle processes abbreviations dhm distributed hydrological model mfa method multiple

2016 2018 liu et al 2010 scanlon et al 2007 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 typically climate change results in an increase in atmospheric temperature and modification of precipitation patterns gupta et al 2015 labat et al 2004 lee and kim 2017 liu and xia 2011 xu 2000 zhang et al 2013b whereas human activities have direct e g water withdrawal or indirect e g land use changes and hydraulic construction impacts on the water cycle branger et al 2013 lioubimtseva et al 2005 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2010 ren et al 2002 yuan et al 2016 zhang et al 2013a 2016a as human activities intensify their impacts could exceed those of climate change chang et al 2015 gao et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 making it important to distinguish their effects on the water cycle to support appropriate water

the impacts of different human activities e g land use change industrial water use domestic water use and irrigation water use on water cycle processes rather than grouping all human activities as one impact factor numerous studies have focused on the attribution analysis of climate change and human activities dey and mishra 2017 duethmann et al 2015 harrigan et al 2014 liu et al 2017 sun et al 2014 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 existing attribution methods can be classified into three groups 1 hydrological sensitivity methods and climate elasticity methods 2 prediction and decomposition methods and 3 hydrological model scenario simulation methods in these attribution methods the base period and impact period are obtained using trend analysis methods such as pettitt mann whitney change point statistics gao et al 2011 2013 li et al 2016 ma et al 2008 pettitt 1979 wang et al 2013 sequential cluster analyses wang et al 2009 2013b sequential mann kendall tests yang and tian 2009 zhang et al 2011 2014 moving t tests li et al 2014 and double mass curves zhang et al 2014a in the first group of methods hydrological sensitivity is calculated using eq 1 ahn and merwade 2014 li et al 2007 2016 ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 and climate elasticity is calculated using eq 2 li et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 1 δ q c α 1 δ p β 1 δ e p 2 δ q c q α 2 δ p p β 2 δ e p e p where δ q c is the stream flow change caused by climate change δ p and δ e p are the changes between two research periods in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively q p and e p are the long term arithmetic mean of stream flow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively and α 1 β 1 and α 2 β 2 are the relative sensitivity coefficients the core of these methods is to calculate the relative sensitivity coefficients that are generally calculated using the water balance equation and budyko functions fu 1981 ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 some researchers have extended the climate elasticity method to include additional impact factors such as solar radiation temperature relative humidity wind speed and land use changes gao et al 2016 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2010 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013c yang and yang 2011 zhan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b the second group of methods considers the differences between the mean observed data in the base period and the mean predicted data in the impact period as the results of climate change and the remaining effects are attributed to human activities chang et al 2015 meng et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 wei and zhang 2010 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a zheng et al 2016 for instance gao et al 2011 2013 used the double mass curves of precipitation versus streamflow sediment for the periods before and after the transition year and showed remarkable decreases in the proportionality of streamflow sediment generation zhang et al 2014a used annual streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data in the base period to estimate parameters of a power function and then simulated streamflow in the change period using the estimated parameters in the base period furthermore wang and hejazi 2011 and liang et al 2015 used the budyko curve for the two periods whereas chang et al 2016 and lee and kim 2017 used hydrological models to predict the impact of climate change the third group of methods simulates different situations by changing one factor and fixing the remaining factors to assess the contribution of the altered factor with different hydrological model performances chawla and mujumdar 2015 jia et al 2012 ma et al 2014 sun et al 2014 tuteja et al 2007 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2017 the core of these methods is the modeling of two scenarios with only one impact factor status changed and considers the difference between the two simulated results absolute values or changing trends in the hydrological variables as the contribution of the changed impact factor jia et al 2012 compared the signal strengths of observations and scene simulations of streamflow to calculate the contribution of climate change and human activities using the water and energy transfer processes in large river basins wep l model ma et al 2014 simulated sediment sourcing and transport processes with the soil and water assessment tool swat model and attributed the reduction in suspended sediment to land use change climate change and engineering measures yang et al 2017 first calculated two impacts of climate change by fixing the land use of the base period and impact period and then averaged the two impacts as the final impact of climate change on changes in runoff the above discussion reveals that previous studies either did not try to separate the impacts of multiple human activities e g the first two groups of methods or could not ensure the sum of all impacts equals to 100 of the total change in the case of the third group of methods in a recent study yang et al 2017 developed an improved modeling method to make the sum of the impacts of climate change and land use change equal to 100 but their method only attributed the impacts of the two factors and did not offer a universal method to attribute the impacts of multiple impact factors in the present study a new approach the multiple factor attribution mfa method was developed to evaluate the impacts of climate change and multiple human activities on water cycle processes while eliminating the influence of interactions and keeping the sum of all impact factors equal to 100 2 methodology 2 1 separation principle for multiple factor attribution analysis the process of attribution analysis typically divides a single research period into two periods the base period period 0 or p0 and the impact period period 1 or p1 the contributions of impact factors i e x 1 x 2 x 3 to a hydrological variable streamflow sedimentation etc i e y are then calculated from the base period to the impact period in other words the process attempts to calculate the influence of changes in impact factors i e δ x i x i 1 x i 0 on changes in the hydrological variable i e δ y y 1 y 0 this is called the impact factor contribution i e δ y 1 y x i 1 x j 0 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 δ y 2 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 etc existing model scenario simulation methods typically calculate δ y i by only changing x i from the base period to the impact period and keeping the other impact factors the same i e in the base period which is also called the fixing changing method wang et al 2009 typically the sum of the contributions of all impact factors will not precisely equal the total change in the hydrological variable that is δ y i δ y evaluation of δ y i shows that many results are also possible such as δ y i y x i 1 x j 0 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 δ y i y x i 1 x j 1 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 0 δ y i y x i 1 x j 0 x k 1 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 1 and δ y i y x i 1 x j 1 x k 1 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 1 all of these could be considered as estimation of δ y i which reflects the impact of other factors on x i when their statuses change from the base period to the impact period here these estimations are called conditional contributions however none of them reflects the impacts of x i when the status changes from x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 to x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 fig 1 presents a graphical example of two impact factors to show these differences according to the definition both δ y 1 and δ y 1 are two estimations of δ y 1 by way of p0 p p1 and p0 p p1 however δ y 1 is the contribution of x 1 when x 2 changes from p0 to p1 i e by way of p0 p1 thus δ y 1 and δ y 1 or δ y 1 are not the same in concept therefore it is not suitable to only use δ y 1 or δ y 1 to estimate δ y 1 which has been used widely in former studies in this study the mean value of δ y 1 and δ y 1 was used to reflect the dynamic changes of the other impact factors if there are n impacts to be attributed there are 2 n possible status combinations because each factor has two statuses either in the base period or impact period moreover 2 n 1 pairs of conditional contributions exist for the estimation of δ y i in the averaging process because all of the conditional estimations are used the values of the final calculated contributions will be unique and independent of each other 2 2 general calculation for the separation of the contributions of multiple impact factors in the proposed approach the arithmetic mean of 2 n 1 possible conditional estimations is used for the final calculated contributions of certain impact factors however the contribution of each impact factor has a combination of the simulated values of 2 n scenarios rendering it difficult to memorize the partnership or connections for different situations for all impact factors fortunately there are some relationships between the combination scenarios of n impact factors here a four factor example is introduced to clarify the general contribution equation of multiple impact factors which is also used in the case study table 1 lists all possible combination scenarios of these four factors which represents the potential combined status of the four factors the values 0 and 1 in table 1 are status flags which identify the period status of the correlative impact factors for example in scenario s4 the factors x 1 and x 2 are in the impact period and the factors x 3 and x 4 are in the base period for the sake of simplicity and convenience s1 is also used to represent the value of y x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 x 4 0 and s2 is used to represent the value of y x 1 1 x 2 0 x 3 0 x 4 0 thus the total change in a hydrological variable is denoted by s16 s1 and the other situations s j are hypothetical situations used to calculate the contributions of x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 accordingly the contribution of the four impact factors can be calculated as follows 3 δ x 1 1 8 s 2 s 1 s 4 s 3 s 6 s 5 s 8 s 7 s 10 s 9 s 12 s 11 s 14 s 13 s 16 s 15 4 δ x 2 1 8 s 3 s 1 s 4 s 2 s 7 s 5 s 8 s 6 s 11 s 9 s 12 s 10 s 15 s 13 s 16 s 14 5 δ x 3 1 8 s 5 s 1 s 6 s 2 s 7 s 3 s 8 s 4 s 13 s 9 s 14 s 10 s 15 s 11 s 16 s 12 6 δ x 4 1 8 s 9 s 1 s 10 s 2 s 11 s 3 s 12 s 4 s 13 s 5 s 14 s 6 s 15 s 7 s 16 s 8 analyzing the coefficient of each scenario in eqs 3 6 as well as the status flags in table 1 reveals that the positive and negative signs of each s j in the equations can be automatically derived from table 1 if the status of x i in scenario s j is 1 in table 1 then the coefficient of s j in the contribution separation equation of x i will be 1 and flag 0 corresponds to 1 in the equations thus the contribution separation equation of each impact factor can be summarized as eq 7 which can then be used for multiple impact factors i e not only four factors this can be proven by the fact that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors in

s8 2 3 use of the multiple impact factor attribution method the first step in the usage of the developed method is determining the research periods the base period and the impact period the change time or change point of the two periods is determined according to the aims of the study for which the use of trend analyses is not mandatory there are several reasons for this first it is not possible for these methods to indicate that the base period has negligible human activity wang et al 2013d wang 2014 or the obtained change point could be induced only by climate change second one method may identify many change points and other methods may identify different change points third the change points of different impact factors e g precipitation land use change water use etc and hydrological variables e g streamflow sediment etc may not be in the same year fourth within the same basin the change points of different rivers may differ resulting in a highly complex attribution analysis of the whole basin fifth in some practical applications we may want to know the contribution of different impact factors on streamflow reduction before and after a given year which cannot be obtained from trend analysis methods for example in practice we want to know the contributions of climate change and human water intake on the reduction in streamflow before and after 1980 which is the year for separating moderate and intensive water intake levels to support wei river basin water resource management however according to different studies the streamflow change point varies substantially none of which are 1980 for instance the change point of huaxian station was 1968 gao et al 2013 1990 chang et al 2015 li et al 2016 and 1993 zuo et al 2014 and the change point of zhuangtou station was 1992 li et al 2016c 1994 gao et al 2013 zuo et al 2014 and 1995 chang et al 2015 moreover some studies did not use the change point to determine the base period and impact period chang et al 2015 used 1956 1970 as the base period and 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2006 and 1971 2006 as the five impact periods jiang et al 2015 used 1960 1970 as the base period and used decadal moving windows e g 1970 1980 1971 1981 and 1999 2009 as the impact periods the second step in using the newly proposed method is determining the number of impact factors and setting the simulation scenario table the table is similar to that presented in table 1 and has n rows and 2 n columns where n is the number of the impact factors to be attributed there is a shortcut to filling the table quickly using s6 and s14 in table 1 for example it can be seen that the flag status sequences from x 4 to x 1 of the two scenarios are 0101 and 1101 which are the binary codes of numbers 5 and 13 thus the flag status sequence from x n to x 1 of scenario s j is the binary code of the serial number j 1 in n digits the third step in this method is determining the attributed hydrological variables and using a distributed hydrological model dhm to model the 2 n scenarios to derive the values of the target hydrological variables in different scenarios a dhm should take the impact factors as model inputs and simulate the target hydrological variables additionally the model should be calibrated and validated well before the attribution analysis the final step in this method is calculating the contribution first the change of the hydrological variables caused by each impact factor is calculated using eq 7 second the relative contribution of each impact factor is calculated using eq 9 which is improved from previous studies duethmann et al 2015 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 by considering the positive or negative effects i e the sign of the contribution represents an increase positive sign or decrease negative sign effect 9 β i δ x i j 1 n δ x j 100 i 1 n where β i is the relative contribution of factor i δ x i is the change of hydrological variables caused by impact factor x i and n is the number of impact factors 2 4 distributed hydrological model the wep l model jia et al 2006 is a type of dhm for large river basins that adopts contour bands as calculation units which are then characterized by coupling simulations of natural hydrological energy transfer and artificial water use processes evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith equation during periods of heavy rainfall the multi layered green ampt model jia and tamai 1997 is used to calculate the infiltration excess runoff generation and the saturation excess runoff is simulated through a water balance analysis of the unsaturated soil layers in the remaining periods a one dimensional kinematic wave approach is adopted for overland and riverine runoff routings additionally the interactions between surface water and groundwater are considered using the boussinesq equations to simulate groundwater flow snowmelt is simulated by employing a temperature index method the annual land use data are used to reflect the change of land use cover which is linearly interpolated from the collected official release data using the year span as the weight the artificial water use processes are subdivided into three parts according to the water supply targets agricultural industrial and domestic water use in each process the annual and administrative regional historical statistical water use data are used and downscaled to daily and model calculation unit i e contour band scales which are then used to evaluate the impacts of water use on natural hydrological processes for more details about this model refer to jia et al 2005 2006 and zhou et al 2018 2 5 model evaluation criteria the values of relative error re nash sutcliffe coefficient ne nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation coefficient cc are used as quantitative measures for model performance evaluation which are defined as follows 10 re i 1 n s i i 1 n o i i 1 n o i 100 11 ne 1 i

km2 was selected as the case study area to test the developed mfa method fig 2 this basin is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin zhan et al 2014 jing river and beiluo river are the two largest tributaries of the wei river the guanzhong plain is located downstream of the wei river which experiences considerable human activity the wei river basin has a semi humid and semi arid continental climate with a mean air temperature of 7 8 13 5 c and average annual precipitation 1956 2005 of 545 mm 60 of which falls from july to october mountainous regions have higher precipitation than plains and the southern part receives more rain than the northern part 3 2 data the digital elevation model dem was derived from the gtopo30 dataset developed by the u s geological survey eros data center http eros usgs gov land use data for 1980 1990 2000 and 2005 were downloaded from the data sharing infrastructure of earth system science http www geodata cn information on soil type and the corresponding characteristic parameters was sourced from the national second soil survey data and soil types of china data on irrigation districts were collected from the yellow river water conservancy commission yrwcc ministry of water resources of china artificial water use data were obtained from the second countrywide comprehensive water resources planning in china 1956 2000 and water resources bulletin of yellow river 2001 2005 daily meteorological observations were provided by the china meteorological administration including precipitation air temperature relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed more dense precipitation data were provided by the yrwcc 1956 2005 time series data 1956 2005 of observed streamflow at huaxian and zhuangtou stations fig 2 which were used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model were also provided by the yrwcc for more information about the data refer to jia et al 2006 in the attribution study the period of 1956 1980 was selected as the base period and that of 1981 2005 as the impact period four impact factors were chosen for the attribution analysis climate change land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use additionally three hydrological variables were selected as the attribution targets evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river no data were available for any of the three hydrological variables at the scale of the wei river basin and were simulated using the dhm the annual arithmetic mean values of the four impact factors in the two periods are shown in table 2 land use showed the smallest changes between the two periods among the factors and its contribution to the change of hydrological variables was less than 10 of that caused by climate change in the results section fig 3 shows the observed annual streamflow at both huaxian and zhuangtou stations because the downstream area of these stations fig 2 is small and has no larger adjoining tributary the sum of their streamflows could somewhat represent the streamflow drainage into the yellow river fig 3 also shows that the streamflow at huaxian station comprises almost 90 of the streamflow draining into the yellow river and the mean streamflow decreased from the base period to the impact period 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the wei river model established by zhou et al 2009 was used in the study this model is part of the yellow river model in the wep l model jia et al 2006 the details of the calibrated parameters which are not discussed here can be found in jia et al 2006 and zhou et al 2009 the calibration period in this study was 1956 1990 and the validation period was 1991 2005 fig 4 and table 3 show the results of the monthly streamflow calibration and validation using the wei river model at huaxian and zhuangtou stations in the beiluo river basin i e zhuangtou station most rain fell in the summer season and within 1 or 2 h periods which typically triggers the generation of excess runoff exceeding the capacity for infiltration however hourly or shorter time scale precipitation data are needed to run the model which did not exist in our study this might explain why the nash sutcliffe coefficient was low in this catchment because of the inaccurate simulation of the peak flow meanwhile the average annual streamflow of zhuangtou station was very small compared with the annual average streamflow of huaxian station the huaxian catchment is calibrated well as is the sum of the two catchments therefore we consider that the model is calibrated and validated well in this study and is suitable for the attribution analysis 4 2 results of the multiple factor attribution analysis the simulated annual mean values of the three hydrological variables for 16 scenarios with the wep l model are shown in table 4 the cell values are the annual mean of the 25 year simulated values of the whole wei river basin based on the data in table 4 the contribution of each impact factor on the hydrological variables was calculated using eqs 7 and 9 and the results are shown in table 5 some factors caused the hydrological variables to increase and others had the reverse effect a negative sign of δ x denotes a decrease and a positive sign denotes an increase however the combination of the four factors caused a decrease as denoted by the negative value of s16 s1 the sum of the contributions of all considered factors equaled the total change in all factors i e the sum of δ x equaled the value of s16 s1 thus for this case study the proposed mfa method effectively executed the attribution analysis of multiple human activities and successfully separated the impacts of multiple factors on different hydrological variables without notable errors according to the value of the contribution of each impact factor β in table 5 the results revealed that climate change was the main reason for the reduction in evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river contributing 373 3 129 8 and 75 2 respectively whereas land use change had the lowest impact all four impact factors decreased the streamflow drainage into the yellow river but they compensated for the impact of the other variables on evapotranspiration and rainfall infiltration the contribution could be larger than 100 or smaller than 100 which indicated that the absolute value of δx was greater than the total sum i e the absolute value of s16 s1 this indicated that not all of the four impact factors had the same increasing or decreasing effect on the hydrological variables therefore the 373 3 relative contribution of climate change on evapotranspiration meant that the impact of climate change on evapotranspiration was 3 733 times greater than the integrated effect of the four impact factors and the negative sign meant that it had a decreasing effect finally land use change had the smallest contribution among the four factors and in most cases its contribution was less than 10 of the contribution of climate change table 5 moreover the new mfa method yields a time series of the relative contributions of each impact factor for each year from the same simulated scenarios for example if 1956 is taken as the base period and 1981 as the impact period the trend shown in fig 5 is the annual relative contribution of the four impact factors on the three hydrological variables as shown in fig 6 the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equaled the total change in hydrological variables between the two periods at an annual time scale 5 discussion most hydrological sensitivity analysis methods climate elasticity methods and the methods based on statistic data assume that changes to soil water storage and deep ground water losses can be ignored in the base and impact periods and that the precipitation runoff relationship is independent of human activity in the base period however these assumptions are poorly validated li et al 2007 wang and hejazi 2011 wang 2014 zheng et al 2009 furthermore only the hydrological variables and the impact factors that can be expressed as mathematical functions can be attributed by these methods which cannot calculate the attributions of multiple human activities by contrast the model scenario simulation method and the mfa method used in this study do not pose such problems and can attribute multiple impact factors on any hydrological variable that the dhm has simulated when calculating the contribution of a given factor in the model scenario simulation method the statuses of the other factors are fixed which results in the overestimation or underestimation of the effect thus the sum of the contribution will be higher or lower than 100 yang et al 2017 proposed a method that could make the sum of the impacts of climate change and land use change equal to 100 but their method only attributed the impacts of two factors differing from yang et al 2017 our method offers a more generalized approach for multiple impact factor attribution regardless there are several disadvantages to our method 1 the attribution results depend on the dhm used because different models may yield different results and the uncertainty of the model will be transferred to the analysis results 2 the considered impact factors should be the same as the independent input data of the distributed hydrological model 3 if the dhm cannot simulate the process of certain impact factors it cannot determine the attribution of these factors for example in our case study attribution analysis of terrace could not be performed because the dhm could not simulate the process explicitly according to the definition of the mfa method once the values of the hydrological variables in the 2 n situations are given it is easy to calculate the contribution using the separation equation thus a dhm is not the only technique that may be used for example experiments may be performed or multiple regression equations may be built from the hydrological variables for all impact factors to achieve the 2 n situations the advantage of a dhm is that it can provide more details on the hydrological variables such as those at different spatial or temporal scales the interactions between different hydrological variables and variables with no observed data that an experiment or regression equation could not handle importantly long term data of the impact factors were used in the dhm in this study to perform the long term simulation of hydrological variables and then averaged or used for one year to calculate the relative contributions thus the new method attributed changes over a long term series of whole research period not only the average status of the base or impact period which could also enable attribution analysis on an annual time scale in the appendix we discuss the mathematical proof of the method which indicates that once the 2 n scenarios values are obtained the final result will be uniquely determined therefore the uncertainty of our method comes from the method by which the 2 n scenario values are obtained i e the dhm in other words the uncertainty of the dhm is transferred to the simulation results if a different dhm were used the attribution results might not be the same therefore it is necessary to use different dhms to conduct the same attribution analysis to better generalize the findings of the present study when applying a dhm the simulated values rather than the observed values of the hydrological variables are used for the attribution analysis because the simulated values of the base period and impact period are systematically consistent with the other 2 n 2 scenarios which is the foundation of the separation equation moreover most of the hydrological variables do not have long term observed values like the three target hydrological variables used in this case study practically the observed annual mean values of the sum of huaxian and zhuangtou stations in the base and impact periods were 276 m3 s and 210 m3 s and the simulated values were 288 m3 s and 208 m3 s with relative errors of 4 3 and 0 9 respectively thus the simulated values reasonably represented the average status of the observed data in the case study of the wei river basin the impacts of climate change and three human activities i e land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use on three hydrological variables i e evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river were calculated using the new method the results of the case study demonstrated the ability of the mfa method to attribute the changes before and after 1980 which also indicated that the new method could attribute hydrological variables for which observation data are not available in our study the annual precipitation between the two periods decreased by 31 2 mm industrial and domestic water use increased by 8 2 mm and agricultural irrigation water use increased by 6 8 mm combined these changes resulted in a decrease in streamflow if we did not consider the cross effects on hydrological processes and the effect of land use the contribution of precipitation would be 31 2 31 2 8 2 6 8 67 5 which also supports climate change as the main impact factor moreover in the dhm we simulated the process of return flow of water used that drained back into the river in view of this we believe that our result is reasonable regardless the uncertainty of the simulated scenarios from the dhm should be analyzed for model structure error data errors and parameter uncertainty in a future study according to the literature the contribution of climate change on runoff or streamflow varied in the upper areas of huaxian and zhuangtou stations gao et al 2013 found that the impact of precipitation was 33 5 and 5 9 for huaxian and zhuangtou while rest of the variation was attributed to human activities zuo et al 2014 found that the contribution of climate change was about 51 and 65 for huaxian and zhuangtou whereas the contribution of human activities was about 43 and 33 and the remaining 6 and 2 was attributed to other factors respectively li et al 2016c found that the impacts of climate change land cover change and direct human activities were 69 4 3 8 and 26 8 for huaxian and 63 4 7 9 and 28 7 for zhuangtou respectively similar to our results jiang et al 2015 and chang et al 2015 separated the decadal impact of climate change and human activities for the base period of 1960 1970 jiang et al 2015 and 1956 1970 chang et al 2015 at huaxian station without performing a change time analysis jiang et al 2015 found that the impact of climate change was 70 5 8 4 79 6 and 80 2 using the decomposition method and 67 8 7 1 76 1 and 77 2 using the sensitivity method respectively of the impact period of 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 1999 2009 however chang et al 2015 obtained values of 36 28 53 10 and 34 on the impact periods of 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2006 and 1971 2006 respectively the large differences in the contribution of climate change on runoff or streamflow among previous studies of the wei river basin are likely the result of the use of different attribution methods input data research period etc in the wei river basin the dams and terrace are also impact factors that influence the hydrological processes but were not considered as separate impact factors in our case study this was partly because the model used does not explicitly include a module to simulate the effects of dam regulation and terrace and partly due to the lack of detailed reservoir regulation data and terrace data li et al 2016c indicated that the impact degrees of reservoirs and dams were less than 10 in the study catchment nevertheless in future research we should consider these factors by modifying the dhm to simulate the process of terraces on surface runoff by interpreting the position and area of terraces from remote sensing data and by modifying the dhm to simulate the dam regulation effect on streamflow by collecting the regulation rules and storage capacity of each dam 6 conclusions to separate the impacts of climate change and multiple human activities on different hydrological variables a new mfa method was developed based on a dhm the proposed technique is a model scenario simulation method which averages the impacts of certain factors for different combined statuses of the remaining impact factors a general contribution separate equation based on these scenario values is solved to calculate the contribution of each factor it was demonstrated that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals the total change in the hydrological variables in the case study of the wei river basin china it was shown that the new method is capable of calculating the contributions of multiple human activities on hydrological variables while ensuring that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals 100 at different time scales furthermore the results of case study showed that climate change was the main factor driving the decreases in evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river whereas land use change had the lowest impact among the four investigated factors future studies will concentrate on quantification and possible reduction of the uncertainty of the simulation results of the dhm and consider other human activities e g

suggestions of external reviewers appendix a mathematical proof of the mfa method this appendix presents a mathematical proof that the sum of the contribution of all factors equals the total change of the hydrological variable i e a n s a s 1 where a 2 n first take the simple situation of two impact factors suppose the four combined scenarios are s 1 0 0 s2 1 0 s 3 0 1 and s 4 1 1 where 0 is in the base period and 1 is in the impact period also s i is used directly as the value of the hydrological variable in the corresponding scenario according to eq 5 the following results can be deduced and the recommendation is proven for two factor situations a1 δ x 1 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 a2 δ x 2 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 a3 a 2 δ x 1 δ x 2 s 4 s 1 second the universal situation is discussed with n factors table a1 presents a five impact factor example the scenarios are divided into n 1 groups based on the value of sc in eq 6 thus it can be deduced that each group has c n i n i n i i 0 1 n scenarios the first and last scenario serial numbers of each group are p g 1 k 0 g 1 c n k g 0 1 n and q g k 0 g c n k g 0 1 n respectively the sum of the simulated values in the same group can be written as t g i p g q g s i g 0 1 n specifically t 0 s 1 and t n s a where a 2 n it can also be deduced that the value of sc in each group is sc 2 g n g 0 1 n moreover the sc values of gi and gn i groups are the same but have the opposite signs the following is defined u j t n j t j j 0 1 n 2 where n 2 is the integer part of the number n 2 e g 5 2 2 or 6 2 3 thus u 0 t n t 0 s a s 1 where a 2 n therefore the total sum of the contributions of n considered factors eq 6 can be written as a4 a n 1 2 n 1 g 0 n 2 g n t g 1 2 n 1 j 0 n 2 n 2 j u j taking the factors in the same status as one compound factor the n factor situation can be considered as a combination of numerous two factor situations e g factor x 1 x 1 x 2 and x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 in table a1 so the contribution of x 1 and x 2 can be calculated using eqs a1 and a2 a5 δ x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 1 2 s 1 s 7 s 26 s 32 a6 δ x 2 δ x 3 δ x 4 δ x 5 1 2 s 1 s 7 s 26 s 32 like this combination and attribution in eqs a5 and a6 all potential separations for two combination factors are calculated which are summed to yield eq a7 and resolve the value of u j in eq a8 a7 c n 1 j 1 a n c n j t 0 t j t n j c n j t n 2 c n j u 0 u j 2 j 0 1 n 2 a8 u j c n j u 0 2 c n 1 j 1 a n j 0 1 n 2 replacing the value of u j in eq a4 with eq a8 yields eq a9 and resolves the value of a n u 0 in eq a10 a9 2 n 1 a n n u 0 j 1 n 2 n 2 j c n j u 0 2 c n 1 j 1 a n a10 a n u 0 n j

6169,the impacts of human activities on the natural water cycle have become increasingly severe due to population growth and economic development therefore it is important to evaluate the contributions of different human activities e g land use change industrial water use and domestic water use on different hydrological variables however existing attribution methods have shortcomings when attributing the impacts of different human activities for instance human activities may only be considered as one impact factor and the total impact of all factors may not be guaranteed to equal 100 of the total change a new approach using multiple scenario simulations from a distributed model was developed in this study to overcome these shortcomings all potential contributions for one impact factor were calculated by fixing the other impact factors at different statuses and the arithmetic mean of all potential contributions was presented as the final result this method ensures that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals the total change in hydrological variables between two periods which was demonstrated mathematically a case study of the wei river basin was used to evaluate the proposed methodology which attributed four impact factors climate change land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use to three hydrological variables evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river the results showed that the new method could attribute the impacts of the four factors to the changes of the three annual average hydrological variables between the period 1956 1980 and the period 1981 2005 these four factors accounted for 373 3 33 3 133 3 and 106 7 of the change in evapotranspiration 129 8 2 2 3 5 and 24 1 of the change in rainfall infiltration and 75 2 4 4 13 4 and 7 0 of the change in streamflow drainage into the yellow river respectively moreover the sum of the relative contributions of the four impact factors to the three hydrological variables was equal to 100 at an annual time scale to avoid the limitations of existing methods we recommend adopting

whitney change point statistics gao et al 2011 2013 li et al 2016 ma et al 2008 pettitt 1979 wang et al 2013 sequential cluster analyses wang et al 2009 2013b sequential mann kendall tests yang and tian 2009 zhang et al 2011 2014 moving t tests li et al 2014 and double mass curves zhang et al 2014a in the first group of methods hydrological sensitivity is calculated using eq 1 ahn and merwade 2014 li et al 2007 2016 ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2010 and climate elasticity is calculated using eq 2 li et al 2012 wu et al 2017 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 zhan et al 2014 zheng et al 2009 1 δ q c α 1 δ p β 1 δ e p 2 δ q c q α 2 δ p p β 2 δ e p e p where δ q c is the stream flow change caused by climate change δ p and δ e p are the changes between two research periods in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively q p and e p are the long term arithmetic mean of stream flow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively and α 1 β 1 and α 2 β 2 are the relative sensitivity coefficients the core of these methods is to calculate the relative sensitivity coefficients that are generally calculated using the water balance equation and budyko functions fu 1981 ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2001 zheng et al 2009 some researchers have extended the climate elasticity method to include additional impact factors such as solar radiation temperature relative humidity wind speed and land use changes gao et al 2016 liu et al 2017 ma et al 2010 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2013c yang and yang 2011 zhan et al 2014 zhang et al 2016b the second group of methods considers the differences between the mean observed data in the base period and the mean predicted data in the impact period as the results of climate change and the remaining effects are attributed to human activities chang et al 2015 meng et al 2016 wang and hejazi 2011 wei and zhang 2010 ye et al 2013 zhang et al 2016a zheng et al 2016 for instance gao et al 2011 2013 used the double mass curves of precipitation versus streamflow sediment for the periods before and after the transition year and showed remarkable decreases in the proportionality of streamflow sediment generation zhang et al 2014a used annual streamflow precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data in the base period to estimate parameters of a power function and then simulated streamflow in the change period using the estimated parameters in the base period furthermore wang and hejazi 2011 and liang et al 2015 used the budyko curve for the two periods whereas chang et al 2016 and lee and kim 2017 used hydrological models to predict the impact of climate change the third group of methods simulates different situations by changing one factor and fixing the remaining factors to assess the contribution of the altered factor with different hydrological model performances chawla and mujumdar 2015 jia et al 2012 ma et al 2014 sun et al 2014 tuteja et al 2007 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2017 the core of these methods is the modeling of two scenarios with only one impact factor status changed and considers the difference between the two simulated results absolute values or changing trends in the hydrological variables as the contribution of the changed impact factor jia et al 2012 compared the signal strengths of observations and scene simulations of streamflow to calculate the contribution of climate change and human activities using the water and energy transfer processes in large river basins wep l model ma et al 2014 simulated sediment sourcing and transport processes with the soil and water assessment tool swat model and attributed the reduction in suspended sediment to land use change climate change and engineering measures yang et al 2017 first calculated two impacts of climate change by fixing the land use of the base period and impact period and then averaged the two impacts as the final impact of climate change on changes in runoff the above discussion reveals that previous studies either did not try to separate the impacts of multiple human activities e g the first two groups of methods or could not ensure the sum of all impacts equals to 100 of the total change in the case of the third group of methods in a recent study yang et al 2017 developed an improved modeling method to make the sum of the impacts of climate change and land use change equal to 100 but their method only attributed the impacts of the two factors and did not offer a universal method to attribute the impacts of multiple impact factors in the present study a new approach the multiple factor attribution mfa method was developed to evaluate the impacts of climate change and multiple human activities on water cycle processes while eliminating the influence of interactions and keeping the sum of all impact factors equal to 100 2 methodology 2 1 separation principle for multiple factor attribution analysis the process of attribution analysis typically divides a single research period into two periods the base period period 0 or p0 and the impact period period 1 or p1 the contributions of impact factors i e x 1 x 2 x 3 to a hydrological variable streamflow sedimentation etc i e y are then calculated from the base period to the impact period in other words the process attempts to calculate the influence of changes in impact factors i e δ x i x i 1 x i 0 on changes in the hydrological variable i e δ y y 1 y 0 this is called the impact factor contribution i e δ y 1 y x i 1 x j 0 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 δ y 2 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 etc existing model scenario simulation methods typically calculate δ y i by only changing x i from the base period to the impact period and keeping the other impact factors the same i e in the base period which is also called the fixing changing method wang et al 2009 typically the sum of the contributions of all impact factors will not precisely equal the total change in the hydrological variable that is δ y i δ y evaluation of δ y i shows that many results are also possible such as δ y i y x i 1 x j 0 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 0 δ y i y x i 1 x j 1 x k 0 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 0 δ y i y x i 1 x j 0 x k 1 y x i 0 x j 0 x k 1 and δ y i y x i 1 x j 1 x k 1 y x i 0 x j 1 x k 1 all of these could be considered as estimation of δ y i which reflects the impact of other factors on x i when their statuses change from the base period to the impact period here these estimations are called conditional contributions however none of them reflects the impacts of x i when the status changes from x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 to x 1 1 x 2 1 x 3 1 fig 1 presents a graphical example of two impact factors to show these differences according to the definition both δ y 1 and δ y 1 are two estimations of δ y 1 by way of p0 p p1 and p0 p p1 however δ y 1 is the contribution of x 1 when x 2 changes from p0 to p1 i e by way of p0 p1 thus δ y 1 and δ y 1 or δ y 1 are not the same in concept therefore it is not suitable to only use δ y 1 or δ y 1 to estimate δ y 1 which has been used widely in former studies in this study the mean value of δ y 1 and δ y 1 was used to reflect the dynamic changes of the other impact factors if there are n impacts to be attributed there are 2 n possible status combinations because each factor has two statuses either in the base period or impact period moreover 2 n 1 pairs of conditional contributions exist for the estimation of δ y i in the averaging process because all of the conditional estimations are used the values of the final calculated contributions will be unique and independent of each other 2 2 general calculation for the separation of the contributions of multiple impact factors in the proposed approach the arithmetic mean of 2 n 1 possible conditional estimations is used for the final calculated contributions of certain impact factors however the contribution of each impact factor has a combination of the simulated values of 2 n scenarios rendering it difficult to memorize the partnership or connections for different situations for all impact factors fortunately there are some relationships between the combination scenarios of n impact factors here a four factor example is introduced to clarify the general contribution equation of multiple impact factors which is also used in the case study table 1 lists all possible combination scenarios of these four factors which represents the potential combined status of the four factors the values 0 and 1 in table 1 are status flags which identify the period status of the correlative impact factors for example in scenario s4 the factors x 1 and x 2 are in the impact period and the factors x 3 and x 4 are in the base period for the sake of simplicity and convenience s1 is also used to represent the value of y x 1 0 x 2 0 x 3 0 x 4 0 and s2 is used to represent the value of y x 1 1 x 2 0 x 3 0 x 4 0 thus the total change in a hydrological variable is denoted by s16 s1 and the other situations s j are hypothetical situations used to calculate the contributions of x 1 x 2 x 3 and x 4 accordingly the contribution of the four impact factors can be calculated as follows 3 δ x 1 1 8 s 2 s 1 s 4 s 3 s 6 s 5 s 8 s 7 s 10 s 9 s 12 s 11 s 14 s 13 s 16 s 15 4 δ x 2 1 8 s 3 s 1 s 4 s 2 s 7 s 5 s 8 s 6 s 11 s 9 s 12 s 10 s 15 s 13 s 16 s 14 5 δ x 3 1 8 s 5 s 1 s 6 s 2 s 7 s 3 s 8 s 4 s 13 s 9 s 14 s 10 s 15 s 11 s 16 s 12 6 δ x 4 1 8 s 9 s 1 s 10 s 2 s 11 s 3 s 12 s 4 s 13 s 5 s 14 s 6 s 15 s 7 s 16 s 8 analyzing the coefficient of each scenario in eqs 3 6 as well as the status flags in table 1 reveals that the positive and negative signs of each s j in the equations can be automatically derived from table 1 if the status of x i in scenario s j is 1 in table 1 then the coefficient of s j in the contribution separation equation of x i will be 1 and flag 0 corresponds to 1 in the equations thus the contribution separation equation of each impact factor can be summarized as eq 7 which can then be used for multiple impact factors i e not only four factors this can be proven by the fact that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors in eq 7 equals the total change in the hydrological variable between different periods for example a4 s16 s1 in table 1 see also appendix a 7 δ x i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n e i j s j i 1 n 8 a n i 1 n δ x i 1 2 n 1 j 1 2 n sc n j s j sc n j i 1 n e i j where δ x i is the change of hydrological variables caused by factor x i e i j is the weight coefficient of the it h factor in scenario j i e if the status flag is 1 it is 1 otherwise it is 1 s j is the simulation value of scenario j n is the total number of considered factors an is the sum of the contributions of n factors and sc n j is the sum of the coefficient e i j of n considered as factors in scenario j i e the number of 1 flags minus the number of 0 flags in the same scenario e g in table 1 sc 4 1 4 for scenario s1 and sc 4 8 2 for scenario s8 2 3 use of the multiple impact factor attribution method the first step in the usage of the developed method is determining the research periods the base period and the impact period the change time or change point of the two periods is determined according to the aims of the study for which the use of trend analyses is not mandatory there are several reasons for this first it is not possible for these methods to indicate that the base period has negligible human activity wang et al 2013d wang 2014 or the obtained change point could be induced only by climate change second one method may identify many change points and other methods may identify different change points third the change points of different impact factors e g precipitation land use change water use etc and hydrological variables e g streamflow sediment etc may not be in the same year fourth within the same basin the change points of different rivers may differ resulting in a highly complex attribution analysis of the whole basin fifth in some practical applications we may want to know the contribution of different impact factors on streamflow reduction before and after a given year which cannot be obtained from trend analysis methods for example in practice we want to know the contributions of climate change and human water intake on the reduction in streamflow before and after 1980 which is the year for separating moderate and intensive water intake levels to support wei river basin water resource management however according to different studies the streamflow change point varies substantially none of which are 1980 for instance the change point of huaxian station was 1968 gao et al 2013 1990 chang et al 2015 li et al 2016 and 1993 zuo et al 2014 and the change point of zhuangtou station was 1992 li et al 2016c 1994 gao et al 2013 zuo et al 2014 and 1995 chang et al 2015 moreover some studies did not use the change point to determine the base period and impact period chang et al 2015 used 1956 1970 as the base period and 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2006 and 1971 2006 as the five impact periods jiang et al 2015 used 1960 1970 as the base period and used decadal moving windows e g 1970 1980 1971 1981 and 1999 2009 as the impact periods the second step in using the newly proposed method is determining the number of impact factors and setting the simulation scenario table the table is similar to that presented in table 1 and has n rows and 2 n columns where n is the number of the impact factors to be attributed there is a shortcut to filling the table quickly using s6 and s14 in table 1 for example it can be seen that the flag status sequences from x 4 to x 1 of the two scenarios are 0101 and 1101 which are the binary codes of numbers 5 and 13 thus the flag status sequence from x n to x 1 of scenario s j is the binary code of the serial number j 1 in n digits the third step in this method is determining the attributed hydrological variables and using a distributed hydrological model dhm to model the 2 n scenarios to derive the values of the target hydrological variables in different scenarios a dhm should take the impact factors as model inputs and simulate the target hydrological variables additionally the model should be calibrated and validated well before the attribution analysis the final step in this method is calculating the contribution first the change of the hydrological variables caused by each impact factor is calculated using eq 7 second the relative contribution of each impact factor is calculated using eq 9 which is improved from previous studies duethmann et al 2015 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2017 zheng et al 2016 by considering the positive or negative effects i e the sign of the contribution represents an increase positive sign or decrease negative sign effect 9 β i δ x i j 1 n δ x j 100 i 1 n where β i is the relative contribution of factor i δ x i is the change of hydrological variables caused by impact factor x i and n is the number of impact factors 2 4 distributed hydrological model the wep l model jia et al 2006 is a type of dhm for large river basins that adopts contour bands as calculation units which are then characterized by coupling simulations of natural hydrological energy transfer and artificial water use processes evapotranspiration is calculated using the penman monteith equation during periods of heavy rainfall the multi layered green ampt model jia and tamai 1997 is used to calculate the infiltration excess runoff generation and the saturation excess runoff is simulated through a water balance analysis of the unsaturated soil layers in the remaining periods a one dimensional kinematic wave approach is adopted for overland and riverine runoff routings additionally the interactions between surface water and groundwater are considered using the boussinesq equations to simulate groundwater flow snowmelt is simulated by employing a temperature index method the annual land use data are used to reflect the change of land use cover which is linearly interpolated from the collected official release data using the year span as the weight the artificial water use processes are subdivided into three parts according to the water supply targets agricultural industrial and domestic water use in each process the annual and administrative regional historical statistical water use data are used and downscaled to daily and model calculation unit i e contour band scales which are then used to evaluate the impacts of water use on natural hydrological processes for more details about this model refer to jia et al 2005 2006 and zhou et al 2018 2 5 model evaluation criteria the values of relative error re nash sutcliffe coefficient ne nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation coefficient cc are used as quantitative measures for model performance evaluation which are defined as follows 10 re i 1 n s i i 1 n o i i 1 n o i 100 11 ne 1 i

observed streamflow of n months m3 s and n is the total number of simulated months 3 study area and data 3 1 study area the wei river basin 104 00 110 20 e 33 50 37 18 n with a total area of 1 35 105 km2 was selected as the case study area to test the developed mfa method fig 2 this basin is located in the middle reaches of the yellow river basin zhan et al 2014 jing river and beiluo river are the two largest tributaries of the wei river the guanzhong plain is located downstream of the wei river which experiences considerable human activity the wei river basin has a semi humid and semi arid continental climate with a mean air temperature of 7 8 13 5 c and average annual precipitation 1956 2005 of 545 mm 60 of which falls from july to october mountainous regions have higher precipitation than plains and the southern part receives more rain than the northern part 3 2 data the digital elevation model dem was derived from the gtopo30 dataset developed by the u s geological survey eros data center http eros usgs gov land use data for 1980 1990 2000 and 2005 were downloaded from the data sharing infrastructure of earth system science http www geodata cn information on soil type and the corresponding characteristic parameters was sourced from the national second soil survey data and soil types of china data on irrigation districts were collected from the yellow river water conservancy commission yrwcc ministry of water resources of china artificial water use data were obtained from the second countrywide comprehensive water resources planning in china 1956 2000 and water resources bulletin of yellow river 2001 2005 daily meteorological observations were provided by the china meteorological administration including precipitation air temperature relative humidity sunshine hours and wind speed more dense precipitation data were provided by the yrwcc 1956 2005 time series data 1956 2005 of observed streamflow at huaxian and zhuangtou stations fig 2 which were used for calibration and validation of the hydrological model were also provided by the yrwcc for more information about the data refer to jia et al 2006 in the attribution study the period of 1956 1980 was selected as the base period and that of 1981 2005 as the impact period four impact factors were chosen for the attribution analysis climate change land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use additionally three hydrological variables were selected as the attribution targets evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river no data were available for any of the three hydrological variables at the scale of the wei river basin and were simulated using the dhm the annual arithmetic mean values of the four impact factors in the two periods are shown in table 2 land use showed the smallest changes between the two periods among the factors and its contribution to the change of hydrological variables was less than 10 of that caused by climate change in the results section fig 3 shows the observed annual streamflow at both huaxian and zhuangtou stations because the downstream area of these stations fig 2 is small and has no larger adjoining tributary the sum of their streamflows could somewhat represent the streamflow drainage into the yellow river fig 3 also shows that the streamflow at huaxian station comprises almost 90 of the streamflow draining into the yellow river and the mean streamflow decreased from the base period to the impact period 4 results 4 1 model calibration and validation the wei river model established by zhou et al 2009 was used in the study this model is part of the yellow river model in the wep l model jia et al 2006 the details of the calibrated parameters which are not discussed here can be found in jia et al 2006 and zhou et al 2009 the calibration period in this study was 1956 1990 and the validation period was 1991 2005 fig 4 and table 3 show the results of the monthly streamflow calibration and validation using the wei river model at huaxian and zhuangtou stations in the beiluo river basin i e zhuangtou station most rain fell in the summer season and within 1 or 2 h periods which typically triggers the generation of excess runoff exceeding the capacity for infiltration however hourly or shorter time scale precipitation data are needed to run the model which did not exist in our study this might explain why the nash sutcliffe coefficient was low in this catchment because of the inaccurate simulation of the peak flow meanwhile the average annual streamflow of zhuangtou station was very small compared with the annual average streamflow of huaxian station the huaxian catchment is calibrated well as is the sum of the two catchments therefore we consider that the model is calibrated and validated well in this study and is suitable for the attribution analysis 4 2 results of the multiple factor attribution analysis the simulated annual mean values of the three hydrological variables for 16 scenarios with the wep l model are shown in table 4 the cell values are the annual mean of the 25 year simulated values of the whole wei river basin based on the data in table 4 the contribution of each impact factor on the hydrological variables was calculated using eqs 7 and 9 and the results are shown in table 5 some factors caused the hydrological variables to increase and others had the reverse effect a negative sign of δ x denotes a decrease and a positive sign denotes an increase however the combination of the four factors caused a decrease as denoted by the negative value of s16 s1 the sum of the contributions of all considered factors equaled the total change in all factors i e the sum of δ x equaled the value of s16 s1 thus for this case study the proposed mfa method effectively executed the attribution analysis of multiple human activities and successfully separated the impacts of multiple factors on different hydrological variables without notable errors according to the value of the contribution of each impact factor β in table 5 the results revealed that climate change was the main reason for the reduction in evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river contributing 373 3 129 8 and 75 2 respectively whereas land use change had the lowest impact all four impact factors decreased the streamflow drainage into the yellow river but they compensated for the impact of the other variables on evapotranspiration and rainfall infiltration the contribution could be larger than 100 or smaller than 100 which indicated that the absolute value of δx was greater than the total sum i e the absolute value of s16 s1 this indicated that not all of the four impact factors had the same increasing or decreasing effect on the hydrological variables therefore the 373 3 relative contribution of climate change on evapotranspiration meant that the impact of climate change on evapotranspiration was 3 733 times greater than the integrated effect of the four impact factors and the negative sign meant that it had a decreasing effect finally land use change had the smallest contribution among the four factors and in most cases its contribution was less than 10 of the contribution of climate change table 5 moreover the new mfa method yields a time series of the relative contributions of each impact factor for each year from the same simulated scenarios for example if 1956 is taken as the base period and 1981 as the impact period the trend shown in fig 5 is the annual relative contribution of the four impact factors on the three hydrological variables as shown in fig 6 the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equaled the total change in hydrological variables between the two periods at an annual time scale 5 discussion most hydrological sensitivity analysis methods climate elasticity methods and the methods based on statistic data assume that changes to soil water storage and deep ground water losses can be ignored in the base and impact periods and that the precipitation runoff relationship is independent of human activity in the base period however these assumptions are poorly validated li et al 2007 wang and hejazi 2011 wang 2014 zheng et al 2009 furthermore only the hydrological variables and the impact factors that can be expressed as mathematical functions can be attributed by these methods which cannot calculate the attributions of multiple human activities by contrast the model scenario simulation method and the mfa method used in this study do not pose such problems and can attribute multiple impact factors on any hydrological variable that the dhm has simulated when calculating the contribution of a given factor in the model scenario simulation method the statuses of the other factors are fixed which results in the overestimation or underestimation of the effect thus the sum of the contribution will be higher or lower than 100 yang et al 2017 proposed a method that could make the sum of the impacts of climate change and land use change equal to 100 but their method only attributed the impacts of two factors differing from yang et al 2017 our method offers a more generalized approach for multiple impact factor attribution regardless there are several disadvantages to our method 1 the attribution results depend on the dhm used because different models may yield different results and the uncertainty of the model will be transferred to the analysis results 2 the considered impact factors should be the same as the independent input data of the distributed hydrological model 3 if the dhm cannot simulate the process of certain impact factors it cannot determine the attribution of these factors for example in our case study attribution analysis of terrace could not be performed because the dhm could not simulate the process explicitly according to the definition of the mfa method once the values of the hydrological variables in the 2 n situations are given it is easy to calculate the contribution using the separation equation thus a dhm is not the only technique that may be used for example experiments may be performed or multiple regression equations may be built from the hydrological variables for all impact factors to achieve the 2 n situations the advantage of a dhm is that it can provide more details on the hydrological variables such as those at different spatial or temporal scales the interactions between different hydrological variables and variables with no observed data that an experiment or regression equation could not handle importantly long term data of the impact factors were used in the dhm in this study to perform the long term simulation of hydrological variables and then averaged or used for one year to calculate the relative contributions thus the new method attributed changes over a long term series of whole research period not only the average status of the base or impact period which could also enable attribution analysis on an annual time scale in the appendix we discuss the mathematical proof of the method which indicates that once the 2 n scenarios values are obtained the final result will be uniquely determined therefore the uncertainty of our method comes from the method by which the 2 n scenario values are obtained i e the dhm in other words the uncertainty of the dhm is transferred to the simulation results if a different dhm were used the attribution results might not be the same therefore it is necessary to use different dhms to conduct the same attribution analysis to better generalize the findings of the present study when applying a dhm the simulated values rather than the observed values of the hydrological variables are used for the attribution analysis because the simulated values of the base period and impact period are systematically consistent with the other 2 n 2 scenarios which is the foundation of the separation equation moreover most of the hydrological variables do not have long term observed values like the three target hydrological variables used in this case study practically the observed annual mean values of the sum of huaxian and zhuangtou stations in the base and impact periods were 276 m3 s and 210 m3 s and the simulated values were 288 m3 s and 208 m3 s with relative errors of 4 3 and 0 9 respectively thus the simulated values reasonably represented the average status of the observed data in the case study of the wei river basin the impacts of climate change and three human activities i e land use change industrial and domestic water use and agricultural irrigation water use on three hydrological variables i e evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river were calculated using the new method the results of the case study demonstrated the ability of the mfa method to attribute the changes before and after 1980 which also indicated that the new method could attribute hydrological variables for which observation data are not available in our study the annual precipitation between the two periods decreased by 31 2 mm industrial and domestic water use increased by 8 2 mm and agricultural irrigation water use increased by 6 8 mm combined these changes resulted in a decrease in streamflow if we did not consider the cross effects on hydrological processes and the effect of land use the contribution of precipitation would be 31 2 31 2 8 2 6 8 67 5 which also supports climate change as the main impact factor moreover in the dhm we simulated the process of return flow of water used that drained back into the river in view of this we believe that our result is reasonable regardless the uncertainty of the simulated scenarios from the dhm should be analyzed for model structure error data errors and parameter uncertainty in a future study according to the literature the contribution of climate change on runoff or streamflow varied in the upper areas of huaxian and zhuangtou stations gao et al 2013 found that the impact of precipitation was 33 5 and 5 9 for huaxian and zhuangtou while rest of the variation was attributed to human activities zuo et al 2014 found that the contribution of climate change was about 51 and 65 for huaxian and zhuangtou whereas the contribution of human activities was about 43 and 33 and the remaining 6 and 2 was attributed to other factors respectively li et al 2016c found that the impacts of climate change land cover change and direct human activities were 69 4 3 8 and 26 8 for huaxian and 63 4 7 9 and 28 7 for zhuangtou respectively similar to our results jiang et al 2015 and chang et al 2015 separated the decadal impact of climate change and human activities for the base period of 1960 1970 jiang et al 2015 and 1956 1970 chang et al 2015 at huaxian station without performing a change time analysis jiang et al 2015 found that the impact of climate change was 70 5 8 4 79 6 and 80 2 using the decomposition method and 67 8 7 1 76 1 and 77 2 using the sensitivity method respectively of the impact period of 1970 1980 1980 1990 1990 2000 and 1999 2009 however chang et al 2015 obtained values of 36 28 53 10 and 34 on the impact periods of 1971 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2006 and 1971 2006 respectively the large differences in the contribution of climate change on runoff or streamflow among previous studies of the wei river basin are likely the result of the use of different attribution methods input data research period etc in the wei river basin the dams and terrace are also impact factors that influence the hydrological processes but were not considered as separate impact factors in our case study this was partly because the model used does not explicitly include a module to simulate the effects of dam regulation and terrace and partly due to the lack of detailed reservoir regulation data and terrace data li et al 2016c indicated that the impact degrees of reservoirs and dams were less than 10 in the study catchment nevertheless in future research we should consider these factors by modifying the dhm to simulate the process of terraces on surface runoff by interpreting the position and area of terraces from remote sensing data and by modifying the dhm to simulate the dam regulation effect on streamflow by collecting the regulation rules and storage capacity of each dam 6 conclusions to separate the impacts of climate change and multiple human activities on different hydrological variables a new mfa method was developed based on a dhm the proposed technique is a model scenario simulation method which averages the impacts of certain factors for different combined statuses of the remaining impact factors a general contribution separate equation based on these scenario values is solved to calculate the contribution of each factor it was demonstrated that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals the total change in the hydrological variables in the case study of the wei river basin china it was shown that the new method is capable of calculating the contributions of multiple human activities on hydrological variables while ensuring that the sum of the contributions of all impact factors equals 100 at different time scales furthermore the results of case study showed that climate change was the main factor driving the decreases in evapotranspiration rainfall infiltration and streamflow drainage into the yellow river whereas land use change had the lowest impact among the four investigated factors future studies will concentrate on quantification and possible reduction of the uncertainty of the simulation results of the dhm and consider other human activities e g

suggestions of external reviewers appendix a mathematical proof of the mfa method this appendix presents a mathematical proof that the sum of the contribution of all factors equals the total change of the hydrological variable i e a n s a s 1 where a 2 n first take the simple situation of two impact factors suppose the four combined scenarios are s 1 0 0 s2 1 0 s 3 0 1 and s 4 1 1 where 0 is in the base period and 1 is in the impact period also s i is used directly as the value of the hydrological variable in the corresponding scenario according to eq 5 the following results can be deduced and the recommendation is proven for two factor situations a1 δ x 1 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 a2 δ x 2 1 2 s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 a3 a 2 δ x 1 δ x 2 s 4 s 1 second the universal situation is discussed with n factors table a1 presents a five impact factor example the scenarios are divided into n 1 groups based on the value of sc in eq 6 thus it can be deduced that each group has c n i n i n i i 0 1 n scenarios the first and last scenario serial numbers of each group are p g 1 k 0 g 1 c n k g 0 1 n and q g k 0 g c n k g 0 1 n respectively the sum of the simulated values in the same group can be written as t g i p g q g s i g 0 1 n specifically t 0 s 1 and t n s a where a 2 n it can also be deduced that the value of sc in each group is sc 2 g n g 0 1 n moreover the sc values of gi and gn i groups are the same but have the opposite signs the following is defined u j t n j t j j 0 1 n 2 where n 2 is the integer part of the number n 2 e g 5 2 2 or 6 2 3 thus u 0 t n t 0 s a s 1 where a 2 n therefore the total sum of the contributions of n considered factors eq 6 can be written as a4 a n 1 2 n 1 g 0 n 2 g n t g 1 2 n 1 j 0 n 2 n 2 j u j taking the factors in the same status as one compound factor the n factor situation can be considered as a combination of numerous two factor situations e g factor x 1 x 1 x 2 and x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 in table a1 so the contribution of x 1 and x 2 can be calculated using eqs a1 and a2 a5 δ x 1 δ x 1 δ x 2 1 2 s 1 s 7 s 26 s 32 a6 δ x 2 δ x 3 δ x 4 δ x 5 1 2 s 1 s 7 s 26 s 32 like this combination and attribution in eqs a5 and a6 all potential separations for two combination factors are calculated which are summed to yield eq a7 and resolve the value of u j in eq a8 a7 c n 1 j 1 a n c n j t 0 t j t n j c n j t n 2 c n j u 0 u j 2 j 0 1 n 2 a8 u j c n j u 0 2 c n 1 j 1 a n j 0 1 n 2 replacing the value of u j in eq a4 with eq a8 yields eq a9 and resolves the value of a n u 0 in eq a10 a9 2 n 1 a n n u 0 j 1 n 2 n 2 j c n j u 0 2 c n 1 j 1 a n a10 a n u 0 n j 1 n 2 n 2 j c n j 2 n 1 j 1 n 2 n 2 j 2 c n 1 j 1 thus if the right part of eq a10 equals 1 then an u 0 s a s 1 where a 2 n some lemmas are proposed for the proof as shown in eqs a11 a14 a11 k b a c a

eq a10 consistently equals 1 j 1 n 2 n 2 j c n j j 1 n 2 n 2 j 2 c n 1 j 1 n j 0 n 2 c n j n 2 j 2 n 1 2 n j 0 n c n j n 2 j 2 1 2 n n 2 j 0 n c n j 4 n j 0 n j c n j 4 j 0 n j 2 c n j 1 2 n n 2 2 n 4
