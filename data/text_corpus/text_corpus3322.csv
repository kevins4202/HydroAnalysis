16610,the treatment of low concentration ammonium e g 50 mg l 1 in highly acidic wastewaters through traditional biological nitrification physical separation or chemical stripping remains a huge challenge herein we report that photocatalytic ammonium oxidation using bismuth oxychloride biocl can successfully occur in cl laden solutions within a ph range of 1 0 6 0 all reactions follow pseudo zero order kinetics with rate constants of 0 27 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 2 0 6 0 and 0 14 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 1 0 indicating the saturation of reactive species by the reactants the interlayer is self oxidized by the valence band holes vb h resulting in the formation of cl and subsequently hclo which is excited upon uv irradiation to provoke consecutive photoreactions for chlorine radical generation compared to the free chlorine ho cl and cl2 the clo produced using the uv biocl system plays a predominant role in oxidizing ammonium under acidic conditions biocl exhibits good stability because of the compensation of cl from solution and maintains high activity under different conditions i e different cations and co existing anions temperatures and initial substrate concentrations the successful removal of ammonium from real wastewater using the uv biocl system suggests that this is a promising method for treating diluted ammonium under highly acidic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium oxidation total nitrogen removal photocatalysis uv chlorine process chlorine oxide radicals 1 introduction ammonium is a ubiquitous pollutant in domestic and industrial wastewaters owing to its potential risk to human health and aquatic ecosystems the removal of ammonium that exceeds the discharge limits has become a worldwide concern accordingly various methods including phase separation karri et al 2018 e g ion exchange and adsorption nitrogen conversion pressley et al 1972 wang et al 2020 e g nitrification denitrification and breakpoint chlorination and their combination tabassum 2019 wang et al 2021 have been developed and applied for ammonium removal from wastewaters for a dilute concentration of ammonium in wastewaters e g 50 mg l 1 nh4 n the preferred strategy for nitrogen management is to remove ammonium by transforming it into nitrogen gas kogler et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a however current ammonium to nitrogen conversion technologies are highly sensitive to ph ammonium oxidation through either biological or photo electro chemical processes is considered impossible under highly acidic conditions jeschke et al 2013 kim et al 2006 shibuya et al 2015 shin et al 2017 this can be explained by the protonation of ammonium which decreases substrate availability and its regular tetrahedron structure which might hinder the accessibility of n by active species jeschke et al 2013 liu 2001 in fact low concentration ammonium is frequently detected in many acidic wastewaters released from electroplating photovoltaic metallurgy and mining industries fthenakis et al 2009 jeschke et al 2013 meng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 although a selective transformation of ammonium to nitrogen at low ph values is technically challenging it can aid in designing processes for nitrogen removal from acidic wastewater the oxidation of ammonium by active free chlorine cl2 hocl or ocl which is either externally added or in situ generated might be a feasible option for the transformation of ammonium to nitrogen however it proceeds at slow rates under acidic conditions jafvert and valentine 1992 pressley et al 1972 the results of our preliminary experiments fig s1 indicate that although the presence of excessive hocl can accelerate the reaction at acidic ph it can also lead to the accumulation of undesirable products such as nitrite nitrate and chlorate which can increase the toxicity of wastewater previous studies have indicated that electrogenerated active chlorine can induce ammonium oxidation at a lower operational molar ratio of free available chlorine to ammonia as compared to conventional breakpoint chlorination gendel and lahav 2012 zhang et al 2018a moreover despite the low local ph the excess of in situ generated free chlorine on an active electrode surface favors the oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gendel and lahav 2012 kapałka et al 2010 however in our view the role of reactive chlorine radicals such as cl cl2 and clo spontaneously produced from a cl containing electrolyte in promoting ammonium conversion has been overlooked these chlorine radicals are relatively long lived and can be easily dissolved in the bulk solution which exhibits superior performance toward selective ammonium oxidation owing to the avoidance of the diffusion limitation of ammonium wu et al 2016a zhang et al 2019a for example clo exhibits excellent capability for effective ammonium to nitrogen conversion zheng et al 2020 li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 despite the merits of electrochemical technologies for chlorine radical mediated ammonium oxidation their high dependence on solution conductivity and low current efficiency in active chlorine generation competition for electrons by water electrolysis limit their practical application in many cases to overcome this limitation this paper proposes a promising alternative for the in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals using bismuth oxychloride biocl a widely investigated photocatalyst that is a nontoxic inexpensive and environmentally friendly semiconductor and features a layered tetragonal matlockite structure composed of bi2o2 2 slabs interleaved by double slabs of chloride ions cl jiang et al 2012 li et al 2018a zhong et al 2019 the principle of this method is based on the fact that the interlayer cl in biocl is highly susceptible to oxidation by valence band holes vb h under uv irradiation which leads to the formation of a variety of free chlorine chen et al 2010 and thus chlorine radicals moreover the removed interlayer cl can be offset by the cl in solution and the conduction band electrons cb e are responsible for h2o or o2 reduction which collectively prevents the self oxidation and self reduction of the lattice biiii hence suppressing catalyst deactivation shiraishi et al 2020 accordingly the primary objectives of the current study are i to demonstrate a facile and selective oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas at acidic ph in the uv biocl system ii to unravel the main reason behind the in situ photogeneration of reactive chlorine radicals and iii to distinguish among the contributions of different chlorine radicals to ammonium oxidation under acidic conditions in addition to the proof of concept that the uv biocl system can effectively transform ammonium to nitrogen at an acidic ph varied from 1 0 to 6 0 ammonium is the dominant species throughout this ph range as show in fig s2 the effects of other operating conditions were examined and the performance of this technology in terms of ammonium removal from real acid wastewater was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bismuth nitrate pentahydrate bi no3 3 5h2o potassium chloride kcl sodium chloride nacl ammonium

performed in a cylindrical quartz container 100 ml containing 100 mg of biocl and 50 ml of synthetic real wastewater under intense stirring which was uv irradiated with a 100 w high pressure mercury lamp at a wavelength of 200 400 nm yaming lighting co ltd shanghai china in all photocatalytic experiments the uv irradiation intensity for was maintained at 30 mw cm 2 a recycling water glass jacket

certain time intervals of uv irradiation 1 ml of the reaction solution was sampled and immediately filtered to remove the photocatalyst for analysis two types of real acid wastewaters were taken from a local printed circuit board pcb manufacturing company fu heng dongguan china rinsing water after the copper etching process and washing water in a spray tower both these wastewaters were discharged using a cu etching relevant process the detailed water quality parameters are listed in table s1 2 5 analytical methods and data analysis the concentration of nh4 n was measured using the nessler reagent with a uv vis spectrophotometer at 420 nm the concentrations of no3 n no2 n cl clo2 and clo3 were determined by suppressed conductivity ion chromatography using a dionex ics 1000 system dionex

differences of ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations before and after the reaction respectively the concentration of free chlorine including cl2 hclo and clo produced in the reaction was monitored using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method zheng et al 2020 nb ba dmob and cbz were used as the probe compounds to quantify the steady state concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo in photocatalytic systems the concentrations of these probes were detected using a high performance liquid chromatograph agilent technologies 1260 infinity ii santa clara ca usa the detailed procedures for the calculations are shown in text s1 the fast digestion spectrophotometric method was used to determine the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod in solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 facile and selective ammonium removal at acidic ph in the uv biocl system fig 1 a shows the time courses of nh4 n concentration at ph ranging from 1 0 to 6 0 in the uv biocl system when the initial ph was varied from 2 0 to 6 0 complete oxidation of ammonium was achieved within 150 min of irradiation and insignificant variations in the reaction rate were revealed an effective removal of ammonium was also achieved at ph 1 0 although the reaction rate was slightly lower than that at the other ph levels as we are aware none of the transformation technologies biological or chemical can oxidize ammonium at ph 1 0 the ammonium oxidation reactions follow pseudo zero order kinetics suggesting that the reactive species is saturated by the reactants li and liu 2009 vanlangendonck et al 2005 because ammonium adsorption on the photocatalyst surface is retarded at low ph values the reactive species responsible for ammonium oxidation should not be surface bounded vikrant et al 2020 the observed pseudo zero order reaction is attributed to the fact that the rate limiting step is the generation of aqueous reactive species xiao et al 2009 while ammonium transport is fast in the case of intense stirring the calculated rate constant was 0 27 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 2 0 6 0 and 0 14 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 1 0 the photocatalytic ammonium oxidation by biocl under acidic conditions was found to be highly dependent on the biocl dosage and the amount of cl available in water taking the case of ph 6 0 as an example fig s3 ammonium disappearance proceeded in pseudo zero order kinetics for all investigated biocl dosages and its rate increased when the biocl concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 g l 1 such increment is attributed to more reactive species provided by the increased dosage of biocl further increase in the concentration to 3 0 g l 1 led to a slight decline in the reaction rate possibly due to the decreased transparence of the solution which reduces uv transmittance as illustrated in fig s4a only 2 7 of ammonium disappeared after 90 min in the absence of cl yielding a rate constant of 8 0 10 3 mg l 1 min 1 increasing the concentration of aqueous cl from 5 to 100 mm significantly accelerated the ammonium oxidation and the reaction rate reached a stable value as the cl concentration exceeded beyond 50 mm such dependence is attributable to the levels of free chlorine e g cl2 hclo and clo that are assumed to be generated in the uv biocl system chen et al 2010 shiraishi et al 2020 fig s4b shows a representative time profile of free chlorine content it rapidly increases in the initial period and reaches a relatively stable value after a certain time fig s4c presents the rate data of free chlorine obtained in each case and the differences in these values are highly consistent with those in the rate constant of ammonium oxidation fig s4d such a proportional relationship results from the fact that free chlorine is the necessary precursor for chlorine radical generation which will be discussed later figs s4a and s4c show that ammonium elimination follows the pseudo zero order kinetics rather than pseudo first order kinetics irrespective of the initial concentration of cl added to water this is because the active chlorine species consumed by ammonium can be immediately generated from the uv biocl system at a given cl concentration to elucidate whether free chlorine e g hclo was mainly responsible for the ammonium conversion a series of reference experiments were conducted at different acidic ph values where ammonium was directly mixed with hclo its concentration was maintained when complete ammonium removal was obtained at the initial ph of 6 0 fig 1b indicates that the decline in ammonium concentration is sensitive to the solution ph the high ph is beneficial to ammonium elimination because it is associated with the increased amount of hclo and the decreased amount of cl2 fig s5 and the latter species is considered to be inert toward ammonium oxidation shin et al 2017 note that the concentration of hclo added was approximately 27 times higher than that detected in the uv biocl system however an excessive amount of hclo was inefficient in fully oxidizing ammonium particularly at an initial ph below 6 0 as presented in fig 1c at all investigated ph levels negligible amounts of no3 n and no2 n were detected in the uv biocl system after 180 min of operation confirming outstanding n2 selectivity approximately 100 as a result of ammonium oxidation it should be noted that the effect of nitrate nitrite adsorption on the solid catalyst can be excluded fig s6 in contrast the hclo initiated oxidation system resulted in n2 selectivity below 100 in acidic solutions fig 1d certain proportions of no3 n and no2 n were detected in these cases for example the concentrations of no3 n and no2 n were 1 02 and 0 38 mg l 1 respectively when the reaction lasted up to 180 min at the initial ph of 6 0 the comparisons between the data with and without irradiation fig 1 clearly indicate that as compared to free chlorine other key active species play a more important role in ammonium removal in the uv biocl system which deserves further exploration previous studies concerning photocatalytic ammonium oxidation have reported that vb h and ho are the main reactive species but the reaction can only proceed under alkaline conditions bonsen et al 1997 lee et al 2002 sun et al 2015 zhu et al 2005 in addition the results of the reference test fig s7 indicated that almost no ammonium underwent oxidation in the uv tio2 system commercial p25 as a benchmark in the acidic solution these results prove that vb h and ho can also be excluded in ammonium conversion under acidic conditions 3 2 identification of the predominant clo radical for ammonium oxidation in acidic solutions as hclo alone has limited ability to completely oxidize ammonium at low ph values we speculate that more reactive radicals including ho and reactive chlorine radicals e g cl cl2 and clo produced from the uv photolysis of hclo minakata et al 2017 wu et al 2016a are potential species conducive to effective ammonium removal in acidic solutions this speculation was verified by the results of a reference uv hclo test which indicated that a substantial increase in the reaction rate was observed in the presence of uv fig s8a to further identify the predominant radicals a combination of epr tests scavenging experiments and probe experiments was conducted with acidic cl solutions in the uv biocl system as depicted in fig 2 a no dmpo related signals were detected in the biocl powder suspended water when pure water was irradiated by uv weak signals assigned to ho were revealed which according to wang et al 2017 is produced from water photolysis the dmpo related signals were clearly observed in pure water when the biocl catalysts were added to the uv irradiation system as many previous measurements have attributed cl caused dmpo oxidation to dmpox signals li et al 2016 cl was inferred to be generated from the oxidation of the interlayer cl by vb h for a scenario in which cl was present in the solution multiple groups of signals corresponding to dmpo ho li et al 2020 dmpo cl zhang et al 2018b and dmpo clo shen et al 2020 emerged this is explained by the fact that cl rapidly reacts with water to form hclo constituting a uv hclo system that triggers a series of chain reactions for the production of different radicals wu et al 2016a note that when ammonium was added to the uv biocl system only dmpo ho signals were visible the disappearance of dmpo cl and dmpo clo signals is interpreted by the view that ammonium is considerably more vulnerable to chlorine radical induced oxidation than ho induced oxidation which agrees with previous findings that the reaction between ammonium and ho is negligible to measure shin et al 2017 xiao et al 2009 and that the second order rate constants of reactions between ammonium and cl clo are in the range of 1 1 to 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 under acidic conditions zhang et al 2019a to distinguish among the contributions of different reactive species to ammonium removal quenching experiments with scavengers such as tba nahco3 and edta 2na were conducted and compared the rate constants of the reactions between the scavengers and targeted radicals are listed in table s2 as shown in fig 2b negligible variations in ammonium removal were observed when edta 2na was added which suggests that the photogenerated h on the catalyst surface had little influence on ammonium oxidation bonsen et al 1997 cai et al 2018 lee et al 2002 shibuya et al 2015 in contrast tba is capable of scavenging the possibly generated radicals such as ho cl and clo which significantly suppressed the percentage of nh4 n removal by 51 8 in addition hco3 distinctly quenches radicals such as ho cl and cl2 but ineffectively extinguishes clo because of the relatively slow reaction rate between them zhang et al 2019a a careful observation of the concentration time profile in the presence of hco3 suggested that the ammonium oxidation reaction substantially suffocated in the initial 60 min but began to accelerate afterward during the earlier period of treatment hco3 might quench the majority of cl functioning as the precursor for the formation of other radicals and compete with cl for the active sites of biocl making clo less abundantly generated the accumulation of the remaining cl with prolonged time might have led to the generation of clo which is expected to be involved in oxidizing ammonium afterward as indicated by the 81 5 ammonium removal after 180 min of operation to prove this reference experiments were conducted in the chemical uv hclo system to which the tba or nahco3 scavenger was introduced fig s8b clearly shows that the presence of tba considerably impeded the reaction and the presence of nahco3 did not obscure ammonium oxidation no stagnant period was observed possibly due to the excessive amount of hclo added to the solution this is a possible sign indicating the role of clo produced from the uv hclo system in oxidizing ammonium furthermore probe experiments were conducted to measure the concentrations of radicals and thus confirm their individual contributions to ammonium conversion in the cl amended uv biocl systems the steady state concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo at ph 6 0 were calculated using nb ba dmob and cbz as the probe compounds the first order rate constants of knb kba kdmob and kcbz were determined to be 0 0181 0 0620 0 3588 and 0 1354 min 1 respectively fig 2c by fitting with the kinetic model see the details in text s1 the steady state ho ss 7 74 10 14 m cl ss 3 21 10 14 m cl2 ss 1 45 10 12 m and clo ss 2 32 10 12 m were estimated as illustrated in fig 2d the concentrations of clo ss and cl2 ss were approximately 102 times higher than those of ho ss and cl ss indicating that clo and cl2 are the major radicals in the system considering the resistance of nh4 oxidation by ho shin et al 2017 xiao et al 2009 and the lower rate constants between cl2 and nh4 x223c 3 5 105 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019b and between cl and nh4 x223c 1 1 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019a as compared to that between clo and nh4 x223c 3 1 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019a clo can be conjectured as the predominant radical contributing to ammonium degradation 3 3 mechanisms of biocl induced in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals and its role in ammonium oxidation to unravel the mechanism behind the in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals induced by the uv biocl system the surface structure and chemistry of pristine and the irradiated samples either in pure water or in acidic cl solution were characterized through sem xrd raman and xps physicochemical techniques as well as electrochemical methods as observed from the top and side views of the sem images in fig 3 a the biocl sample exhibited a plate like structure with each plate having a width of 0 2 2 μm and thicknesses of 10 100 nm the sides of the plates were almost round or arc shaped the diffraction peaks of pristine biocl observed in fig 3b were in accordance with the characteristic features of the tetragonal phase of biocl jcpds card no 06 0249 weng et al 2013 xu et al 2020 which suggests its successful preparation the as prepared biocl exhibited cb and vb structures similar to those of tio2 gondal et al 2010 as depicted in fig s9 in addition the peak intensities related to 001 002 and 003 crystal planes were distinctly higher than those of other planes which indicates the orientated growth of biocl along the 001 facet jiang et al 2012 in the raman spectrum fig 3c of the pristine photocatalyst three distinguishable bands 144 59 and 200 cm 1 ascribed to the internal a1g external a1g and eg internal bi x stretching modes respectively and one weak band 396 cm 1 belonging to the eg and b1g produced by the motion of the oxygen atoms were observed weng et al 2013 the sem image xrd pattern and raman spectra of the irradiated biocl sample in acidic cl solution were similar to those of the pristine sample suggesting very small variations in their microtopographies and crystalline structures in contrast significant changes in the surface morphology were observed on the surface of photoreacted biocl in pure water which yielded an air bag like structure analogous to the phenomenon of gas etching a distinct reduction in the peak intensity was also revealed in the xrd and raman curves of this sample the raman spectrum indicated that the three original peaks broadened and two new peaks at 68 and 95 cm 1 appeared corresponding to the first order scattering eg from the oxygen vacancies li et al 2014 the peak attenuation and broadening originated from the typical phonon confinement effects induced by atom distortions mao et al 2018 these observations suggest that the irreversible self oxidation and self reduction reactions occurring under irradiation in pure water deteriorated the biocl structure which is attributable to the oxidation of the interlayer cl to cl2 gas shiraishi et al 2020 the retention or loss of the interlayer cl was verified by xps analysis which is generally used for investigating the chemical compositions and surface chemical states of a photocatalyst fig s10 li et al 2018b for the pristine biocl sample the molar ratio of bi o cl estimated by the surveyed xps spectrum was approximately 1 1 1 which agrees well with the theoretical stoichiometry value the high resolution bi 4f xps spectrum displayed two apparent peaks at 159 5 and 164 7 ev corresponding to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 respectively which are characteristic of biiii in bi based compounds fujishima et al 2015 the o1s signal can be deconvoluted into well resolved contributions ascribed to the lattice oxygen 530 3 ev and surface oh 531 4 ev the two evident peaks at 198 2 and 199 8 ev were allocated to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 respectively li et al 2018b being attributed to the interlayer cl in the biocl photocatalyst cai et al 2018 for the irradiated biocl sample in pure water however the cl percentage decreased from 34 1 to 26 3 after the photoreaction table s3 and the peak positions shifted to 197 9 ev cl 2p3 2 and 199 5 ev cl 2p1 2 in addition the binding energy of the lattice oxygen shifted from 530 3 ev pristine to 529 7 ev under irradiation and significant increases in the intensities of the peak attributed to oh hydroxyl groups and a new peak attributed to chemisorbed oxygen wu et al 2016b were observed the formation of these surface oxygen species implies the simultaneous oxidation of oxygen in biocl under this scenario a shift in the binding energies of bi 4f5 2 166 4 ev and bi 4f7 2 159 2 ev was also observed biiii in biocl was susceptible to self oxidation by vb h and self reduction by cb e as evidenced from the appearance of biv species 165 2 and 160 0 ev and bi 3 x species biii 163 9 and 158 3 ev bi0 163 0 and 157 8 ev fujishima et al 2015 wu et al 2016b in the irradiated biocl sample in acidic cl solution there were insignificant discrepancies in the bi 4f o 1s cl 2p xps spectra before and after irradiation and the cl concentration in biocl even increased slightly this is because cl available in the solution tends to react with the cl lacking biocl1 x oh x to form biocl as the pk sp of biocl is 30 75 bio cl 1 8 10 31 m2 chen et al 2010 a successful cl compensation by the solution thus suppresses the self oxidation reduction reactions shiraishi et al 2020 the intercalation deintercalation of cl in biocl was further verified by cyclic voltammetry cv one prominent pair of oxidation 0 33 v vs rhe and reduction 0 19 v vs rhe peaks was observed on the cvs of biocl in the cl solution fig 4 a suggesting the existence of cl involved redox reaction tan et al 2019 a remarkable finding was that the intensity of the redox peaks continuously increased with the cycle number after the 50th cycle the intensity amounted to a relatively stable value suggesting that the intercalation and deintercalation of cl reached equilibrium the positive current was much higher than the negative current which means that an apparent oxidation reaction occurred during the deintercalation of cl considering the susceptibility to oxidation the self oxidation of interlayer cl occurred at 0 33 v vs rhe which is significantly lower than the potential 1 5 v vs rhe required for cl oxidation in the bulk solution this implies that the oxidation of interlayer cl by vb h is thermodynamically more favorable fujito et al 2016 for the case of na2so4 solution in the absence of cl the pronounced deactivation of biocl was also evidenced from the cv measurements fig 4b contrary to the case of cl solution the oxidation peak corresponding to interlayer cl oxidation remarkably decreased demonstrating the irreversibility of this reaction and the loss of interlayer cl upon cycling in addition an oxidation peak assigned to biiii biv 0 42 v vs rhe a reduction peak assigned to biiii biii 0 042 v vs rhe and a reduction peak assigned to biiii bi0 0 56 v vs rhe were clearly visible in the cv curves their peak intensities continuously dropped with the increasing cycles these observations indicate that biiii itself in biocl experiences irreversible oxidation and reduction wu et al 2018 analogous to the behavior of cl note that no such biiii related redox peaks were observed in the cvs recorded in the cl solution the results from fig 4a clearly demonstrate that the deintercalated interlayer cl as a result of vb h oxidation is successfully and quickly compensated by cl in solution and that the re intercalation of cl effectively prevents the oxidation and reduction of biiii shiraishi et al 2020 based on all the data presented above we propose possible mechanisms for interpreting biocl induced photogeneration of chlorine radicals and accordingly the role of clo in promoting ammonium oxidation as illustrated in fig 5 under uv irradiation the photocatalyst produces photogenerated electron hole pairs eq 3 that are efficiently separated due to the internal polar field and the presence of oxygen vacancies in biocl jiang et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the cl atom is more electronegative than the o atom thus the density of states in the vicinity of the vb maximum is composed of cl 3p orbitals fujito et al 2016 as such vb h can preferentially oxidize the interlayer cl leading to the formation of cl eq 4 the combination of which leads to cl2 production eq 5 zheng et al 2020 the oxidation of water molecules eq 6 might hardly occur under this situation if no cl is supplemented from the solution the consumption of the interlayer cl together with the self oxidation eq 7 and self reduction eq 8 of the lattice biiii is expected to yield the deactivation of the photocatalysts shiraishi et al 2020 in contrast if the cl in the solution can sufficiently compensate for that released from the lattice cl can be continuously generated and the structure collapse of the biocl photocatalyst can be prevented the generated cl can react with cl in the solution to form cl2 eq 9 at an extremely fast reaction rate zhang et al 2019b and the combination of cl2 with cl2 or ho induces the formation of cl2 and hclo in acidic solutions eqs 10 12 minakata et al 2017 their direct photolysis uv cl2 and uv hclo is expected to produce ho eq 13 li et al 2016 and the combination of ho with cl and hclo triggers a chain reaction creating diverse chlorine radicals including cl cl2 and clo eqs 9 and 14 16 wu et al 2016a because the steady state concentration of clo in the photolysis reactor is higher than that of other radicals and clo is more effective in transforming ammonium to nitrogen eq 17 compared to other species zhang et al 2019a clo is considered to be the predominant chlorine radical responsible for a rapid and selective ammonium removal at acidic ph in the uv biocl system 3 biocl hv h e 4 biiiiocl h biiiio cl 5 2cl cl2 6 2h2o 4h o2 4h 7 2biiiio 2h2o 2h biiiibivo4 4h 8

effects of cations and co existing anions reaction temperature ammonium concentration and consecutive operation on nh4 n removal fig 6 a shows that when licl and kcl solutions were added to the uv biocl system the use of other alkali metal cations such as li and k did not elicit distinction in nh4 n removal this observation suggests that these cations did not interfere with the expulsion and insertion of cl from and into biocl respectively in addition the effects of co existing so4 2 and no3 which are stable in acidic ph on nh4 n oxidation were examined the presence of so4 2 exerted no apparent influence and no3 slightly affected nh4 n conversion the slight inhibitory effect by no3 is attributable to its strong absorption in the uv region constituting an inert filter layer that prevents light from being efficiently passed through solution and accessed by the catalyst sorensen and frimmel 1997 temperature had an insignificant effect on nh4 n oxidation in the uv biocl system as revealed by the slight differences within the temperature range of 5 c to 35 c fig 6b this implies that the proposed method can treat ammonium in low temperature environments for the nh4 n concentration 10 50 mg l 1 investigated the photocatalytic kinetic behavior of ammonium conversion was of zero order implying a complete mixing of active species with the substrate fig 6c therefore the presence of additional ammonium did not influence the kinetics the slopes of all linear curves were similar which indicates a similar reaction rate irrespective of the initial concentration the zero order kinetics also suggest that the rate demining step is not the diffusion of ammonium ion but the oxidation reaction between ammonium and chlorine radicals i e clo which is limited by the photon incidence photocatalyst structure and cl level in the solution shibuya et al 2015 vikrant et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b the consecutive operation of biocl for the photocatalysis of ammonium oxidation showed that the photocatalyst performance remained at a high level even after seven cycles fig 6d a slight deactivation of the photocatalyst was observed during subsequent cycles this indicates that the improvement in its long term stability deserves further investigation 3 5 uv biocl system for removing ammonium in real acid wastewater the feasibility of treating ammonium in real acid wastewater by using the uv biocl system was verified by conducting photocatalysis experiments with two rinsing wastewaters purchased from a local pcb manufacturing company both wastewaters contained certain amounts of copper ions hydrochloric acid ammonium and cod with different concentrations to avoid the negative influence of copper ions on biocl deactivation electrolytical deposition was performed before conducting the experiments to remove copper ions from the aqueous solution which were recovered in the form of metallic copper on the cathode surface table 1 shows that the uv biocl system achieved complete removal of ammonium demonstrating its potential application in treating the low concentration ammonium available in cl laden acid wastewater this can help resolve the problems associated with biological nitrogen treatment including poor adaptation and tolerance of bacteria against acids and high concentration salts jeschke et al 2013 ye et al 2009 and chemical nitrogen treatment including low efficiency in treating low concentration ammonium and huge consumption of alkaline and oxidants jafvert and valentine 1992 karri et al 2018 lin and wu 1996 pressley et al 1972 comparisons between the two datasets indicated that the presence of organic matter indexed by cod substantially affected the operation time required for 100 ammonium removal 9 h for wastewater containing 440 2 11 3 mg l 1 cod and 3 h for wastewater containing 68 1 5 6 mg l 1 cod this is interpreted by the fact that in situ photogenerated chlorine radicals in the uv biocl system are also responsible for the removal of organic pollutants and their degradation proceeds faster than the oxidation of ammonium in accordance with the literature results li et al 2016 minakata et al 2017 all these results corroborate that the photocatalysis system with biocl is effective in degrading both ammonium and organic carbons which represents an attractive route for treating industrial wastewater featured with low ph and a high abundance of cl 4 conclusions generally ammonium oxidation rarely occurs at ph values less than 7 0 either through biological treatment electrocatalytic treatment or photocatalytic treatment using tio2 based photocatalysts due to the ionization of ammonium and the increased difficulty in ammonium transport and adsorption compared to its diffusion nevertheless we provide solid evidence that the photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous ammonium in the presence of biocl can proceed successfully within the ph range of 1 0 6 0 in this study a facile and selective oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas is achieved and the reactions are found to follow pseudo zero order kinetics indicating that the reactions are neither surface bounded nor limited by ammonium transport and adsorption mechanistic studies have revealed that chlorine radicals e g clo dissolved in an aqueous solution play a critical role in ammonium conversion in addition uv irradiation of biocl causes the self oxidation of interlayer cl by vb h resulting in the formation of cl and thus hclo as a consequence of the reaction between cl and water the combination of hclo and uv irradiation provokes a series of chain reactions responsible for clo generation the biocl photocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability because the cl present in the acidic solution compensates for the oxidized interlayer cl and thus alleviates catalyst deactivation however the practical application of the uv biocl system incurs several challenges such as reliance on uv light which enhances energy consumption and the requirement of pretreatment steps for the separation of heavy metals suspended solids and lipophilic compounds fig s11 shows that the complete removal of ammonium with high concentrations 100 200 mg l 1 can be achieved upon prolonged operation time and the kinetics follow the zero order law however the extended period is expected to cause excessive energy consumption implying that this technology may not be proper for treating high concentration ammonium nevertheless the successful removal of ammonium from real acid wastewater using the proposed method can open a

16610,the treatment of low concentration ammonium e g 50 mg l 1 in highly acidic wastewaters through traditional biological nitrification physical separation or chemical stripping remains a huge challenge herein we report that photocatalytic ammonium oxidation using bismuth oxychloride biocl can successfully occur in cl laden solutions within a ph range of 1 0 6 0 all reactions follow pseudo zero order kinetics with rate constants of 0 27 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 2 0 6 0 and 0 14 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 1 0 indicating the saturation of reactive species by the reactants the interlayer is self oxidized by the valence band holes vb h resulting in the formation of cl and subsequently hclo which is excited upon uv irradiation to provoke consecutive photoreactions for chlorine radical generation compared to the free chlorine ho cl and cl2 the clo produced using the uv biocl system plays a predominant role in oxidizing ammonium under acidic conditions biocl exhibits good stability because of the compensation of cl from solution and maintains high activity under different conditions i e different cations and co existing anions temperatures and initial substrate concentrations the successful removal of ammonium from real wastewater using the uv biocl system suggests that this is a promising method for treating diluted ammonium under highly acidic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ammonium oxidation total nitrogen removal photocatalysis uv chlorine process chlorine oxide radicals 1 introduction ammonium is a ubiquitous pollutant in domestic and industrial wastewaters owing to its potential risk to human health and aquatic ecosystems the removal of ammonium that exceeds the discharge limits has become a worldwide concern accordingly various methods including phase separation karri et al 2018 e g ion exchange and adsorption nitrogen conversion pressley et al 1972 wang et al 2020 e g nitrification denitrification and breakpoint chlorination and their combination tabassum 2019 wang et al 2021 have been developed and applied for ammonium removal from wastewaters for a dilute concentration of ammonium in wastewaters e g 50 mg l 1 nh4 n the preferred strategy for nitrogen management is to remove ammonium by transforming it into nitrogen gas kogler et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a however current ammonium to nitrogen conversion technologies are highly sensitive to ph ammonium oxidation through either biological or photo electro chemical processes is considered impossible under highly acidic conditions jeschke et al 2013 kim et al 2006 shibuya et al 2015 shin et al 2017 this can be explained by the protonation of ammonium which decreases substrate availability and its regular tetrahedron structure which might hinder the accessibility of n by active species jeschke et al 2013 liu 2001 in fact low concentration ammonium is frequently detected in many acidic wastewaters released from electroplating photovoltaic metallurgy and mining industries fthenakis et al 2009 jeschke et al 2013 meng et al 2020 wang et al 2021 although a selective transformation of ammonium to nitrogen at low ph values is technically challenging it can aid in designing processes for nitrogen removal from acidic wastewater the oxidation of ammonium by active free chlorine cl2 hocl or ocl which is either externally added or in situ generated might be a feasible option for the transformation of ammonium to nitrogen however it proceeds at slow rates under acidic conditions jafvert and valentine 1992 pressley et al 1972 the results of our preliminary experiments fig s1 indicate that although the presence of excessive hocl can accelerate the reaction at acidic ph it can also lead to the accumulation of undesirable products such as nitrite nitrate and chlorate which can increase the toxicity of wastewater previous studies have indicated that electrogenerated active chlorine can induce ammonium oxidation at a lower operational molar ratio of free available chlorine to ammonia as compared to conventional breakpoint chlorination gendel and lahav 2012 zhang et al 2018a moreover despite the low local ph the excess of in situ generated free chlorine on an active electrode surface favors the oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gendel and lahav 2012 kapałka et al 2010 however in our view the role of reactive chlorine radicals such as cl cl2 and clo spontaneously produced from a cl containing electrolyte in promoting ammonium conversion has been overlooked these chlorine radicals are relatively long lived and can be easily dissolved in the bulk solution which exhibits superior performance toward selective ammonium oxidation owing to the avoidance of the diffusion limitation of ammonium wu et al 2016a zhang et al 2019a for example clo exhibits excellent capability for effective ammonium to nitrogen conversion zheng et al 2020 li et al 2020 shen et al 2020 despite the merits of electrochemical technologies for chlorine radical mediated ammonium oxidation their high dependence on solution conductivity and low current efficiency in active chlorine generation competition for electrons by water electrolysis limit their practical application in many cases to overcome this limitation this paper proposes a promising alternative for the in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals using bismuth oxychloride biocl a widely investigated photocatalyst that is a nontoxic inexpensive and environmentally friendly semiconductor and features a layered tetragonal matlockite structure composed of bi2o2 2 slabs interleaved by double slabs of chloride ions cl jiang et al 2012 li et al 2018a zhong et al 2019 the principle of this method is based on the fact that the interlayer cl in biocl is highly susceptible to oxidation by valence band holes vb h under uv irradiation which leads to the formation of a variety of free chlorine chen et al 2010 and thus chlorine radicals moreover the removed interlayer cl can be offset by the cl in solution and the conduction band electrons cb e are responsible for h2o or o2 reduction which collectively prevents the self oxidation and self reduction of the lattice biiii hence suppressing catalyst deactivation shiraishi et al 2020 accordingly the primary objectives of the current study are i to demonstrate a facile and selective oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas at acidic ph in the uv biocl system ii to unravel the main reason behind the in situ photogeneration of reactive chlorine radicals and iii to distinguish among the contributions of different chlorine radicals to ammonium oxidation under acidic conditions in addition to the proof of concept that the uv biocl system can effectively transform ammonium to nitrogen at an acidic ph varied from 1 0 to 6 0 ammonium is the dominant species throughout this ph range as show in fig s2 the effects of other operating conditions were examined and the performance of this technology in

performed in a cylindrical quartz container 100 ml containing 100 mg of biocl and 50 ml of synthetic real wastewater under intense stirring which was uv irradiated with a 100 w high pressure mercury lamp at a wavelength of 200 400 nm yaming lighting co ltd shanghai china in all photocatalytic experiments the uv irradiation intensity for was maintained at 30 mw cm 2 a recycling water glass jacket

certain time intervals of uv irradiation 1 ml of the reaction solution was sampled and immediately filtered to remove the photocatalyst for analysis two types of real acid wastewaters were taken from a local printed circuit board pcb manufacturing company fu heng dongguan china rinsing water after the copper etching process and washing water in a spray tower both these wastewaters were discharged using a cu etching relevant process the detailed water quality parameters are listed in table s1 2 5 analytical methods and data analysis the concentration of nh4 n was measured using the nessler

differences of ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations before and after the reaction respectively the concentration of free chlorine including cl2 hclo and clo produced in the reaction was monitored using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method zheng et al 2020 nb ba dmob and cbz were used as the probe compounds to quantify the steady state concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo in photocatalytic systems the concentrations of these probes were detected using a high performance liquid chromatograph agilent technologies 1260 infinity ii santa clara ca usa the detailed procedures for the calculations are shown in text s1 the fast digestion spectrophotometric method was used to determine the concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod in solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 facile and selective ammonium removal at acidic ph in the uv biocl system fig 1 a shows the time courses of nh4 n concentration at ph ranging from 1 0 to 6 0 in the uv biocl system when the initial ph was varied from 2 0 to 6 0 complete oxidation of ammonium was achieved within 150 min of irradiation and insignificant variations in the reaction rate were revealed an effective removal of ammonium was also achieved at ph 1 0 although the reaction rate was slightly lower than that at the other ph levels as we are aware none of the transformation technologies biological or chemical can oxidize ammonium at ph 1 0 the ammonium oxidation reactions follow pseudo zero order kinetics suggesting that the reactive species is saturated by the reactants li and liu 2009 vanlangendonck et al 2005 because ammonium adsorption on the photocatalyst surface is retarded at low ph values the reactive species responsible for ammonium oxidation should not be surface bounded vikrant et al 2020 the observed pseudo zero order reaction is attributed to the fact that the rate limiting step is the generation of aqueous reactive species xiao et al 2009 while ammonium transport is fast in the case of intense stirring the calculated rate constant was 0 27 0 32 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 2 0 6 0 and 0 14 mg l 1 min 1 at ph 1 0 the photocatalytic ammonium oxidation by biocl under acidic conditions was found to be highly dependent on the biocl dosage and the amount of cl available in water taking the case of ph 6 0 as an example fig s3 ammonium disappearance proceeded in pseudo zero order kinetics for all investigated biocl dosages and its rate increased when the biocl concentration was increased from 1 0 to 2 0 g l 1 such increment is attributed to more reactive species provided by the increased dosage of biocl further increase in the concentration to 3 0 g l 1 led to a slight decline in the reaction rate possibly due to the decreased transparence of the solution which reduces uv transmittance as illustrated in fig s4a only 2 7 of ammonium disappeared after 90 min in the absence of cl yielding a rate constant of 8 0 10 3 mg l 1 min 1 increasing the concentration of aqueous cl from 5 to 100 mm significantly accelerated the ammonium oxidation and the reaction rate reached a stable value as the cl concentration exceeded beyond 50 mm such dependence is attributable to the levels of free chlorine e g cl2 hclo and clo that are assumed to be generated in the uv biocl system chen et al 2010 shiraishi et al 2020 fig s4b shows a representative time profile of free chlorine content it rapidly increases in the initial period and reaches a relatively stable value after a certain time fig s4c presents the rate data of free chlorine obtained in each case and the differences in these values are highly consistent with those in the rate constant of ammonium oxidation fig s4d such a proportional relationship results from the fact that free chlorine is the necessary precursor for chlorine radical generation which will be discussed later figs s4a and s4c show that ammonium elimination follows the pseudo zero order kinetics rather than pseudo first order kinetics irrespective of the initial concentration of cl added to water this is because the active chlorine species consumed by ammonium can be immediately generated from the uv biocl system at a given cl concentration to elucidate whether free chlorine e g hclo was mainly responsible for the ammonium conversion a series of reference experiments were conducted at different acidic ph values where ammonium was directly mixed with hclo its concentration was maintained when complete ammonium removal was obtained at the initial ph of 6 0 fig 1b indicates that the decline in ammonium concentration is sensitive to the solution ph the high ph is beneficial to ammonium elimination because it is associated with the increased amount of hclo and the decreased amount of cl2 fig s5 and the latter species is considered to be inert toward ammonium oxidation shin et al 2017 note that the concentration of hclo added was approximately 27 times higher than that detected in the uv biocl system however an excessive amount of hclo was inefficient in fully oxidizing ammonium particularly at an initial ph below 6 0 as presented in fig 1c at all investigated ph levels negligible amounts of no3 n and no2 n were detected in the uv biocl system after 180 min of operation confirming outstanding n2 selectivity approximately 100 as a result of ammonium oxidation it should be noted that the effect of nitrate nitrite adsorption on the solid catalyst can be excluded fig s6 in contrast the hclo initiated oxidation system resulted in n2 selectivity below 100 in acidic solutions fig 1d certain proportions of no3 n and no2 n were detected in these cases for example the concentrations of no3 n and no2 n were 1 02 and 0 38 mg l 1 respectively when the reaction lasted up to 180 min at the initial ph of 6 0 the comparisons between the data with and without irradiation fig 1 clearly indicate that as compared to free chlorine other key active species play a more important role in ammonium removal in the uv biocl system which deserves further exploration previous studies concerning photocatalytic ammonium oxidation have reported that vb h and ho are the main reactive species but the reaction can only proceed under alkaline conditions bonsen et al 1997 lee et al 2002 sun et al 2015 zhu et al 2005 in addition the results of the reference test fig s7 indicated that almost no ammonium underwent oxidation in the uv tio2 system commercial p25 as a benchmark in the acidic solution these results prove that vb h and ho can also be excluded in ammonium conversion under acidic conditions 3 2 identification of the predominant clo radical for ammonium oxidation in acidic solutions as hclo alone has limited ability to completely oxidize ammonium at low ph values we speculate that more reactive radicals including ho and reactive chlorine radicals e g cl cl2 and clo produced from the uv photolysis of hclo minakata et al 2017 wu et al 2016a are potential species conducive to effective ammonium removal in acidic solutions this speculation was verified by the results of a reference uv hclo test which indicated that a substantial increase in the reaction rate was observed in the presence of uv fig s8a to further identify the predominant radicals a combination of epr tests scavenging experiments and probe experiments was conducted with acidic cl solutions in the uv biocl system as depicted in fig 2 a no dmpo related signals were detected in the biocl powder suspended water when pure water was irradiated by uv weak signals assigned to ho were revealed which according to wang et al 2017 is produced from water photolysis the dmpo related signals were clearly observed in pure water when the biocl catalysts were added to the uv irradiation system as many previous measurements have attributed cl caused dmpo oxidation to dmpox signals li et al 2016 cl was inferred to be generated from the oxidation of the interlayer cl by vb h for a scenario in which cl was present in the solution multiple groups of signals corresponding to dmpo ho li et al 2020 dmpo cl zhang et al 2018b and dmpo clo shen et al 2020 emerged this is explained by the fact that cl rapidly reacts with water to form hclo constituting a uv hclo system that triggers a series of chain reactions for the production of different radicals wu et al 2016a note that when ammonium was added to the uv biocl system only dmpo ho signals were visible the disappearance of dmpo cl and dmpo clo signals is interpreted by the view that ammonium is considerably more vulnerable to chlorine radical induced oxidation than ho induced oxidation which agrees with previous findings that the reaction between ammonium and ho is negligible to measure shin et al 2017 xiao et al 2009 and that the second order rate constants of reactions between ammonium and cl clo are in the range of 1 1 to 3 1 109 m 1 s 1 under acidic conditions zhang et al 2019a to distinguish among the contributions of different reactive species to ammonium removal quenching experiments with scavengers such as tba nahco3 and edta 2na were conducted and compared the rate constants of the reactions between the scavengers and targeted radicals are listed in table s2 as shown in fig 2b negligible variations in ammonium removal were observed when edta 2na was added which suggests that the photogenerated h on the catalyst surface had little influence on ammonium oxidation bonsen et al 1997 cai et al 2018 lee et al 2002 shibuya et al 2015 in contrast tba is capable of scavenging the possibly generated radicals such as ho cl and clo which significantly suppressed the percentage of nh4 n removal by 51 8 in addition hco3 distinctly quenches radicals such as ho cl and cl2 but ineffectively extinguishes clo because of the relatively slow reaction rate between them zhang et al 2019a a careful observation of the concentration time profile in the presence of hco3 suggested that the ammonium oxidation reaction substantially suffocated in the initial 60 min but began to accelerate afterward during the earlier period of treatment hco3 might quench the majority of cl functioning as the precursor for the formation of other radicals and compete with cl for the active sites of biocl making clo less abundantly generated the accumulation of the remaining cl with prolonged time might have led to the generation of clo which is expected to be involved in oxidizing ammonium afterward as indicated by the 81 5 ammonium removal after 180 min of operation to prove this reference experiments were conducted in the chemical uv hclo system to which the tba or nahco3 scavenger was introduced fig s8b clearly shows that the presence of tba considerably impeded the reaction and the presence of nahco3 did not obscure ammonium oxidation no stagnant period was observed possibly due to the excessive amount of hclo added to the solution this is a possible sign indicating the role of clo produced from the uv hclo system in oxidizing ammonium furthermore probe experiments were conducted to measure the concentrations of radicals and thus confirm their individual contributions to ammonium conversion in the cl amended uv biocl systems the steady state concentrations of ho cl cl2 and clo at ph 6 0 were calculated using nb ba dmob and cbz as the probe compounds the first order rate constants of knb kba kdmob and kcbz were determined to be 0 0181 0 0620 0 3588 and 0 1354 min 1 respectively fig 2c by fitting with the kinetic model see the details in text s1 the steady state ho ss 7 74 10 14 m cl ss 3 21 10 14 m cl2 ss 1 45 10 12 m and clo ss 2 32 10 12 m were estimated as illustrated in fig 2d the concentrations of clo ss and cl2 ss were approximately 102 times higher than those of ho ss and cl ss indicating that clo and cl2 are the major radicals in the system considering the resistance of nh4 oxidation by ho shin et al 2017 xiao et al 2009 and the lower rate constants between cl2 and nh4 x223c 3 5 105 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019b and between cl and nh4 x223c 1 1 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019a as compared to that between clo and nh4 x223c 3 1 109 m 1s 1 zhang et al 2019a clo can be conjectured as the predominant radical contributing to ammonium degradation 3 3 mechanisms of biocl induced in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals and its role in ammonium oxidation to unravel the mechanism behind the in situ photogeneration of chlorine radicals induced by the uv biocl system the surface structure and chemistry of pristine and the irradiated samples either in pure water or in acidic cl solution were characterized through sem xrd raman and xps physicochemical techniques as well as electrochemical methods as observed from the top and side views of the sem images in fig 3 a the biocl sample exhibited a plate like structure with each plate having a width of 0 2 2 μm and thicknesses of 10 100 nm the sides of the plates were almost round or arc shaped the diffraction peaks of pristine biocl observed in fig 3b were in accordance with the characteristic features of the tetragonal phase of biocl jcpds card no 06 0249 weng et al 2013 xu et al 2020 which suggests its successful preparation the as prepared biocl exhibited cb and vb structures similar to those of tio2 gondal et al 2010 as depicted in fig s9 in addition the peak intensities related to 001 002 and 003 crystal planes were distinctly higher than those of other planes which indicates the orientated growth of biocl along the 001 facet jiang et al 2012 in the raman spectrum fig 3c of the pristine photocatalyst three distinguishable bands 144 59 and 200 cm 1 ascribed to the internal a1g external a1g and eg internal bi x stretching modes respectively and one weak band 396 cm 1 belonging to the eg and b1g produced by the motion of the oxygen atoms were observed weng et al 2013 the sem image xrd pattern and raman spectra of the irradiated biocl sample in acidic cl solution were similar to those of the pristine sample suggesting very small variations in their microtopographies and crystalline structures in contrast significant changes in the surface morphology were observed on the surface of photoreacted biocl in pure water which yielded an air bag like structure analogous to the phenomenon of gas etching a distinct reduction in the peak intensity was also revealed in the xrd and raman curves of this sample the raman spectrum indicated that the three original peaks broadened and two new peaks at 68 and 95 cm 1 appeared corresponding to the first order scattering eg from the oxygen vacancies li et al 2014 the peak attenuation and broadening originated from the typical phonon confinement effects induced by atom distortions mao et al 2018 these observations suggest that the irreversible self oxidation and self reduction reactions occurring under irradiation in pure water deteriorated the biocl structure which is attributable to the oxidation of the interlayer cl to cl2 gas shiraishi et al 2020 the retention or loss of the interlayer cl was verified by xps analysis which is generally used for investigating the chemical compositions and surface chemical states of a photocatalyst fig s10 li et al 2018b for the pristine biocl sample the molar ratio of bi o cl estimated by the surveyed xps spectrum was approximately 1 1 1 which agrees well with the theoretical stoichiometry value the high resolution bi 4f xps spectrum displayed two apparent peaks at 159 5 and 164 7 ev corresponding to bi 4f7 2 and bi 4f5 2 respectively which are characteristic of biiii in bi based compounds fujishima et al 2015 the o1s signal can be deconvoluted into well resolved contributions ascribed to the lattice oxygen 530 3 ev and surface oh 531 4 ev the two evident peaks at 198 2 and 199 8 ev were allocated to cl 2p3 2 and cl 2p1 2 respectively li et al 2018b being attributed to the interlayer cl in the biocl photocatalyst cai et al 2018 for the irradiated biocl sample in pure water however the cl percentage decreased from 34 1 to 26 3 after the photoreaction table s3 and the peak positions shifted to 197 9 ev cl 2p3 2 and 199 5 ev cl 2p1 2 in addition the binding energy of the lattice oxygen shifted from 530 3 ev pristine to 529 7 ev under irradiation and significant increases in the intensities of the peak attributed to oh hydroxyl groups and a new peak attributed to chemisorbed oxygen wu et al 2016b were observed the formation of these surface oxygen species implies the simultaneous oxidation of oxygen in biocl under this scenario a shift in the binding energies of bi 4f5 2 166 4 ev and bi 4f7 2 159 2 ev was also observed biiii in biocl was susceptible to self oxidation by vb h and self reduction by cb e as evidenced from the appearance of biv species 165 2 and 160 0 ev and bi 3 x species biii 163 9 and 158 3 ev bi0 163 0 and 157 8 ev fujishima et al 2015 wu et al 2016b in the irradiated biocl sample in acidic cl solution there were insignificant discrepancies in the bi 4f o 1s cl 2p xps spectra before and after irradiation and the cl concentration in biocl even increased slightly this is because cl available in the solution tends to react with the cl lacking biocl1 x oh x to form biocl as the pk sp of biocl is 30 75 bio cl 1 8 10 31 m2 chen et al 2010 a successful cl compensation by the solution thus suppresses the self oxidation reduction reactions shiraishi et al 2020 the intercalation deintercalation of cl in biocl was further verified by cyclic voltammetry cv one prominent pair of oxidation 0 33 v vs rhe and reduction 0 19 v vs rhe peaks was observed on the cvs of biocl in the cl solution fig 4 a suggesting the existence of cl involved redox reaction tan et al 2019 a remarkable finding was that the intensity of the redox peaks continuously increased with the cycle number after the 50th cycle the intensity amounted to a relatively stable value suggesting that the intercalation and deintercalation of cl reached equilibrium the positive current was much higher than the negative current which means that an apparent oxidation reaction occurred during the deintercalation of cl considering the susceptibility to oxidation the self oxidation of interlayer cl occurred at 0 33 v vs rhe which is significantly lower than the potential 1 5 v vs rhe required for cl oxidation in the bulk solution this implies that the oxidation of interlayer cl by vb h is thermodynamically more favorable fujito et al 2016 for the case of na2so4 solution in the absence of cl the pronounced deactivation of biocl was also evidenced from the cv measurements fig 4b contrary to the case of cl solution the oxidation peak corresponding to interlayer cl oxidation remarkably decreased demonstrating the irreversibility of this reaction and the loss of interlayer cl upon cycling in addition an oxidation peak assigned to biiii biv 0 42 v vs rhe a reduction peak assigned to biiii biii 0 042 v vs rhe and a reduction peak assigned to biiii bi0 0 56 v vs rhe were clearly visible in the cv curves their peak intensities continuously dropped with the increasing cycles these observations indicate that biiii itself in biocl experiences irreversible oxidation and reduction wu et al 2018 analogous to the behavior of cl note that no such biiii related redox peaks were observed in the cvs recorded in the cl solution the results from fig 4a clearly demonstrate that the deintercalated interlayer cl as a result of vb h oxidation is successfully and quickly compensated by cl in solution and that the re intercalation of cl effectively prevents the oxidation and reduction of biiii shiraishi et al 2020 based on all the data presented above we propose possible mechanisms for interpreting biocl induced photogeneration of chlorine radicals and accordingly the role of clo in promoting ammonium oxidation as illustrated in fig 5 under uv irradiation the photocatalyst produces photogenerated electron hole pairs eq 3 that are efficiently separated due to the internal polar field and the presence of oxygen vacancies in biocl jiang et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the cl atom is more electronegative than the o atom thus the density of states in the vicinity of the vb maximum is composed of cl 3p orbitals fujito et al 2016 as such vb h can preferentially oxidize the interlayer cl leading to the formation of cl eq 4 the combination of which leads to cl2 production eq 5 zheng et al 2020 the oxidation of water molecules eq 6 might hardly occur under this situation if no cl is supplemented from the solution the consumption of the interlayer cl together with the self oxidation eq 7 and self reduction eq 8 of the lattice biiii is expected to yield the deactivation of the photocatalysts shiraishi et al 2020 in contrast if the cl in the solution can sufficiently compensate for that released from the lattice cl can be continuously generated and the structure collapse of the biocl photocatalyst can be prevented the generated cl can react with cl in the solution to form cl2 eq 9 at an extremely fast reaction rate zhang et al 2019b and the combination of cl2 with cl2 or ho induces the formation of cl2 and hclo in acidic solutions eqs 10 12 minakata et al 2017 their direct photolysis uv cl2 and uv hclo is expected to produce ho eq 13 li et al 2016 and the combination of ho with cl and hclo triggers a chain reaction creating diverse chlorine radicals including cl cl2 and clo eqs 9 and 14 16 wu et al 2016a because the steady state concentration of clo in the photolysis reactor is higher than that of other radicals and clo is more effective in transforming ammonium to nitrogen eq 17 compared to other species zhang et al 2019a clo is considered to be the predominant chlorine radical responsible for a rapid and selective ammonium removal at acidic ph in the uv biocl system 3 biocl hv h e 4 biiiiocl h biiiio cl 5 2cl cl2 6 2h2o 4h o2 4h 7 2biiiio 2h2o 2h biiiibivo4 4h 8

effects of cations and co existing anions reaction temperature ammonium concentration and consecutive operation on nh4 n removal fig 6 a shows that when licl and kcl solutions were added to the uv biocl system the use of other alkali metal cations such as li and k did not elicit distinction in nh4 n removal this observation suggests that these cations did not interfere with the expulsion and insertion of cl from and into biocl respectively in addition the effects of co existing so4 2 and no3 which are stable in acidic ph on nh4 n oxidation were examined the presence of so4 2 exerted no apparent influence and no3 slightly affected nh4 n conversion the slight inhibitory effect by no3 is attributable to its strong absorption in the uv region constituting an inert filter layer that prevents light from being efficiently passed through solution and accessed by the catalyst sorensen and frimmel 1997 temperature had an insignificant effect on nh4 n oxidation in the uv biocl system as revealed by the slight differences within the temperature range of 5 c to 35 c fig 6b this implies that the proposed method can treat ammonium in low temperature environments for the nh4 n concentration 10 50 mg l 1 investigated the photocatalytic kinetic behavior of ammonium conversion was of zero order implying a complete mixing of active species with the substrate fig 6c therefore the presence of additional ammonium did not influence the kinetics the slopes of all linear curves were similar which indicates a similar reaction rate irrespective of the initial concentration the zero order kinetics also suggest that the rate demining step is not the diffusion of ammonium ion but the oxidation reaction between ammonium and chlorine radicals i e clo which is limited by the photon incidence photocatalyst structure and cl level in the solution shibuya et al 2015 vikrant et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b the consecutive operation of biocl for the photocatalysis of ammonium oxidation showed that the photocatalyst performance remained at a high level even after seven cycles fig 6d a slight deactivation of the photocatalyst was observed during subsequent cycles this indicates that the improvement in its long term stability deserves further investigation 3 5 uv biocl system for removing ammonium in real acid wastewater the feasibility of treating ammonium in real acid wastewater by using the uv biocl system was verified by conducting photocatalysis experiments with two rinsing wastewaters purchased from a local pcb manufacturing company both wastewaters contained certain amounts of copper ions hydrochloric acid ammonium and cod with different concentrations to avoid the negative influence of copper ions on biocl deactivation electrolytical deposition was performed before conducting the experiments to remove copper ions from the aqueous solution which were recovered in the form of metallic copper on the cathode surface table 1 shows that the uv biocl system achieved complete removal of ammonium demonstrating its potential application in treating the low concentration ammonium available in cl laden acid wastewater this can help resolve the problems associated with biological nitrogen treatment including poor adaptation and tolerance of bacteria against acids and high concentration salts jeschke et al 2013 ye et al 2009 and chemical nitrogen treatment including low efficiency in treating low concentration ammonium and huge consumption of alkaline and oxidants jafvert and valentine 1992 karri et al 2018 lin and wu 1996 pressley et al 1972 comparisons between the two datasets indicated that the presence of organic matter indexed by cod substantially affected the operation time required for 100 ammonium removal 9 h for wastewater containing 440 2 11 3 mg l 1 cod and 3 h for wastewater containing 68 1 5 6 mg l 1 cod this is interpreted by the fact that in situ photogenerated chlorine radicals in the uv biocl system are also responsible for the removal of organic pollutants and their degradation proceeds faster than the oxidation of ammonium in accordance with the literature results li et al 2016 minakata et al 2017 all these results corroborate that the photocatalysis system with biocl is effective in degrading both ammonium and organic carbons which represents an attractive route for treating industrial wastewater featured with low ph and a high abundance of cl 4 conclusions generally ammonium oxidation rarely occurs at ph values less than 7 0 either through biological treatment electrocatalytic treatment or photocatalytic treatment using tio2 based photocatalysts due to the ionization of ammonium and the increased difficulty in ammonium transport and adsorption compared to its diffusion nevertheless we provide solid evidence that the photocatalytic oxidation of aqueous ammonium in the presence of biocl can proceed successfully within the ph range of 1 0 6 0 in this study a facile and selective oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas is achieved and the reactions are found to follow pseudo zero order kinetics indicating that the reactions are neither surface bounded nor limited by ammonium transport and adsorption mechanistic studies have revealed that chlorine radicals e g clo dissolved in an aqueous solution play a critical role in ammonium conversion in addition uv irradiation of biocl causes the self oxidation of interlayer cl by vb h resulting in the formation of cl and thus hclo as a consequence of the reaction between cl and water the combination of hclo and uv irradiation provokes a series of chain reactions responsible for clo generation the biocl photocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability because the cl present in the acidic solution compensates for the oxidized interlayer cl and thus alleviates catalyst deactivation however the practical application of the uv biocl system incurs several challenges such as reliance on uv light which enhances energy consumption and the requirement of pretreatment steps for the separation of heavy metals suspended solids and lipophilic compounds fig s11 shows that the complete removal of ammonium with high concentrations 100 200 mg l 1 can be achieved upon prolonged operation time and the kinetics follow the zero order law however the extended period is expected to cause excessive energy consumption implying that this technology may not be proper for treating high concentration ammonium nevertheless the successful removal of ammonium from real acid wastewater using the proposed method can open a new avenue for treating low concentration ammonium under highly acidic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

16611,a continuous variable bayesian network cbn model is used to link watershed development and climate change to stream ecosystem indicators a graphical model reflecting our understanding of the connections between climate change weather condition loss of natural land cover stream flow characteristics and stream ecosystem indicators is used as the basis for selecting flow metrics for predicting macroinvertebrate based indicators selected flow metrics were then linked to variables representing watershed development and climate change we fit the model to data from two river basins in southeast us and the resulting model was used to simulate future stream ecological conditions using projected future climate and development scenarios the three climate models predicted varying ecological condition trajectories but similar worst case ecological conditions the established modeling approach couples mechanistic understanding with field data to develop predictions of management relevant variables across a heterogeneous landscape we discussed the transferability of the modeling approach keywords bayesian network climate change ecological condition regression streamflow metrics watershed 1 introduction prediction plays an increasingly important role in environmental management in a nonstationary world milly et al 2008 poff 2018 managers can act most effectively if they can anticipate where environmental conditions are most likely to require intervention to maintain ecosystem derived goods and services this applies to freshwater ecosystems for which future water availability will depend on climate conditions and watershed land use as well as on human needs and water management actions mcdonald et al 2011 palmer et al 2008 stream ecosystems in particular provide goods and services to society in proportion to ecological function which in turn depends in large part on streamflow characteristics baron et al 2002 models that can relate local stream ecological condition to watershed scale drivers particularly land use and climate variables and then predict likely future scenarios may help managers identify regions where large environmental changes are likely and perhaps target actions that could alleviate undesired outcomes peterson et al 2013 wenger et al 2010 ecologists have taken a variety of modeling approaches for predicting future conditions of stream ecosystems managers focused on species conservation for example may benefit from models of future species distribution or population status however managers concerned with environmental condition as defined by regulatory statutes more often rely on indicators of ecological health managers use indicators such as dominance by pollution tolerant organisms and other community based attributes to assess the effects of pollution sedimentation and a variety of other stressors often acting in combination on ecological condition of streams and rivers barbour et al 2000 davies and jackson 2006 building the tools to predict condition or indicator scores under future land use and climate conditions could thus provide particular value to managers and regulators charged with meeting environmental standards e g as established under the u s clean water act the connections between human activities and climate variables and indicators of stream ecosystem condition are complex grimm et al 2013 shifts in ecological indicators may reflect direct e g contaminant or sediment loading waite et al 2019 or indirect e g hydrologic shifts roy et al 2005 effects of human activities in a watershed modeling causal relations between the factors that we can reasonably project for example future land use temperature and flow regimes and environmental indicators entails major challenges one common challenge is selecting variables that predict outcomes for a given data set and yet have general applicability a second challenge involves building predictions using relationships estimated from characteristically noisy data when responses may be determined by a variety of drivers thus although studies have successfully simulated effects of land use and land cover lulc and climate changes on streamflow patterns lafontaine et al 2019 e g the connection between lulc or climate changes and stream ecosystem conditions is still a broad area of study the field of eco hydrology is increasingly moving towards developing solutions for environmental management arthington et al 2018 including development of suitable quantitative research tools while process based mechanistic models are more likely to capture the state of the art understanding of the ecologic processes complex mechanistic models cannot be realistically calibrated to existing monitoring data because of the spatiotemporal scale mismatch between what a model predicts and what can be observed as a result mechanistic models rarely provide predictive accuracy assessment needed for management on the other hand empirical statistical models are necessarily based on available monitoring data with predictive accuracy assessment readily available however an empirical model captures correlation not necessarily causal relation consequently empirical models are often unsuitable for predicting future changes a combination of the two modeling approaches could be helpful our study part of the empirical modeling component of the usgs national water census nwc coastal carolina focus area study ccfas is designed to integrate empirical modeling approaches under a structure defined by the state of the art understanding of the underlying causal links the paper reports 1 a variable selection approach based on a systematic exploration of large data sets using classification and

developed based on a graphic model linking the selected variables based on the conceptual causal model fig 1 a monte carlo simulation algorithm is developed to incorporate projected future climate and lulc condition scenarios in the study area to predict likely future changes in stream ecosystem indicators a space for time modeling approach is implemented in which the differences in climate land use and flow alteration among sites are used to infer differences at a site through time our objective is to provide water resource managers with tools and information necessary to make informed management decisions 2 methods 2 1 study area the cape fear and yadkin pee dee rivers drain the foothills of the blue ridge piedmont and coastal plain of north nc and south carolina sc usa before entering the atlantic ocean fig 2 population has increased dramatically since the 1970s particularly in the coastal region this growth has affected both the quantity and quality of surface water in the region as municipal industrial and agricultural consumption increases over pumping of groundwater in parts of these basins has greatly lowered groundwater levels carswell et al 1988 and decreased the amount and quality of water available to support aquatic ecosystems future climate and land use shifts threaten to further reduce biological condition in the region s streams 2 2 data 2 2 1 ecological data benthic invertebrate for the cape fear and yadkin pee dee river basins were collected by the nc department of environmental quality ncdeq and the sc department of health environmental control scdhec the ncdeq data were obtained from the usepa storet database 1 1 https www tinyurl com y4b4hbre whereas scdhec data were obtained directly from scdhec jim glover personal communication 2016 ncdeq data were restricted to samples collected using full scale and swamp sample collection methods ncdeq 2016 scdhec samples were collected using comparable methods jim glover personal communication 2016 the sc invertebrate data were presented as counts whereas nc abundances were presented as categorical rare common or abundant values consequently nc and sc data could only be combined based on the presence or absence of taxa data between 1988 and 2014 were reviewed for inclusion in the study temporal and spatial filters were applied to reduce pseudo replication and autocorrelation arising from the proximity of sample sites in time and space armstrong et al 2011 hurlbert 1984 this was accomplished by including data only from the most recent sample collection period and examining sites located within 0 5 km of each other to determine if they were environmentally distinct e g main stem and tributary sites or separated by an intervening point source or environmental discontinuity wenger et al 2008 if sites were not environmentally distinct then the downstream most site was selected for analysis site locations were based on the reported latitude and longitude coordinates and geo referenced to the nearest nhdplus stream segment using arcgis tidally influenced sites and very small headwater ca 5 2 square kilometers basins were removed because flow conditions at these sites could not be modeled these temporal and spatial filters resulted in 237 cape fear and 313 yadkin pee dee sampling sites fig 2 that were suitable for model development nc and sc invertebrate data were prepared for analysis by harmonizing taxa across data sources and years e g updating taxonomy standardizing nomenclature resolving taxonomic ambiguities within samples and calculating assemblage metrics the invertebrate data analysis system idas software cuffney and brightbill 2010 was used to calculate metrics and to resolve ambiguous taxa by distributing the abundances of ambiguous parents among their children separately for each sample cuffney et al 2007 tolerance metrics were calculated using ncdeq pollution tolerance values ncdeq 2016 supplemented with usepa tolerance values barbour et al 1999 metric calculations were restricted to the calculation of richness i e number of taxa metrics due to the differences in the characterization of abundances in the nc and sc programs invertebrate response modeling focused on the responses of two metrics ept ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera richness e p t r and the average tolerance of taxa present in the sample calculated as r i c h t o l i 1 n t v i n where n is the number of taxa in the sample and t v i is the pollution tolerance value 0 to 10 lowest to highest pollution tolerance of the i th taxon e p t r and r i c h t o l were chosen because they have been shown to respond well to environmental degradation of streams cuffney et al 2010 and are often used to assess biological conditions in bio monitoring programs ncdeq 2016 2 2 2 streamflow data the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop simulated streamflow at all ecological sampling locations in the study area swat is a well established basin scale watershed process model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2005 the swat watershed model is designed to simulate management effects on streamflow at gauged and ungauged watersheds gassman et al 2007 and can simulate changes in water availability as a result of changing climate water use demand or land use the arcgis extension for swat arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 was used with arcgis 10 4 1 for model development see sanchez et al 2020 for additional information on swat model calibration and projections of future water demand for the cape fear and pee dee basins mean daily flows at invertebrate sampling sites were estimated for 1988 2014 using swat ecologically important measures of hydrological variability e g magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change gao et al 2009 poff et al 2010 poff and ward 1989 were calculated using the statistics package eflowstats 2 2 github com usgs r eflowstats flow metrics were calculated for the year prior to the date of sample collection because eflowstats can calculate many metrics 180 additional analyses are required to remove redundant metrics and to identify a small subset of flow metrics that are associated with changes in invertebrate assemblages land use climate and population 2 2 3 land use and land cover change projection land cover within the drainage basin associated with each sampling site was derived from the decadal estimates of national land cover developed by falcone 2015 gis was used to estimate the area of each land cover class in each basin for the years 1982 1992 2002 and 2012 land cover for the years between decadal assessments was derived by linear interpolation the land cover associated with the invertebrate sample year was used in the development of invertebrate response models land cover from 2012 was used to characterize land cover for samples collected in 2013 and 2014 two development scenarios were developed by sanchez et al 2020 and combined with three climate models to develop projected future scenarios including future land use precipitation and temperature variables for each watershed future land cover changes will primarily be driven by urbanization as existing urban areas expand consequently land cover changes for the period 2012 2065 were simulated using the future urban regional environment simulation meentemeyer et al 2013 futures for two urbanization scenarios 1 continued historic trend of growth higher demand scenario and 2 clustered higher density development lower demand scenario land change projections for both urbanization scenarios are presented at an annual time step in a format consistent with the national land cover database sanchez et al 2020 2 2 4 simulated and down scaled climate change predictions the uncertainty associated with future climate conditions was simulated by integrating global climate models gcm representative of dry wet and median future conditions following a continuously increasing greenhouse gas emissions scenario representative concentration pathway van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 8 5 at present global emission trends follow closest the rcp 8 5 concentration trajectory three gcms were used the institute of numerical mathematics the russian academy of sciences model volodin et al 2010 inmcm4 the japanese meteorological research institute model yukomoto et al 2012 mri cgcm3 and the norwegian earth system model bentsen et al 2013 noresm1 m precipitation and air temperature for the period 1988 2014 were based on the university of idaho s gridmet data set abatzoglou 2013 this data set blends gridded climate data from prism 3 3 http www prism oregonstate edu with temporal attributes and additional variables from regional reanalysis nldas 2 4 4 http www ldas gsfc nasa gov nldas nldas2forcing php using climatically aided interpolation it provides high resolution 4 km gridded data of daily minimum and maximum temperatures c and daily precipitation mm air temperature and precipitation were derived for each hydrologic response unit hru associated with the ecological sampling sites data from the grid point that was closest to the pour point of the swat model hru were used to characterize conditions at the hru conditions at the invertebrate sampling sites were characterized by aggregating the hru data after weighting for their contribution to the total basin area both temperature and precipitation were summarized for the year prior to sample collection and expressed as mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of values for the year and the seasons 2 3 variable selection selecting variables for an empirical predictive model is an iterative and case specific process gelman and hill 2007 qian 2016 in our case we want to populate the conceptual diagram fig 1 with relevant variables selected from hundreds of available variables for example streamflow metrics that are predictive of stream ecological indicators and watershed climate land use and land cover variables that are predictive of the selected streamflow metrics the selected variables must also be able to be part of the network model to link climate and watershed activities to streamflow and then to stream ecological conditions as such we used an approach to identify relevant variables among a large number of potential variables e g there are more than 400 streamflow metrics the process starts with an exploration of all available variables using parametric and nonparametric methods classification and regression tree analysis breiman et al 1984 cart is a nonparametric method often used for exploring important factors affecting the response variable and for developing predictive models qian and anderson 1999 demonstrated the value of cart as a variable selection method in cases where a large number of potential predictors are available a distinct advantage of cart as a variable selection tool is that we can screen a large number of potential predictors without the concern of over fitting the model the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso is a penalized linear parametric regression model with regression coefficients intercept and slopes estimated to minimize the deviance residual sum of squares in normal response model plus a penalty term tibshirani 1996 the penalty term shrinks slopes of all predictors towards zero smaller absolute values compared to the conventional linear regression model predictors that are not relevant to predicting the response variables often have slopes reaching zero as a result lasso can be used as a variable selection method that supports model development both cart and lasso are standalone models they cannot be integrated into a network model as a result we used them as part of our exploratory analysis for selecting relevant variables 2 4 exploratory plots using cart we screened all potential predictors and their potential interactions using the r package rpart as outlined in qian 2016 chapter 7 using lasso we identified the most effective predictors for a linear model we further explored these two sets of variables using plots 1 scatter plots of the response variable against the predictors to provide a visual assessment of the association especially nonlinear associations and 2 conditional plots of the response variable against two or more predictors cleveland 1993 to explore potential interactions based on our conceptual diagram linking watershed natural and cultural conditions to stream ecological conditions fig 1 we combined the two exploratory variable selection models and exploratory plots to establish two sets of empirical models first we explored and selected flow metrics from among more than 400 metrics that can be used to predict the selected ecosystem indicator r i c h t o l section 2 2 1 second we explored the watershed scale predictors of the selected flow metrics these empirical models were a simplified representation of the conceptual causal diagram and can be connected to form a bayesian network model fig 3 2 5 modified continuous variable bayesian network model a traditional bayesian network model is specifically for categorical predictors to avoid the difficulties in deciding the proper means for discretizing a continuous variable nojavan et al 2017 qian and miltner 2015 developed a continuous variable bayesian network cbn parameterized in two steps our selected variables and the network model in fig 3 complete the first step following the iterative process of model fitting model evaluation and model revision gelman and hill 2007 to find the most parsimonious model forms using the procedure of developing predictive regression models outlined in qian 2016 chapter 5 these independently developed regression models were connected based on the final bayesian network model diagram fig 3 our network consists of nine nodes represented by watershed input variables watershed drainage area d a percent of natural land cover p n a t u r a l percent of watershed with soil in hydrological soil group c s g c annual precipitation p r e c i p and summer mean temperature t e m p streamflow metrics mean of

et al 2013 and stream ecosystem condition indicator r i c h t o l which was strongly correlated with e p t r in the model selection process step 1 d h 20 was eliminated from the model collectively the diagram represents a linked network that can be summarized in connected regression models three nodes in the diagram have arrows pointed to them response variables representing three regression models the network model can be expressed in probability distribution 1 l o g f μ n μ f σ f 2 μ f β 0 f β 1 f d a β 2 f p r e c i p m l 20 n μ m l 20 σ m l 20 2 μ m l 20 β 0 m l β 1 m l p n a t u r a l β 2 m

interactions between some predictors and ecoregion the full model has 23 unknown parameters table 1 instead of using a markov chain monte carlo simulation approach as in qian and miltner 2015 that is computationally demanding we developed a gibbs sampler algorithm based on linear model theories it greatly reduces computational intensity and facilitates the predictive monte carlo simulation details of the gibbs sampler and the monte carlo simulation for prediction are in the online supporting materials section 6 2 6 simulation for prediction because the bayesian network is a directed and acyclic graph prediction also follows the direction of the network from the terminal parent nodes to terminal child nodes furthermore because model coefficients are estimated using the gibbs sampler our prediction will also be presented with random samples from the predictive distribution using the projected future climate precipitation and temperature and future lulc we predict the future stream ecological condition the prediction is compared to a baseline condition represented by the mean of ecological condition in 2014 through 2019 2 7 linking an ecological indicator to regulatory assessment categories an ecological indicator such as r i c h t o l is one of many factors considered when states develop biological monitoring and assessment objectives in north carolina biological condition is defined into five categories excellent good good fair fair and poor based on scoring criteria applied to a subset of ecological metrics ncdeq 2016 to make the predicted ecological indicator under future climate and development scenarios relevant to state regulatory objectives we used the ordered multinomial logit model gelman and hill 2007 section 6 5 to link r i c h t o l values to nc s biological condition categories delineated using assessment and metric data from the invertebrate sampling sites the model estimated four r i c h t o l thresholds which divide the r i c h t o l values into five subsets each corresponding to a biological condition category details of the model development are presented in the online supporting materials section 6 3 results computational details of the exploratory analysis and the monte carlo simulation for estimating regression coefficients are documented in the on line supporting materials section 6 the final cbn model consists of three individual linear regression models representing two levels of connections connecting variables of watershed land use soil condition and precipitation to two flow metrics and linking flow metrics and temperature to a stream ecological indicator fig 3 these regression models represent a combination of our conceptual understanding and empirical modeling the conceptual diagram fig 1 guided the exploratory data analysis to select variables representing each node in the diagram fig 3 which in turn led to individual regression models model coefficients of the three regression models in the first level connection from environmental variables to flow metrics are estimated based on bayesian regression analysis estimating the joint posterior distribution of these coefficients see qian 2016 chapter 9 3 1 cbn model coefficients all component models of the cbn model include the four level 3 ecoregions represented in our study area as a categorical predictor regression model coefficients for the middle atlantic coastal plains region 63 differ from the coefficients of the other three regions 45 piedmont 65 southeastern plains and 66 blue ridge table 1 all estimated slopes β 1 4 and the ecoregion interaction offsets δ 0 4 in table 1 are statistically different from 0 i e 95 credible intervals do not include 0 in nearly all cases the flow metrics and the ecological indicator in the middle atlantic coastal plains ecoregion 63 do not respond to the respective predictors as strongly as the same responded in other ecoregions the absolute values of β k δ k slopes for ecoregion 63 are generally smaller than the absolute values of β k slopes for other ecoregions for example the slope of precipitation of the base flow model is β 23 δ 23 0 8175 0 9580 0 1405 for ecoregion 63 and β 23 0 8175 for the other three ecoregions table 1 the two flow metrics are largely influenced by annual precipitation less so in ecoregion 63 the stream ecosystem condition indicator r i c h t o l is negatively related to the mean log daily flow β 32 table 1 and base flow β 33 and positively related to summer mean temperature β 34 suggesting that increased flow and base flow would improve ecosystem condition reduce r i c h t o l whereas increased temperature would lead to worsening ecosystem condition r i c h t o l in ecoregion 63 does not respond to changes in natural land cover does not change as a function of summer temperature and is less affected by changes in base flow table 1 the ecological model for ecoregion 63 has a substantially higher intercept than the model for the other three ecoregions r i c h t o l on average is higher in ecoregion 63 than in other regions given the dampened response to the predictors our model would predict a narrower range of r i c h t o l in the middle atlantic coastal plain than the ranges for the other three ecoregions under future climate and land use scenarios see table 2 3 2 ecological changes under projected future climate conditions the projected future climate conditions vary by climate models fig 4 however the predicted percent of natural land cover sum of forest shrub and wetlands is largely unchanged both over time and between the two development scenarios section 6 the simulation results allow us to estimate the likelihood that ecological conditions for each watershed will deteriorate over time represented by the probabilities that future year s r i c h t o l values for each watershed will be larger than the respective baseline r i c h t o l values the trends of mean r i c h t o l are largely determined by climate scenarios fig 5 high temperature is associated with high r i c h t o l values and high precipitation is associated with low r i c h t o l values table 1 because the predicted r i c h t o l for each watershed is a probability distribution we can estimate the probabilities that individual watersheds will have higher r i c h t o l in future years compared to the baseline condition or the probability of deterioration fig 6 the estimated probability of deterioration can be misleading as a watershed already with a high r i c h t o l value is less likely to experience further deterioration thereby showing a small probability of future r i c h t o l exceeding the baseline level accordingly we estimated the probabilities of each watershed achieving a biological condition of worse than good fair based on the ordered multinomial logit model estimated threshold of r i c h t o l 6 which separates the management biological condition of better than good fair from fair and poor this probability of worse than good fair or probability r i c h t o l 6 is a better indication of future conditions than the probability of deterioration from a baseline condition we estimated the projected proportion of watersheds in each of the three level 3 ecoregions that would have a probability of biological condition worse than good fair exceeding 0 75 highly likely to be worse than good fair using future temperature and precipitation from the three climate models table 2 all three models projected that 70 or more watersheds in the piedmont and southeastern plains would be highly likely to have stream biological condition worse than good fair under all three models during at least one of the nine projected time steps in table 2 although with a different timing for the middle atlantic coastal plains all three models predicted generally low percentages of watersheds to be worse than good fair the difference between ecoregion 63 and the rest of the study area is a reflection of the lack of response of both the flow metrics and the ecological condition indicators in ecoregion 63 to the selected predictors 1 although r i c h t o l was correlated with both summer temperature and annual precipitation table 1 in the piedmont and southeastern plains the stream ecological condition indicator was more responsive to changes in precipitation than to the changes in temperature the bold values in table 2 show years when the predicted percent of watersheds that are highly likely to have biological conditions worse than good fair is above 70 the timing is more in response to the fluctuation in the projected precipitation fig 4 left column than to the steady increase in summer temperature fig 4 right column these aggregated summaries can be mapped into individual watersheds to represent spatial differences in temporal changes in ecological condition indicator to make the map informative we categorize the probability of having biological condition worse than good fair into four classes unlikely probability range 0 0 25 less likely 0 25 0 5 more likely 0 5 0 75 and highly likely 0 75 1 the categorization is a convenient means to present the spatial distribution of the estimated probabilities fig 7 the spatial distributions show that the three climate models resulted in a generally consistent assessment of the worst case scenario future stream ecological conditions the baseline condition shows a general upstream to downstream northwest to southeast gradient consistent with the general increasing trend in watershed population density all three models predict that the stream biological conditions under future climate scenarios will likely be worse than good fair during at least one projected time step across most of the study area except for the few watersheds in the blue ridge area ecoregion 66 4 discussion developing a continuous variable bayesian network model allowed us to forecast a metric of stream ecological condition across geographically heterogeneous river basins in response to changes in precipitation and air temperature under future climate scenarios our process of variable selection using spatially extensive ecological data coupled with a simple conceptual model identified a tractable set of predictive stream flow variables that could be linked to climate and geographic drivers our variable selection and model building approach the coupled parametric lasso and nonparametric cart models for variable screening combined with exhaustive graphical exploration for model forms appears to be highly effective for selecting representative variables and forming the network model the resulting parameterized cbn provided spatially explicit probabilistic predictions of the ecological response metric by capturing and conveying levels of uncertainty as probabilities for specific outcomes as well as spatial variation in forecast outcomes this modeling approach could be particularly useful to managers by identifying climate conditions likely to degrade ecological value in differing geographic areas our model is exploratory because data used for model development i e modeled streamflow future precipitation temperature and land cover were mostly derived from process based model simulations in a way part of our model linking watershed variables to stream flow metrics is a simplified representation of these models because the process based models represent relatively fine temporal spatial scales the links between development and climate variables to ecological conditions are not obvious due to the inevitable high levels of uncertainty both natural variability and model uncertainty in many cases combining simple mechanistic processes and empirical modeling is necessary for modeling stream ecological indicators webb et al 2018 using the cbn model we simplify the model and establish the connection between the three groups of variables watershed level variables stream flow metrics and stream ecological indicators that are directly relevant to regional water resources management such simplification is achieved by spatial and temporal aggregation through statistical models the aggregated representation is often relevant to management decision making at a regional scale our predictions of future stream ecological condition were based on three climate models and two land use scenarios both with large uncertainty we acknowledged such uncertainty by using a probabilistic prediction to summarize the level of uncertainty in our model and data nevertheless our predictions are unlikely to be accurate the value of such prediction is a systematic summary of what we know and such a summary can be updated as we accumulate new data because of the bayesian nature of the model the sequential updating under the bayesian framework has been explored for updating highly uncertain predictions elsewhere qian et al 2021 such sequential updating is also a valuable feature because we used the approach of space for time substitution to summarize the relationship between climate and land use patterns on stream ecological conditions the space for time approach does not include the potential temporal correlation in ecological conditions in that once a stream s ecological condition deteriorates it may not bounce back immediately when the weather condition improves consequently we used the years with high temperature and low precipitation from each of the three climate models to evaluate the worst case scenario furthermore the space for time approach can potentially fall victim to a statistical phenomenon known as simpson s paradox which describes the potentially conflicting results when analyzing the same relationship at different levels of spatial or temporal aggregations in this case simpson s paradox indicates that empirical relationships established across a large spatial scale may not hold in a specific location over time qian et al 2019 simpson 1951 however a bayesian model can be updated either for the same study area with new data or applying the model to a smaller watershed or a different watershed in both cases we can use the current model output as the basis for developing prior distributions of model parameters to combine with new or site specific data for an updated model or site specific model qian et al 2021 all three climate models predicted a steady increase in summer temperature and a large variation in annual precipitation the predicted percent of watersheds that was highly likely to have a biological condition worse than good fair in the predicted time steps was more in line with the changes in predicted precipitation table 2 these results indicate that predicted changes in precipitation are more responsible than the changes in temperature for the projected changes in stream ecological response in particular years with exceptionally low precipitation were expected to result in poor ecological conditions in affected streams the maintenance of streamflow supporting ecological condition is well supported arthington et al 2018 poff 2018 therefore understanding how changes in precipitation affect the water required to support aquatic ecosystems is critical for long term water management especially in areas such as the southeastern u s that experience climate driven periods of water stress when seasonal flow diminish a disruption in life history or behavioral cues can occur boulton 2003 lytle 2002 in this study the flow attributes m l 20 base flow and l o g f μ mean of daily log discharge were identified as critical to supporting ecological condition represented by r i c h t o l for example emergence periods for more sensitive taxa such as ephemeroptera plecoptera and some trichoptera ept may be affected by reductions in annual base flow kennen et al 2010 such changes may result in reduced abundance of sensitive taxa and increases in taxa that are more tolerant of changes in annual base flow kennen et al 2014 in parts of north and south carolina surface water and groundwater withdrawals have reduced base flow and estimates of water use indicate that the total amount of fresh surface water withdrawals across the region amounted to 11 7 billion m 3 year 1 maupin et al 2014 consequently policies and management actions that maintain adequate stream flow conditions during dry periods could help support ecological integrity our model predicted a weak ecological response for coastal plain sites to future climate change coastal plain streams tend to be ecologically unpredictable marion et al 2015 and are known to have a strong connection to groundwater and extensive floodplains and wetlands causing these streams to respond differently to changes in precipitation and human exploitation for example groundwater stored on the extensive floodplains of coastal plain streams may also buffer flows leading to changes in the timing and magnitude of flows in response to precipitation events compared to streams with higher gradients and less extensive floodplains and associated wetlands lotic benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are also challenging to model in coastal plain streams streams that arise on the coastal plain store large amounts of benthic organic matter and have low velocity flows these conditions can lead to harsh environmental conditions during the summer low flow periods when water temperatures are high dissolved oxygen levels are low and current velocities are more characteristic of lentic than lotic systems consequently the macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics used to assess biological conditions in non coastal plain steams e g r i c h t o l may not adequately capture the condition of the coastal plain swamp streams where benthic assemblages may be dominated by midges and worms state agencies for example the north carolina department of environmental quality are actively assessing appropriate indicators of biological conditions for these swamp streams ncdeq 2016 from an empirical modeling perspective our model succeeded in predicting the variation in r i c h t o l by separating non responsive sites in coastal plain from sites in other ecoregions we expected land cover variables and future land cover change would link strongly to stream flow and ecological condition wetlands are known to improve water quality and dampen the effects of hydrologic variability however their cumulative effects on stream integrity at a landscape scale may be confounding whigham et al 1988 because ecological integrity in streams with a high proportion of wetlands such as in the coastal plains can be highly variable this is perhaps why a variable selection process chose percent of natural land cover but not percent wetlands cover as a predictor of flow metrics the cbn modeling using the gibbs sampler as described in this work is most effective for networks linked by relatively simple models although a model s complexity can be increased through a more realistic network structure the gibbs sampler is most computationally effective when empirical relationships connecting nodes of a network can be represented by linear models and nonlinear models that can be linearized through proper variable transformation in our research we were unable to develop a similar model using indicators from fish population survey data perhaps because the fish response to watershed change is unlikely to be linear rosenfeld 2017 similarly in a previous usgs national water qualityassessment study on the effects of urbanization on stream ecosystems euse macroinvertebrate indicators were also found to be more responsive than fish indicators to watershed level urbanization kashuba et al 2010 future work could usefully explore those ecological metrics that can be linked in simple linear models to management relevant drivers to support predictions that incorporate uncertainty and can be updated as the future indeed unfolds 5 conclusions the bayesian network model cbn developed for this study was used to forecast stream ecological condition across a heterogeneous riverscape in response to changes in precipitation and temperature this model is highly integrative adaptive and can be updated global climate models using rcp 8 5 predict that stream biological condition under future climate scenarios 2025 2065 have a high probability of being worse than good fair during at least one projected time step across most of the study area the stream ecological condition indicator the richness of tolerant aquatic macroinvertebrates r i c h t o l appeared to be more responsive to changes in precipitation than to the changes in temperature the predictive scenarios presented represent actionable science that supports a better understanding of long term climate related changes in water and ecosystems and is directly relatable

16611,a continuous variable bayesian network cbn model is used to link watershed development and climate change to stream ecosystem indicators a graphical model reflecting our understanding of the connections between climate change weather condition loss of natural land cover stream flow characteristics and stream ecosystem indicators is used as the basis for selecting flow metrics for predicting macroinvertebrate based indicators selected flow metrics were then linked to variables representing watershed development and climate change we fit the model to data from two river basins in southeast us and the resulting model was used to simulate future stream ecological conditions using projected future climate and development scenarios the three climate models predicted varying ecological condition trajectories but similar worst case ecological conditions the established modeling approach couples mechanistic understanding with field data to develop predictions of management relevant variables across a heterogeneous landscape we discussed the transferability of the modeling approach keywords bayesian network climate change ecological condition regression streamflow metrics watershed 1 introduction prediction plays an increasingly important role in environmental management in a nonstationary world milly et al 2008 poff 2018 managers can act most effectively if they can anticipate where environmental conditions are most likely to require intervention to maintain ecosystem derived goods and services this applies to freshwater ecosystems for which future water availability will depend on climate conditions and watershed land use as well as on human needs and water management actions mcdonald et al 2011 palmer et al 2008 stream ecosystems in particular provide goods and services to society in proportion to ecological function which in turn depends in large part on streamflow characteristics baron et al 2002 models that can relate local stream ecological condition to watershed scale drivers particularly land use and climate variables and then predict likely future scenarios may help managers identify regions where large environmental changes are likely and perhaps target actions that could alleviate undesired outcomes peterson et al 2013 wenger et al 2010 ecologists have taken a variety of modeling approaches for predicting future conditions of stream ecosystems managers focused on species conservation for example may benefit from models of future species distribution or population status however managers concerned with environmental condition as defined by regulatory statutes more often rely on indicators of ecological health managers use indicators such as dominance by pollution tolerant organisms and other community based attributes to assess the effects of pollution sedimentation and a variety of other stressors often acting in combination on ecological condition of streams and rivers barbour et al 2000 davies and jackson 2006 building the tools to predict condition or indicator scores under future land use and climate conditions could thus provide particular value to managers and regulators charged with meeting environmental standards e g as established under the u s clean water act the connections between human activities and climate variables and indicators of stream ecosystem condition are complex grimm et al 2013 shifts in ecological indicators may reflect direct e g contaminant or sediment loading waite et al 2019 or indirect e g hydrologic shifts roy et al 2005 effects of human activities in a watershed modeling causal relations between the factors that we can reasonably project for example future land use temperature and flow regimes and environmental indicators entails major challenges one common challenge is selecting variables that predict outcomes for a given data set and yet have general applicability a second challenge involves building predictions using relationships estimated from characteristically noisy data when responses may be determined by a variety of drivers thus although studies have successfully simulated effects of land use and land cover lulc and climate changes on streamflow patterns lafontaine et al 2019 e g the connection between lulc or climate changes and stream ecosystem conditions is still a broad area of study the field of eco hydrology is increasingly moving towards developing solutions for environmental management arthington et al 2018 including development of suitable quantitative research tools while process based mechanistic models are more likely to capture the state of the art understanding of the ecologic processes complex mechanistic models cannot be realistically calibrated to existing monitoring data because of the spatiotemporal scale mismatch between what a model predicts and what can be observed as a result mechanistic models rarely provide predictive accuracy assessment needed for management on the other hand empirical statistical models are necessarily based on available monitoring data with predictive accuracy assessment readily available however an empirical model captures correlation not necessarily causal relation consequently empirical models are often unsuitable for predicting future changes a combination of the two modeling approaches could be helpful our study part of the empirical modeling component of the usgs national water census nwc coastal carolina focus area study ccfas is designed to integrate empirical modeling approaches under a structure defined by the state of the art understanding of the underlying causal links the paper reports 1 a variable selection approach based on a systematic exploration of large data sets using classification and regression tree models cart and the linear absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso and 2 application of a modified continuous variable bayesian network cbn model qian and miltner 2015 developed based on a graphic model linking the selected variables based on the conceptual causal model fig 1 a monte carlo simulation algorithm is developed to incorporate projected future climate and lulc condition scenarios in the study area to predict likely future changes in stream ecosystem indicators a space for time modeling approach is implemented in which the differences in climate land use and flow alteration among sites are used to infer differences at a site through time our objective is to provide water resource managers with tools and information necessary to make informed management decisions 2 methods 2 1 study area the cape fear and yadkin pee dee rivers drain the foothills of the blue ridge piedmont and coastal plain of north nc and south carolina sc usa before entering the atlantic ocean fig 2 population has increased dramatically since the 1970s particularly in the coastal region this growth has affected both the quantity and quality of surface water in the region as municipal industrial and agricultural consumption increases over pumping of groundwater in parts of these basins has greatly lowered groundwater levels carswell et al 1988 and decreased the amount and quality of water available to support aquatic ecosystems future climate and land use shifts threaten to further reduce biological condition in the region s streams 2 2 data 2 2 1 ecological data benthic invertebrate for the cape fear and yadkin pee dee river basins were collected by the nc department of environmental quality ncdeq and the sc department of health environmental control scdhec the ncdeq data were obtained from the usepa storet database 1 1 https www tinyurl com y4b4hbre whereas scdhec data were obtained directly from scdhec jim glover personal communication 2016 ncdeq data were restricted to samples collected using full scale and swamp sample collection methods ncdeq 2016 scdhec samples were collected using comparable methods jim glover personal communication 2016 the sc invertebrate data were presented as counts whereas nc abundances were presented as categorical rare common or abundant values consequently nc and sc data could only be combined based on the presence or absence of taxa data between 1988 and 2014 were reviewed for inclusion in the study temporal and spatial filters were applied to reduce pseudo replication and autocorrelation arising from the proximity of sample sites in time and space armstrong et al 2011 hurlbert 1984 this was accomplished by including data only from the most recent sample collection period and examining sites located within 0 5 km of each other to determine if they were environmentally distinct e g main stem and tributary sites or separated by an intervening point source or environmental discontinuity wenger et al 2008 if sites were not environmentally distinct then the downstream most site was selected for analysis site locations were based on the reported latitude and longitude coordinates and geo referenced to the nearest nhdplus stream segment using arcgis tidally influenced sites and very small headwater ca 5 2 square kilometers basins were removed because flow conditions at these sites could not be modeled these temporal and spatial filters resulted in 237 cape fear and 313 yadkin pee dee sampling sites fig 2 that were suitable for model development nc and sc invertebrate data were prepared for analysis by harmonizing taxa across data sources and years e g updating taxonomy standardizing nomenclature resolving taxonomic ambiguities within samples and calculating assemblage metrics the invertebrate data analysis system idas software cuffney and brightbill 2010 was used to calculate metrics and to resolve ambiguous taxa by distributing the abundances of ambiguous parents among their children separately for each sample cuffney et al 2007 tolerance metrics were calculated using ncdeq pollution tolerance values ncdeq 2016 supplemented with usepa tolerance values barbour et al 1999 metric calculations were restricted to the calculation of richness i e number of taxa metrics due to the differences in the characterization of abundances in the nc and sc programs invertebrate response modeling focused on the responses of two metrics ept ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera richness e p t r and the average tolerance of taxa present in the sample calculated as r i c h t o l i 1 n t v i n where n is the number of taxa in the sample and t v i is the pollution tolerance value 0 to 10 lowest to highest pollution tolerance of the i th taxon e p t r and r i c h t o l were chosen because they have been shown to respond well to environmental degradation of streams cuffney et al 2010 and are often used to assess biological conditions in bio monitoring programs ncdeq 2016 2 2 2 streamflow data the soil and water assessment tool swat was used to develop simulated streamflow at all ecological sampling locations in the study area swat is a well established basin scale watershed process model arnold et al 1998 neitsch et al 2005 the swat watershed model is designed to simulate management effects on streamflow at gauged and ungauged watersheds gassman et al 2007 and can simulate changes in water availability as a result of changing climate water use demand or land use the arcgis extension for swat arcswat version 2012 10 4 19 was used with arcgis 10 4 1 for model development see sanchez et al 2020 for additional information on swat model calibration and projections of future water demand for the cape fear and pee dee basins mean daily flows at invertebrate sampling sites were estimated for 1988 2014 using swat ecologically important measures of hydrological variability e g magnitude timing frequency duration and rate of change gao et al 2009 poff et al 2010 poff and ward 1989 were calculated using the statistics package eflowstats 2 2 github com usgs r eflowstats flow metrics were calculated for the year prior to the date of sample collection because eflowstats can calculate many metrics 180 additional analyses are required to remove redundant metrics and to identify a small subset of flow metrics that are associated with changes in invertebrate assemblages land use climate and population 2 2 3 land use and land cover change projection land cover within the drainage basin associated with each sampling site was derived from the decadal estimates of national land cover developed by falcone 2015 gis was used to estimate the area of each land cover class in each basin for the years 1982 1992 2002 and 2012 land cover for the years between decadal assessments was derived by linear interpolation the land cover associated with the invertebrate sample year was used in the development of invertebrate response models land cover from 2012 was used to characterize land cover for samples collected in 2013 and 2014 two development scenarios were developed by sanchez et al 2020 and combined with three climate models to develop projected future scenarios including future land use precipitation and temperature variables for each watershed future land cover changes will primarily be driven by urbanization as existing urban areas expand consequently land cover changes for the period 2012 2065 were simulated using the future urban regional environment simulation meentemeyer et al 2013 futures for two urbanization scenarios 1 continued historic trend of growth higher demand scenario and 2 clustered higher density development lower demand scenario land change projections for both urbanization scenarios are presented at an annual time step in a format consistent with the national land cover database sanchez et al 2020 2 2 4 simulated and down scaled climate change predictions

cgcm3 and the norwegian earth system model bentsen et al 2013 noresm1 m precipitation and air temperature for the period 1988 2014 were based on the university of idaho s gridmet data set abatzoglou

temperature and precipitation were derived for each hydrologic response unit hru associated with the ecological sampling sites data from the grid point that was closest to the pour point of the swat model hru were used to characterize conditions at the hru conditions at the invertebrate sampling sites were characterized by aggregating the hru data after weighting for their contribution to the total basin area both temperature and precipitation were summarized for the year prior to sample collection and expressed as mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of values for the year and the seasons 2 3 variable selection selecting variables for an empirical predictive model is an iterative and case specific process gelman and hill 2007 qian 2016 in our case we want to populate the conceptual diagram fig 1 with relevant variables selected from hundreds of available variables for example streamflow metrics that are predictive of stream ecological indicators and watershed climate land use and land cover variables that are predictive of the selected streamflow metrics the selected variables must also be able to be part of the network model to link climate and watershed activities to streamflow and then to stream ecological conditions as such we used an approach to identify relevant variables among a large number of potential variables e g there are more than 400 streamflow metrics the process starts with an exploration of all available variables using parametric and nonparametric methods classification and regression tree analysis breiman et al 1984 cart is a nonparametric method often used for exploring important factors affecting the response variable and for developing predictive models qian and anderson 1999 demonstrated the value of cart as a variable selection method in cases where a large number of potential predictors are available a distinct advantage of cart as a variable selection tool is that we can screen a large number of potential predictors without the concern of over fitting the model the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator lasso is a penalized linear parametric regression model with regression coefficients intercept and slopes estimated to minimize the deviance residual sum of squares in normal response model plus a penalty term tibshirani 1996 the penalty term shrinks slopes of all predictors towards zero smaller absolute values compared to the conventional linear regression model predictors that are not relevant to predicting the response variables often have slopes reaching zero as a result lasso can be used as a variable selection method that supports model development both cart and lasso are standalone models they cannot be integrated into a network model as a result we used them as part of our exploratory analysis for selecting relevant variables 2 4 exploratory plots using cart we screened all potential predictors and their potential interactions using the r package rpart as outlined in qian 2016 chapter 7 using lasso we identified the most effective predictors for a linear model we further explored these two sets of variables using plots 1 scatter plots of the response variable against the predictors to provide a visual assessment of the association especially nonlinear associations and 2 conditional plots of the response variable against two or more predictors cleveland 1993 to explore potential interactions based on our conceptual diagram linking watershed natural and cultural conditions to stream ecological conditions fig 1 we combined the two exploratory variable selection models and exploratory plots to establish two sets of empirical models first we explored and selected flow metrics from among more than 400 metrics that can be used to predict the selected ecosystem indicator r i c h t o l section 2 2 1 second we explored the watershed scale predictors of the selected flow metrics these empirical models were a simplified representation of the conceptual causal diagram and can be connected to form a bayesian network model fig 3 2 5 modified continuous variable bayesian network model a traditional bayesian network model is specifically for categorical predictors to avoid the difficulties in deciding the proper means for discretizing a continuous variable nojavan et al 2017 qian and miltner 2015 developed a continuous variable bayesian network cbn parameterized in two steps our selected variables and the network model in fig 3 complete the first step following the iterative process of model fitting model evaluation and model revision gelman and hill 2007 to find the most parsimonious model forms using the procedure of developing predictive regression models outlined in qian 2016 chapter 5 these independently developed regression models were connected based on the final bayesian network model diagram fig 3 our network consists of nine nodes represented by watershed input variables watershed drainage area d a percent

et al 2013 and stream ecosystem condition indicator r i c h t o l which was strongly correlated with e p t r in the model selection process step 1 d h 20 was eliminated from the model collectively the diagram represents a linked network that can be summarized in connected regression models three nodes in the diagram have arrows pointed to them response variables representing three regression models

interactions between some predictors and ecoregion the full model has 23 unknown parameters table 1 instead of using a markov chain monte carlo simulation approach as in qian and miltner 2015 that is computationally demanding we developed a gibbs sampler algorithm based on linear model theories it greatly reduces computational intensity and facilitates the predictive monte carlo simulation details of the gibbs sampler and the monte carlo simulation for prediction are in the online supporting materials section 6 2 6 simulation for prediction because the bayesian network is a directed and acyclic graph prediction also follows the direction of the network from the terminal parent nodes to terminal child nodes furthermore because model coefficients are estimated using the gibbs sampler our prediction will also be presented with random samples from the predictive distribution using the projected future climate precipitation and temperature and future lulc we predict the future stream ecological condition the prediction is compared to a baseline condition represented by the mean of ecological condition in 2014 through 2019 2 7 linking an ecological indicator to regulatory

condition is defined into five categories excellent good good fair fair and poor based on scoring criteria applied to a subset of ecological metrics ncdeq 2016 to make the predicted ecological indicator under future climate and development scenarios relevant to state regulatory objectives we used the ordered multinomial logit model gelman and hill 2007 section 6 5 to link r i c h t o l values to nc s biological condition categories delineated using assessment and metric data from the invertebrate sampling sites the model estimated four r i c h t o l thresholds which divide the r i c h t o l values into five subsets each corresponding to a biological condition category details of the model development are presented in the online supporting materials section 6 3 results computational details of the exploratory analysis and the monte carlo simulation for estimating regression coefficients are documented in the on line supporting materials section 6 the final cbn model consists of three individual linear regression models representing two levels of connections connecting variables of watershed land use soil condition and precipitation to two flow metrics and linking flow metrics and temperature to a stream ecological indicator fig 3 these regression models represent a combination of our conceptual understanding and empirical modeling the conceptual diagram fig 1 guided the exploratory data analysis to select variables representing each node in the diagram fig 3 which in turn led to individual regression models model coefficients of the three regression models in the first level connection from environmental variables to flow metrics are estimated based on bayesian regression analysis estimating the joint posterior distribution of these coefficients see qian 2016 chapter 9 3 1 cbn model coefficients all component models of the cbn model include the four level 3 ecoregions represented in our study area as a categorical predictor regression model coefficients for the middle atlantic coastal plains region 63 differ from the coefficients of the other three regions 45 piedmont 65 southeastern plains and 66 blue ridge table 1 all estimated slopes β 1 4 and the ecoregion interaction offsets δ 0 4 in table 1 are statistically different from 0 i e 95 credible intervals do not include 0 in nearly all cases the flow metrics and the ecological indicator in the middle atlantic coastal plains ecoregion 63 do not respond to the respective predictors as strongly as the same responded in other ecoregions the absolute values of β k δ k slopes for ecoregion 63 are generally smaller than the absolute values of β k slopes for other ecoregions for example the slope of precipitation of the base flow model is β 23 δ 23 0 8175 0 9580 0 1405 for ecoregion 63 and β 23 0 8175 for the other three ecoregions table 1 the two flow metrics are largely influenced by annual precipitation less so in ecoregion 63 the stream ecosystem condition indicator r i c h t o l is negatively related to the mean log daily flow β 32 table 1 and base flow β 33 and positively related to summer mean temperature β 34 suggesting that increased flow and base flow would improve ecosystem condition reduce r i c h t o l whereas increased temperature would lead to worsening ecosystem condition r i c h t o l in ecoregion 63 does not respond to changes in natural land cover does not change as a function of summer temperature and is less affected by changes in base flow table 1 the ecological model for ecoregion 63 has a substantially higher intercept than the model for the other three ecoregions r i c h t o l on average is higher in ecoregion 63 than in other regions given the dampened response to the predictors our model would predict a narrower range of r i c h t o l in the middle atlantic coastal plain than the ranges for the other three ecoregions under future climate and land use scenarios see table 2 3 2 ecological changes under projected future climate conditions the projected future climate conditions vary by climate models fig 4 however the predicted percent of natural land cover sum of forest shrub and wetlands is largely unchanged both over time and between the two development scenarios section 6 the simulation results allow us to estimate the likelihood that ecological conditions for each watershed will deteriorate over time represented by the probabilities that future year s r i c h t o l values for each watershed will be larger than the respective baseline r i c h t o l values the trends of mean r i c h t o l are largely determined by climate scenarios fig 5 high temperature is associated with high r i c h t o l values and high precipitation is associated with low r i c h t o l values table 1 because the predicted r i c h t o l for each watershed is a probability distribution we can estimate the probabilities that individual watersheds will have higher r i c h t o l in future years compared to the baseline condition or the probability of deterioration fig 6 the estimated probability of deterioration can be misleading as a watershed already with a high r i c h t o l value is less likely to experience further deterioration thereby showing a small probability of future r i c h t o l exceeding the baseline level accordingly we estimated the probabilities of each watershed achieving a biological condition of worse than good fair based on the ordered multinomial logit model estimated threshold of r i c h t o l 6 which separates the management biological condition of better than good fair from fair and poor this probability of worse than good fair or probability r i c h t o l 6 is a better indication of future conditions than the probability of deterioration from a baseline condition we estimated the projected proportion of watersheds in each of the three level 3 ecoregions that would have a probability of biological condition worse than good fair exceeding 0 75 highly likely to be worse than good fair using future temperature and precipitation from the three climate models table 2 all three models projected that 70 or more watersheds in the piedmont and southeastern plains would be highly likely to have stream biological condition worse than good fair under all three models during at least one of the nine projected time steps in table 2 although with a different timing for the middle atlantic coastal plains all three models predicted generally low percentages of watersheds to be worse than good fair the difference between ecoregion 63 and the rest of the study area is a reflection of the lack of response of both the flow metrics and the ecological condition indicators in ecoregion 63 to the selected predictors 1 although r i c h t o l was correlated with both summer temperature and annual precipitation table 1 in the piedmont and southeastern plains the stream ecological condition indicator was more responsive to changes in precipitation than to the changes in temperature the bold values in table 2 show years when the predicted percent of watersheds that are highly likely to have biological conditions worse than good fair is above 70 the timing is more in response to the fluctuation in the projected precipitation fig 4 left column than to the steady increase in summer temperature fig 4 right column these aggregated summaries can be mapped into individual watersheds to represent spatial differences in temporal changes in ecological condition indicator to make the map informative we categorize the probability of having biological condition worse than good fair into four classes unlikely probability range 0 0 25 less likely 0 25 0 5 more likely 0 5 0 75 and highly likely 0 75 1 the categorization is a convenient means to present the spatial distribution of the estimated probabilities fig 7 the spatial distributions show that the three climate models resulted in a generally consistent assessment of the worst case scenario future stream ecological conditions the baseline condition shows a general upstream to downstream northwest to southeast gradient consistent with the general increasing trend in watershed population density all three models predict that the stream biological conditions under future climate scenarios will likely be worse than good fair during at least one projected time step across most of the study area except for the few watersheds in the blue ridge area ecoregion 66 4 discussion developing a continuous variable bayesian network model allowed us to forecast a metric of stream ecological condition across geographically heterogeneous river basins in response to changes in precipitation and air temperature under future climate scenarios our process of variable selection using spatially extensive ecological data coupled with a simple conceptual model identified a tractable set of predictive stream flow variables that could be linked to climate and geographic drivers our variable selection and model building approach the coupled parametric lasso and nonparametric cart models for variable screening combined with exhaustive graphical exploration for model forms appears to be highly effective for selecting representative variables and forming the network model the resulting parameterized cbn provided spatially explicit probabilistic predictions of the ecological response metric by capturing and conveying levels of uncertainty as probabilities for specific outcomes as well as spatial variation in forecast outcomes this modeling approach could be particularly useful to managers by identifying climate conditions likely to degrade ecological value in differing geographic areas our model is exploratory because data used for model development i e modeled streamflow future precipitation temperature and land cover were mostly derived from process based model simulations in a way part of our model linking watershed variables to stream flow metrics is a simplified representation of these models because the process based models represent relatively fine temporal spatial scales the links between development and climate variables to ecological conditions are not obvious due to the inevitable high levels of uncertainty both natural variability and model uncertainty in many cases combining simple mechanistic processes and empirical modeling is necessary for modeling stream ecological indicators webb et al 2018 using the cbn model we simplify the model and establish the connection between the three groups of variables watershed level variables stream flow metrics and stream ecological indicators that are directly relevant to regional water resources management such simplification is achieved by spatial and temporal aggregation through statistical models the aggregated representation is often relevant to management decision making at a regional scale our predictions of future stream ecological condition were based on three climate models and two land use scenarios both with large uncertainty we acknowledged such uncertainty by using a probabilistic prediction to summarize the level of uncertainty in our model and data nevertheless our predictions are unlikely to be accurate the value of such prediction is a systematic summary of what we know and such a summary can be updated as we accumulate new data because of the bayesian nature of the model the sequential updating under the bayesian framework has been explored for updating highly uncertain predictions elsewhere qian et al 2021 such sequential updating is also a valuable feature because we used the approach of space for time substitution to summarize the relationship between climate and land use patterns on stream ecological conditions the space for time approach does not include the potential temporal correlation in ecological conditions in that once a stream s ecological condition deteriorates it may not bounce back immediately when the weather condition improves consequently we used the years with high temperature and low precipitation from each of the three climate models to evaluate the worst case scenario furthermore the space for time approach can potentially fall victim to a statistical phenomenon known as simpson s paradox which describes the potentially conflicting results when analyzing the same relationship at different levels of spatial or temporal aggregations in this case simpson s paradox indicates that empirical relationships established across a large spatial scale may not hold in a specific location over time qian et al 2019 simpson 1951 however a bayesian model can be updated either for the same study area with new data or applying the model to a smaller watershed or a different watershed in both cases we can use the current model output as the basis for developing prior distributions of model parameters to combine with new or site specific data for an updated model or site specific model qian et al 2021 all three climate models predicted a steady increase in summer temperature and a large variation in annual precipitation the predicted percent of watersheds that was highly likely to have a biological condition worse than good fair in the predicted time steps was more in line with the changes in predicted precipitation table 2 these results indicate that predicted changes in precipitation are more responsible than the changes in temperature for the projected changes in stream ecological response in particular years with exceptionally low precipitation were expected to result in poor ecological conditions in affected streams the maintenance of streamflow supporting ecological condition is well supported arthington et al 2018 poff 2018 therefore understanding how changes in precipitation affect the water required to support aquatic ecosystems is critical for long term water management especially in areas such as the southeastern u s that experience climate driven periods of water stress when seasonal flow diminish a disruption in life history or behavioral cues can occur boulton 2003 lytle 2002 in this study the flow attributes m l 20 base flow and l o g f μ mean of daily log discharge were identified as critical to supporting ecological condition represented by r i c h t o l for example emergence periods for more sensitive taxa such as ephemeroptera plecoptera and some trichoptera ept may be affected by reductions in annual base flow kennen et al 2010 such changes may result in reduced abundance of sensitive taxa and increases in taxa that are more tolerant of changes in annual base flow kennen et al 2014 in parts of north and south carolina surface water and groundwater withdrawals have reduced base flow and estimates of water use indicate that the total amount of fresh surface water withdrawals across the region amounted to 11 7 billion m 3 year 1 maupin et al 2014 consequently policies and management actions that maintain adequate stream flow conditions during dry periods could help support ecological integrity our model predicted a weak ecological response for coastal plain sites to future climate change coastal plain streams tend to be ecologically unpredictable marion et al 2015 and are known to have a strong connection to groundwater and extensive floodplains and wetlands causing these streams to respond differently to changes in precipitation and human exploitation for example groundwater stored on the extensive floodplains of coastal plain streams may also buffer flows leading to changes in the timing and magnitude of flows in response to precipitation events compared to streams with higher gradients and less extensive floodplains and associated wetlands lotic benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages are also challenging to model in coastal plain streams streams that arise on the coastal plain store large amounts of benthic organic matter and have low velocity flows these conditions can lead to harsh environmental conditions during the summer low flow periods when water temperatures are high dissolved oxygen levels are low and current velocities are more characteristic of lentic than lotic systems consequently the macroinvertebrate assemblage characteristics used to assess biological conditions in non coastal plain steams e g r i c h t o l may not adequately capture the condition of the coastal plain swamp streams where benthic assemblages may be dominated by midges and worms state agencies for example the north carolina department of environmental quality are actively assessing appropriate indicators of biological conditions for these swamp streams ncdeq 2016 from an empirical modeling perspective our model succeeded in predicting the variation in r i c h t o l by separating non responsive sites in coastal plain from sites in other ecoregions we expected land cover variables and future land cover change would link strongly to stream flow and ecological condition wetlands are known to improve water quality and dampen the effects of hydrologic variability however their cumulative effects on stream integrity at a landscape scale may be confounding whigham et al 1988 because ecological integrity in streams with a high proportion of wetlands such as in the coastal plains can be highly variable this is perhaps why a variable selection process chose percent of natural land cover but not percent wetlands cover as a predictor of flow metrics the cbn modeling using the gibbs sampler as described in this work is most effective for networks linked by relatively simple models although a model s complexity can be increased through a more realistic network structure the gibbs sampler is most computationally effective when empirical relationships connecting nodes of a network can be represented by linear models and nonlinear models that can be linearized through proper variable transformation in our research we were unable to develop a similar model using indicators from fish population survey data perhaps because the fish response to watershed change is unlikely to be linear rosenfeld 2017 similarly in a previous usgs national water qualityassessment study on the effects of urbanization on stream ecosystems euse macroinvertebrate indicators were also found to be more responsive than fish indicators to watershed level urbanization kashuba et al 2010 future work could usefully explore those ecological metrics that can be linked in simple linear models to management relevant drivers to support predictions that incorporate uncertainty and can be updated as the future indeed unfolds 5 conclusions the bayesian network model cbn developed for this study was used to forecast stream ecological condition across a heterogeneous riverscape in response to changes in precipitation and temperature this model is highly integrative adaptive and can be updated global climate models using rcp 8 5 predict that stream biological condition under future climate scenarios 2025 2065 have a high probability of being worse than good fair during at least one projected time step across most of the study area the stream ecological condition indicator the richness of tolerant aquatic macroinvertebrates r i c h t o l appeared to be more responsive to changes in precipitation than to the changes in

the investigation of earth s microbiome is of increasing interest for scientists and engineers across many disciplines who seek to harness the molecular machinery of microbes in order to address current grand challenges facing humanity including food production environmental health and sustainable energy production alivisatos et al 2015 dubilier et al 2015 despite the broad application of microbiome engineering and biotechnology in nearly every aspect of our lives the real potential of our planet s environmental microbiome is far from fully explored rittmann 2006 the recent development of high throughput nucleic acid sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the diversity of microbial communities in various natural and engineered ecosystems castelle and banfield 2018 rinke

design build test learn dbtl for microbiome engineering lawson et al 2019 in order to effectively guide the development of these continuously changing microbial resources we need to not only identify microbial community members in activated sludge systems but more importantly we need to evaluate who is doing what when and with whom singer et al 2017 furthermore since we are still in the early stages of understanding how some complex mechanisms e g quorum sensing and secondary metabolites regulate the community level behavior for open mixed culture systems phelan et al 2012 it could be helpful to simplify ecosystem level functional analyses by studying the in situ physiology of highly active or key functional microorganisms in activated sludge systems understanding the ecophysiology of functional key populations can inform how controllable parameters in engineered bioprocesses spatially and temporally affect microbial activities and dynamic interplay this knowledge is vital for interpreting and predicting community level behaviors and metaphenotypes in order to guarantee desired outputs under changing environmental operational conditions lindemann et al 2016 prosser 2012 since it s mainly the active fraction of complex microbial communities who are drivers of microbiome structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 broadly applied post genomic techniques to study the ecophysiology of microbiomes such as metagenomics and metaproteomics so far lack single cell resolution however recent technical developments made it possible to link cell identification with individual cell activities at high accuracy and with high throughput resulting in new insights into the dynamics and heterogeneity of cellular activity in complex microbial communities hatzenpichler et al 2020 here we adapted and optimized protocols that combine bioorthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging boncat hatzenpichler et al 2016 with fluorescence activated cell sorting facs and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing fig 1 to monitor translationally active bacterial populations in activated sludge we analyzed activated sludge samples from a sequencing batch reactor sbr at a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp treating municipal wastewater the wwtp was designed for enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr which makes it an interesting system to study activity levels of individual microorganisms since ebpr systems are a sustainable and cost effective solution for phosphate recovery from wastewaters but the microbial ecology of these systems is currently not well

sludge microbiome were then analyzed and separated using facs facs sorted cells were subsequently subjected to dna preparation amplification and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we optimized protocol integration for boncat facs and amplicon sequencing besides evaluating optimal parameters for the application of boncat and the performance of facs on activated sludge samples we also tested and optimized different dna preparation techniques a cell lysis protocol a commercial dna extraction kit and multiple displacement amplification and developed a 2 step sequencing library preparation protocol for facs sorted low biomass samples experimental controls and technical replicates included in our method optimization efforts helped to overcome common challenges and analysis biases associated with the cell labeling sorting and sequencing of low biomass subcommunities of complex aggregated microbial assemblages as observed in activated sludge this newly developed boncat facs protocol described in this study will inform the development of predictive microbial community performance models that not only improve bioreactor design and operational conditions for wwtps but might also promote the future development of microbiome engineering tools for other biotechnologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge sampling and boncat incubation activated sludge sampling and

250 ml sludge samples were collected from a sampling port after flushing pipes for about 5 min one ml each of the well mixed activated sludge slurry was then pipetted into three 2 ml centrifuge tubes

sequencing reads in the boncat labeled activated sludge samples bas as part of the core activated sludge microbiome and refer to them as abundant the core microbiome includes all taxa with a relative sequence abundance of 0 36 taxa with a lower relative sequence abundance were considered rare 2 6 boncat activity categories in order to distinguish active and inactive microbial populations in activated sludge based on their de novo protein synthesis level we used flow cytometry dot plot data of fsc vs green fluorescence of bas samples fig 2 illustrates the gating strategy used to categorize activated sludge cells as active or inactive based on their boncat mediated relative fluorescence intensity activated sludge microbial cells in gate p5 were considered to be active boncat and cells in gate p3 were considered to be inactive boncat fig 2 the subcommunities of boncat and boncat events accounted for 16 4 and 67 9 of the total activated sludge community bas samples respectively table s4 based on the percent abundance of boncat and boncat subcommunities observed by flow cytometry table s4 we placed all classified microbial taxa into different categories of translational activity for that we compared each taxa s average relative sequence abundance in the sorted boncat or boncat population to its average relative sequence abundance in the total activated sludge community bas samples table s6 according to the following equations 1 r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e o f b o n c a t c e l l s o f a s p e c i f i c t a x a i n b a s s a m p l e s a r s a o

samples into one of four activity categories the four activity categories were called most active moderately active inactive and active inactive the activity categories were defined as follows a taxa was considered most active when its relative abundance of boncat cells was than the boncat subcommunity community average 16 4 and when its relative abundance of boncat cells was than the boncat subcommunity community average 67 9 moderately active taxa had to have a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average and a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average accordingly inactive taxa had a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average as well as a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average all taxa that had a relative abundance of boncat and boncat cells than the community average were categorized as active inactive 3 results 3 1 boncat to identify translationally active bacteria the ability to use boncat to characterize translationally active microbial communities in environmental samples has been demonstrated in previous studies on deep sea and hotspring sediments soil and sputum from cystic fibrosis patients couradeau et al 2019 hatzenpichler et al 2016 hatzenpichler et al 2014 reichart et al 2020 valentini et al 2020 in order to assess whether boncat can be combined with facs to label and subsequently sort translationally active microbial communities from activated sludge we performed a couple of method optimization and control experiments fig 1 outlines the multi step boncat facs approach of this study and all steps involved in dna sequence analyses including 16s rrna gene amplicon library preparation library sequencing sequence classification and statistical analyses for the boncat incubation step we performed initial experiments to determine an optimal hpg concentration 500 µm and incubation time 15 min for efficient cell labeling incubation experiments and results are described in detail in the supplementary information fig s1 we also performed initial experiments to determine optimal sonication conditions 120 kj l to break up flocs and cell aggregates of the paraformaldehyde fixed activated sludge samples sonication experiments and results are described in detail in the supplementary information fig s2 only activated sludge samples incubated with the hpg amino acid analog contained green fluorescent cells following click chemistry and cell staining fig s3 confirming that boncat labeling relied on amino acid uptake and incorporation the short incubation time of 15 min did allow for sufficient cell labeling while the used hpg concentration 500 µm did not stimulate growth of activated sludge cells in our experiments the hpg concentration we used in this study was comparable to known average methionine concentrations in activated sludge 370 µm subrahmanyam et al 1960 in order to evaluate if hpg incubation stimulated microbial growth we quantified cells in sludge samples incubated in the presence and absence of hpg by flow cytometry to do that with our flow sorter we quantified the total number of events passing the interrogation point of the flow cytometer within a time interval of 10 s no significant differences between event counts of an unlabeled control cas and a hpg incubated activated sludge sample bas were observed t test p value 0 52 n 3 table s1 3 2 dna preparation from low biomass samples the quality of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data to determine the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in environmental samples strongly depends among other things on the quality of the template dna for library preparation we therefore evaluated three different approaches to prepare dna from boncat labeled cell fractions following facs sorting the aim of these experiments was to overcome limitations imposed by working with relatively low biomass samples 600 000 events ml as well as chemical alteration of cellular biomolecules as result of cell staining and chemical fixation in order to study the effects of boncat labeling and different dna preparation techniques on the microbial community composition we compared 8 replicate 16s rrna gene sequence data sets of each of the unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas the two sorted activated sludge populations boncat and boncat and the sheath fluids controls fig 3 the mda samples squares in fig 3 clustered together and away from all other samples community richness was significantly reduced in the mda samples while the number of obtained raw sequence reads for all sequenced samples was comparable the number of amplicon sequence variants asvs found in the mda samples 11 to 46 asvs was much lower than the number of asvs found in the unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas prepared with the cell lysis and dna extraction kits 243 886 asvs table s2 because of the strong community shift introduced by mda we did not further consider this method for dna preparation of our sorted activated sludge samples boncat and boncat the sequencing replicates of dna preparations by cell lysis and dna extraction formed distinct clusters in the pcoa fig 3 sheath fluid controls white diamonds and circles in fig 3 for both dna preparation techniques clustered separately from all unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas independent of their prior incubation with hpg or not this shows that while background contamination by sheath fluid and reagents used for dna amplification was unavoidable it did not affect the microbial community composition of the unsorted activated sludge samples since the sheath fluid microbial community was distinctly different from the activated sludge microbial community sequencing and identification of asvs in these samples aided in the process of identifying and removing potential contaminants as detailed below in general sorted boncat samples for which dna was prepared by cell lysis red and yellow diamonds in fig 3 clustered closer to their respective unsorted activated sludge samples green and brown diamonds in fig 3 than the samples that have been extracted with the commercial dna extraction kit colored circles in fig 3 this shows that sorted boncat and boncat samples treated with the cell lysis protocol seemed to most closely resemble the microbial community composition of unsorted activated sludge samples using the dna extraction kit on sorted boncat samples red and yellow circles in fig 3 appeared to be problematic for these low biomass samples in the pcoa plot in fig 3 these samples clustered with the sheath flow control samples white circles indicating that commercial dna preparation kit failed in extracting genomic dna suitable for amplicon sequencing from chemically fixed low biomass activated sludge samples we also compared the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data from the cell lysis sorted activated sludge subcommunities and unsorted activated sludge samples and dna extraction samples only unsorted activated sludge samples from this study to the sequence data from a prior study performed on the same reactor johnston et al 2019 fig s4 also in this pcoa plot all samples treated with the cell lysis protocol were more similar in their microbial community composition to the previously sequenced total activated sludge microbial community by johnston et al johnston et al 2019 than the mda or dna extraction samples that the cell lysis samples from this study are similar but not identical in community composition to the prior study by johnston et al was expected and has several reasons activated sludge microbial communities undergo dynamic shifts over time samples in the johnston et al johnston et al 2019 study were not chemically fixed prior to extraction of dna with a commercial kit chemical cross linking of biomolecules caused by paraformaldehyde fixation of cells can affect dna extraction efficiency and sequencing results sequencing artifacts of dna from chemically fixed samples have been described previously do and dobrovic 2015 parker et al 2019 proteinase treatment as part of the cell lysis protocol on the other hand has been shown to be effective in degrading proteins crosslinked to dna stingele et al 2017 making the treated dna more accessible for downstream applications such as pcr and library preparation this finding emphasizes how important it is to carefully evaluate template dna preparation methods prior to comparing amplicon sequencing libraries and microbial community composition even among the same samples based on the results of the different dna preparation experiments we decided to use the cell lysis method for all boncat and control samples in further experiments 3 3 sorting purity and sample decontamination in order to evaluate the specificity and purity of our cell sorting approach we mixed gfp e coli cells with unlabeled activated sludge and used facs to sort the gfp e coli cells from the mixed activated sludge community again sorted gfp e coli cells were subjected to amplicon sequencing following cell lysis to assess sample purity fig 3 the 16s rrna gene sequence reads from the sorted gfp e coli samples clustered separately from all activated sludge and control samples taxonomic classification of the sequence reads from the sorted e coli samples together with the sequences obtained from the sheath flow controls were used to identify potential background contamination in our sorted samples as follows the accuracy of determining the microbial community composition of environmental samples based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing is often impaired by the introduction of contaminating dna that does not truly belong to the sampled community the contaminating dna can come from different sources such as the reagents used in sample preparation e g sheath fluid or the sequencing reaction this is especially critical for all low biomass samples in this study we used the r package decontam to identify and visualize contaminating dna features in all samples in addition sequencing amplicon libraries of sheath fluid controls and the sorted gpf e coli cells were used to manually identify and remove further contaminant sequences from all sample data sets the sheath fluid controls contained 11 to 28 asvs table s2 after processing with decontam which mainly classified into 6 different genera table s3 all of which had previously been described as commonly derived from contaminant dna sequences in low biomass samples davis et al 2018 eisenhofer et al 2019 karstens et al 2019 salter et al 2014 after removal of these contamination sequences the remaining sequences from the sorted gfp e coli cells all classified into one genus e coli which accounted for 95 8 to 97 8 of all decontaminated sequence reads obtained for these control samples this result demonstrated the high specificity and conservative gating strategy of our sorting approach removing potential contaminating sequences from our sequence libraries generated more accurate profiles of the sampled activated sludge communities and their boncat and boncat subcommunities 3 4 boncat identification of translationally active bacteria in activated sludge the systematic method optimization and control experiments described above have shown that boncat incubation and staining in combination with facs and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing can be used to identify translationally active microbial populations in activated sludge samples potential methodological issues stemming from background contamination and dna extraction of chemically fixed low biomass samples have been addressed and can largely be abated using the boncat facs approach to analyze microbial translational activity during the aerobic reaction phase of a sbr treating municipal wastewater showed that only a subcommunity of the activated sludge microbiome is translationally active during this phase fig 4 the heterogeneity of single cell fluorescence signal intensities of boncat cells as quantified in the fluorescence channel filter bandwidth 530 40 nm indicate that boncat is capable of visualizing different levels of translational activity in cells in a structurally heterogenous environmental sample cells of the same species population will have different needs for de novo protein synthesis and access to the hpg amino acid analog at any point in time which results in a broad continuous range of fluorescence signal intensities fluorescence signal intensities of boncat cells ranged over more than three orders of magnitude cells were sorted as boncat events when their fluorescence intensity was 10 fold above the background fluorescence of unstained activated sludge cells fig 2 gate p5 based on the applied gating strategy boncat and boncat populations account for 16 4 and 67 9 of all detected events in the analyzed activated sludge samples respectively fig 2b gates p3 and p5 when counting all events outside the boncat gate then 32 01 of all detected events had fluorescence signal intensities higher than the boncat population fig 2b sum of orange and black dots and table s4 the 16s rrna gene sequence reads of the boncat and boncat populations showed distinct alpha and beta diversities h 11 29 p value 0 002 f 73 20 p value 0 002 table s5 the microbial community of the boncat population was more similar to the total activated sludge microbial community bas samples h 7 46 p value 0 008 f 27 49 p value 0 002 than the boncat population h 11 29 p value 0 002 f 98 13 p value 0 002 table s5 3 5 taxonomic identification of active and inactive taxa comparing the taxonomic composition of the boncat population boncat population and total activated sludge microbial community bas samples we found that the three communities comprised 279 331 and 269 taxa at the genus level respectively all three communities shared 201 genera fig s5 these common genera accounted for 98 21 97 58 and 97 92 of all sequence reads in the boncat population boncat population and total activated sludge microbial community this demonstrates that the three communities shared a very similar core microbiome composition and that we needed to compare relative sequence abundances of the individual genera in each community to distinguish active and inactive taxa based on their abundance in each sample based on the relative abundance of boncat and boncat events quantified by flow cytometry table s4 we placed all classified taxa into different activity categories by comparing each taxa s relative sequence abundance in the boncat or boncat population to its relative sequence abundance in the total activated sludge community table s6 this allowed us to categorize taxa into three main activity groups that we named most active moderately active inactive taxa that had a higher than average sequence abundance in both boncat and boncat populations were place in a fourth activity group called active inactive table s6 lists all identified taxa and their relative sequence abundances in the total activated sludge community and in the sorted boncat populations the table also shows the relative abundance of each taxa of the boncat and boncat populations in the total activated sludge community bas samples these values determined the activity group categorization of each taxa in the total activated sludge community 19 taxa had a relative sequence abundance of 1 and 52 taxa had a sequence abundance of 0 36 these most abundant 52 taxa accounted for 80 15 of all quality filtered sequence reads in fig 5 the 52 taxa are plotted by their relative sequence abundance in each of the four activity groups of the 52 most abundant taxa 13 21 6 and 12 were assigned to the most active moderately active inactive and active inactive groups respectively by relative sequence abundance the four activity groups accounted for 21 21 26 68 15 59 and 16 67 respectively of all sequence reads in the total activated sludge community many identified genera in the most active group contain bacterial lineages known for intracellular phosphate accumulation these include tetrasphaera 4 40 fernando et al 2019 rhodobacter 5 56 mackenzie et al 2007 candidatus microthrix 0 78 mcilroy et al 2013 and acinetobacter 0 69 seviour et al 2003 fig 5 also the most abundant genus in the moderately active group candidatus accumulibacter 5 53 fig 5 is a known phosphate accumulating organisms paos often identified in ebpr systems stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 in general taxa identified as most active or moderately active were aerobes or facultative aerobes capable of metabolizing a diverse range of carbon compounds in the presence of oxygen all six taxa categorized as inactive belong to anaerobic but aerotolerant proteobacteria propionivibrio 12 10 was the most abundant inactive genus in the total activated sludge community propionivibrio have been described as typical glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in ebpr systems they can store volatile fatty acids as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions without the accumulation of poly p albertsen et al 2016 most taxa in the active inactive groups were chemoorganotrophic aerobes or facultative anaerobes leptothrix 0 67 and rhodoferax 3 10 contain strains capable or aerobic iron oxidation or nitrate dependent anaerobic iron oxidation mcilroy et al 2016 willems 2014 limnohabitans 2 42 are known freshwater bacteria they are mainly chemoorganotrophic aerobes or facultative anaerobes but some strains are also aerobic photoheterotrophs kasalický 2020 while all identified taxa showed a broad range of protein synthesis levels their general activity classification was reflective of their metabolic capabilities under aerobic conditions confirming that boncat facs identified the active fraction of the sampled activated sludge microbiome 16s rrna gene sequence abundance was not a good proxy for translational activity as the most active organisms were not the most abundant ones while the genus propionivibrio with the highest relative sequence abundance in the complete data set was identified as not translationally active during the aerobic reaction phase in the investigated sbr boncat facs might therefore allow for the identification of new process specific key players involved in carbon nitrogen and phosphate transformation in highly dynamic systems that are characterized by rapid shifts in environmental conditions such as sbrs or other engineered bioprocess systems 4 discussion next generation sequencing has generated a cornucopia of genomic data on the microbial community composition and biogeography of activated sludge systems in various wwtps from all over the world wu et al 2019 however understanding individual microbial functions remains difficult due to the complexity of the activated sludge ecosystem conventional genomic screening methods fall short in establishing robust links between microbial community composition and desired microbial processes for efficient wastewater cleanup in order to bridge this knowledge gap we need to combine cell identification based on traditional phylogenetic marker gene approaches with new technologies that allow to distinguish between active and inactive dormant or dead cells hatzenpichler et al 2020 ideally these technologies also allow for high taxonomic and temporal resolution to be able to study the intricate interplay of taxa in complex and highly dynamic natural and engineered ecosystems here we extend recent applications of boncat to identify translationally active bacterial taxa in situ in a full scale sbr treating municipal wastewater we combined the boncat enabled fluorescence cell staining with facs and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to sort and characterize active and inactive populations from activated sludge sampled during the aerobic treatment stage we showed that our boncat facs protocol identified only a subset of taxa as metabolically active which allowed new insights into the role of specific taxa in carbon degradation and phosphorous removal in the studied system short boncat incubation times are desired in order to identify changes in dynamic systems such as sbrs that operate on reactor cycles only lasting for a couple of hours we showed that 15 min of hpg incubation was sufficient to label the translationally active fraction in our samples boncat incubation times in prior studies on soil and sediment samples have ranged from 2 to 3 h up to 2 days couradeau et al 2019 hatzenpichler et al 2016 reichart et al 2020 incubation of activated sludge with the methionine analog hpg and subsequent sorting did not result in significant shifts in microbial community composition fig 4 in our activated sludge samples processed by cell lysis previous boncat studies on different environmental samples have made similar observations following hpg incubation hatzenpichler and orphan 2015 hatzenpichler et al 2014 microbial community composition of these samples was also consistent with prior 16s rrna gene and transcript surveys of sludge from the same wastewater treatment plant johnston and behrens 2020 johnston et al 2019 historically our knowledge on microbial taxa associated with specific nutrient removal processes in activated sludge is rooted in classical microbiology enrichment and isolation experiments in the last two decades meta omics technologies began to challenge this view by identifying the genomic functional potential of many taxa that have so far evaded cultivation and detailed physiological characterization in the lab however for an organism being present in a microbial community or carrying a specific set of functional genes is not always directly related to its actual in situ metabolic activity more recently rna based studies have revealed unexpected new roles of low abundant community members in central carbon and nitrogen metabolisms in activated sludge johnston and behrens 2020 sato et al 2019 our sequence data also showed that many translationally active taxa with an increased abundance in the sorted boncat population samples were of relatively low sequence abundance 1 in the total activated sludge community this confirmed that relative sequence abundance is not a good predictor of translational activity classical 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing studies often overlook low abundant taxa in their discussion of the potential importance of a particular genus for ecosystem processes several previous studies have demonstrated that rare species can have an over proportional role in biogeochemical cycles and may be a hidden driver of microbiome function jousset et al 2017 while we found that inactive dormant or dead cells made up a significant proportion of the total activated sludge community 67 9 these results need to be interpreted cautiously fluorescence signal intensity of a cell following boncat depends on access to hpg during incubation the rate of hpg incorporation into new protein and the sensitivity of the fluorescence detector of the flow cytometer sorter although boncat facs is a very useful tool to study the activated sludge microbiome de novo protein synthesis is only one of many functions of a cell by which activity can be quantified cells that are translationally inactive can still have significant impact on ecosystem processes through the catalytic activities of their already existing proteome as well as nutrient uptake metabolite excretion and other cellular interactions that shape the overall microbiome functioning these and other limitations of the boncat approach have previously been described hatzenpichler et al 2020 the total fraction of events outside the boncat gate accounted for 32 01 of all detected events this mean that about one third of the activated sludge community during time of sampling had a detectable level of translational activity higher than the background fluorescence of the activated sludge samples the fraction of translationally active cells observed in this study is comparable with previous studies on activated sludge that quantified microbial activity based on oxygen utilization rates 29 5 57 lee et al 2006 wentzel et al 1998 and intracellular esterase activity 35 1 42 3 collado et al 2017 foladori et al 2010 in order to limit the sorting of translationally active cells in the boncat gate and vice versa we used a very conservative gating strategy that required boncat cells to exhibit a relative fluorescence intensity that was on average 10 fold higher than the background fluorescence of our activated sludge samples this resulted in a gap between the boncat and boncat gate and a fraction of active cells with above background fluorescence was not collected we addressed this potential limitation of our sorting approach in our comparative sequence analyses of the sorted and unsorted activated sludge microbial communities we calculated the relative abundance of boncat and boncat cells of each classified taxa in the total activated sludge community by doing so we were able to categorize all identified taxa in the total activated sludge community into four activity groups most active moderately active inactive and active inactive this was possible because sorted and unsorted communities shared a similar core microbiome the core microbiome comprised 52 taxa and accounted for 80 15 of all asv across samples fig 5 and table s6 while the individual sorted fractions were similar in core species composition we observed taxon specific heterogeneity in translational activity the broad range of detected cell translational activity among cells of the same taxonomic group seems plausible because not all cells of a species will either be solely active or completely inactive given the heterogenous and dynamic environmental conditions in activated sludge at any point in time the phenotypic heterogeneity among species populations is caused by varying nutrient accessibility intra and interspecies interactions and the diverse structure and chemical gradients in cell aggregate micro environments in a highly structured and dynamic environment it might be of selective advantage to species populations if subcommunities exhibit different levels of translational activity which can increase overall population resilience and ensure survival at times of environmental stress two genera containing known paos tetrasphaera and candidatus accumulibacter were among the most abundant taxa in the most and moderately active groups their presence relative abundance and activity level is consistent with the fact that the sbr was designed to ebpr from municipal wastewater candidatus accumulibacter are widely believed to be the most important player for the phosphorous removal process in full scale ebpr systems crocetti et al 2000 hesselmann et al 2000 however more recent studies also report that the actinobacterial genus tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 kong et al 2005 can be consistently found in high abundance in full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 despite the global relevance of the ebpr process the actual contributions of candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera to the total phosphorous removal are still unknown because it has been challenging to simultaneously quantify individual taxa abundances and cell specific phosphate accumulation fernando et al 2019 used raman fish to quantify the individual contribution of candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera to the phosphorous removal process in eight full scale ebpr plants they found that in six of the eight plants they sampled the contribution of tetrasphaera to the total phosphorous removal was higher than that of candidatus accumulibacter while we did not quantify taxa specific phosphorous accumulation the fact that we found an abundant population of tetrasphaera that exhibited a higher translational activity than an almost equally abundant population of candidatus accumulibacter seems to support the findings of fernando et al 2019 future experiments using our boncat approach in combination with cell sorting of fish labeled pao taxa and quantification of intracellular poly p content might provide new insights into the individual role known and so far unknown pao taxa might play in the ebpr process in full scale sbrs the most abundant genus in our total activated sludge community propionivibrio 12 1 was identified as translationally inactive propionivibrio have recently been identified as abundant glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in sbr systems designed for ebpr albertsen et al 2016 like other gaos propionivibrio take up volatile fatty acids during the anaerobic phase and store them as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha while gaos need phosphate for growth they do not store it in excess of what they need it remains to be shown what the high abundance of the genus propionivibrio in the sbrs in this study means for the phosphorous removal efficiency of the studied plant not much is currently known about the metabolic activities of propionivibrio in ebpr systems it is therefore an interesting observation from our boncat facs study that propionivibrio seem to be not synthesizing new protein during the aerobic treatment phase in accordance with their mainly anaerobic but aero tolerant metabolism however it is possible that propionivibrio is not able to take up hpg interestingly the combined relative sequence abundance of the two active paos tetrasphaera and candidatus accumulibacter 4 36 and 5 53 accounted for 81 of the observed sequence abundance of the gao genus propionivibrio during the aerobic treatment phase in the analyzed ebpr srb system in this study we have focused on the aerobic stage of wastewater treatment but the boncat facs approach will also be well suited to address questions about microbial community activity shifts over time for example 1 how does the activity level of individual activated sludge populations vary with reactor cycle stage in sbrs when operational conditions switch from static fill to mixed fill to aerobic reaction with and without physical mixing to anaerobic treatment and finally sludge settling and decant future studies will focus on longitudinal analyses of activity dynamics to identify the key metabolic players at each reactor stage 2 wastewater treatment plants at template climate zones often experience seasonal failure of specific microbial processes e g nitrification in the colder winter months cross season comparative studies of microbial activity patterns will help to shed light on how seasonal changes in plant operational parameters affect plant performance and microbial process stability 3 how do process specific taxa relevant to efficient carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal respond to different engineering designs of wastewater treatment plants it is well known that bacteria express different metabolic phenotypes and growth behavior based on the physical structure and environmental conditions of their habitat boncat facs can help to understand how certain taxa manage to establish themselves under specific plant design and operational scenarios and how resilient wanted e g phosphorous removal and or unwanted sludge foaming or bulking process related microorganisms are to perturbation 5 conclusions the boncat facs proved to be a useful tool for the analysis of the active fraction of the activated sludge microbiome when combined with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing it visualizes and quantifies de novo protein synthesis activity in bacteria and enables separation and identification of translationally active taxa which is generally not possible with traditional genomic technologies we demonstrated that boncat facs can be used to gain new insights into the activity level of species known for carbon degradation and nutrient removal processes important to wastewater treatment while the biological findings of this study pertain to the specific samples and operational condition of the ebpr sbr system investigated here our data shows that boncat facs is a reliable and reproducible approach that

16612,in order to ensure stable performance of engineered biotechnologies that rely on mixed microbial community systems it is important to identify process specific microbial traits and study their in situ activity and responses to changing environmental conditions and system operational parameters we used bioorthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging boncat in combination with fluorescence

the investigation of earth s microbiome is of increasing interest for scientists and engineers across many disciplines who seek to harness the molecular machinery of microbes in order to address current grand challenges facing humanity including food production environmental health and sustainable energy production alivisatos et al 2015 dubilier et al 2015 despite the broad application of microbiome engineering and biotechnology in nearly every aspect of our lives the real potential of our planet s environmental microbiome is far from fully explored rittmann 2006 the recent development of high throughput nucleic acid sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of the diversity of microbial communities in various natural and engineered ecosystems castelle and banfield 2018 rinke et al 2013 however these technologies cannot accurately characterize microbiome functions interactions between individual microorganisms or microbial community responses to biotic and abiotic environmental changes across time and space especially in open systems e g wastewater treatment plants it is challenging to truly control the efficiency and reliability of bioprocesses for desired purposes tailoring metaphenotype jansson and hofmockel 2018 because natural microbial assemblages in activated sludge systems are not stable entities but dynamic cooperative continuums verstraete et

design build test learn dbtl for microbiome engineering lawson et al 2019 in order to effectively guide the development of these continuously changing microbial resources we need to not only identify microbial community members in activated sludge systems but more importantly we need to evaluate who is doing what when and with whom singer et al 2017 furthermore since we are still in the early stages of understanding how some complex mechanisms e g quorum sensing and secondary metabolites regulate the community level behavior for open mixed culture systems phelan et al 2012 it could be helpful to simplify ecosystem level functional analyses by studying the in situ physiology of highly active or key functional microorganisms in activated sludge systems understanding the ecophysiology of functional key populations can inform how controllable parameters in engineered bioprocesses spatially and temporally affect microbial activities and dynamic interplay this knowledge is vital for interpreting and predicting community level behaviors and metaphenotypes in order to guarantee desired outputs under changing environmental operational conditions lindemann et al 2016 prosser 2012 since it s mainly the active fraction of complex microbial communities who are drivers of microbiome structure and functioning banerjee et al 2018 broadly applied post genomic techniques to study the ecophysiology of microbiomes such as metagenomics and metaproteomics so far lack single cell resolution however recent technical developments made it possible to link cell identification with individual cell activities at high accuracy and with high throughput resulting in new insights into the dynamics and heterogeneity of cellular activity in complex microbial communities hatzenpichler et al 2020 here we adapted and optimized protocols that combine bioorthogonal non canonical amino acid tagging boncat hatzenpichler et al 2016 with fluorescence activated cell sorting facs and 16s

wastewater treatment plant wwtp treating municipal wastewater the wwtp was designed for enhanced biological phosphorous removal ebpr which makes it an interesting system to study activity levels of individual microorganisms since ebpr systems are a sustainable and cost effective solution for phosphate recovery from wastewaters but the microbial ecology of these systems is currently not well understood fernando et al 2019 samples were taken during the aerobic react phase and incubated with the amino acid analog l homopropargylglycine hpg following fluorescent cell staining by click chemistry boncat positive boncat translationally active and boncat negative boncat translationally inactive no de novo protein synthesis during time of incubation cell populations of the activated sludge microbiome were then analyzed and separated using facs facs sorted cells were subsequently subjected to dna preparation amplification and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing we optimized protocol integration for boncat facs and amplicon sequencing besides evaluating optimal parameters for the application of boncat and the performance of facs on activated sludge samples we also tested and optimized different dna preparation techniques a cell lysis protocol a commercial dna extraction kit and multiple displacement amplification and developed a 2 step sequencing library preparation protocol for facs sorted low biomass samples experimental controls and technical replicates included in our method optimization efforts helped to overcome common challenges and analysis biases associated with the cell labeling sorting and sequencing of low biomass subcommunities of complex aggregated microbial assemblages as observed in activated sludge this newly developed boncat facs protocol described in this study will inform the development of predictive microbial community performance models that not only improve bioreactor design and operational conditions for wwtps but might also promote the future development of microbiome engineering tools for other biotechnologies 2 materials and methods 2 1 activated sludge sampling and boncat incubation activated sludge sampling and boncat incubation were conducted at the brainerd wastewater treatment facility brainerd minnesota usa the wwtp operates three full scale sbrs which run on six hour successive cycles including 1 hour of static fill 1 hour of mixed fill 2 h of aerobic react 1 hour of settling and 1 hour of decanting activated sludge samples were collected from one of the sbrs during the aerobic react phase about 250 ml sludge samples were collected from a sampling port after flushing pipes for about 5 min one ml each of the well mixed activated sludge slurry was then pipetted into three 2 ml centrifuge tubes containing hpg click chemistry tools scottsdale az usa at a final concentration of 500 µm optimal hpg conc identified in prior incubation tests fig s1b in the following we will refer to these samples as boncat labeled activated sludge bas samples another set of three 2 ml centrifuge tubes without addition of hpg also received 1 ml each of the activated sludge slurry these control samples will be referred to as control activated sludge cas samples after 15 mins incubation in the dark at room temperature optimal incubation time as identified in prior tests fig s1c paraformaldehyde alfa aesar ward hill ma usa was added into each tube to a final concentration of 2 v v to stop the hpg assimilation and preserve cellular integrity for downstream analysis all samples were stored on ice and

organics fair lawn nj usa were freshly prepared in 1x pbs 12 5 μl of the sodium ascorbate and aminoguanidine were mixed with 4 μl dye premix and added to the dehydrated activated sludge samples to start the click reaction final reaction volume 250 μl after 30 mins incubation all samples were washed three times with 1x pbs and once with 50 v v ethanol after the washing steps cell were resuspended in a 1 1 v v mix of pbs ethanol and stored at 20 c until further analyzes by microscopy and flow cytometry 2 3 fluorescence activated cell sorting facs before facs activated sludge samples

contain the nextera adapter for information on primer choice for the phylogenetic analysis of activated sludge communities please refer to albertsen et al 2015 albertsen et al 2015 the pcr reaction volume was 20 μl including 10 μl q5 high fidelity 2x master mix new england biolabs ipswich ma usa 1 μl each of forward and reverse primers 500 nm each 7 μl molecular biology grade water sigma aldrich st louis mo usa and 1 μl template dna the thermocycling conditions were 95 c for 10 min followed by 27 cycles of 95 c for 15 s and 60 c for 60 s the pcr products were purified by ampure xp beads beckman coulter brea ca usa and pcr product size was verified by gel electrophoresis the first pcr product was then used as templates for a second pcr to add the barcode indexing sequences for dna sequencing four different indexing primer sets were used for each sample replicate in this second pcr step this resulted in a total of 8 sequencing libraries for each sample the pcr reaction mix for the barcoding pcr was the same as for the first pcr described above except different primers and template pcr product of first pcr were used the second pcr reaction was run for only 10 cycles but with the same thermocycling protocol as described above pcr products were again purified and verified by ampure xp beads purification and gel electrophoresis the purified pcr products were then quantified by fluorescence spectrometry using the qubit dsdna hs assay kit thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa amplicon libraries were pooled to an equimolar concentration and submitted to the university of minnesota genomics center for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing on an illumina miseq platform 2 5 sequence analysis qiime 2 version 2019 1 was used for amplicon sequence processing bolyen et al 2019 briefly the paired end demultiplexed raw sequences fastq gz format were imported into qiime 2 in total amplicon sequencing resulted in 13 293 321 raw sequence reads for all 120 processed samples table s2 the first 20 and 17 nucleotides were trimmed from the 5 and 3 end of each read respectively in order to remove forward and reverse primer sequences forward and reverse sequence reads were further trimmed at 3 and 5 positions 290 and 275 respectively to remove low quality reads before denoising merging and chimera removal using the dada2 plugin in qiime 2 callahan et al 2016 the remaining 4 830 873 quality screened sequences yielded 6 752 amplicon sequence variants asvs sequence alignment and filtering to exclude highly variable positions were performed using the mafft program in qiime 2 masked alignments were used to generate phylogenetic trees with fasttree in qiime 2 price et al 2010 principal coordinate analysis pcoa was performed on denoised sequence data based on weighted unifrac distances sampling depth 8 000 fig 3 to compare the effect of different dna preparation techniques on amplicon sequencing and community composition of low biomass sorted activated sludge populations sequence reads were trimmed to the amplified region v1 v3 27f 534r and classified using the greengenes database 13 8 at a 97 desantis et al 2006 sequence similarity cutoff the phyloseq package mcmurdie and holmes 2013 in r r core team 2020 was used to create phyloseq projects for removal of contamination sequences by the decontam package davis et al 2018 with either mode at a threshold of 0 5 in total 825 asvs were identified as potential contaminants representing 453 759 sequences 9 39 of the denoised sequences from dada2 further identification of potential contamination sequences relied on previously reported common contamination genera in reagents during sequencing analysis of low biomass samples eisenhofer et al 2019 karstens et al 2019 salter et al 2014 and our own genus level taxonomic tables generated from the sheath fluid and sorted gfp e coli control samples which were manually removed for all samples the remaining 2 502 809 decontaminated sequences 57 18 of filtered sequences from decontam comprised 5 901 asvs the decontaminated data set was used for pcoa analysis in figs 4 and s4 for the comparative pcoa analysis in fig s4 we included sequencing data from a previous study by johnston et al johnston et al 2019 performed on activated sludge samples from the same plant the clustering of microbial communities of different samples in the pcoa plots was further verified by the kruskal wallis and permanova tests in qiime 2 for alpha and beta diversity respectively table s5 in this study we define taxa contributing to the top 80 of all sequencing reads in the boncat labeled activated sludge samples bas as part of the core activated sludge microbiome and refer to them as abundant the core microbiome includes all taxa with a relative sequence abundance of 0 36 taxa with a lower relative sequence abundance were considered rare 2 6 boncat activity categories in order to distinguish active and inactive microbial populations in activated sludge based on their de novo protein synthesis level we used flow cytometry dot plot data of fsc vs green fluorescence of bas samples fig 2 illustrates the gating strategy used to categorize activated sludge cells as active or inactive based on their boncat mediated relative fluorescence intensity activated sludge microbial cells in gate p5 were considered to be active boncat and cells in gate p3 were considered to be inactive boncat fig 2 the subcommunities of boncat and boncat events accounted for 16 4 and 67 9 of the total activated sludge community bas samples respectively table s4 based on the percent abundance of boncat and boncat subcommunities observed by flow cytometry table s4 we placed all classified microbial taxa into different categories of translational activity for that we compared each taxa s average relative sequence abundance in the sorted boncat or boncat population to its average relative sequence abundance in the total activated sludge community bas samples table s6 according to the following equations 1 r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e o f b o n c a t c e l l s o f a s p e c i f i c t a x a i n b a s s a m p l e s a r s a o

samples into one of four activity categories the four activity categories were called most active moderately active inactive and active inactive the activity categories were defined as follows a taxa was considered most active when its relative abundance of boncat cells was than the boncat subcommunity community average 16 4 and when its relative abundance of boncat cells was than the boncat subcommunity community average 67 9 moderately active taxa had to have a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average and a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average accordingly inactive taxa had a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average as well as a relative abundance of boncat cells that was than the community average all taxa that had a relative abundance of boncat and boncat cells than the community average were categorized as active inactive 3 results 3 1 boncat to identify translationally active bacteria the ability to use boncat to characterize translationally active microbial communities in environmental samples has been demonstrated in previous studies on deep sea and hotspring sediments soil and sputum from cystic fibrosis patients couradeau et al 2019 hatzenpichler et al 2016 hatzenpichler et al 2014 reichart et al 2020 valentini et al 2020 in order to assess whether boncat can be combined with facs to label and subsequently sort translationally active microbial communities from activated sludge we performed a couple of method optimization and control experiments fig 1 outlines the multi step boncat facs approach of this study and all steps involved in dna sequence analyses including 16s rrna gene amplicon library preparation library sequencing sequence classification and statistical analyses for the boncat incubation step we performed initial experiments to determine an optimal hpg concentration 500 µm and incubation time 15 min for efficient cell labeling incubation experiments and results are described in detail in the supplementary information fig s1 we also performed initial experiments to determine optimal sonication conditions 120 kj l to break up flocs and cell aggregates of the paraformaldehyde fixed activated sludge samples sonication experiments and results are described in detail in the supplementary information fig s2 only activated sludge samples incubated with the hpg amino acid analog contained green fluorescent cells following click chemistry and cell staining fig s3 confirming that boncat labeling relied on amino acid uptake and incorporation the short incubation time of 15 min did allow for sufficient cell labeling while the used hpg concentration 500 µm did not stimulate growth of activated sludge cells in our experiments the hpg concentration we used in this study was comparable to known average methionine concentrations in activated sludge 370 µm subrahmanyam et al 1960 in order to evaluate if hpg incubation stimulated microbial growth we quantified cells in sludge samples incubated in the presence and absence of hpg by flow cytometry to do that with our flow sorter we quantified the total number of events passing the interrogation point of the flow cytometer within a time interval of 10 s no significant differences between event counts of an unlabeled control cas and a hpg incubated activated sludge sample bas were observed t test p value 0 52 n 3 table s1 3 2 dna preparation from low biomass samples the quality of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data to determine the taxonomic composition of microbial communities in environmental samples strongly depends among other things on the quality of the template dna for library preparation we therefore evaluated three different approaches to prepare dna from boncat labeled cell fractions following facs sorting the aim of these experiments was to overcome limitations imposed by working with relatively low biomass samples 600 000 events ml as well as chemical alteration of cellular biomolecules as result of cell staining and chemical fixation in order to study the effects of boncat labeling and different dna preparation techniques on the microbial community composition we compared 8 replicate 16s rrna gene sequence data sets of each of the unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas the two sorted activated sludge populations boncat and boncat and the sheath fluids controls fig 3 the mda samples squares in fig 3 clustered together and away from all other samples community richness was significantly reduced in the mda samples while the number of obtained raw sequence reads for all sequenced samples was comparable the number of amplicon sequence variants asvs found in the mda samples 11 to 46 asvs was much lower than the number of asvs found in the unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas prepared with the cell lysis and dna extraction kits 243 886 asvs table s2 because of the strong community shift introduced by mda we did not further consider this method for dna preparation of our sorted activated sludge samples boncat and boncat the sequencing replicates of dna preparations by cell lysis and dna extraction formed distinct clusters in the pcoa fig 3 sheath fluid controls white diamonds and circles in fig 3 for both dna preparation techniques clustered separately from all unsorted activated sludge samples cas and bas independent of their prior incubation with hpg or not this shows that while background contamination by sheath fluid and reagents used for dna amplification was unavoidable it did not affect the microbial community composition of the unsorted activated sludge samples since the sheath fluid microbial community was distinctly different from the activated sludge microbial community sequencing and identification of asvs in these samples aided in the process of identifying and removing potential contaminants as detailed below in general sorted boncat samples for which dna was prepared by cell lysis red and yellow diamonds in fig 3 clustered closer to their respective unsorted activated sludge samples green and brown diamonds in fig 3 than the samples that have been extracted with the commercial dna extraction kit colored circles in fig 3 this shows that sorted boncat and boncat samples treated with the cell lysis protocol seemed to most closely resemble the microbial community composition of unsorted activated sludge samples using the dna extraction kit on sorted boncat samples red and yellow circles in fig 3 appeared to be problematic for these low biomass samples in the pcoa plot in fig 3 these samples clustered with the sheath flow control samples white circles indicating that commercial dna preparation kit failed in extracting genomic dna suitable for amplicon sequencing from chemically fixed low biomass activated sludge samples we also compared the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing data from the cell lysis sorted activated sludge subcommunities and unsorted activated sludge samples and dna extraction samples only unsorted activated sludge samples from this study to the sequence data from a prior study performed on the same reactor johnston et al 2019 fig s4 also in this pcoa plot all samples treated with the cell lysis protocol were more similar in their microbial community composition to the previously sequenced total activated sludge microbial community by johnston et al johnston et al 2019 than the mda or dna extraction samples that the cell lysis samples from this study are similar but not identical in community composition to the prior study by johnston et al was expected and has several reasons activated sludge microbial communities undergo dynamic shifts over time samples in the johnston et al johnston et al 2019 study were not chemically fixed prior to extraction of dna with a commercial kit chemical cross linking of biomolecules caused by paraformaldehyde fixation of cells can affect dna extraction efficiency and sequencing results sequencing artifacts of dna from chemically fixed samples have been described previously do and dobrovic 2015 parker et al 2019 proteinase treatment as part of the cell lysis protocol on the other hand has been shown to be effective in degrading proteins crosslinked to dna stingele et al 2017 making the treated dna more accessible for downstream applications such as pcr and library preparation this finding emphasizes how important it is to carefully evaluate template dna preparation methods prior to comparing amplicon sequencing libraries and microbial community composition even among the same samples based on the results of the different dna preparation experiments we decided to use the cell lysis method for all boncat and control samples in further experiments 3 3 sorting purity and sample decontamination in order to evaluate the specificity and purity of our cell sorting approach we mixed gfp e coli cells with unlabeled activated sludge and used facs to sort the gfp e coli cells from the mixed activated sludge community again sorted gfp e coli cells were subjected to amplicon sequencing following cell lysis to assess sample purity fig 3 the 16s rrna gene sequence reads from the sorted gfp e coli samples clustered separately from all activated sludge and control samples taxonomic classification of the sequence reads from the sorted e coli samples together with the sequences obtained from the sheath flow controls were used to identify potential background contamination in our sorted samples as follows the accuracy of determining the microbial community composition of environmental samples based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing is often impaired by the introduction of contaminating dna that does not truly belong to the sampled community the contaminating dna can come from different sources such as the reagents used in sample preparation e g sheath fluid or the sequencing reaction this is especially critical for all low biomass samples in this study we used the r package decontam to identify and visualize contaminating dna features in all samples in addition sequencing amplicon libraries of sheath fluid controls and the sorted gpf e coli cells were used to manually identify and remove further contaminant sequences from all sample data sets the sheath fluid controls contained 11 to 28 asvs table s2 after processing with decontam which mainly classified into 6 different genera table s3 all of which had previously been described as commonly derived from contaminant dna sequences in low biomass samples davis et al 2018 eisenhofer et al 2019 karstens et al 2019 salter et al 2014 after removal of these contamination sequences the remaining sequences from the sorted gfp e coli cells all classified into one genus e coli which accounted for 95 8 to 97 8 of all decontaminated sequence reads obtained for these control samples this result demonstrated the high specificity and conservative gating strategy of our sorting approach removing potential contaminating sequences from our sequence libraries generated more accurate profiles of the sampled activated sludge communities and their boncat and boncat subcommunities 3 4 boncat identification of translationally active bacteria in activated sludge the systematic method optimization and control experiments described above have shown that boncat incubation and staining in combination with facs and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing can be used to identify translationally active microbial populations in activated sludge samples potential methodological issues stemming from background contamination and dna extraction of chemically fixed low biomass samples have been addressed and can largely be abated using the boncat facs approach to analyze microbial translational activity during the aerobic reaction phase of a sbr treating municipal wastewater showed that only a subcommunity of the activated sludge microbiome is translationally active during this phase fig 4 the heterogeneity of single cell fluorescence signal intensities of boncat cells as quantified in the fluorescence channel filter bandwidth 530 40 nm indicate that boncat is capable of visualizing different levels of translational activity in cells in a structurally heterogenous environmental sample cells of the same species population will have different needs for de novo protein synthesis and access to the hpg amino acid analog at any point in time which results in a broad continuous range of fluorescence signal intensities fluorescence signal intensities of boncat cells ranged over more than three orders of magnitude cells were sorted as boncat events when their fluorescence intensity was 10 fold above the background fluorescence of unstained activated sludge cells fig 2 gate p5 based on the applied gating strategy boncat and boncat populations account for 16 4 and 67 9 of all detected events in the analyzed activated sludge samples respectively fig 2b gates p3 and p5 when counting all events outside the boncat gate then 32 01 of all detected events had fluorescence signal intensities higher than the boncat population fig 2b sum of orange and black dots and table s4 the 16s rrna gene sequence reads of the boncat and boncat populations showed distinct alpha and beta diversities h 11 29 p value 0 002 f 73 20 p value 0 002 table s5 the microbial community of the boncat population was more similar to the total activated sludge microbial community bas samples h 7 46 p value 0 008 f 27 49 p value 0 002 than the boncat population h 11 29 p value 0 002 f 98 13 p value 0 002 table s5 3 5 taxonomic identification of active and inactive taxa comparing the taxonomic composition of the boncat population boncat population and total activated sludge microbial community bas samples we found that the three communities comprised 279 331 and 269 taxa at the genus level respectively all three communities shared 201 genera fig s5 these common genera accounted for 98 21 97 58 and 97 92 of all sequence reads in the boncat population boncat population and total activated sludge microbial community this demonstrates that the three communities shared a very similar core microbiome composition and that we needed to compare relative sequence abundances of the individual genera in each community to distinguish active and inactive taxa based on their abundance in each sample based on the relative abundance of boncat and boncat events quantified by flow cytometry table s4 we placed all classified taxa into different activity categories by comparing each taxa s relative sequence abundance in the boncat or boncat population to its relative sequence abundance in the total activated sludge community table s6 this allowed us to categorize taxa into three main activity groups that we named most active moderately active inactive taxa that had a higher than average sequence abundance in both boncat and boncat populations were place in a fourth activity group called active inactive table s6 lists all identified taxa and their relative sequence abundances in the total activated sludge community and in the sorted boncat populations the table also shows the relative abundance of each taxa of the boncat and boncat populations in the total activated sludge community bas samples these values determined the activity group categorization of each taxa in the total activated sludge community 19 taxa had a relative sequence abundance of 1 and 52 taxa had a sequence abundance of 0 36 these most abundant 52 taxa accounted for 80 15 of all quality filtered sequence reads in fig 5 the 52 taxa are plotted by their relative sequence abundance in each of the four activity groups of the 52 most abundant taxa 13 21 6 and 12 were assigned to the most active moderately active inactive and active inactive groups respectively by relative sequence abundance the four activity groups accounted for 21 21 26 68 15 59 and 16 67 respectively of all sequence reads in the total activated sludge community many identified genera in the most active group contain bacterial lineages known for intracellular phosphate accumulation these include tetrasphaera 4 40 fernando et al 2019 rhodobacter 5 56 mackenzie et al 2007 candidatus microthrix 0 78 mcilroy et al 2013 and acinetobacter 0 69 seviour et al 2003 fig 5 also the most abundant genus in the moderately active group candidatus accumulibacter 5 53 fig 5 is a known phosphate accumulating organisms paos often identified in ebpr systems stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 in general taxa identified as most active or moderately active were aerobes or facultative aerobes capable of metabolizing a diverse range of carbon compounds in the presence of oxygen all six taxa categorized as inactive belong to anaerobic but aerotolerant proteobacteria propionivibrio 12 10 was the most abundant inactive genus in the total activated sludge community propionivibrio have been described as typical glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in ebpr systems they can store volatile fatty acids as polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic conditions without the accumulation of poly p albertsen et al 2016 most taxa in the active inactive groups were chemoorganotrophic aerobes or facultative anaerobes leptothrix 0 67 and rhodoferax 3 10 contain strains capable or aerobic iron oxidation or nitrate dependent anaerobic iron oxidation mcilroy et al 2016 willems 2014 limnohabitans 2 42 are known freshwater bacteria they are mainly chemoorganotrophic aerobes or facultative anaerobes but some strains are also aerobic photoheterotrophs kasalický 2020 while all identified taxa showed a broad range of protein synthesis levels their general activity classification was reflective of their metabolic capabilities under aerobic conditions confirming that boncat facs identified the active fraction of the sampled activated sludge microbiome 16s rrna gene sequence abundance was not a good proxy for translational activity as the most active organisms were not the most abundant ones while the genus propionivibrio with the highest relative sequence abundance in the complete data set was identified as not translationally active during the aerobic reaction phase in the investigated sbr boncat facs might therefore allow for the identification of new process specific key players involved in carbon nitrogen and phosphate transformation in highly dynamic systems that are characterized by rapid shifts in environmental conditions such as sbrs or other engineered bioprocess systems 4 discussion next generation sequencing has generated a cornucopia of genomic data on the microbial community composition and biogeography of activated sludge systems in various wwtps from all over the world wu et al 2019 however understanding individual microbial functions remains difficult due to the complexity of the activated sludge ecosystem conventional genomic screening methods fall short in establishing robust links between microbial community composition and desired microbial processes for efficient wastewater cleanup in order to bridge this knowledge gap we need to combine cell identification based on traditional phylogenetic marker gene approaches with new technologies that allow to distinguish between active and inactive dormant or dead cells hatzenpichler et al 2020 ideally these technologies also allow for high taxonomic and temporal resolution to be able to study the intricate interplay of taxa in complex and highly dynamic natural and engineered ecosystems here we extend recent applications of boncat to identify translationally active bacterial taxa in situ in a full scale sbr treating municipal wastewater we combined the boncat enabled fluorescence cell staining with facs and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to sort and characterize active and inactive populations from activated sludge sampled during the aerobic treatment stage we showed that our boncat facs protocol identified only a subset of taxa as metabolically active which allowed new insights into the role of specific taxa in carbon degradation and phosphorous removal in the studied system short boncat incubation times are desired in order to identify changes in dynamic systems such as sbrs that operate on reactor cycles only lasting for a couple of hours we showed that 15 min of hpg incubation was sufficient to label the translationally active fraction in our samples boncat incubation times in prior studies on soil and sediment samples have ranged from 2 to 3 h up to 2 days couradeau et al 2019 hatzenpichler et al 2016 reichart et al 2020 incubation of activated sludge with the methionine analog hpg and subsequent sorting did not result in significant shifts in microbial community composition fig 4 in our activated sludge samples processed by cell lysis previous boncat studies on different environmental samples have made similar observations following hpg incubation hatzenpichler and orphan 2015 hatzenpichler et al 2014 microbial community composition of these samples was also consistent with prior 16s rrna gene and transcript surveys of sludge from the same wastewater treatment plant johnston and behrens 2020 johnston et al 2019 historically our knowledge on microbial taxa associated with specific nutrient removal processes in activated sludge is rooted in classical microbiology enrichment and isolation experiments in the last two decades meta omics technologies began to challenge this view by identifying the genomic functional potential of many taxa that have so far evaded cultivation and detailed physiological characterization in the lab however for an organism being present in a microbial community or carrying a specific set of functional genes is not always directly related to its actual in situ metabolic activity more recently rna based studies have revealed unexpected new roles of low abundant community members in central carbon and nitrogen metabolisms in activated sludge johnston and behrens 2020 sato et al 2019 our sequence data also showed that many translationally active taxa with an increased abundance in the sorted boncat population samples were of relatively low sequence abundance 1 in the total activated sludge community this confirmed that relative sequence abundance is not a good predictor of translational activity classical 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing studies often overlook low abundant taxa in their discussion of the potential importance of a particular genus for ecosystem processes several previous studies have demonstrated that rare species can have an over proportional role in biogeochemical cycles and may be a hidden driver of microbiome function jousset et al 2017 while we found that inactive dormant or dead cells made up a significant proportion of the total activated sludge community 67 9 these results need to be interpreted cautiously fluorescence signal intensity of a cell following boncat depends on access to hpg during incubation the rate of hpg incorporation into new protein and the sensitivity of the fluorescence detector of the flow cytometer sorter although boncat facs is a very useful tool to study the activated sludge microbiome de novo protein synthesis is only one of many functions of a cell by which activity can be quantified cells that are translationally inactive can still have significant impact on ecosystem processes through the catalytic activities of their already existing proteome as well as nutrient uptake metabolite excretion and other cellular interactions that shape the overall microbiome functioning these and other limitations of the boncat approach have previously been described hatzenpichler et al 2020 the total fraction of events outside the boncat gate accounted for 32 01 of all detected events this mean that about one third of the activated sludge community during time of sampling had a detectable level of translational activity higher than the background fluorescence of the activated sludge samples the fraction of translationally active cells observed in this study is comparable with previous studies on activated sludge that quantified microbial activity based on oxygen utilization rates 29 5 57 lee et al 2006 wentzel et al 1998 and intracellular esterase activity 35 1 42 3 collado et al 2017 foladori et al 2010 in order to limit the sorting of translationally active cells in the boncat gate and vice versa we used a very conservative gating strategy that required boncat cells to exhibit a relative fluorescence intensity that was on average 10 fold higher than the background fluorescence of our activated sludge samples this resulted in a gap between the boncat and boncat gate and a fraction of active cells with above background fluorescence was not collected we addressed this potential limitation of our sorting approach in our comparative sequence analyses of the sorted and unsorted activated sludge microbial communities we calculated the relative abundance of boncat and boncat cells of each classified taxa in the total activated sludge community by doing so we were able to categorize all identified taxa in the total activated sludge community into four activity groups most active moderately active inactive and active inactive this was possible because sorted and unsorted communities shared a similar core microbiome the core microbiome comprised 52 taxa and accounted for 80 15 of all asv across samples fig 5 and table s6 while the individual sorted fractions were similar in core species composition we observed taxon specific heterogeneity in translational activity the broad range of detected cell translational activity among cells of the same taxonomic group seems plausible because not all cells of a species will either be solely active or completely inactive given the heterogenous and dynamic environmental conditions in activated sludge at any point in time the phenotypic heterogeneity among species populations is caused by varying nutrient accessibility intra and interspecies interactions and the diverse structure and chemical gradients in cell aggregate micro environments in a highly structured and dynamic environment it might be of selective advantage to species populations if subcommunities exhibit different levels of translational activity which can increase overall population resilience and ensure survival at times of environmental stress two genera containing known paos tetrasphaera and candidatus accumulibacter were among the most abundant taxa in the most and moderately active groups their presence relative abundance and activity level is consistent with the fact that the sbr was designed to ebpr from municipal wastewater candidatus accumulibacter are widely believed to be the most important player for the phosphorous removal process in full scale ebpr systems crocetti et al 2000 hesselmann et al 2000 however more recent studies also report that the actinobacterial genus tetrasphaera hanada et al 2002 kong et al 2005 can be consistently found in high abundance in full scale ebpr plants stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 despite the global relevance of the ebpr process the actual contributions of candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera to the total phosphorous removal are still unknown because it has been challenging to simultaneously quantify individual taxa abundances and cell specific phosphate accumulation fernando et al 2019 used raman fish to quantify the individual contribution of candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera to the phosphorous removal process in eight full scale ebpr plants they found that in six of the eight plants they sampled the contribution of tetrasphaera to the total phosphorous removal was higher than that of candidatus accumulibacter while we did not quantify taxa specific phosphorous accumulation the fact that we found an abundant population of tetrasphaera that exhibited a higher translational activity than an almost equally abundant population of candidatus accumulibacter seems to support the findings of fernando et al 2019 future experiments using our boncat approach in combination with cell sorting of fish labeled pao taxa and quantification of intracellular poly p content might provide new insights into the individual role known and so far unknown pao taxa might play in the ebpr process in full scale sbrs the most abundant genus in our total activated sludge community propionivibrio 12 1 was identified as translationally inactive propionivibrio have recently been identified as abundant glycogen accumulating organisms gaos in sbr systems designed for ebpr albertsen et al 2016 like other gaos propionivibrio take up volatile fatty acids during the anaerobic phase and store them as polyhydroxyalkanoates pha while gaos need phosphate for growth they do not store it in excess of what they need it remains to be shown what the high abundance of the genus propionivibrio in the sbrs in this study means for the phosphorous removal efficiency of the studied plant not much is currently known about the metabolic activities of propionivibrio in ebpr systems it is therefore an interesting observation from our boncat facs study that propionivibrio seem to be not synthesizing new protein during the aerobic treatment phase in accordance with their mainly anaerobic but aero tolerant metabolism however it is possible that propionivibrio is not able to take up hpg interestingly the combined relative sequence abundance of the two active paos tetrasphaera and candidatus accumulibacter 4 36 and 5 53 accounted for 81 of the observed sequence abundance of the gao genus propionivibrio during the aerobic treatment phase in the analyzed ebpr srb system in this study we have focused on the aerobic stage of wastewater treatment but the boncat facs approach will also be well suited to address questions about microbial community activity shifts over time for example 1 how does the activity level of individual activated sludge populations vary with reactor cycle stage in sbrs when operational conditions switch from static fill to mixed fill to aerobic reaction with and without physical mixing to anaerobic treatment and finally sludge settling and decant future studies will focus on longitudinal analyses of activity dynamics to identify the key metabolic players at each reactor stage 2 wastewater treatment plants at template climate zones often experience seasonal failure of specific microbial processes e g nitrification in the colder winter months cross season comparative studies of microbial activity patterns will help to shed light on how seasonal changes in plant operational parameters affect plant performance and microbial process stability 3 how do process specific taxa relevant to efficient carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal respond to different engineering designs of wastewater treatment plants it is well known that bacteria express different metabolic phenotypes and growth behavior based on the physical structure and environmental conditions of their habitat boncat facs can help to understand how certain taxa manage to establish themselves under specific plant design and operational scenarios and how resilient wanted e g phosphorous removal and or unwanted sludge foaming or bulking process related microorganisms are to perturbation 5 conclusions the boncat facs proved to be a useful tool for the analysis of the active fraction of the activated sludge microbiome when combined with 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing it visualizes and quantifies de novo protein synthesis activity in bacteria and enables separation and identification of translationally active taxa which is generally not possible with traditional genomic technologies we demonstrated that boncat facs can be used to gain new insights into the activity level of species known for carbon degradation and nutrient removal processes important to wastewater treatment while the biological findings of this study pertain to the specific samples and operational condition of the ebpr sbr system investigated here our data shows that boncat facs is a reliable and reproducible approach that

16613,minimum treatment requirements are set in response to established or anticipated levels of enteric pathogens in the source water of drinking water treatment plants dwtps for surface water contamination can be determined directly by monitoring reference pathogens or indirectly by measuring fecal indicators such as escherichia coli e coli in the latter case a quantitative interpretation of e coli for estimating reference pathogen concentrations could be used to define treatment requirements this study presents the statistical analysis of paired e coli and reference protozoa cryptosporidium giardia data collected monthly for two years in source water from 27 dwtps supplied by rivers in canada e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios in source water were modeled as the ratio of two correlated lognormal variables to evaluate the potential of e coli for defining protozoa treatment requirements risk based critical mean protozoa concentrations in source water were determined with a reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model model assumptions were selected to be consistent with the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality the sensitivity of mean e coli concentration trigger levels to identify these critical concentrations in source water was then evaluated results showed no proportionalities between the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations e coli protozoa ratios at dwtps supplied by small rivers in agricultural and forested areas were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas the seasonal variations analysis revealed that these differences were related to low mean e coli concentrations during winter in small rivers to achieve the who target of 10 6 disability adjusted life year daly per person per year a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of cryptosporidium would be required for 20 dwtps and a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of giardia would be needed for all dwtps a mean e coli trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 would be a sensitive threshold to identify critical mean concentrations for cryptosporidium but not for giardia treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at dwtps with mean e coli concentrations as low as 30 cfu 100 ml 1 for cryptosporidium and 3 cfu 100 ml 1 for giardia therefore an e coli trigger level would have limited value for defining health based treatment requirements for protozoa at dwtps supplied by small rivers in rural areas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords minimum treatment requirements drinking water quantitative microbial risk assessment escherichia coli cryptosporidium giardia 1 introduction concentrations of reference enteric protozoa cryptosporidium giardia in source water must be adequately estimated to define health based protozoa treatment requirements for drinking water safety who 2016 however data are not always available because of the difficulty and cost associated with analyzing waterborne protozoa in environmental samples in these situations fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli are commonly used as indicators of pathogen occurrence although fib monitoring data sets can provide important information on fluctuations of fecal contamination in source water it is essential to keep in mind that this indicator has limitations for predicting concentrations of enteric protozoa wu et al 2011 health canada 2017 meteorological and environmental factors can have different effects on the fate and transport of indicators and pathogens in water moreover indicators can originate from other sources than pathogens monitoring of protozoa in raw water from drinking water treatment plants dwtps is recommended in canada health canada 2017 still protozoa monitoring is not mandatory in most canadian provinces government of manitoba 2007 gouvernement du québec 2012 in the united states and alberta canada protozoa monitoring is mandatory for large community water supplies and small community water supplies when e coli concentrations are low usepa 2010 government of alberta 2012 most of these regulations rely on the assumption that drinking water sources exposed to high e coli concentrations have a greater probability of protozoa occurrence independently of their concentration payment and locas 2011 however a quantitative relationship between concentrations of e coli and protozoa needs to be established to define health based minimum treatment requirements for protozoa using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to determine whether e coli data can be used to support the implementation of health based treatment requirements e coli to protozoa ratios can be evaluated over a given period at multiple dwtps supplied by different types of drinking water sources a meta analysis of e coli cryptosporidium ratios in primary sources of fecal contamination suggested that e coli is generally a good indicator for predicting cryptosporidium occurrence for urban pollution sources raw and treated wastewater but not for agricultural runoff lalancette et al 2014 in this study e coli cryptosporidium ratios were also evaluated at drinking water intakes from 13 dwtps in quebec canada using data from payment et al 2000 as estimated in their meta analysis ratios at drinking water intakes were lower for sources influenced by agricultural runoff than those influenced by municipal sewage the present study was designed to validate these findings using recent data collected at 27 surface dwtps supplied by rivers dominated by urban agricultural or wildlife sources of fecal pollution in quebec canada the mathematical model of lalancette et al 2014 was also extended to evaluate the uncertainty associated with arithmetic mean e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios the objectives of this study were i to derive the arithmetic mean ratio of two correlated lognormal distributions and use this model to characterize e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios in source water for 27 dwtps supplied by rivers ii to investigate the influence of river types and seasons on the variation in the magnitude of the mean ratios and iii to evaluate whether e coli trigger levels provide valuable information for defining health based treatment requirements for pathogenic protozoa at these dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 classification of sites source water supplies were anonymized and classified according to their annual mean flow rate table 1 group a group b and group c represent rivers with mean flow rates of less than 20 m3 s 1 between 20 and 100 m3 s 1 and larger than 100 m3 s 1 respectively the main land cover type for each catchment was determined visually with google earth 2 2 sampling and microbial detection methods paired samples were collected monthly over approximately two consecutive years between 2011 and 2020 at each of the 27 dwtps for the detection of cryptosporidium and giardia a raw water volume varying from 10 to 60 litres was filtered on site with an envirochek hv cartridge pall according to u s epa method 1623 from 2011 to 2012 and u s epa method 1623 1 from 2013 to 2020 for one dwtp 10 liter cubitainers were collected on site and filtered at the laboratory the enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts was carried out according to u s epa method 1623 or 1623 1 usepa 2005a usepa 2012 mean analytical recovery rates of 43 matrix spikes in raw water samples collected at these dwtps were 0 46 standard deviation sd 0 14 for cryptosporidium and 0 50 sd 0 17 for giardia the enumeration of e coli was done by membrane filtration according to the modified mtec method from 2011 to 2012 or mfc bcig method ceaeq ma 700 ec bcig 1 0 from 2013 to 2020 these methods involve filtration of the sample through a 0 45 μm porosity membrane which is then deposited on a selective agar medium and incubated at 44 5 c for 24 h the e coli colonies were identified and counted visually and the concentration was expressed in cfu 100 ml 1 3 statistical methods 3 1 ratio of microbial concentrations 3 1 1 poisson counts in mixture distributions a pragmatic way to account for non detects is to assume that each observed count is poisson distributed and that the unknown microbial concentration is described by a mixture distribution haas et al 1999 within a mixed poisson modeling framework the probability of finding k organisms in a homogenous sample x of volume v collected from a suspension of mean concentration c is given by a poisson distribution with probability mass function 1 p k c v c v k k exp c v overdispersion relative to the poisson distribution was expected because microbial concentrations typically vary over orders of magnitude in river water a mixing distribution was selected to account for the unobserved heterogeneity i e the temporal variation of the concentration c in successive samples the mixed poisson distribution describing variations in counts is given by 2 p k c v θ p k c v f c θ d c where f is a mixing distribution of parameters θ the precise form of the mixed poisson distribution depends on the choice of f c θ in this study the lognormal distribution was selected as a mixing distribution because the mean ratio of two lognormal variables is simple to derive the lognormal distribution has a probability density 3 f c μ σ 1 σ c 2 π exp 1 2 l n c μ 2 σ 2 where the shape parameter μ and the scale parameter σ are respectively the expected value and the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of c original observations counts processed volumes were not available to model temporal variations in e coli concentrations therefore a parameters of the lognormal distribution were estimated from reported e coli concentrations non detects were replaced by a detection limit of 1 cfu 100 ml 1 this approach for handling non detects should not result in substantial estimation biases because the proportion of non detects was typically very small 5 for e coli recovery rates of 100 were assumed for e coli 3 1 2 ratio of two correlated lognormal variables to derive the ratio of lognormal variables let x be the e coli concentration in cfu l 1 and y be the protozoa concentration in oo cyst l 1 if x ln μ x σ x and y ln μ y σ y then by definition ln x and ln y are normally distributed it follows that the difference z between ln x and ln y is normally distributed with mean 4 μ z μ x μ y and variance 5 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 2 σ n x y where σ n x y is the covariance between x and y in log space therefore the ratio x y is described by z ln μ z σ z with mean 6 e z exp μ z σ z 2 2 to account for the correlation between x and y the covariance σ n x y in eq 5 can be calculated as follows 7 σ n x y ln σ ln x y x y 1 where σ ln x y is the covariance in real space and x and y are the arithmetic means of x and y crow and shimizu 1987 the covariance σ n x y is related to the pearson moment correlation coefficient in log space ρ n x y by 8 ρ n x y σ n x y σ x σ y by substituting eqs 7 8 in eq 5 the mean ratio x y from eq 6 can be rewritten in the following form 9 e x y exp μ x μ y σ x 2 σ y 2 2 ρ n x y σ x σ y 2 the covariance σ ln x y and sample means x and y in eq 7 were evaluated from the sample considering that non detects had a concentration of 0 oo cyst the arithmetic mean ratio was evaluated because it can be calculated straightforwardly it is also a standard measure of location to compare ratios among groups recovery rates of 100 were assumed for protozoa in this model 3 1 3 influence of seasonality weather events and nonconstant analytical recovery mean ratios of pooled data by seasons were evaluated for group a group b and group c to provide an overall summary of the influence of river types and seasons on the magnitude of mean ratios the climate in southern quebec is humid continental and it is characterized by large seasonal temperature differences and four seasons in this work seasons were defined as winter dec feb spring mar may summer june aug and autumn sept nov for dwtps a4 c6 and c7 mean ratios in routine monitoring conditions i e ratios evaluated with routine monitoring data were compared to daily mean ratios determined for event conditions i e ratios evaluated with data obtained following rainfall and snowmelt events a detailed characterization of event based sampling strategies implemented to obtain these data sets is presented elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020b sylvestre et al 2021 daily mean ratios in event conditions were estimated by averaging ratios from each sample i as follows 10 e x y e v e n t 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x is the e coli concentration and y is the protozoa concentration event based samples were collected at regular intervals of 4 h or 6 h over 24 h dwtps a4 c6 or three times over 96 h dwtp c7 concentrations of protozoa during events were estimated from raw oo cyst counts corrected for sample specific recovery rates to account for the analytical recovery in the estimation of the mean ratio in routine monitoring conditions the number of microorganisms observed in each sample was modeled as a binomial distribution of independent counts having a probability of recovery described by a beta distribution with parameters α β 6 48 7 70 for cryptosporidium and α β 3 80 3 91 for giardia sylvestre et al 2020c 3 1 4 model implementation the parameters of the poisson lognormal distributions were estimated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations via rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 in r v4 0 4 for each parameter four markov chains were run for 1 106 iterations after a burn in phase of 104 iterations the convergence of chains was monitored using the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor gelman and shirley 2011 the median of the posterior distribution of the arithmetic mean and its 95 credibility interval were reported for microbial concentrations and ratios estimates of the 95 credibility interval of the posterior distributions of the parameter values were considered reasonably accurate when an effective sample size ess higher than 10 000 was obtained kass et al 1998 kruschke 2014 uninformative or weakly informative priors were adopted priors on parameters μ and σ were set to uniform 10 10 and exp 1 respectively the rationale for the selection of these priors is presented elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020c the r code is provided in the supplementary material 3 2 scaling relationship between e coli and protozoa 3 2 1 bivariate power law regression sample mean e coli concentrations and sample mean protozoa concentrations from the 27 sites were compared on a log log scale the relationship between e coli and protozoa was evaluated with a bivariate power law expressed as follows 11 c 2 r c 1 k where c 2 is the mean protozoa concentration c 1 is the mean e coli concentration r is the intercept at c 1 1 and k is the dimensionless scaling exponent the slope k identifies the relationship between c 1 and c 2 the following three situations are relevant to consider 1 k 1 the relationship between c 1 and c 2 is proportional 2 k 1 a large change in c 1 is only related to a small change in c 2 3 k 0 a large change in c 1 is not related to a change in c 2 power laws were fitted using the iteratively reweighted least squares irls algorithm from the glm function in r software environment 3 2 2 risk based critical mean cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations risk based critical mean cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in source water were determined for treatment reduction requirements of 3 0 log and 4 0 log the critical mean concentration was defined as the maximum cryptosporidium or giardia concentration that would be tolerable to achieve a health based target of 10 6 disability adjusted life year daly per person per year critical mean concentrations c were calculated with the following reverse qmra model 11 c 1 r i 10 t v r p i ι ι inf db e f s 1 ht where r is the recovery rate of the enumeration method i is the infectivity of oo cysts t is the reduction of the organism by treatment v is the volume of drinking water ingested per person per day r is the probability of infection for a single organism p i l l i n f is the probability of infection given illness db is the disease burden e is the number of exposures per year f s is the susceptible fraction of the population and ht is the health outcome target each variable of the model was described by its arithmetic mean mean values and assumptions for each parameter are presented in table 2 full scale reductions of giardia and cryptosporidium at the selected dwtps were not evaluated and considered in the qmra risk based concentrations were determined for theoretical treatment reduction requirements most assumptions for the qmra for cryptosporidium ingestion volume dose response model for infection probability of illness given infection disease burden were selected to be consistent with those recommended in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 conservative default mean infectivity fractions of 30 for cryptosporidium oocysts and 100 for giardia cysts were assumed to characterize source water concentrations conservative human pathogenicity fractions of 100 were assumed for cryptosporidium and giardia 3 2 3 sensitivity of e coli for identifying critical mean protozoa concentrations the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels to identify high cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in source water was evaluated based on the methodology presented in usepa 2005b cryptosporidium and giardia levels of concern were defined as the risk based critical mean concentrations for treatment requirement of 3 0 log selected e coli trigger values ranged from 5 cfu 100 ml 1 to 100 cfu 100 ml 1 the sensitivity of e coli was defined as the proportion of dwtps with high cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations that exceed the e coli trigger level 4 results site specific mean e coli protozoa ratios were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower at dwtps supplied by small and medium rivers group a group b in comparison with dwtps supplied by large rivers group c fig 1 ratios varied by approximately 4 0 log for both cryptosporidium 103 107 and giardia 100 104 mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios were generally 2 0 to 3 0 log higher than mean e coli giardia ratios because cryptosporidium concentrations were lower and more uncertain than giardia concentrations supplementary fig 1 modeled e coli cryptosporidium ratios were not reported for 10 dwtps because mcmc samples for estimating parameters of the poisson lognormal distribution for cryptosporidium were highly correlated ess 10 000 empirical ratios calculated assuming a detection limit of 1 oo cyst volume are shown for these sites the 95 credible intervals on the mean spanned from 2 0 to 3 0 log for e coli cryptosporidium ratios and from 1 0 to 2 0 log for e coli giardia ratios the parametric uncertainty on the e coli cryptosporidium ratio was high when less than ten positive samples were measured at a site fig 1 table 1 the incorporation of pearson s product moment correlations in the model had a minor effect 0 5 log on mean ratios at most locations supplementary table 1 supplementary fig 1 however high correlations absolute value 0 5 increased negative correlation or reduced positive correlation mean ratios by approximately 1 0 log overall positive correlations were higher for giardia than for cryptosporidium the seasonal analysis of pooled data showed that e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios were especially low during winter dec feb in group a q 20 m3 s 1 fig 2 supplementary table 3 these low ratios were associated with low e coli concentrations and high giardia concentrations during this period mean e coli concentrations in winter conditions were lower in group a 47 cfu 100 ml 1 compared to group b 222 cfu 100 ml 1 and group c 668 cfu 100 ml 1 the seasonal analysis also shows that the uncertainty on the mean cryptosporidium concentration dominated the uncertainty on the e coli cryptosporidium ratio e g summer ratio in group c during event conditions and routine monitoring conditions mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios were similar for dwtps a4 rainfall and c6 rainfall and snowmelt fig 3 in contrast e coli giardia ratios at dwtps a4 and c7 snowmelt were approximately 1 0 log lower during peak conditions in comparison to routine monitoring conditions accounting for beta distributed recovery rates reduced the mean e coli protozoa ratios but did not change the magnitude of the 95 credible interval the power law regression showed that the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations were not proportional fig 4 the slope k for cryptosporidium and giardia were 0 26 95 ci 0 08 0 47 and 0 19 95 ci 0 04 0 43 respectively predicted r squared were small for e coli as a predictor of protozoa cryptosporidium 26 giardia 10 and moderate for giardia as a predictor for cryptosporidium 43 supplementary fig 2 to achieve a target of 10 6 daly per person per year a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of cryptosporidium critical concentration 0 038 cysts l 1 was required for 20 dwtps a minimum reduction of 3 0 log of cryptosporidium was needed for the seven other dwtps for giardia a reduction of at least 4 0 log of giardia critical concentration 0 228 cysts l 1 was required for all dwtps moreover a reduction of at least 5 0 log of giardia critical concentration 2 28 cysts l 1 was required for 6 dwtps a treatment requirement of 3 0 log for a mean e coli concentration below a trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 would result in a maximum risk of 10 5 4 daly pers year for cryptosporidium dwtp a1 and 10 4 7 daly pers year for giardia dwtp a1 the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels for correctly identifying high cryptosporidium and high giardia concentrations is shown in table 3 a trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 resulted in a sensitivity of 95 for cryptosporidium lowering the trigger level to 10 cfu 100 ml 1 produced a sensitivity of 100 for giardia a trigger level of 10 cfu 100 ml 1 resulted in a sensitivity of 92 5 discussion despite inherent uncertainties associated with quantifying reference pathogen concentrations from indicator data fecal indicator bacteria trigger levels are still commonly used to define treatment requirements in drinking water safety regulations the values and limitations of indicators for predicting reference pathogen concentrations need to be rigorously assessed to support the development and the revision of risk based regulations this study was undertaken to determine whether e coli is a valid quantitative indicator for defining protozoa treatment requirements at surface dwtps the ratio of two lognormal variables was derived and used to evaluate site specific ratios from paired monitoring data collected at 27 dwtps the proposed mixed poisson model allowed to handle non detects correlations and parametric uncertainties mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios predicted by this model were higher than ratios previously estimated at dwtps supplied by rivers by lalancette et al 2014 this finding was expected because non detects were not considered in ratios reported by lalancette et al 2014 therefore modeling ratios with mixed poisson distributions can considerably increase the mean ratio especially for dwtps with a high proportion of non detects accounting for correlations between concentrations of e coli and protozoa rather than statistical independence did not change the magnitude of mean ratios for most dwtps because correlations were typically weak however neglecting moderately large linear correlations ρ 0 5 resulted in an overestimation or an underestimation of the mean ratio for some dwtps as previously demonstrated for the estimation of the product of two correlated lognormal variables smith et al 1992 the quantification of parametric uncertainty revealed that site specific mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios evaluated from small data sets n 30 were often highly uncertain other positively skewed distributions may be used to estimate ratios the ratio of poisson gamma distributions could be a valuable model for datasets with small count observations and a high proportion of non detects this ratio is simple to derive and has been used previously for microbial risk assessment teunis et al 2009 it can be demonstrated that if x γ α 1 β 1 and y γ α 2 β 2 are independently distributed then x y has a generalized beta prime distribution β α 1 α 2 1 β 2 β 1 johnson et al 1995 however the generalized beta prime distribution has an infinite mean if its shape parameter α 2 has a value 1 in our work this condition was too restrictive to model mean ratios at most dwtps the ratio of two correlated gamma variables has also been derived and used to evaluate the mean ratio of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci in surface water loáiciga and leipnik 2005 but the calculation of this ratio requires advanced integration techniques nonetheless it has recently been demonstrated that the gamma distribution can underestimate the magnitude of e coli and protozoa concentrations in source water during wet weather events sylvestre et al 2020a sylvestre et al 2020b thus the ratio of two lognormal variables may be a better model than the ratio of two gamma variables to account for the influence of high microbial concentrations on mean ratios as observed by lalancette et al 2014 for the e coli cryptosporidium ratio e coli protozoa ratios in small and medium rivers were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than those in large rivers the analysis of pooled data with power law regressions also showed that a large change in the mean e coli concentration is related to small changes in mean cryptosporidium or giardia concentrations therefore relying on e coli data only may lead to an inaccurate assumption that protozoa concentrations are low too the variability and uncertainty in concentrations of e coli and protozoa were not considered in this analysis the critical mean cryptosporidium concentration determined with the reverse qmra model for a reduction by a treatment of 3 0 log 0 038 oocysts l 1 was similar to the level of 0 075 oocysts l 1 used to trigger additional treatment requirements 3 0 log for filtered systems within the u s epa long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2006 in our work a conservative dose response model r 0 2 was selected for cryptosporidium parvum who 2009 it was assumed that this dose response model was consistent with recent scientific evidence as it is currently applied in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 nonetheless the cryptosporidium dose response relationship remains highly uncertain at low dose exposures messner and berger 2016 schmidt and chappell 2016 in the current study a default mean infectivity fraction of 30 was selected to characterize cryptosporidium oocysts in source water this fraction is similar to the one used for defining protozoa treatment requirements for surface water supplies in the united states united states environmental protection agency usepa 2005 an infectivity fraction of 30 has also been recently suggested as a conservative estimate for qmra based on cryptosporidium data collected across nine locations in south australia swaffer et al 2018 considering a human pathogenicity fraction of 100 for cryptosporidium may overestimate risks depending on the catchment type and the inputs from wildlife fractions of human pathogenic species c hominis and c parvum of approximately 10 were found in the south nation river and the grand river basins in ontario canada wilkes et al 2013 lapen et al 2016 the analysis of site specific human pathogenicity infectivity data could be valuable in an in depth qmra to determine whether additional treatment is needed the e coli trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 used to trigger cryptosporidium monitoring for small community water supplies in the lt2 had a high sensitivity for identifying critical mean cryptosporidium concentrations however increasing the trigger level to 100 cfu 100 ml 1 considerably reduced the sensitivity the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels was lower for giardia compared to cryptosporidium overall these analyses showed that treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at some sites with low mean e coli concentration to achieve 10 6 daly per person per year targets for cryptosporidium and giardia additional treatment credits may be obtained by optimizing the performance of existing treatment processes e g filter effluent turbidity target usepa 2010 however additional disinfection processes e g uv disinfection may be needed if treatment processes are already optimized the evaluation of seasonal variations of ratios pooled by river sizes generally reduced the parametric uncertainty on mean ratios the seasonal variations analysis indicated that differences in ratios were partly related to differences in mean e coli concentrations during winter among groups in fact decreases in mean e coli concentrations during winter and spring were observed at dwtps supplied by small rivers in agricultural and forested areas but not at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas the die off of e coli in winter may be higher in non point source pollution surface runoff soil leaching than in point source pollution wastewater treatment plants effluents combined sewer overflow discharges large rivers in southern quebec are primarily influenced by treated and untreated municipal wastewater discharges combined sewer overflow discharges sporadic sewage by passes payment et al 2000 and the increase e coli concentrations following wastewater discharges in winter and spring has been documented previously for dwtps c6 c7 c10 and c11 madoux humery et al 2016 burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2021 by contrast the contribution of agricultural pollution sources may be considerably higher in summer than in winter in summer grazing surfaces are contaminated by livestock feces and manure is applied to croplands consequently rainfall induced runoff can carry water contaminated by fecal wastes into surface water on the other hand in winter livestock is kept inside due to cold temperatures therefore runoff water is less contaminated by livestock feces this hypothesis is only valid for agricultural areas not for forested areas however it has been shown that in rural areas fecal contamination of rivers mainly originates from grazing areas george et al 2004 garcia armisen and servais 2007 ouattara et al 2011 other potential causes for seasonal variations in rural areas are the buffering of surface runoff by snow in winter and the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the survival of microorganisms in water wang et al 2019 recently reported a decline in initial e coli concentrations of 4 0 log in river water after 1 to 3 freeze thaw cycles but not at a constant temperature of 4 c 1 0 log afolabi et al 2020 inoculated animal feces into water and measured high reductions in initial e coli concentrations after one freeze thaw for red deer feces 1 0 to 3 0 log but not in dairy cow feces 1 0 log the effect of freeze thaw cycles on cryptosporidium and giardia survival is uncertain kato et al 2002 reported a reduction of 1 0 log of viable oocysts of cryptosporidium parvum in water after five freeze thaw cycles robertson and gjerde 2004 diluted a bovine fecal sample in water and found that initial numbers of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts were reduced by 0 6 log after five freeze thaw cycles further research on the survival of e coli and protozoa in winter conditions may therefore be valuable to investigate differences in ratios the analysis of e coli to protozoa ratios in rivers located in other climatic regions would also be relevant to investigate the nature and extent of this problem 6 conclusions in this study relationships between e coli cryptosporidium and giardia were quantified using paired e coli and protozoa data collected in source water from 27 drinking water treatment plants dwtps to evaluate the potential of e coli for defining minimum treatment requirements risk based critical mean protozoa concentrations in source water were determined with a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model developed using the methods and assumptions recommended by the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality this work led to the following conclusions it was possible to evaluate site specific mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios and mean e coli giardia ratios in source water by modeling the ratio of two correlated lognormal variables non detects correlations between e coli and protozoa and parametric uncertainties were taken into account with this model e coli protozoa ratios at dwtps supplied by small and medium rivers in agricultural or forested areas were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas these results support the findings of lalancette et al 2014 the seasonal variation analysis revealed that these differences were related to low mean e coli concentrations during winter at dwtps supplied by small rivers power law regressions showed no proportionalities between the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations at the 27 sites this analysis indicated that large changes in mean e coli concentrations are related to small changes in mean cryptosporidium or giardia concentrations results from qmra models indicated that a minimum reduction of 4 0 log would be needed at 20 dwtps to achieve a health based target of 10 6 daly per person per year for cryptosporidium a minimum reduction of 4 0 log would be necessary at all dwtps to achieve this target for giardia to achieve a target of 10 6 daly per person per year treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at dwtps with mean e coli concentrations as low as 30 cfu 100 ml 1 for cryptosporidium and 3 cfu 100 ml 1 for giardia therefore the definition of an e coli trigger level would have limited value for defining health based treatment requirements for protozoa at these dwtps overall this work suggests that e coli monitoring does not provide valuable insight for the risk assessment of cryptosporidium and giardia at dwtps supplied by small rivers in

16613,minimum treatment requirements are set in response to established or anticipated levels of enteric pathogens in the source water of drinking water treatment plants dwtps for surface water contamination can be determined directly by monitoring reference pathogens or indirectly by measuring fecal indicators such as escherichia coli e coli in the latter case a quantitative interpretation of e coli for estimating reference pathogen concentrations could be used to define treatment requirements this study presents the statistical analysis of paired e coli and reference protozoa cryptosporidium giardia data collected monthly for two years in source water from 27 dwtps supplied by rivers in canada e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios in source water were modeled as the ratio of two correlated lognormal variables to evaluate the potential of e coli for defining protozoa treatment requirements risk based critical mean protozoa concentrations in source water were determined with a reverse quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model model assumptions were selected to be consistent with the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality the sensitivity of mean e coli concentration trigger levels to identify these critical concentrations in source water was then evaluated results showed no proportionalities between the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations e coli protozoa ratios at dwtps supplied by small rivers in agricultural and forested areas were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas the seasonal variations analysis revealed that these differences were related to low mean e coli concentrations during winter in small rivers to achieve the who target of 10 6 disability adjusted life year daly per person per year a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of cryptosporidium would be required for 20 dwtps and a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of giardia would be needed for all dwtps a mean e coli trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 would be a sensitive threshold to identify critical mean concentrations for cryptosporidium but not for giardia treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at dwtps with mean e coli concentrations as low as 30 cfu 100 ml 1 for cryptosporidium and 3 cfu 100 ml 1 for giardia therefore an e

keywords minimum treatment requirements drinking water quantitative microbial risk assessment escherichia coli cryptosporidium giardia 1 introduction concentrations of reference enteric protozoa cryptosporidium giardia in source water must be adequately estimated to define health based protozoa treatment requirements for drinking water safety who 2016 however data are not always available because of the difficulty and cost associated with analyzing waterborne protozoa in environmental samples in these situations fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli are commonly used as indicators of pathogen occurrence although fib monitoring data sets can provide important information on fluctuations of fecal contamination in source water it is essential to keep in mind that this indicator has limitations for predicting concentrations of enteric protozoa wu et al 2011 health canada 2017 meteorological and environmental factors can have different effects on the fate and transport of indicators and pathogens in water moreover indicators can originate from other sources than pathogens monitoring of protozoa in raw water from drinking water treatment plants dwtps is recommended in canada health canada 2017 still protozoa monitoring is not mandatory in most canadian provinces government of manitoba 2007 gouvernement du québec 2012 in the united states and alberta canada protozoa monitoring is mandatory for large community water supplies and small community water supplies when e coli concentrations are low usepa 2010 government of alberta 2012 most of these regulations rely on the assumption that drinking water sources exposed to high e coli concentrations have a greater probability of protozoa occurrence independently of their concentration payment and locas 2011 however a quantitative relationship between concentrations of e coli and protozoa needs to be established to define health based minimum treatment requirements for protozoa using quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra to determine whether e coli data can be used to support the implementation of health based treatment requirements e coli to protozoa ratios can be evaluated over a given period at multiple dwtps supplied by different types of drinking water sources a meta analysis of e coli cryptosporidium ratios in primary sources of fecal contamination suggested that e coli is generally a good indicator for predicting cryptosporidium occurrence for urban pollution sources raw and treated wastewater but not for agricultural runoff lalancette et al 2014 in this study e coli cryptosporidium ratios were also evaluated at drinking water intakes from 13 dwtps in quebec canada using data from payment et al 2000 as estimated in their meta analysis ratios at drinking water intakes were lower for sources influenced by agricultural runoff than those influenced by municipal sewage the present study was designed to validate these findings using recent data collected at 27 surface dwtps supplied by rivers dominated by urban agricultural or wildlife sources of fecal pollution in quebec canada the mathematical model of lalancette et al 2014 was also extended to evaluate the uncertainty associated with arithmetic mean e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios the objectives of this study were i to derive the arithmetic mean ratio of two correlated lognormal distributions and use this model to characterize e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios in source water for 27 dwtps supplied by rivers ii to investigate the influence of river types and seasons on the variation in the magnitude of the mean ratios and iii to evaluate whether e coli trigger levels provide valuable information for defining health based treatment requirements for pathogenic protozoa at these dwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 classification of sites source water supplies were anonymized and classified according to their annual mean flow rate table 1 group a group b and group c represent rivers with mean flow rates of less than 20 m3 s 1 between 20 and 100 m3 s 1 and larger than 100 m3 s 1 respectively the main land cover type for each catchment was determined visually with google earth 2 2 sampling and microbial detection methods paired samples were collected monthly over approximately two consecutive years between 2011 and 2020 at each of the 27 dwtps for the detection of cryptosporidium and giardia a raw water volume varying from 10 to 60 litres was filtered on site with an envirochek hv cartridge pall according to u s epa method 1623 from 2011 to 2012 and u s epa method 1623 1 from 2013 to 2020 for one dwtp 10 liter cubitainers were collected on site and filtered at the laboratory the enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts was carried out according to u s epa method 1623 or 1623 1 usepa 2005a usepa 2012 mean analytical recovery rates of 43 matrix spikes in raw water samples collected at these dwtps were 0 46 standard deviation sd 0 14 for cryptosporidium and 0 50 sd 0 17 for giardia the enumeration of e coli was done by membrane filtration according to the modified mtec method from 2011 to 2012 or mfc bcig method ceaeq ma 700 ec bcig 1 0 from 2013 to 2020 these methods involve filtration of the sample through a 0 45 μm porosity membrane which is then deposited on a selective agar medium and incubated at 44 5 c for 24 h the e coli colonies were identified and counted visually and the concentration was expressed in cfu 100 ml 1 3 statistical methods 3 1 ratio of microbial concentrations 3 1 1 poisson counts in mixture distributions a pragmatic way to account for non detects is to assume that each observed count is poisson distributed and that the unknown microbial concentration is described by a mixture distribution haas et al 1999 within a mixed poisson modeling framework the probability of finding k organisms in a homogenous sample x of volume v collected from a suspension of mean concentration c is given by a poisson distribution with probability mass function 1 p k c v c v k k exp c v overdispersion relative to the poisson distribution was expected because microbial concentrations typically vary over orders of magnitude in river water a mixing distribution was selected to account for the unobserved heterogeneity i e the temporal variation of the concentration c in successive samples the mixed poisson distribution describing variations in counts is given by 2 p k c v θ p k c v f c θ d c where f is a mixing distribution of parameters θ the precise form of the mixed poisson distribution depends on the choice of f c θ in this study the lognormal distribution was selected as a mixing distribution because the mean ratio of two lognormal variables is simple to derive the lognormal distribution has a probability density 3 f c μ σ 1 σ c 2 π exp 1 2 l n c μ 2 σ 2 where the shape parameter μ and the scale parameter σ are respectively the expected value and the standard deviation of the natural logarithm of c original observations counts processed volumes were not available to model temporal variations in e coli concentrations therefore a parameters of the lognormal distribution were estimated from reported e coli concentrations non detects were replaced by a detection limit of 1 cfu 100 ml 1 this approach for handling non detects should not result in substantial estimation biases because the proportion of non detects was typically very small 5 for e coli recovery rates of 100 were assumed for e coli 3 1 2 ratio of two correlated lognormal variables to derive the ratio of lognormal variables let x be the e coli concentration in cfu l 1 and y be the protozoa concentration in oo cyst l 1 if x ln μ x σ x and y ln μ y σ y then by definition ln x and ln y are normally distributed it follows that the difference z between ln x and ln y is normally distributed with mean 4 μ z μ x μ y and variance 5 σ z 2 σ x 2 σ y 2 2 σ n x y where σ n x y is the covariance between x and y in log space therefore the ratio x y is described by z ln μ z σ z with mean 6 e z exp μ z σ z 2 2 to account for the correlation between x and y the covariance σ n x y in eq 5 can be calculated as follows 7 σ n x y ln σ ln x y x y 1 where σ ln x y is the covariance in real space and x and y are the arithmetic means of x and y crow and shimizu 1987 the covariance σ n x y is related to the pearson moment correlation coefficient in log space ρ n x y by 8 ρ n x y σ n x y σ x σ y by substituting eqs 7 8 in eq 5 the mean ratio x y from eq 6 can be rewritten in the following form 9 e x y exp μ x μ y σ x 2 σ y 2 2 ρ n x y σ x σ y 2 the covariance σ ln x y and sample means x and y in eq 7 were evaluated from the sample considering that non detects had a concentration of 0 oo cyst the arithmetic mean ratio was evaluated because it can be calculated straightforwardly it is also a standard measure of location to compare ratios among groups recovery rates of 100 were assumed for protozoa in this model 3 1 3 influence of seasonality weather events and nonconstant analytical recovery mean ratios of pooled data by seasons were evaluated for group a group b and group c to provide an overall summary of the influence of river types and seasons on the magnitude of mean ratios the climate in southern quebec is humid continental and it is characterized by large seasonal temperature differences and four seasons in this work seasons were defined as winter dec feb spring mar may summer june aug and autumn sept nov for dwtps a4 c6 and c7 mean ratios in routine monitoring conditions i e ratios evaluated with routine monitoring data were compared to daily mean ratios determined for event conditions i e ratios evaluated with data obtained following rainfall and snowmelt events a detailed characterization of event based sampling strategies implemented to obtain these data sets is presented elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020b sylvestre et al 2021 daily mean ratios in event conditions were estimated by averaging ratios from each sample i as follows 10 e x y e v e n t 1 n i 1 n x i y i where x is the e coli concentration and y is the protozoa concentration event based samples were collected at regular intervals of 4 h or 6 h over 24 h dwtps a4 c6 or three times over 96 h dwtp c7 concentrations of protozoa during events were estimated from raw oo cyst counts corrected for sample specific recovery rates to account for the analytical recovery in the estimation of the mean ratio in routine monitoring conditions the number of microorganisms observed in each sample was modeled as a binomial distribution of independent counts having a probability of recovery described by a beta distribution with parameters α β 6 48 7 70 for cryptosporidium and α β 3 80 3 91 for giardia sylvestre et al 2020c 3 1 4 model implementation the parameters of the poisson lognormal distributions were estimated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc simulations via rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 in r v4 0 4 for each parameter four markov chains were run for 1 106 iterations after a burn in phase of 104 iterations the convergence of chains was monitored using the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor gelman and shirley 2011 the median of the posterior distribution of the arithmetic mean and its 95 credibility interval were reported for microbial concentrations and ratios estimates of the 95 credibility interval of the posterior distributions of the parameter values were considered reasonably accurate when an effective sample size ess higher than 10 000 was obtained kass et al 1998 kruschke 2014 uninformative or weakly informative priors were adopted priors on parameters μ and σ were set to uniform 10 10 and exp 1 respectively the rationale for the selection of these priors is presented elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020c the r code is provided in the supplementary material 3 2 scaling relationship between e coli and protozoa 3 2 1 bivariate power law regression sample mean e coli concentrations and sample mean protozoa concentrations from the 27 sites were compared on a log log scale the relationship between e coli and protozoa was evaluated with a bivariate power law expressed as follows 11 c 2 r c 1 k where c 2 is the mean protozoa concentration c 1 is the mean e coli concentration r is the intercept at c 1 1 and k is the dimensionless scaling exponent the slope k identifies the relationship between c 1 and c 2 the following three situations are relevant to consider 1 k 1 the relationship between c 1 and c 2 is proportional 2 k 1 a large change in c 1 is only related to a small change in c 2 3 k 0 a large change in c 1 is not related to a change in c 2 power laws were fitted using the iteratively reweighted least squares irls algorithm from the glm function in r software environment 3 2 2 risk based critical mean cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations risk based critical mean cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in source water were determined for treatment reduction requirements of 3 0 log and 4 0 log the critical mean concentration was defined as the maximum cryptosporidium or giardia concentration that would be tolerable to achieve a health based target of 10 6 disability adjusted life year daly per person per year critical mean concentrations c were calculated with the following reverse qmra model 11 c 1 r i 10 t v r p i ι ι inf db e f s 1 ht where r is the recovery rate of the enumeration method i is the infectivity of oo cysts t is the reduction of the organism by treatment v is the volume of drinking water ingested per person per day r is the probability of infection for a single organism p i l l i n f is the probability of infection given illness db is the disease burden e is the number of exposures per year f s is the susceptible fraction of the population and ht is the health outcome target each variable of the model was described by its arithmetic mean mean values and assumptions for each parameter are presented in table 2 full scale reductions of giardia and cryptosporidium at the selected dwtps were not evaluated and considered in the qmra risk based concentrations were determined for theoretical treatment reduction requirements most assumptions for the qmra for cryptosporidium ingestion volume dose response model for infection probability of illness given infection disease burden were selected to be consistent with those recommended in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 conservative default mean infectivity fractions of 30 for cryptosporidium oocysts and 100 for giardia cysts were assumed to characterize source water concentrations conservative human pathogenicity fractions of 100 were assumed for cryptosporidium and giardia 3 2 3 sensitivity of e coli for identifying critical mean protozoa concentrations the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels to identify high cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations in source water was evaluated based on the methodology presented in usepa 2005b cryptosporidium and giardia levels of concern were defined as the risk based critical mean concentrations for treatment requirement of 3 0 log selected e coli trigger values ranged from 5 cfu 100 ml 1 to 100 cfu 100 ml 1 the sensitivity of e coli was defined as the proportion of dwtps with high cryptosporidium and giardia concentrations that exceed the e coli trigger level 4 results site specific mean e coli protozoa ratios were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower at dwtps supplied by small and medium rivers group a group b in comparison with dwtps supplied by large rivers group c fig 1 ratios varied by approximately 4 0 log for both cryptosporidium 103 107 and giardia 100 104 mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios were generally 2 0 to 3 0 log higher than mean e coli giardia ratios because cryptosporidium concentrations were lower and more uncertain than giardia concentrations supplementary fig 1 modeled e coli cryptosporidium ratios were not reported for 10 dwtps because mcmc samples for estimating parameters of the poisson lognormal distribution for cryptosporidium were highly correlated ess 10 000 empirical ratios calculated assuming a detection limit of 1 oo cyst volume are shown for these sites the 95 credible intervals on the mean spanned from 2 0 to 3 0 log for e coli cryptosporidium ratios and from 1 0 to 2 0 log for e coli giardia ratios the parametric uncertainty on the e coli cryptosporidium ratio was high when less than ten positive samples were measured at a site fig 1 table 1 the incorporation of pearson s product moment correlations in the model had a minor effect 0 5 log on mean ratios at most locations supplementary table 1 supplementary fig 1 however high correlations absolute value 0 5 increased negative correlation or reduced positive correlation mean ratios by approximately 1 0 log overall positive correlations were higher for giardia than for cryptosporidium the seasonal analysis of pooled data showed that e coli cryptosporidium and e coli giardia ratios were especially low during winter dec feb in group a q 20 m3 s 1 fig 2 supplementary table 3 these low ratios were associated with low e coli concentrations and high giardia concentrations during this period mean e coli concentrations in winter conditions were lower in group a 47 cfu 100 ml 1 compared to group b 222 cfu 100 ml 1 and group c 668 cfu 100 ml 1 the seasonal analysis also shows that the uncertainty on the mean cryptosporidium concentration dominated the uncertainty on the e coli cryptosporidium ratio e g summer ratio in group c during event conditions and routine monitoring conditions mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios were similar for dwtps a4 rainfall and c6 rainfall and snowmelt fig 3 in contrast e coli giardia ratios at dwtps a4 and c7 snowmelt were approximately 1 0 log lower during peak conditions in comparison to routine monitoring conditions accounting for beta distributed recovery rates reduced the mean e coli protozoa ratios but did not change the magnitude of the 95 credible interval the power law regression showed that the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations were not proportional fig 4 the slope k for cryptosporidium and giardia were 0 26 95 ci 0 08 0 47 and 0 19 95 ci 0 04 0 43 respectively predicted r squared were small for e coli as a predictor of protozoa cryptosporidium 26 giardia 10 and moderate for giardia as a predictor for cryptosporidium 43 supplementary fig 2 to achieve a target of 10 6 daly per person per year a minimum reduction of 4 0 log of cryptosporidium critical concentration 0 038 cysts l 1 was required for 20 dwtps a minimum reduction of 3 0 log of cryptosporidium was needed for the seven other dwtps for giardia a reduction of at least 4 0 log of giardia critical concentration 0 228 cysts l 1 was required for all dwtps moreover a reduction of at least 5 0 log of giardia critical concentration 2 28 cysts l 1 was required for 6 dwtps a treatment requirement of 3 0 log for a mean e coli concentration below a trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 would result in a maximum risk of 10 5 4 daly pers year for cryptosporidium dwtp a1 and 10 4 7 daly pers year for giardia dwtp a1 the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels for correctly identifying high cryptosporidium and high giardia concentrations is shown in table 3 a trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 resulted in a sensitivity of 95 for cryptosporidium lowering the trigger level to 10 cfu 100 ml 1 produced a sensitivity of 100 for giardia a trigger level of 10 cfu 100 ml 1 resulted in a sensitivity of 92 5 discussion despite inherent uncertainties associated with quantifying reference pathogen concentrations from indicator data fecal indicator bacteria trigger levels are still commonly used to define treatment requirements in drinking water safety regulations the values and limitations of indicators for predicting reference pathogen concentrations need to be rigorously assessed to support the development and the revision of risk based regulations this study was undertaken to determine whether e coli is a valid quantitative indicator for defining protozoa treatment requirements at surface dwtps the ratio of two lognormal variables was derived and used to evaluate site specific ratios from paired monitoring data collected at 27 dwtps the proposed mixed poisson model allowed to handle non detects correlations and parametric uncertainties mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios predicted by this model were higher than ratios previously estimated at dwtps supplied by rivers by lalancette et al 2014 this finding was expected because non detects were not considered in ratios reported by lalancette et al 2014 therefore modeling ratios with mixed poisson distributions can considerably increase the mean ratio especially for dwtps with a high proportion of non detects accounting for correlations between concentrations of e coli and protozoa rather than statistical independence did not change the magnitude of mean ratios for most dwtps because correlations were typically weak however neglecting moderately large linear correlations ρ 0 5 resulted in an overestimation or an underestimation of the mean ratio for some dwtps as previously demonstrated for the estimation of the product of two correlated lognormal variables smith et al 1992 the quantification of parametric uncertainty revealed that site specific mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios evaluated from small data sets n 30 were often highly uncertain other positively skewed distributions may be used to estimate ratios the ratio of poisson gamma distributions could be a valuable model for datasets with small count observations and a high proportion of non detects this ratio is simple to derive and has been used previously for microbial risk assessment teunis et al 2009 it can be demonstrated that if x γ α 1 β 1 and y γ α 2 β 2 are independently distributed then x y has a generalized beta prime distribution β α 1 α 2 1 β 2 β 1 johnson et al 1995 however the generalized beta prime distribution has an infinite mean if its shape parameter α 2 has a value 1 in our work this condition was too restrictive to model mean ratios at most dwtps the ratio of two correlated gamma variables has also been derived and used to evaluate the mean ratio of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci in surface water loáiciga and leipnik 2005 but the calculation of this ratio requires advanced integration techniques nonetheless it has recently been demonstrated that the gamma distribution can underestimate the magnitude of e coli and protozoa concentrations in source water during wet weather events sylvestre et al 2020a sylvestre et al 2020b thus the ratio of two lognormal variables may be a better model than the ratio of two gamma variables to account for the influence of high microbial concentrations on mean ratios as observed by lalancette et al 2014 for the e coli cryptosporidium ratio e coli protozoa ratios in small and medium rivers were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than those in large rivers the analysis of pooled data with power law regressions also showed that a large change in the mean e coli concentration is related to small changes in mean cryptosporidium or giardia concentrations therefore relying on e coli data only may lead to an inaccurate assumption that protozoa concentrations are low too the variability and uncertainty in concentrations of e coli and protozoa were not considered in this analysis the critical mean cryptosporidium concentration determined with the reverse qmra model for a reduction by a treatment of 3 0 log 0 038 oocysts l 1 was similar to the level of 0 075 oocysts l 1 used to trigger additional treatment requirements 3 0 log for filtered systems within the u s epa long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2006 in our work a conservative dose response model r 0 2 was selected for cryptosporidium parvum who 2009 it was assumed that this dose response model was consistent with recent scientific evidence as it is currently applied in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 nonetheless the cryptosporidium dose response relationship remains highly uncertain at low dose exposures messner and berger 2016 schmidt and chappell 2016 in the current study a default mean infectivity fraction of 30 was selected to characterize cryptosporidium oocysts in source water this fraction is similar to the one used for defining protozoa treatment requirements for surface water supplies in the united states united states environmental protection agency usepa 2005 an infectivity fraction of 30 has also been recently suggested as a conservative estimate for qmra based on cryptosporidium data collected across nine locations in south australia swaffer et al 2018 considering a human pathogenicity fraction of 100 for cryptosporidium may overestimate risks depending on the catchment type and the inputs from wildlife fractions of human pathogenic species c hominis and c parvum of approximately 10 were found in the south nation river and the grand river basins in ontario canada wilkes et al 2013 lapen et al 2016 the analysis of site specific human pathogenicity infectivity data could be valuable in an in depth qmra to determine whether additional treatment is needed the e coli trigger level of 50 cfu 100 ml 1 used to trigger cryptosporidium monitoring for small community water supplies in the lt2 had a high sensitivity for identifying critical mean cryptosporidium concentrations however increasing the trigger level to 100 cfu 100 ml 1 considerably reduced the sensitivity the sensitivity of e coli trigger levels was lower for giardia compared to cryptosporidium overall these analyses showed that treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at some sites with low mean e coli concentration to achieve 10 6 daly per person per year targets for cryptosporidium and giardia additional treatment credits may be obtained by optimizing the performance of existing treatment processes e g filter effluent turbidity target usepa 2010 however additional disinfection processes e g uv disinfection may be needed if treatment processes are already optimized the evaluation of seasonal variations of ratios pooled by river sizes generally reduced the parametric uncertainty on mean ratios the seasonal variations analysis indicated that differences in ratios were partly related to differences in mean e coli concentrations during winter among groups in fact decreases in mean e coli concentrations during winter and spring were observed at dwtps supplied by small rivers in agricultural and forested areas but not at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas the die off of e coli in winter may be higher in non point source pollution surface runoff soil leaching than in point source pollution wastewater treatment plants effluents combined sewer overflow discharges large rivers in southern quebec are primarily influenced by treated and untreated municipal wastewater discharges combined sewer overflow discharges sporadic sewage by passes payment et al 2000 and the increase e coli concentrations following wastewater discharges in winter and spring has been documented previously for dwtps c6 c7 c10 and c11 madoux humery et al 2016 burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2021 by contrast the contribution of agricultural pollution sources may be considerably higher in summer than in winter in summer grazing surfaces are contaminated by livestock feces and manure is applied to croplands consequently rainfall induced runoff can carry water contaminated by fecal wastes into surface water on the other hand in winter livestock is kept inside due to cold temperatures therefore runoff water is less contaminated by livestock feces this hypothesis is only valid for agricultural areas not for forested areas however it has been shown that in rural areas fecal contamination of rivers mainly originates from grazing areas george et al 2004 garcia armisen and servais 2007 ouattara et al 2011 other potential causes for seasonal variations in rural areas are the buffering of surface runoff by snow in winter and the effect of freeze thaw cycles on the survival of microorganisms in water wang et al 2019 recently reported a decline in initial e coli concentrations of 4 0 log in river water after 1 to 3 freeze thaw cycles but not at a constant temperature of 4 c 1 0 log afolabi et al 2020 inoculated animal feces into water and measured high reductions in initial e coli concentrations after one freeze thaw for red deer feces 1 0 to 3 0 log but not in dairy cow feces 1 0 log the effect of freeze thaw cycles on cryptosporidium and giardia survival is uncertain kato et al 2002 reported a reduction of 1 0 log of viable oocysts of cryptosporidium parvum in water after five freeze thaw cycles robertson and gjerde 2004 diluted a bovine fecal sample in water and found that initial numbers of giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts were reduced by 0 6 log after five freeze thaw cycles further research on the survival of e coli and protozoa in winter conditions may therefore be valuable to investigate differences in ratios the analysis of e coli to protozoa ratios in rivers located in other climatic regions would also be relevant to investigate the nature and extent of this problem 6 conclusions in this study relationships between e coli cryptosporidium and giardia were quantified using paired e coli and protozoa data collected in source water from 27 drinking water treatment plants dwtps to evaluate the potential of e coli for defining minimum treatment requirements risk based critical mean protozoa concentrations in source water were determined with a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model developed using the methods and assumptions recommended by the world health organization who guidelines for drinking water quality this work led to the following conclusions it was possible to evaluate site specific mean e coli cryptosporidium ratios and mean e coli giardia ratios in source water by modeling the ratio of two correlated lognormal variables non detects correlations between e coli and protozoa and parametric uncertainties were taken into account with this model e coli protozoa ratios at dwtps supplied by small and medium rivers in agricultural or forested areas were typically 1 0 to 2 0 log lower than at dwtps supplied by large rivers in urban areas these results support the findings of lalancette et al 2014 the seasonal variation analysis revealed that these differences were related to low mean e coli concentrations during winter at dwtps supplied by small rivers power law regressions showed no proportionalities between the log of mean e coli concentrations and the log of mean protozoa concentrations at the 27 sites this analysis indicated that large changes in mean e coli concentrations are related to small changes in mean cryptosporidium or giardia concentrations results from qmra models indicated that a minimum reduction of 4 0 log would be needed at 20 dwtps to achieve a health based target of 10 6 daly per person per year for cryptosporidium a minimum reduction of 4 0 log would be necessary at all dwtps to achieve this target for giardia to achieve a target of 10 6 daly per person per year treatment requirements higher than 3 0 log would be needed at dwtps with mean e coli concentrations as low as 30 cfu 100 ml 1 for cryptosporidium and 3 cfu 100 ml 1 for giardia therefore the definition of an e coli trigger level would have limited value for defining health based treatment requirements for protozoa at these dwtps overall this work suggests that e coli monitoring does not provide valuable insight for the risk assessment of cryptosporidium and giardia at dwtps supplied by small rivers in

16614,this study aimed to determine the reliability of the double clustering method to understand the spatial association and distribution of major and minor constituents in the groundwater of an arid endorheic basin in central mexico comarca lagunera region the results of the double clustering approach were compared with well known spatial statistics such as spatial autocorrelations moran index and the local indicator of spatial association lisa fifty five groundwater samples were collected from diverse wells within the basin and the major ions metalloids and trace elements were determined overall the double clustering analysis was an effective tool for identifying lithogenic anthropogenic processes occurring in the basin and for establishing zones with high or low abundance of major ions and trace elements even where processes affecting the groundwater quality were spatially dispersed although 89 of the samples showed as higher than the threshold value of 10 μg l proposed by the world health organization for drinking water both the double clustering and lisa analyses identified as hotspots in the alluvial aquifer where the extraction of deeper and warmer groundwater might promote the concomitant release of the metalloids as sb and ge and the trace elements v and w similarly both statistical analyses identified mountainous sectors where the weathering of silicates and carbonates plays a key role in the abundance of hco3 ga and ba however the lisa analysis failed to identify hotspots of carbonate derived elements such as ca mg sr and u and silicate derived elements such as ca mg k sr rb cs pb ni and y otherwise the double clustering analysis clearly defined high and low concentration zones for all these elements in the study region unlike the lisa analysis the double clustering approach was also successful in determining alluvial areas with high concentrations of si and ti and areas where the concentrations of na cl so4 2 no3 b li cu re and se in groundwater were elevated increasing the groundwater salinity overall this study demonstrated that the double clustering is an easy to apply approach capable of visualizing disperse zones where specific anthropogenic processes may threaten the groundwater quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords double clustering lisa metalloids salinity groundwater 1 introduction groundwater availability in arid and semiarid regions has received increased attention because of the rising pressure on aquifers as a reliable source of water for urban industrial and agricultural consumption ghazavi et al 2018 kourakos et al 2019 in these warm climate areas groundwater becomes more sensitive to prolonged droughts and anthropogenic activities which results in groundwater storage depletion and water quality deterioration ali et al 2019 benfetta and ouadja 2020 in several arid and semi arid regions worldwide the decreasing level of fresh groundwater due to the overexploitation of aquifer systems has triggered a decline in its chemical quality posing a health threat to millions of people who use this water for domestic and irrigation purposes various studies have revealed that aquifer dewatering in warm regions leads to high groundwater mineralization el alfy et al 2018 singhal et al 2020 and increasing concentrations of f as mo cd and other trace elements kuiper et al 2015 khan et al 2016 knappett et al 2018 2020 mora et al 2020 however these trends depend on a wide range of processes such as the degree of aquifer drawdown aquifer recharge rates regional geology and the interaction of fresh groundwater with brackish water among others making it difficult to manage the risks to human health barbieri et al 2019 ricolfi et al 2020 the structure status and processes of the groundwater system which can only be assessed through scientific research are critical aspects of water resource management in this regard hydrogeochemical data provide essential tools to support water resource management barbieri 2019 because both essential and non essential trace elements can be toxic at elevated concentrations in drinking water calderon 2000 the mapping of their abundances in aquifers is critical for identifying trace element hotspots and areas where groundwater quality may represent a threat to humans this approach may be useful for the development of aquifer management strategies to remediate and or exclude groundwater wells located in vulnerable areas bhowmik et al 2015 raju et al 2019 from this perspective spatial statistical methods applied in geographical sciences such as the moran index moran s i and the local indicator of spatial association lisa anselin 1995 have been successfully used in geochemistry and environmental sciences to find spatial autocorrelations and determine areas that are susceptible to lithogenic and or anthropogenic contamination zhang et al 2008 specifically both statistical methods have been used recently to determine spatial as hotspots in the groundwater of ireland mcgrory et al 2017 and to assess the spatial dependence of as and other trace elements in the shallow groundwater of the bolivian altiplano quino lima et al 2020 in the same way multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis accompanied by hierarchical cluster analysis hca have been used to detect the sources of trace elements and groundwater pollution in several areas worldwide chen et al 2007 kazakis et al 2017 wu et al 2020 kumar 2020 however this strategy can mask the geochemical or anthropogenic processes occurring in a specific zone owing to the effect of cumulative processes through the dissolution and mobility of certain elements therefore identifying the spatial patterns exhibited by the data and recognizing the different processes controlling both major and minor element abundances may be challenging to address this issue the application of hca to the groups of clusters obtained from the first clustering double clustering approach can be very effective in identifying certain structures of causality making the interpretation of the results more reliable matuszewski 2002 although this method is easy to apply to large datasets it has not been proven either in geochemical prospecting or in environmental sciences in order to elucidate critical zones for groundwater related human health threats the arid and semi arid region of north central mexico has a long history of lithogenic groundwater pollution due to the presence of elevated levels of as and f in bedrock which is related to cenozoic volcanism alarcón herrera et al 2020 the comarca lagunera region clr located in north central mexico is one of the most populated areas of the country with lithogenic groundwater pollution the growing livestock industrial mining and agricultural activities in the clr drive prosperous economic growth nevertheless because of the arid climate surface water is scarce and groundwater has become a vital resource for urban industrial and agricultural supply in addition the growing water demand has led to overexploitation of aquifers and the use of non traditional deeper groundwater although a recent study has found high levels of nitrates derived from agricultural livestock activities in the shallow groundwater of this area torres martínez et al 2021 arsenic is the main contaminant of concern in both deep and shallow groundwater this metalloid has exhibited a broad range of concentrations which have varied from 7μg l to 740 μg l in wells del razo et al 1990 rosas et al 1999 to up to 5000 μg l in aquitards ortega guerrero 2017 this has led to the incorporation of as removal systems removal of as 5 by coagulation with ferric chloride in wells operated by the national water authority and the local water sanitation service these filter systems reduce the as in water to levels below those established 25 μg l as the mexican drinking water standard nom 127 ssa1 2017 dof 2019 however many privately drilled wells do not benefit from these filters although several studies have addressed the processes controlling the content of inorganic as species and the associated risk assessment in the groundwater of the clr del razo et al 1990 mejía gonzález et al 2014 there is a lack of concurrent evaluation of other potentially toxic elements that may also present a risk to human health thus the objectives of this study are i to map the salinity and trace element levels in the groundwater of the clr using a double clustering procedure and well known spatial statistics moran s i and lisa ii to compare the use of these statistical approaches in order to check similarities and differences in their results and iii to evaluate the concentrations of major ions and trace elements in order to detect any threat to human health in general this study focused on the use of a simple and easy statistical approach double clustering to obtain the spatial variability of major ions metalloids and trace elements in the groundwater of a closed basin determining which lithogenic or anthropogenic processes might be inferred in those areas where elevated levels of salinity and trace elements occur additionally to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a double clustering approach is used to assess the spatial distribution of major ions and trace elements in a groundwater system the results of this work could help decision makers involved in regional water quality management to delineate safe areas and areas vulnerable to toxic elements to enable the expansion of groundwater use 2 study area 2 1 general settings the clr fig 1 is enclosed by the physiographical sub provinces laguna de mayrán and bolsón de mapimí and covers an area of 44 800 km2 the area includes part of the endorheic basins of the nazas and aguanaval rivers these rivers have been dammed to create the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco reservoirs which supply water to meet urban and irrigation demands before damming both rivers supplied water to 13 natural lakes among them is the laguna de mayrán the largest in latin america however the combination of river damming and arid conditions dried up all the lakes resulting in one of the worst ecological disasters in mexico the clr climate is semi arid to arid with mean temperatures between 8 c and 22 c in winter and between 23 c and 36 c in summer the average annual precipitation is 177 mm with maximum values in september 40 5 mm and minimums in february 2 9 mm the population of almost 1 6 million people is centered mainly in the metropolitan areas of torreón gomez palacio and lerdo agricultural and livestock activities are intensive in the clr including one of the most important dairy industries in mexico livestock breeding includes poultry and cattle for milk and meat production agricultural lands are mainly fertilized with manure from livestock activities to produce crops such as alfalfa corn sorghum cotton sugar and watermelon 2 2 geology hydrogeology and hydrochemistry the clr is located in the sierra madre oriental range a long mountain belt extending from the trans mexican volcanic belt to the usa mexican border which resulted from the deformation of mesozoic sedimentary rocks and a complex basement that includes neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks paleozoic schist and sedimentary rocks and upper triassic lower jurassic red beds velasco tapia et al 2016 the study area includes mountains located in the upper nazas and aguanaval basins n sw direction and an alluvial plain sw ne orientation fig 1a six administrative aquifers nazas vicente suárez villa juárez oriente aguanaval pedriceña velardreña and principal lagunera region supply water to the clr fig 1c these aquifers are interconnected conforming to one integrated system that flowed from the mountains to the ancient lakes of this endorheic basin from sw to ne direction however due to groundwater overexploitation in the principal lagunera region aquifer alluvial aquifer there has been considerable hydrological changes in the groundwater flow fig 1a in other words the cones of depression caused by intensive pumping have reversed the groundwater flow from the dry ancient lakes ne to the sw direction ortega guerrero et al 2017 fig 1a shows that the groundwater system comprises two principal areas each with different hydrogeological characteristics the main system is dominated by intercalations between carbonate rocks marls limestone and dolomites volcanic siliciclastic rocks granite rhyolite andesite and basalt shales sandstones and conglomerates conagua 1999 these extend from the surrounding mountains to the bottom of an unconfined granular aquifer that constitutes the second system which consists of clastic material composed of intercalated layers of gravel sand silt and clay resulting from the erosion of the surrounding mountains and transported by the nazas and aguanaval rivers fig 1 this porous aquifer has a varied granulometry showing an increasing thickness from 50 m near the mountains to more than 1000 m in the lowlands conagua 1999 additionally there are lacustrine clayey rich aquitards toward the northeastern part of this closed basin where the viesca mayran and other ancient lakes developed ortega guerrero 2017 although the alluvial aquifer is scarcely recharged by rainfall infiltration artificial recharge by the irrigation return flow may occur in some agricultural areas given that these lands are irrigated with surface waters from the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco reservoirs hydrochemical studies have confirmed the presence of highly mineralized groundwater in the clr with an average total dissolved solids tds of 1180 933 mg l so4 2 and ca2 dominate the ionic composition due to the progressive dissolution of carbonates gypsum and the oxidation of pyrite brouste et al 1997 nevertheless large spatial variability of chemical facies occurs due to the variable lithology and high evaporation brouste et al 1997 additionally the groundwater of the viesca aquitard shows saline mineralization conditions with tds concentrations between 97 000 and 148 000 mg l and as concentrations of up to 5 mg l ortega guerrero 2017 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling fifty five wells that supplied water for irrigation and human consumption in the clr were sampled in november 2018 fig 1a the production wells located in the mountainous area upper basin have depths that vary from 75 to 150 m dof 2015 whereas the wells located in the alluvial aquifer limited by the urban area are between 125 and 500 m deep garcía salazar and mora flores 2008 in the lower basin the wells range from 150 to 300 m deep rivas sada 2011 at the time of sampling the wells operated by the local water service were working under normal conditions in wells that had as removal systems the water samples were collected before these systems in private wells the pumps were switched on and the water was run until the electrical conductivity ec values stabilized only then was the water measured and sampled the ph temperature salinity oxidation reduction potential orp ec and dissolved oxygen do concentrations in water were measured in the field using pre calibrated electrodes the water samples were collected in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and filtered on site using 0 45 μm pore size membranes the filtered samples were placed in two pre washed and pre rinsed 250 ml sampling kits for anion analysis and for major cation and trace element analysis the samples for major cation and trace element analysis were acidified with ultrapure hno3 in addition 50 ml of unfiltered samples were collected for the analysis of water stable isotopes bicarbonates were measured in the field by titration using h2so4 0 02 n until the ph reached 4 3 all samples were stored at 4 c until further analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis major ions and trace elements were analyzed by activation laboratories ltd ancaster canada major cations na k ca2 and mg2 were measured using an agilent axial icp oes system whereas anions cl f so4 2 and no3 were analyzed with ion chromatography using a dionex dx 120 instrument the concentrations of trace alkali and alkali earth elements li rb cs sr and ba transition elements ti v cr mn fe ni cu zn y mo w and re metalloids b si ge as and sb and other trace elements ga pb se tl and u were determined using a perkin elmer sciex elan 9000 icp ms equipment in ultra low mode nitrites no2 and other trace elements such as ag al be bi cd co hg in nb sc sn ta te and zr were also measured however in almost all the samples the concentrations were lower than the detection limit dl of the analytical technique and thus were not considered in this study during all determinations blanks and primary standard solutions were run to perform quality control of the analysis and verify the precision and calibration of the equipment the accuracy of the icp ms measurements was checked using the standard iv stock 1643 trace elements in water overall the relative difference between the measured and certified values of the standard ranged between 0 4 and 16 2 the dl for each element and the relative difference between the certified and measured values of the standard iv stock 1643 are included in supplementary information table s1 seven sample results for fe two sample results for pb mn cr and nitrates and one sample result for tl and f were lower than the dl of the analytical method these values were expressed as dl 2 for statistical analysis the ionic charge balance ranged between 0 05 and 20 only five samples with high b concentrations showed values higher than 15 with an average value of 4 8 stable water isotope analysis was performed at the environmental isotope laboratory of the university of waterloo canada using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia los gatos research inc following the method described by berman et al 2013 water standards calibrated to the reference materials vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and vienna standard light antarctic precipitation vslap were used to check the quality of the analytical procedure the results were expressed as δ values by representing the deviations in per mil from the vsmow standard the precision varied from 0 04 to 1 2 and from 0 04 to 0 66 for δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o analyses respectively 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 spearman s rank correlation coefficient and saturation index the non parametric spearman analysis was used to determine significant correlations between the physicochemical parameters major ions metalloids and trace elements in groundwater samples three levels of significance were considered p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 the saturation index for some mineral phases in groundwater was calculated using the phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 uncertainties for each mineral phase were also included in the saturation index plots langmuir and melchior 1985 nordstrom and ball 1989 plummer et al 1990 mclaughlin et al 2013 3 3 2 double clustering analysis hca has been widely used in both surface and groundwater systems to differentiate and or link water samples with different or similar characteristics at several hierarchical levels egbueri 2020 gyimah et al 2020 although this method seems to be suitable for characterizing a particular system it does not directly indicate which parameters are responsible for the grouping of samples in a determined region or zone this overlaps the effects that chemical and physical variables exert on ions and elements making it difficult to identify the real processes controlling the abundance of trace elements in a particular region therefore it is convenient to first group the associated variables that control the levels of certain elements in groundwater through an hca of variables and then apply a subsequent hca of cases using only the data of each group of variables defined in the first hca double clustering approach in our study we first carried out an hca using all the data for clustering variables this analysis generated six groups of variables then we applied the hca of cases clustering cases in all six groups of variables defined in the first step in order to elucidate how the magnitude of these variables including trace elements changes spatially this allowed the generation of a map that describes the magnitude of these variables in the aquifer system overall the first clustering groups variables associated to lithogenic anthropogenic processes occurring in the system whereas the second clustering indicates where these processes occur all hca were performed based on euclidean distance and ward s method before applying hca to the data these were log transformed and standardized z score in order to provide equal weight to all variables and approximate normality güler et al 2002 3 3 3 kruskal wallis analysis once the groups of cases subgroups for each group of variables were defined by the double clustering approach the nonparametric kruskal wallis analysis was applied to determine whether there were significant differences among these subgroups differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 3 4 mapping construction according to the information generated from the double clustering approach six study area maps were constructed one map for each group of variables depicting the spatial distribution of each subgroup of cases sampled wells and the average values of variables contained in each subgroup the clr maps were built using arcgis 10 8 software 3 3 5 spatial autocorrelations moran s i and local indicator of spatial association lisa in addition to the double clustering approach the local moran s i and lisa analysis were carried out to verify the spatial autocorrelations of variables and identify local clusters respectively of major ions metalloids and trace elements in the study area anselin 1995 1996 in brief moran s i is a way to verify the spatial autocorrelation of major and minor constituents of groundwater in a determined area this is based on the location of the sampling wells and therefore the distance between them and the concentration values of the tested variables when moran s i is positive the sampling wells have similarly high or low values of a particular variable as their neighbor wells and thus they are considered spatial clusters on the other hand negative values of moran s i indicate that the spatial distribution is scattered so the wells are considered as single localities or spatial outliers anselin 2005 zhang et al 2008 as a complementary analysis to moran s i lisa categorizes the spatial clusters as high high high values in a high value neighborhood and low low low values in a low value neighborhood spatial outliers are classified as high low and low high high values in a low value neighborhood and vice versa whereas the rest of the wells are not significant groups according to lisa zhang et al 2008 mcgrory et al 2017 in our study the total number of neighbors were 55 sampled wells the percentage of these wells forming high high hotspots and low low coldspots clusters for each variable is shown in the following section overall the lisa analysis aimed to compare the local lisa clusters of variables with the subgroups generated through the double clustering approach the z score and the p value were obtained from moran s i to assess the level of significance spatial autocorrelations were considered significant for positive moran s i and p 0 05 both moran s i and lisa statistics were developed using geoda software 1 18 0 anselin et al 2006 4 results table 1 shows the minimum maximum and average values of major ion and trace element concentrations in the groundwater of the clr the complete dataset of both major ions and trace elements together with the location name altitude thickness of the vadose zone level of the water table and the utm coordinates of the sampled wells are included in supplementary information table s2 the groundwater ph varied between slightly acidic 6 00 and moderately alkaline 8 64 the water temperature ranged from 20 7 to 34 3 c and the do concentrations ranged between 1 01 and 7 31 mg l the ec and tds concentrations showed variations up to 20 fold with minimums of 332 μs cm and 190 mg l and maximums of 5957 μs cm and 3894 mg l respectively whereas 63 of the samples showed tds concentrations higher than 500 mg l the dissolved si concentrations not shown in table 1 ranged from 10 9 to 34 3 mg l with an average concentration of 20 1 mg l the waters were between calcic sulfated and bicarbonated although some samples showed na as the major cation the concentrations of several elements such as b ge rb ti and si presented limited spatial variation between 3 and 28 fold variation whereas the trace elements w tl sr and mn displayed variations of up to three and four orders of magnitude arsenic concentrations varied between 5 and 349 μg l thus 89 of the groundwater samples showed values above the safe limit of 10 μg l established by the world health organization who 2018 for drinking water this demonstrates the lithogenic enrichment of as in groundwater of the whole region due to the natural as enrichment in volcanic silicate rocks alarcón herrera et al 2020 4 1 double clustering approach fig 2 depicts the resulting dendrogram of the hca of the variables first hca applied to the entire dataset the phenon line delimits six groups of variables with a linkage distance of approximately 16 group a includes the variables ph temperature f the metalloids as ge and sb and the trace elements mn v and w group b contains do and mo b li cu and na group c includes hco3 and the trace elements ga ba pb and cr group d includes k the alkali earth ions ca2 mg2 and sr2 and the trace elements ni zn rb y u fe ta and cs whereas group e comprises the major anions cl so4 2 and no3 salinity ec and tds and the trace elements re and se finally group f only contains dissolved si ti and the parameter orp fig 3 shows the dendrograms of the hca of the cases applied to each group of variables in these dendrograms the phenon lines were chosen so that the differences between the subgroups of extracted clusters were pronounced table 2 indicates the average of each variable together with the respective standard deviation in each subgroup of cases and specifies whether there were significant differences between subgroups for each selected variable according to the kruskal wallis analysis group a showed two subgroups of cases fig 3a which displayed significant differences for all variables except for f group b presented three subgroups of cases fig 3b which showed significant differences for all variables except for mo and cu group c showed two subgroups fig 3c presenting significant differences for all variables similarly group d displayed two subgroups of cases fig 3d however the variables fe and tl did not show significant differences between these two subgroups group e displayed three subgroups fig 3e which were significantly different for all variables finally group f displayed two subgroups of cases fig 3f in this group there were significant differences in ti and si between subgroups whereas the difference in orp values was not significant between the two subgroups fig 4 depicts six maps regarding to each group of variables these maps show the sites and the zones with the highest values of physicochemical parameters major ions metalloids and trace elements according to the results of the double clustering approach the red color indicates the subgroups and the area with the highest values of the above mentioned variables the yellow color indicates moderate values whereas the blue color indicates the subgroups and areas with the lowest values the criteria for defining these high moderate and low values were the average values of each subgroup for each variable which are presented in table 2 4 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis and lisa statistic table 3 shows the results of the moran s i and lisa statistic applied to each measured variable in the groundwater of the clr whereas fig 5 depicts the results of the lisa analysis applied to the variables of most environmental or health interests of each case group as and ge for group a na for group b hco3 for group c k for group d and salinity for group e the variables of group f were not plotted because they did not show significant moran s i values the results of the lisa analysis that were applied to the rest of the variables are presented in supplementary information fig f1 regarding group a of variables defined by the hca the temperature and the concentrations of the elements as ge and w showed positive and significant moran s i values suggesting the presence of spatial clusters in the clr the lisa analysis indicated that the hotspots high high clusters of as concentrations 12 7 of total samples were located toward the northern part of the principal lagunera region aquifer fig 5a this agrees with the map generated by the double clustering approach fig 4a which indicates that the highest concentrations of as ge sb v and w were located in the northern part of this aquifer in fact all the locations considered as as hotspots according to the lisa analysis lie in subgroup g2 of group a the subgroup presenting the highest concentrations similarly fig 5b shows that the hotspots of ge concentrations 25 5 of total samples were also located toward the north of the alluvial aquifer which agrees with fig 4a 71 of samples representing the ge hotspots are included in g2 of group a of variables overall the low low clusters coldspots of as and ge representing 12 7 and 16 4 of the total samples respectively are located in the southwestern part of the basin figs 5a and 5b as mentioned earlier the high low and low high wells 1 8 and 16 4 for as and 3 6 and 9 1 for ge respectively are considered outliers whereas the rest of the wells 54 5 and 46 6 for as and ge respectively were not significant according to the lisa statistic regarding the other variables of group a showing significant moran s i values w and temperature both showed hotspots high high clusters toward the north of the alluvial aquifer and coldspots toward the southwestern part of the basin such as as and ge supplementary information fig f1 variables of group b had a small percentage of high high clusters table 3 therefore their significant moran s i values were mainly related to the greater density of low low clusters fig 5c located toward the center of the basin in the case of na and b concentrations with 40 and 45 5 of the total samples toward the alluvial aquifer in the case of li and cu with 63 6 and 58 2 of the total samples and in minor proportion toward the southwestern part of the basin in the case of mo with 21 8 of total samples see supplementary information fig f1 regarding group c fig 5d shows that the high high clusters of hco3 are located toward the southwestern part of the basin mountainous sector whereas a high proportion of low low clustered wells are found in the alluvial aquifer a similar distribution of high and low concentrations of hco3 was also obtained for the variables of group c through the double clustering approach fig 4c the same high high cluster distribution also applies to ga and ba supplementary information fig f1 however according to the lisa analysis the majority of wells located in the alluvial aquifer 69 1 and 70 9 of the total samples for ga and ba respectively were not significant for ga and ba because pb concentrations only present 1 8 of the total samples as hotspots table 3 the significant moran s i was mainly due to the low low clusters or coldspots 38 2 of the total samples moreover the low low cluster pattern for pb was comparable to that of hco3 supplementary information fig f1 although the general pattern of pb was nearly similar to that of k concentrations fig 5e an element of group d therefore this similar spatial distribution for pb and k may suggest a similar source which is discussed in the next section except for zn concentrations the rest of the variables in group d showed no significant values of moran s i finally the variables of group e that displayed a significant moran s i ec salinity tds and so4 2 concentrations exhibited a similar pattern according to the lisa results low percentages of samples showing high high clusters and moderate percentages of samples showing low low clusters table 3 in general these low low clusters were located in the central part of the basin as shown in fig 5f for salinity 5 discussion 5 1 spatial distribution and occurrence of major ions and trace elements in groundwater based on the double clustering approach and the lisa statistic 5 1 1 group a metalloids mobility in the overexploited alluvial aquifer as demonstrated above both lisa and double clustering analyses indicate as hotspots in groundwater of the aquifer principal lagunera region which agrees with other studies ortega guerrero 2017 although the lisa analysis presented hotspots for a specific variable arsenic in this case the double clustering approach allows delineating a hotspot relative to the general system comprising several variables in this case the delineated hotspot is included in a general hotspot featuring a high frequency of high temperature ph as ge sb v w and mn the significantly higher values of these variables in the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer table 2 and the positive correlations of as with temperature r 0 45 p 0 001 ph r 0 33 p 0 05 sb r 0 47 p 0 001 ge r 0 39 p 0 01 v r 0 62 p 0 001 and w r 0 66 p 0 001 across the whole basin may suggest that the high as levels may be related to deeper groundwater abstraction where this metalloid is probably mobilized with the metalloids sb and ge and with the elements v and w in this sense several hypotheses regarding the origin of as in the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer are discussed studies performed in sediments of a drilled deep well 400 m deep in the alluvial aquifer have shown particles of fe oxides carrying as mejía et al 2018 this metalloid might be accumulated absorbed into fe oxyhydroxides due to the continuous episodes of transport and accumulation of weathering products of as enriched high silica volcanic rocks in these alluvial deposits alarcón herrera et al 2020 as mentioned earlier the alluvial aquifer has been subjected to considerable overexploitation to the extent that deeper wells 125 500 m deep have been drilled and equipped with slotted pipes promoting the mixture of cold groundwater with deeper and warmer groundwater this pumping induced mixing with warmer groundwater leads to alkaline waters due to hydrolysis of silicate minerals knappett et al 2020 where this rising ph changes the charged binding sites of the fe oxides from positive to negative releasing oxyanions such as as to pore waters however other hypotheses such as the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides containing as mejía et al 2018 and higher as concentrations in deeper aquifer layers may also be considered as potential factors inducing the dissemination of as in this alluvial aquifer another important fact regarding group a defined by the double clustering approach is the possible co mobilization of as sb ge v and w in groundwater of the alluvial aquifer several studies have found that as and sb are concomitantly mobilized in groundwater due to processes such as reductive dissolution of amorphous hydrous fe oxides where as and sb are adsorbed the weathering of arsenopyrites and stibnite and the re adsorption of both metalloids onto fe oxyhydroxides kelepertsis et al 2006 vega et al 2020 quino lima et al 2020 the transition element v has also been shown to co occur with as and sb in groundwater because like as and sb both viv and vv species can be adsorbed onto mn and fe oxides and clays and then desorbed by reductive dissolution of these oxides vega et al 2020 similarly w has shown a strong tendency to be adsorbed onto fe and al oxyhydroxides as well as some clays such as smectite and kaolinite neiva et al 2019 therefore these references together with the results of the double clustering analysis and the significant positive correlations found between these elements suggest the concomitant mobilization of as sb ge v and w by the desorption dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides however more evidence is needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached numerous studies have pointed out the co occurrence of as and f in groundwater in arid and semi arid zones of mexico alarcón herrera et al 2020 in our study 22 of the sampled wells also had f concentrations exceeding the limit of 1 5 mg l proposed by who 2018 for safe drinking water additionally although a positive correlation between as and f r 0 41 p 0 01 was found the difference in f concentrations between subgroups g1 and g2 was not statistically significant a possible explanation for this may be as follows several studies performed in volcanic regions of central mexico have indicated that the co occurrence of as with f in groundwater is due to the weathering of silicate rocks by hot water which produces an increase in ph and the desorption of as from fe oxyhydroxides knappett et al 2020 this silicate weathering results in the formation of clays enhancing the abundance of cation exchange sites where dissolved ca2 is interchanged with na this depletion of dissolved ca promotes the dissolution of the slightly undersaturated fluorite which further increases the concentration of dissolved f favoring the co occurrence of as and f in contrast to these studies the groundwater of the clr is strongly undersaturated with respect to fluorite and slightly saturated with respect to calcite and aragonite supplementary information fig f2 hence a depletion in the content of dissolved ca in groundwater due to the above mentioned cation exchange process may be rapidly buffered either by calcite or fluorite dissolution restricting the concomitant release of as and f although mn concentrations were higher in the alluvial aquifer this element was correlated with neither as the more abundant metalloid nor v thus there is no conclusive evidence about the behavior of this element in groundwater of the clr in general mn mobility in groundwater is more associated to ph changes and redox processes which may be chemically or biologically mediated hamer et al 2020 bourg and bertin 1994 5 1 2 groups b and e groundwater salinity according to the lisa analysis the groups of variables b and e only showed low low clusters which were located mainly toward the central part of the basin conversely the double clustering approach showed that both groups had three subgroups g1 g2 and g3 which were dispersed or randomly distributed in the area figs 4b and 4e by comparing figs 4b and 4e it could be observed that the highest levels of variables contained in each group b and e were found in groundwater collected in the northern and southeastern parts of the clr red points otherwise moderate values for each group yellow points were the most abundant and widely distributed throughout the basin both groups b and e are related to the salinity and sodicity of groundwater which may be due to saline aquitards deeper wells groundwater abstraction inverse cation exchange processes high evaporation rates and the weathering of saline rocks overall fig 6 indicates that the high salinity groundwater wells of group e red points with the thickest undersaturated zone thicker than 100 m are located in the viesca aquitard t11 where saline mineralized waters dominate in desert areas b14 and in the city of torreón t24 t25 where the deepest water table levels measured in m a s l in fig 1 promote the abstraction of more mineralized groundwater the other high salinity groundwater wells showing an undersaturated zone thickness between 50 and 100 m are located in the agricultural zones of the principal lagunera region and oriente aganuaval aquifers zones where the irrigation returns and cation exchange processes may increase salinity and sodicity in groundwater since water from the francisco zarco reservoir is mainly used for irrigation wells with a water table lower than 40 m did not show high salinity conditions fig 6 probably due to the reduced water path from the surface to the saturated zone however when the irrigation return flows have to pass through a thicker undersaturated zone of more than 50 m fig 6 to reach the water table the high evaporation rates and the presence of evaporite minerals halite gypsum etc underlying the agricultural lands may lead irrigation returns showing enhanced salinity pulido bosch et al 2018 in this sense several variables involved in groups b and e may be increased by the dissolution of evaporite minerals during the passage of irrigated water through the thicker soil column na li as na surrogate cl so4 2 cu se and re by the use of fertilizers no3 and b in agricultural lands or by the combination of these two processes ec salinity tds with the exception of no3 all these variables including cl were positively correlated with each other at p 0 001 nitrates correlated with na and li at p 0 05 and 0 01 respectively and at p 0 001 with ec salinity tds and so4 2 additional evidence that could suggest the influence of the irrigation return flow in the salinization of groundwater in agricultural areas fig 6 is the distribution of do concentrations in group b table 2 indicates that the concentration of do increased significantly in group b in the order g3 g2 g1 this suggests that the do concentrations in groundwater are the highest in zones impacted by irrigation water returns that is this groundwater is derived from well oxygenated surface water of recent infiltration artificial recharge during irrigation however although these high do concentrations might be interpreted as natural groundwater recharge it is important to note the low precipitation values in the area 177 mm y and that recharge areas are located in the mountainous sector and not in the alluvial aquifer additionally although the enrichment of heavy water isotopes in groundwater may indicate the influence of the evaporation rates on the irrigation returns the craig diagram fig 7 showed that the values of the water isotopes δ18o and δ2h in all samples of group e where the salinity was clustered followed a linear evaporation trend that fell below the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl rozanski et al 1993 aguilar ramírez et al 2017 indicating no significant differences among subgroups probably due to the δ18o and δ2h precision values fig 8 a shows a similar increasing trend for na and cl concentrations in groundwater of the clr which can be explained by halite dissolution during groundwater flow or during irrigated water infiltration nevertheless there is a clear deviation of na and cl concentrations from the halite equiline indicating that other processes such as albite dissolution na silicate and or inverse cation exchange dissolved ca is substituted for na in the aquifer matrix may increase the na concentrations over cl levels in fact fig 8b indicates lower values of ca and mg with regard to hco3 and so4 2 concentrations suggesting that the inverse cation exchange processes may account for the na increase in groundwater figs 8c 8d 8e and 8f depict the binary diagrams used to distinguish waters interacting with carbonate silicates and evaporite rocks gaillardet et al 1999 figs 8c and 8d show how groundwater with the highest concentrations of na red points representing g3 of group b and high salinity groundwater of group e red points representing g3 of group e display ca na and hco3 na molar ratios even lower than those of the evaporite endmember whereas the moderate values of both groups yellow points of groups b and f lie in the evaporite silicate carbonate mixing this demonstrates that the groundwater collected at these sampling sites red points has enhanced na concentrations compared to the other ions indeed this fact may be triggered by the inverse cation exchange processes which increase the na concentrations in groundwater and change its geochemical signature acquired during rock weathering regarding the behavior of re se and cu in the double clustering results it was observed that the concentrations of these elements increased significantly in each subgroup g3 g2 g1 for cu in group b and g3 g2 g1 for se and re in group e moreover these elements showed a highly significant positive correlation with so4 2 r 0 52 for cu r 0 78 for re r 0 66 for se p 0 001 this behavior lies in the fact that these three elements are strongly chalcophilic sarah jane 2016 for example re tends to be enriched in sulfide deposits such as pyrite pentlandite pyrrhotite and copper iron sulfide chalcopyrite moilanen et al 2021 otherwise se can be naturally enriched in pyrite tian et al 2020 as well as in sulfate minerals such as gypsum mainly due to the oxyanions selenite seo3 2 and selenate seo4 2 substitute so4 2 in the gypsum structure lin et al 2020 although the saturation index of gypsum and anhydrite increased with increasing tds concentrations all the groundwater samples of clr were undersaturated with respect to both phases supplementary information fig f2 suggesting a continuous process of sulfate dissolution during the infiltration of irrigation water or during the groundwater flow path hence the elements cu se and re are mobilized with so4 2 to groundwater because of the oxidation of sulfides such as the pyrite oxidation process and weathering of sulfate evaporites gypsum and anhydrite these elements remain in solution even in highly oxygenated waters because some oxidized forms of se selenate seo4 2 and re perrhenate oxyanion reo4 are highly soluble in oxidizing waters hodge et al 1996 kumar and riyazuddin 2011 it is noteworthy that increased salinization also threatens the quality of groundwater used for human consumption overall ten samples showed so4 2 concentrations higher than the 500 mg l recommended by who 2018 to avoid laxative effects in humans while 33 of samples had no3 n levels higher than the 11 mg l no3 n established by who 2018 to protect bottle fed infants against methemoglobinemia only one sample showed se levels higher than the maximum permissible value 40 μg l reported by who 2018 whereas no samples showed b concentrations above the who guideline value 2 4 mg l in summary the subgroups of variables b and e resulting from the double clustering approach show a random pattern in the clr because the clustering of these subgroups can be influenced by diverse processes such as the presence of highly mineralized groundwater in aquitards and deeper wells the dissolution of evaporite minerals the high evaporative rates and the inverse cation exchange processes indeed the random distribution of these processes in the clr precludes spatial autocorrelations moran s i and specific variable clustering lisa because both spatial analyses depend on the distance between locations sampled wells finally although the mo concentrations were also increased in the same order as those of the other variables in group b table 2 the differences among subgroups were not statistically significant hence the mo content in the clr groundwater does not seem to be affected by the above mentioned processes 5 1 3 groups c and d water rock interaction in the mountainous sectors with the exception of some sites in the northwest the subgroups of groups c and d derived from the double clustering displayed a similar spatial distribution figs 4c and 4d these subgroups showed that the highest concentrations of major and trace elements table 2 were found in the mountainous sectors southeastern part of the basin and the lowest concentrations in the alluvial aquifer this distribution was very similar to that shown by hco3 fig 5d according to the lisa analysis however the other variables of group c ga and ba concentrations showed only hotspots toward the southwestern part of the basin they did not present coldspots toward the alluvial aquifer whereas pb concentrations and the other variables of group d k and zn only showed coldspots toward the alluvial aquifer they did not show hotspots according to the lisa analysis see supplementary information fig f1 overall the subdivisions g1 and g2 of groups c and d may be explained as follows in the mountainous sectors g2 carbonates are intercalated with volcanic rocks and the elevated concentrations of hco3 ca and mg in groundwater are mainly derived from the weathering of plagioclases contained in andesite and basaltic rocks and the weathering of carbonate minerals found in limestone and dolomite this agrees with the binary diagrams depicted in figs 8e and 8f which indicate that groundwater in this sector g2 of group c had strongly interacted with silicates and carbonates whereas groundwater in the alluvial aquifer had a greater interaction with evaporite rocks additionally these reactions lead that almost all the groundwater samples collected in the whole basin are in equilibrium with respect to calcite and aragonite and oversaturated with respect to dolomite supplementary information fig f2 examples of carbonate and silicate weathering reactions are as follows 1 c a m g c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a m g 2 2 h c o 3 2 c a m g a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o c a m g 2 2 h c o 3 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 similarly the high concentrations of sr and ba in the mountains indicate that silicates and carbonates are also the major sources of these alkali earth elements in this closed basin this is consistent with the observations that both lithologies are important sources of ba and sr in water dalai et al 2002 2003 nevertheless whereas sr displayed highly significant correlations p 0 001 with ca and mg r 0 84 and r 0 87 respectively ba did not correlate with these major elements which suggests that ba may be mainly derived from other silicate sources k feldspars it is noteworthy that a highly significant relationship was found between ba and ga r 0 99 p 0 001 and that the concentrations of both elements together with pb were significantly higher in the groundwater of the mountainous sector than in the alluvial aquifer table 2 this suggests that these three elements ba ga and pb are derived from the host rocks of the mountainous sector mainly from the weathering of k feldspars this is consistent with the fact that k feldspars provide a suitable host for ba and pb in the alkali position and ga in tetrahedral sites oyarzábal et al 2009 in parallel ni and y were significantly enriched in the groundwater of the mountains and both elements showed a highly significant positive correlation r 0 76 p 0 001 this suggests that both elements may be derived from other silicate rocks such as basalts which are abundant in the clr mountains in fact ni is a common trace element in olivine herd et al 2009 whereas y has been found to mobilize during the weathering of some basalts cotten et al 1995 hill et al 2000 fig 4d indicates that the heaviest alkali elements k rb and cs are in highest abundance in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors owing to the scarcity of k in carbonate minerals groundwater k may be mainly derived from the dissolution of k feldspar which is mainly contained in rhyolites during this weathering process the other heavy alkali elements rb and cs may be concomitantly mobilized with k because some k feldspars provide a suitable host for these trace elements in the alkali position oyarzábal et al 2009 thus this may be responsible for the highly significant positive correlations found between rb and cs with k r 0 83 for rb and r 0 53 for cs p 0 001 as expected the u concentrations in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors were statistically higher than those in the alluvial aquifer additionally u showed a positive correlation with hco3 which may be explained as follows it is well known that soluble uvi has a strong affinity for carbonates owing to the formation of stable aqueous uranyl carbonates uo2 co3 3 4 cauo2 co3 3 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 which prevent the adsorption of u onto surfaces such as fe oxyhydroxides and maintain u mobility in groundwater cumberland et al 2016 swift bird et al 2020 even under anoxic conditions immobile uiv may be oxidized into aqueous uvi carbonate species via carbonate promoted oxidative dissolution seder colomina et al 2018 therefore the greater levels of u in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors may be due to the high concentrations of dissolved hco3 and ca which enhance the mobility of u because of the formation of uvi carbonate complexes even in reducing groundwater indeed this has led to three groundwater samples collected in this sector with u levels higher than the maximum levels of 30 μg l proposed by the who 2018 consistently the low levels of both ca2 and hco3 in the alluvial aquifer should limit the formation of such uvi carbonate complexes promoting the sequestration of u onto fe oxyhydroxides 5 1 4 group f ti as surrogate of si in quartz group f defined by the double clustering approach comprised the elements si and ti and the parameter orp because si and ti are not redox sensitive their concentrations are not affected by the redox potential of groundwater this may be confirmed by the absence of correlations between the orp and si and ti on the other hand si was highly correlated with ti r 0 90 p 0 001 suggesting similar sources group f was subdivided into two subgroups of cases where the concentrations of si and ti were significantly higher in the subgroup g2 than those in the subgroup g1 indeed the highest si and ti concentrations g2 in fig 4f were found in the alluvial aquifer and wells located in small alluvial deposits of the nazas aquifer where the weathering of alluvial material containing coarse medium sand fractions plays a determinant role in the elevated abundance of dissolved si and ti in groundwater this is because ti is a surrogate of si in quartz and both elements tend to be released by the breakdown of polymineralic grains containing phases such as quartz rich in these elements during the weathering process johnsson et al 1991 finally despite the double clustering approach showed two well defined subgroups no variables of this group si ti and orp showed significant moran s i values whereas the lisa analysis did not present spatial clusters supplementary information fig f1 6 conclusions the double clustering approach applied to the dataset of major and minor constituents of groundwater in the clr has been shown to be a powerful tool for identifying spatial areas where different lithogenic and anthropogenic processes or a combination of both can control the abundance of major ions metalloids and trace elements in general this easy to apply approach can visualize dispersed or randomized small zones where processes such as salinization may affect the quality of groundwater although moran s i and lisa are powerful statistical techniques for clustering locations with high or low values of a specific variable they present a strong limitation when the hotspots of several elements or variables are dispersedly distributed in a large area because large distances avoid spatial autocorrelations and spatial associations in contrast when the lithogenic and or anthropogenic processes are restricted to a specific area such as the release of high as levels in the alluvial aquifer the double clustering approach and the moran s i and lisa analysis provide consistent results indicating the zones or areas where hotspots are located in general this integrated and multi statistical analysis double clustering allowed the delineation of the major processes affecting groundwater quality throughout the clr which can be considered as representative of hotspots for groundwater management in this important region of mexico additionally this study illustrates the advantage of analyzing valorizing complex hydrochemical datasets using the double clustering approach to highlight the natural and human induced processes that potentially threaten human health one of the most important limitations of using the double clustering approach is that the method delineates hotspots relative to a general system that includes several variables whereas other spatial statistics delineate hotspots of a single variable this may provide high uncertainties in the resulting hotspots for several variables included in the general system therefore it is important to complement the double clustering approach with indicators of spatial association for one variable such as the lisa analysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

16614,this study aimed to determine the reliability of the double clustering method to understand the spatial association and distribution of major and minor constituents in the groundwater of an arid endorheic basin in central mexico comarca lagunera region the results of the double clustering approach were compared with well known spatial statistics such as spatial autocorrelations moran index and the local indicator of spatial association lisa fifty five groundwater samples were collected from diverse wells within the basin and the major ions metalloids and trace elements were determined overall the double clustering analysis was an effective tool for identifying lithogenic anthropogenic processes occurring in the basin and for establishing zones with high or low abundance of major ions and trace elements even where processes affecting the groundwater quality were spatially dispersed although 89 of the samples showed as higher than the threshold value of 10 μg l proposed by the world health organization for drinking water both the double clustering and lisa analyses identified as hotspots in the alluvial aquifer where the extraction of deeper and warmer groundwater might promote the concomitant release of the metalloids as sb and ge and the trace elements v and w similarly both statistical analyses identified mountainous sectors where the weathering of silicates and carbonates plays a key role in the abundance of hco3 ga and ba however the lisa analysis failed to identify hotspots of carbonate derived elements such as ca mg sr and u and silicate derived elements such as ca mg k sr rb cs pb ni and y otherwise the double clustering analysis clearly defined high and low concentration zones for all these elements in the study region unlike the lisa analysis the double clustering approach was also successful in determining alluvial areas with high concentrations of si and ti and areas where the concentrations of na cl so4 2 no3 b li cu re and se in groundwater were elevated increasing the groundwater salinity overall this study demonstrated that the double clustering is an easy to apply approach capable of visualizing disperse zones where specific anthropogenic processes may threaten the groundwater quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords double clustering lisa metalloids salinity groundwater 1 introduction groundwater availability in arid and semiarid regions has received increased attention because of the rising pressure on aquifers as a reliable source of water for urban industrial and agricultural consumption ghazavi et al 2018 kourakos et al 2019 in these warm climate areas groundwater becomes more sensitive to prolonged droughts and anthropogenic activities which results in groundwater storage depletion and water quality deterioration ali et al 2019 benfetta and ouadja 2020 in several arid and semi arid regions worldwide the decreasing level of fresh groundwater due to the overexploitation of aquifer systems has triggered a decline in its chemical quality posing a health threat to millions of people who use this water for domestic and irrigation purposes various studies have revealed that aquifer dewatering in warm regions leads to high groundwater mineralization el alfy et al 2018 singhal et al 2020 and increasing concentrations of f as mo cd and other trace elements kuiper et al 2015 khan et al 2016 knappett et al 2018 2020 mora et al 2020 however these trends depend on a wide range of processes such as the degree of aquifer drawdown aquifer recharge rates regional geology and the interaction of fresh groundwater with brackish water among others making it difficult to manage the risks to human health barbieri et al 2019 ricolfi et al 2020 the structure status and processes of the groundwater system which can only be assessed through scientific research are critical aspects of water resource management in this regard hydrogeochemical data provide essential tools to support water resource management barbieri 2019 because both essential and non essential trace elements can be toxic at elevated concentrations in drinking water calderon 2000 the mapping of their abundances in aquifers is critical for identifying trace element hotspots and areas where groundwater quality may represent a threat to humans this approach may be useful for the development of aquifer management strategies to remediate and or exclude groundwater wells located in vulnerable areas bhowmik et al 2015 raju et al 2019 from this perspective spatial statistical methods applied in geographical sciences such as the moran index moran s i and the local indicator of spatial association lisa anselin 1995 have been successfully used in geochemistry and environmental sciences to find spatial autocorrelations and determine areas that are susceptible to lithogenic and or anthropogenic contamination zhang et al 2008 specifically both statistical methods have been used recently to determine spatial as hotspots in the groundwater of ireland mcgrory et al 2017 and to assess the spatial dependence of as and other trace elements in the shallow groundwater of the bolivian altiplano quino lima et al 2020 in the same way multivariate statistical techniques such as factor analysis accompanied by hierarchical cluster analysis hca have been used to detect the sources of trace elements and groundwater pollution in several areas worldwide chen et al 2007 kazakis et al 2017 wu et al 2020 kumar 2020 however this strategy can mask the geochemical or anthropogenic processes occurring in a specific zone owing to the effect of cumulative processes through the dissolution and mobility of certain elements therefore identifying the spatial patterns exhibited by the data and recognizing the different processes controlling both major and minor element abundances may be challenging to address this issue the application of hca to the groups of clusters obtained from the first clustering double clustering approach can be very effective in identifying certain structures of causality making the interpretation of the results more reliable matuszewski 2002 although this method is easy to apply to large datasets it has not been proven either in geochemical prospecting or in environmental sciences in order to elucidate critical zones for groundwater related human health threats the arid and semi arid region of north central mexico has a long history of lithogenic groundwater pollution due to the presence of elevated levels of as and f in bedrock which is related to cenozoic volcanism alarcón herrera et al 2020 the comarca lagunera region clr located in north central mexico is one of the most populated areas of the country with lithogenic groundwater pollution the growing livestock industrial mining and agricultural activities in the clr drive prosperous economic growth nevertheless because of the arid climate surface water is scarce and groundwater has become a vital resource for urban industrial and agricultural supply in addition the growing water demand has led to overexploitation of aquifers and the use of non traditional deeper groundwater although a recent study has found high levels of nitrates derived from agricultural livestock activities in the shallow groundwater of this area torres martínez et al 2021 arsenic is the main contaminant of concern in both deep and shallow groundwater this metalloid has exhibited a broad range of concentrations which have varied from 7μg l to 740 μg l in wells del razo et al 1990 rosas et al 1999 to up to 5000 μg l in aquitards ortega guerrero 2017 this has led to the incorporation of as removal systems removal of as 5 by coagulation with ferric chloride in wells operated by the national water authority and the local water sanitation service these filter systems reduce the as in water to levels below those established 25 μg l as the mexican drinking water standard nom 127 ssa1 2017 dof 2019 however many privately drilled wells do not benefit from these filters although several studies have addressed the processes controlling the content of inorganic as species and the associated risk assessment in the groundwater of the clr del razo et al 1990 mejía gonzález et al 2014 there is a lack of concurrent evaluation of other potentially toxic elements that may also present a risk to human health thus the objectives of this study are i to map the salinity and trace element levels in the groundwater of the clr using a double clustering procedure and well known spatial statistics moran s i and lisa ii to compare the use of these statistical approaches in order to check similarities and differences in their results and iii to evaluate the concentrations of major ions and trace elements in order to detect any threat to human health in general this study focused on the use of a simple and easy statistical approach double clustering to obtain the spatial variability of major ions metalloids and trace elements in the groundwater of a closed basin determining which lithogenic or anthropogenic processes might be inferred in those areas where elevated levels of salinity and trace elements occur additionally to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a double clustering approach is used to assess the spatial distribution of major ions and trace elements in a groundwater system the results of this work could help decision makers involved in regional water quality management to delineate safe areas and areas vulnerable to toxic elements to enable the expansion of groundwater use 2 study area 2 1 general settings the clr fig 1 is enclosed by the physiographical sub provinces laguna de mayrán and bolsón de mapimí and covers an area of 44 800 km2 the area includes part of the endorheic basins of the nazas and aguanaval rivers these rivers have been dammed to create the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco reservoirs which supply water to meet urban and irrigation demands before damming both rivers supplied water to 13 natural lakes among them is the laguna de mayrán the largest in latin america however the combination of river damming and arid conditions dried up all the lakes resulting in one of the worst ecological disasters in mexico the clr climate is semi arid to arid with mean temperatures between 8 c and 22 c in winter and between 23 c and 36 c in summer the average annual precipitation is 177 mm with maximum values in september 40 5 mm and minimums in february 2 9 mm the population of almost 1 6 million people is centered mainly in the metropolitan areas of torreón gomez palacio and lerdo agricultural and livestock activities are intensive in the clr including one of the most important dairy industries in mexico livestock breeding includes poultry and cattle for milk and meat production agricultural lands are mainly fertilized with manure from livestock activities to produce crops such as alfalfa corn sorghum cotton sugar and watermelon 2 2 geology hydrogeology and hydrochemistry the clr is located in the sierra madre oriental range a long mountain belt extending from the trans mexican volcanic belt to the usa mexican border which resulted from the deformation of mesozoic sedimentary rocks and a complex basement that includes neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks paleozoic schist and sedimentary rocks and upper triassic lower jurassic red beds velasco tapia et al 2016 the study area includes mountains located in the upper nazas and aguanaval basins n sw direction and an alluvial plain sw ne orientation fig 1a six administrative aquifers nazas vicente suárez villa juárez oriente aguanaval pedriceña velardreña and principal lagunera region supply water to the clr fig 1c these aquifers are interconnected conforming to one integrated system that flowed from the mountains to the ancient lakes of this endorheic basin from sw to ne direction however due to groundwater overexploitation in the principal lagunera region aquifer alluvial aquifer there has been considerable hydrological changes in the groundwater flow fig 1a in other words the cones of depression caused by intensive pumping have reversed the groundwater flow from the dry ancient lakes ne to the sw direction ortega guerrero et al 2017 fig 1a shows that the groundwater system comprises two principal areas each with different hydrogeological characteristics the main system is dominated by intercalations between carbonate rocks marls limestone and dolomites volcanic siliciclastic rocks granite rhyolite andesite and basalt shales sandstones and conglomerates conagua 1999 these extend from the surrounding mountains to the bottom of an unconfined granular aquifer that constitutes the second system which consists of clastic material composed of intercalated layers of gravel sand silt and clay resulting from the erosion of the surrounding mountains and transported by the nazas and aguanaval rivers fig 1 this porous aquifer has a varied granulometry showing an increasing thickness from 50 m near the mountains to more than 1000 m in the lowlands conagua 1999 additionally there are lacustrine clayey rich aquitards toward the northeastern part of this closed basin where the viesca mayran and other ancient lakes developed ortega guerrero 2017 although the alluvial aquifer is scarcely recharged by rainfall infiltration artificial recharge by the irrigation return flow may occur in some agricultural areas given that these lands are irrigated with surface waters from the lázaro cárdenas and francisco zarco reservoirs hydrochemical studies have confirmed the presence of highly mineralized groundwater in the clr with an average total dissolved solids tds of 1180 933 mg l so4 2 and ca2 dominate the ionic composition due to the progressive dissolution of carbonates gypsum and the oxidation of pyrite brouste et al 1997 nevertheless large spatial variability of chemical facies occurs due to the variable lithology and high evaporation brouste et al 1997 additionally the groundwater of the viesca aquitard shows saline mineralization conditions with tds concentrations between 97 000 and 148 000 mg l and as concentrations of up to 5 mg l ortega guerrero 2017 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling fifty five wells that supplied water for irrigation and human consumption in the clr were sampled in november 2018 fig 1a the production wells located in the mountainous area upper basin have depths that vary from 75 to 150 m dof 2015 whereas the wells located in the alluvial aquifer limited by the urban area are between 125 and 500 m deep garcía salazar and mora flores 2008 in the lower basin the wells range from 150 to 300 m deep rivas sada 2011 at the time of sampling the wells operated by the local water service were working under normal conditions in wells that had as removal systems the water samples were collected before these systems in private wells the pumps were switched on and the water was run until the electrical conductivity ec values stabilized only then was the water measured and sampled the ph temperature salinity oxidation reduction potential orp ec and dissolved oxygen do concentrations in water were measured in the field using pre calibrated electrodes the water samples were collected in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles and filtered on site using 0 45 μm pore size membranes the filtered samples were placed in two pre washed and pre rinsed 250 ml sampling kits for anion analysis and for major cation and trace element analysis the samples for major cation and trace element analysis were acidified with ultrapure hno3 in addition 50 ml of unfiltered samples were collected for the analysis of water stable isotopes bicarbonates were measured in the field by titration using h2so4 0 02 n until the ph reached 4 3 all samples were stored at 4 c until further analysis 3 2 laboratory analysis major ions and trace elements were analyzed by activation laboratories ltd ancaster canada major cations na k ca2 and mg2 were measured using an agilent axial icp oes system whereas anions cl f so4 2 and no3 were analyzed with ion chromatography using a dionex dx 120 instrument the concentrations of trace alkali and alkali earth elements li rb cs sr and ba transition elements ti v cr mn fe ni cu zn y mo w and re metalloids b si ge as and sb and other trace elements ga pb se tl and u were determined using a perkin elmer sciex elan 9000 icp ms equipment in ultra low mode nitrites no2 and other trace elements such as ag al be bi cd co hg in nb sc sn ta te and zr were also measured however in almost all the samples the concentrations were lower than the detection limit dl of the analytical technique and thus were not considered in this study during all determinations blanks and primary standard solutions were run to perform quality control of the analysis and verify the precision and calibration of the equipment the accuracy of the icp ms measurements was checked using the standard iv stock 1643 trace elements in water overall the relative difference between the measured and certified values of the standard ranged between 0 4 and 16 2 the dl for each element and the relative difference between the certified and measured values of the standard iv stock 1643 are included in supplementary information table s1 seven sample results for fe two sample results for pb mn cr and nitrates and one sample result for tl and f were lower than the dl of the analytical method these values were expressed as dl 2 for statistical analysis the ionic charge balance ranged between 0 05 and 20 only five samples with high b concentrations showed values higher than 15 with an average value of 4 8 stable water isotope analysis was performed at the environmental isotope laboratory of the university of waterloo canada using a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia los gatos research inc following the method described by berman et al 2013 water standards calibrated to the reference materials vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow and vienna standard light antarctic precipitation vslap were used to check the quality of the analytical procedure the results were expressed as δ values by representing the deviations in per mil from the vsmow standard the precision varied from 0 04 to 1 2 and from 0 04 to 0 66 for δ18o h2o and δ2h h2o analyses respectively 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 spearman s rank correlation coefficient and saturation index the non parametric spearman analysis was used to determine significant correlations between the physicochemical parameters major ions metalloids and trace elements in groundwater samples three levels of significance were considered p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 the saturation index for some mineral phases in groundwater was calculated using the phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 uncertainties for each mineral phase were also included in the saturation index plots langmuir and melchior 1985 nordstrom and ball 1989 plummer et al 1990 mclaughlin et al 2013 3 3 2 double clustering analysis hca has been widely used in both surface and groundwater systems to differentiate and or link water samples with different or similar characteristics at several hierarchical levels egbueri 2020 gyimah et al 2020 although this method seems to be suitable for characterizing a particular system it does not directly indicate which parameters are responsible for the grouping of samples in a determined region or zone this overlaps the effects that chemical and physical variables exert on ions and elements making it difficult to identify the real processes controlling the abundance of trace elements in a particular region therefore it is convenient to first group the associated variables that control the levels of certain elements in groundwater through an hca of variables and then apply a subsequent hca of cases using only the data of each group of variables defined in the first hca double clustering approach in our study we first carried out an hca using all the data for clustering variables this analysis generated six groups of variables then we applied the hca of cases clustering cases in all six groups of variables defined in the first step in order to elucidate how the magnitude of these variables including trace elements changes spatially this allowed the generation of a map that describes the magnitude of these variables in the aquifer system overall the first clustering groups variables associated to lithogenic anthropogenic processes occurring in the system whereas the second clustering indicates where these processes occur all hca were performed based on euclidean distance and ward s method before applying hca to the data these were log transformed and standardized z score in order to provide equal weight to all variables and approximate normality güler et al 2002 3 3 3 kruskal wallis analysis once the groups of cases subgroups for each group of variables were defined by the double clustering approach the nonparametric kruskal wallis analysis was applied to determine whether there were significant differences among these subgroups differences were considered significant at p 0 05 3 3 4 mapping construction according to the information generated from the double clustering approach six study area maps were constructed one map for each group of variables depicting the spatial distribution of each subgroup of cases sampled wells and the average values of variables contained in each subgroup the clr maps were built using arcgis 10 8 software 3 3 5 spatial autocorrelations moran s i and local indicator of spatial association lisa in addition to the double clustering approach the local moran s i and lisa analysis were carried out to verify the spatial autocorrelations of variables and identify local clusters respectively of major ions metalloids and trace elements in the study area anselin 1995 1996 in brief moran s i is a way to verify the spatial autocorrelation of major and minor constituents of groundwater in a determined area this is based on the location of the sampling wells and therefore the distance between them and the concentration values of the tested variables when moran s i is positive the sampling wells have similarly high or low values of a particular variable as their neighbor wells and thus they are considered spatial clusters on the other hand negative values of moran s i indicate that the spatial distribution is scattered so the wells are considered as single localities or spatial outliers anselin 2005 zhang et al 2008 as a complementary analysis to moran s i lisa categorizes the spatial clusters as high high high values in a high value neighborhood and low low low values in a low value neighborhood spatial outliers are classified as high low and low high high values in a low value neighborhood and vice versa whereas the rest of the wells are not significant groups according to lisa zhang et al 2008 mcgrory et al 2017 in our study the total number of neighbors were 55 sampled wells the percentage of these wells forming high high hotspots and low low coldspots clusters for each variable is shown in the following section overall the lisa analysis aimed to compare the local lisa clusters of variables with the subgroups generated through the double clustering approach the z score and the p value were obtained from moran s i to assess the level of significance spatial autocorrelations were considered significant for positive moran s i and p 0 05 both moran s i and lisa statistics were developed using geoda software 1 18 0 anselin et al 2006 4 results table 1 shows the minimum maximum and average values of major ion and trace element concentrations in the groundwater of the clr the complete dataset of both major ions and trace elements together with the location name altitude thickness of the vadose zone level of the water table and the utm coordinates of the sampled wells are included in supplementary information table s2 the groundwater ph varied between slightly acidic 6 00 and moderately alkaline 8 64 the water temperature ranged from 20 7 to 34 3 c and the do concentrations ranged between 1 01 and 7 31 mg l the ec and tds concentrations showed variations up to 20 fold with minimums of 332 μs cm and 190 mg l and maximums of 5957 μs cm and 3894 mg l respectively whereas 63 of the samples showed tds concentrations higher than 500 mg l the dissolved si concentrations not shown in table 1 ranged from 10 9 to 34 3 mg l with an average concentration of 20 1 mg l the waters were between calcic sulfated and bicarbonated although some samples showed na as the major cation the concentrations of several elements such as b ge rb ti and si presented limited spatial variation between 3 and 28 fold variation whereas the trace elements w tl sr and mn displayed variations of up to three and four orders of magnitude arsenic concentrations varied between 5 and 349 μg l thus 89 of the groundwater samples showed values above the safe limit of 10 μg l established by the world health organization who 2018 for drinking water this demonstrates the lithogenic enrichment of as in groundwater of the whole region due to the natural as enrichment in volcanic silicate rocks alarcón herrera et al 2020 4 1 double clustering approach fig 2 depicts the resulting dendrogram of the hca of the variables first hca applied to the entire dataset the phenon line delimits six groups of variables with a linkage distance of approximately 16 group a includes the variables ph temperature f the metalloids as ge and sb and the trace elements mn v and w group b contains do and mo b li cu and na group c includes hco3 and the trace elements ga ba pb and cr group d includes k the alkali earth ions ca2 mg2 and sr2 and the trace elements ni zn rb y u fe ta and cs whereas group e comprises the major anions cl so4 2 and no3 salinity ec and tds and the trace elements re and se finally group f only contains dissolved si ti and the parameter orp fig 3 shows the dendrograms of the hca of the cases applied to each group of variables in these dendrograms the phenon lines were chosen so that the differences between the subgroups of extracted clusters were pronounced table 2 indicates the average of each variable together with the respective standard deviation in each subgroup of cases and specifies whether there were significant differences between subgroups for each selected variable according to the kruskal wallis analysis group a showed two subgroups of cases fig 3a which displayed significant differences for all variables except for f group b presented three subgroups of cases fig 3b which showed significant differences for all variables except for mo and cu group c showed two subgroups fig 3c presenting significant differences for all variables similarly group d displayed two subgroups of cases fig 3d however the variables fe and tl did not show significant differences between these two subgroups group e displayed three subgroups fig 3e which were significantly different for all variables finally group f displayed two subgroups of cases fig 3f in this group there were significant differences in ti and si between subgroups whereas the difference in orp values was not significant between the two subgroups fig 4 depicts six maps regarding to each group of variables these maps show the sites and the zones with the highest values of physicochemical parameters major ions metalloids and trace elements according to the results of the double clustering approach the red color indicates the subgroups and the area with the highest values of the above mentioned variables the yellow color indicates moderate values whereas the blue color indicates the subgroups and areas with the lowest values the criteria for defining these high moderate and low values were the average values of each subgroup for each variable which are presented in table 2 4 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis and lisa statistic table 3 shows the results of the moran s i and lisa statistic applied to each measured variable in the groundwater of the clr whereas fig 5 depicts the results of the lisa analysis applied to the variables of most environmental or health interests of each case group as and ge for group a na for group b hco3 for group c k for group d and salinity for group e the variables of group f were not plotted because they did not show significant moran s i values the results of the lisa analysis that were applied to the rest of the variables are presented in supplementary information fig f1 regarding group a of variables defined by the hca the temperature and the concentrations of the elements as ge and w showed positive and significant moran s i values suggesting the presence of spatial clusters in the clr the lisa analysis indicated that the hotspots high high clusters of as concentrations 12 7 of total samples were located toward the northern part of the principal lagunera region aquifer fig 5a this agrees with the map generated by the double clustering approach fig 4a which indicates that the highest concentrations of as ge sb v and w were located in the northern part of this aquifer in fact all the locations considered as as hotspots according to the lisa analysis lie in subgroup g2 of group a the subgroup presenting the highest concentrations similarly fig 5b shows that the hotspots of ge concentrations 25 5 of total samples were also located toward the north of the alluvial aquifer which agrees with fig 4a 71 of samples representing the ge hotspots are included in g2 of group a of variables overall the low low clusters coldspots of as and ge representing 12 7 and 16 4 of the total samples respectively are located in the southwestern part of the basin figs 5a and 5b as mentioned earlier the high low and low high wells 1 8 and 16 4 for as and 3 6 and 9 1 for ge respectively are considered outliers whereas the rest of the wells 54 5 and 46 6 for as and ge respectively were not significant according to the lisa statistic regarding the other variables of group a showing significant moran s i values w and temperature both showed hotspots high high clusters toward the north of the alluvial aquifer and coldspots toward the southwestern part of the basin such as as and ge supplementary information fig f1 variables of group b had a small percentage of high high clusters table 3 therefore their significant moran s i values were mainly related to the greater density of low low clusters fig 5c located toward the center of the basin in the case of na and b concentrations with 40 and 45 5 of the total samples toward the alluvial aquifer in the case of li and cu with 63 6 and 58 2 of the total samples and in minor proportion toward the southwestern part of the basin in the case of mo with 21 8 of total samples see supplementary information fig f1 regarding group c fig 5d shows that the high high clusters of hco3 are located toward the southwestern part of the basin mountainous sector whereas a high proportion of low low clustered wells are found in the alluvial aquifer a similar distribution of high and low concentrations of hco3 was also obtained for the variables of group c through the double clustering approach fig 4c the same high high cluster distribution also applies to ga and ba supplementary information fig f1 however according to the lisa analysis the majority of wells located in the alluvial aquifer 69 1 and 70 9 of the total samples for ga and ba respectively were not significant for ga and ba because pb concentrations only present 1 8 of the total samples as hotspots table 3 the significant moran s i was mainly due to the low low clusters or coldspots 38 2 of the total samples moreover the low low cluster pattern for pb was comparable to that of hco3 supplementary information fig f1 although the general pattern of pb was nearly similar to that of k concentrations fig 5e an element of group d therefore this similar spatial distribution for pb and k may suggest a similar source which is discussed in the next section except for zn concentrations the rest of the variables in group d showed no significant values of moran s i finally the variables of group e that displayed a significant moran s i ec salinity tds and so4 2 concentrations exhibited a similar pattern according to the lisa results low percentages of samples showing high high clusters and moderate percentages of samples showing low low clusters table 3 in general these low low clusters were located in the central part of the basin as shown in fig 5f for salinity 5 discussion 5 1 spatial distribution and occurrence of major ions and trace elements in groundwater based on the double clustering approach and the lisa statistic 5 1 1 group a metalloids mobility in the overexploited alluvial aquifer as demonstrated above both lisa and double clustering analyses indicate as hotspots in groundwater of the aquifer principal lagunera region which agrees with other studies ortega guerrero 2017 although the lisa analysis presented hotspots for a specific variable arsenic in this case the double clustering approach allows delineating a hotspot relative to the general system comprising several variables in this case the delineated hotspot is included in a general hotspot featuring a high frequency of high temperature ph as ge sb v w and mn the significantly higher values of these variables in the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer table 2 and the positive correlations of as with temperature r 0 45 p 0 001 ph r 0 33 p 0 05 sb r 0 47 p 0 001 ge r 0 39 p 0 01 v r 0 62 p 0 001 and w r 0 66 p 0 001 across the whole basin may suggest that the high as levels may be related to deeper groundwater abstraction where this metalloid is probably mobilized with the metalloids sb and ge and with the elements v and w in this sense several hypotheses regarding the origin of as in the groundwater of the alluvial aquifer are discussed studies performed in sediments of a drilled deep well 400 m deep in the alluvial aquifer have shown particles of fe oxides carrying as mejía et al 2018 this metalloid might be accumulated absorbed into fe oxyhydroxides due to the continuous episodes of transport and accumulation of weathering products of as enriched high silica volcanic rocks in these alluvial deposits alarcón herrera et al 2020 as mentioned earlier the alluvial aquifer has been subjected to considerable overexploitation to the extent that deeper wells 125 500 m deep have been drilled and equipped with slotted pipes promoting the mixture of cold groundwater with deeper and warmer groundwater this pumping induced mixing with warmer groundwater leads to alkaline waters due to hydrolysis of silicate minerals knappett et al 2020 where this rising ph changes the charged binding sites of the fe oxides from positive to negative releasing oxyanions such as as to pore waters however other hypotheses such as the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides containing as mejía et al 2018 and higher as concentrations in deeper aquifer layers may also be considered as potential factors inducing the dissemination of as in this alluvial aquifer another important fact regarding group a defined by the double clustering approach is the possible co mobilization of as sb ge v and w in groundwater of the alluvial aquifer several studies have found that as and sb are concomitantly mobilized in groundwater due to processes such as reductive dissolution of amorphous hydrous fe oxides where as and sb are adsorbed the weathering of arsenopyrites and stibnite and the re adsorption of both metalloids onto fe oxyhydroxides kelepertsis et al 2006 vega et al 2020 quino lima et al 2020 the transition element v has also been shown to co occur with as and sb in groundwater because like as and sb both viv and vv species can be adsorbed onto mn and fe oxides and clays and then desorbed by reductive dissolution of these oxides vega et al 2020 similarly w has shown a strong tendency to be adsorbed onto fe and al oxyhydroxides as well as some clays such as smectite and kaolinite neiva et al 2019 therefore these references together with the results of the double clustering analysis and the significant positive correlations found between these elements suggest the concomitant mobilization of as sb ge v and w by the desorption dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides however more evidence is needed before a definitive conclusion can be reached numerous studies have pointed out the co occurrence of as and f in groundwater in arid and semi arid zones of mexico alarcón herrera et al 2020 in our study 22 of the sampled wells also had f concentrations exceeding the limit of 1 5 mg l proposed by who 2018 for safe drinking water additionally although a positive correlation between as and f r 0 41 p 0 01 was found the difference in f concentrations between subgroups g1 and g2 was not statistically significant a possible explanation for this may be as follows several studies performed in volcanic regions of central mexico have indicated that the co occurrence of as with f in groundwater is due to the weathering of silicate rocks by hot water which produces an increase in ph and the desorption of as from fe oxyhydroxides knappett et al 2020 this silicate weathering results in the formation of clays enhancing the abundance of cation exchange sites where dissolved ca2 is interchanged with na this depletion of dissolved ca promotes the dissolution of the slightly undersaturated fluorite which further increases the concentration of dissolved f favoring the co occurrence of as and f in contrast to these studies the groundwater of the clr is strongly undersaturated with respect to fluorite and slightly saturated with respect to calcite and aragonite supplementary information fig f2 hence a depletion in the content of dissolved ca in groundwater due to the above mentioned cation exchange process may be rapidly buffered either by calcite or fluorite dissolution restricting the concomitant release of as and f although mn concentrations were higher in the alluvial aquifer this element was correlated with neither as the more abundant metalloid nor v thus there is no conclusive evidence about the behavior of this element in groundwater of the clr in general mn mobility in groundwater is more associated to ph changes and redox processes which may be chemically or biologically mediated hamer et al 2020 bourg and bertin 1994 5 1 2 groups b and e groundwater salinity according to the lisa analysis the groups of variables b and e only showed low low clusters which were located mainly toward the central part of the basin conversely the double clustering approach showed that both groups had three subgroups g1 g2 and g3 which were dispersed or randomly distributed in the area figs 4b and 4e by comparing figs 4b and 4e it could be observed that the highest levels of variables contained in each group b and e were found in groundwater collected in the northern and southeastern parts of the clr red points otherwise moderate values for each group yellow points were the most abundant and widely distributed throughout the basin both groups b and e are related to the salinity and sodicity of groundwater which may be due to saline aquitards deeper wells groundwater abstraction inverse cation exchange processes high evaporation rates and the weathering of saline rocks overall fig 6 indicates that the high salinity groundwater wells of group e red points with the thickest undersaturated zone thicker than 100 m are located in the viesca aquitard t11 where saline mineralized waters dominate in desert areas b14 and in the city of torreón t24 t25 where the deepest water table levels measured in m a s l in fig 1 promote the abstraction of more mineralized groundwater the other high salinity groundwater wells showing an undersaturated zone thickness between 50 and 100 m are located in the agricultural zones of the principal lagunera region and oriente aganuaval aquifers zones where the irrigation returns and cation exchange processes may increase salinity and sodicity in groundwater since water from the francisco zarco reservoir is mainly used for irrigation wells with a water table lower than 40 m did not show high salinity conditions fig 6 probably due to the reduced water path from the surface to the saturated zone however when the irrigation return flows have to pass through a thicker undersaturated zone of more than 50 m fig 6 to reach the water table the high evaporation rates and the presence of evaporite minerals halite gypsum etc underlying the agricultural lands may lead irrigation returns showing enhanced salinity pulido bosch et al 2018 in this sense several variables involved in groups b and e may be increased by the dissolution of evaporite minerals during the passage of irrigated water through the thicker soil column na li as na surrogate cl so4 2 cu se and re by the use of fertilizers no3 and b in agricultural lands or by the combination of these two processes ec salinity tds with the exception of no3 all these variables including cl were positively correlated with each other at p 0 001 nitrates correlated with na and li at p 0 05 and 0 01 respectively and at p 0 001 with ec salinity tds and so4 2 additional evidence that could suggest the influence of the irrigation return flow in the salinization of groundwater in agricultural areas fig 6 is the distribution of do concentrations in group b table 2 indicates that the concentration of do increased significantly in group b in the order g3 g2 g1 this suggests that the do concentrations in groundwater are the highest in zones impacted by irrigation water returns that is this groundwater is derived from well oxygenated surface water of recent infiltration artificial recharge during irrigation however although these high do concentrations might be interpreted as natural groundwater recharge it is important to note the low precipitation values in the area 177 mm y and that recharge areas are located in the mountainous sector and not in the alluvial aquifer additionally although the enrichment of heavy water isotopes in groundwater may indicate the influence of the evaporation rates on the irrigation returns the craig diagram fig 7 showed that the values of the water isotopes δ18o and δ2h in all samples of group e where the salinity was clustered followed a linear evaporation trend that fell below the global meteoric water line gmwl and the local meteoric water line lmwl rozanski et al 1993 aguilar ramírez et al 2017 indicating no significant differences among subgroups probably due to the δ18o and δ2h precision values fig 8 a shows a similar increasing trend for na and cl concentrations in groundwater of the clr which can be explained by halite dissolution during groundwater flow or during irrigated water infiltration nevertheless there is a clear deviation of na and cl concentrations from the halite equiline indicating that other processes such as albite dissolution na silicate and or inverse cation exchange dissolved ca is substituted for na in the aquifer matrix may increase the na concentrations over cl levels in fact fig 8b indicates lower values of ca and mg with regard to hco3 and so4 2 concentrations suggesting that the inverse cation exchange processes may account for the na increase in groundwater figs 8c 8d 8e and 8f depict the binary diagrams used to distinguish waters interacting with carbonate silicates and evaporite rocks gaillardet et al 1999 figs 8c and 8d show how groundwater with the highest concentrations of na red points representing g3 of group b and high salinity groundwater of group e red points representing g3 of group e display ca na and hco3 na molar ratios even lower than those of the evaporite endmember whereas the moderate values of both groups yellow points of groups b and f lie in the evaporite silicate carbonate mixing this demonstrates that the groundwater collected at these sampling sites red points has enhanced na concentrations compared to the other ions indeed this fact may be triggered by the inverse cation exchange processes which increase the na concentrations in groundwater and change its geochemical signature acquired during rock weathering regarding the behavior of re se and cu in the double clustering results it was observed that the concentrations of these elements increased significantly in each subgroup g3 g2 g1 for cu in group b and g3 g2 g1 for se and re in group e moreover these elements showed a highly significant positive correlation with so4 2 r 0 52 for cu r 0 78 for re r 0 66 for se p 0 001 this behavior lies in the fact that these three elements are strongly chalcophilic sarah jane 2016 for example re tends to be enriched in sulfide deposits such as pyrite pentlandite pyrrhotite and copper iron sulfide chalcopyrite moilanen et al 2021 otherwise se can be naturally enriched in pyrite tian et al 2020 as well as in sulfate minerals such as gypsum mainly due to the oxyanions selenite seo3 2 and selenate seo4 2 substitute so4 2 in the gypsum structure lin et al 2020 although the saturation index of gypsum and anhydrite increased with increasing tds concentrations all the groundwater samples of clr were undersaturated with respect to both phases supplementary information fig f2 suggesting a continuous process of sulfate dissolution during the infiltration of irrigation water or during the groundwater flow path hence the elements cu se and re are mobilized with so4 2 to groundwater because of the oxidation of sulfides such as the pyrite oxidation process and weathering of sulfate evaporites gypsum and anhydrite these elements remain in solution even in highly oxygenated waters because some oxidized forms of se selenate seo4 2 and re perrhenate oxyanion reo4 are highly soluble in oxidizing waters hodge et al 1996 kumar and riyazuddin 2011 it is noteworthy that increased salinization also threatens the quality of groundwater used for human consumption overall ten samples showed so4 2 concentrations higher than the 500 mg l recommended by who 2018 to avoid laxative effects in humans while 33 of samples had no3 n levels higher than the 11 mg l no3 n established by who 2018 to protect bottle fed infants against methemoglobinemia only one sample showed se levels higher than the maximum permissible value 40 μg l reported by who 2018 whereas no samples showed b concentrations above the who guideline value 2 4 mg l in summary the subgroups of variables b and e resulting from the double clustering approach show a random pattern in the clr because the clustering of these subgroups can be influenced by diverse processes such as the presence of highly mineralized groundwater in aquitards and deeper wells the dissolution of evaporite minerals the high evaporative rates and the inverse cation exchange processes indeed the random distribution of these processes in the clr precludes spatial autocorrelations moran s i and specific variable clustering lisa because both spatial analyses depend on the distance between locations sampled wells finally although the mo concentrations were also increased in the same order as those of the other variables in group b table 2 the differences among subgroups were not statistically significant hence the mo content in the clr groundwater does not seem to be affected by the above mentioned processes 5 1 3 groups c and d water rock interaction in the mountainous sectors with the exception of some sites in the northwest the subgroups of groups c and d derived from the double clustering displayed a similar spatial distribution figs 4c and 4d these subgroups showed that the highest concentrations of major and trace elements table 2 were found in the mountainous sectors southeastern part of the basin and the lowest concentrations in the alluvial aquifer this distribution was very similar to that shown by hco3 fig 5d according to the lisa analysis however the other variables of group c ga and ba concentrations showed only hotspots toward the southwestern part of the basin they did not present coldspots toward the alluvial aquifer whereas pb concentrations and the other variables of group d k and zn only showed coldspots toward the alluvial aquifer they did not show hotspots according to the lisa analysis see supplementary information fig f1 overall the subdivisions g1 and g2 of groups c and d may be explained as follows in the mountainous sectors g2 carbonates are intercalated with volcanic rocks and the elevated concentrations of hco3 ca and mg in groundwater are mainly derived from the weathering of plagioclases contained in andesite and basaltic rocks and the weathering of carbonate minerals found in limestone and dolomite this agrees with the binary diagrams depicted in figs 8e and 8f which indicate that groundwater in this sector g2 of group c had strongly interacted with silicates and carbonates whereas groundwater in the alluvial aquifer had a greater interaction with evaporite rocks additionally these reactions lead that almost all the groundwater samples collected in the whole basin are in equilibrium with respect to calcite and aragonite and oversaturated with respect to dolomite supplementary information fig f2 examples of carbonate and silicate weathering reactions are as follows 1 c a m g c o 3 c o 2 h 2 o c a m g 2 2 h c o 3 2 c a m g a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 3 h 2 o c a m g 2 2 h c o 3 a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 similarly the high concentrations of sr and ba in the mountains indicate that silicates and carbonates are also the major sources of these alkali earth elements in this closed basin this is consistent with the observations that both lithologies are important sources of ba and sr in water dalai et al 2002 2003 nevertheless whereas sr displayed highly significant correlations p 0 001 with ca and mg r 0 84 and r 0 87 respectively ba did not correlate with these major elements which suggests that ba may be mainly derived from other silicate sources k feldspars it is noteworthy that a highly significant relationship was found between ba and ga r 0 99 p 0 001 and that the concentrations of both elements together with pb were significantly higher in the groundwater of the mountainous sector than in the alluvial aquifer table 2 this suggests that these three elements ba ga and pb are derived from the host rocks of the mountainous sector mainly from the weathering of k feldspars this is consistent with the fact that k feldspars provide a suitable host for ba and pb in the alkali position and ga in tetrahedral sites oyarzábal et al 2009 in parallel ni and y were significantly enriched in the groundwater of the mountains and both elements showed a highly significant positive correlation r 0 76 p 0 001 this suggests that both elements may be derived from other silicate rocks such as basalts which are abundant in the clr mountains in fact ni is a common trace element in olivine herd et al 2009 whereas y has been found to mobilize during the weathering of some basalts cotten et al 1995 hill et al 2000 fig 4d indicates that the heaviest alkali elements k rb and cs are in highest abundance in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors owing to the scarcity of k in carbonate minerals groundwater k may be mainly derived from the dissolution of k feldspar which is mainly contained in rhyolites during this weathering process the other heavy alkali elements rb and cs may be concomitantly mobilized with k because some k feldspars provide a suitable host for these trace elements in the alkali position oyarzábal et al 2009 thus this may be responsible for the highly significant positive correlations found between rb and cs with k r 0 83 for rb and r 0 53 for cs p 0 001 as expected the u concentrations in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors were statistically higher than those in the alluvial aquifer additionally u showed a positive correlation with hco3 which may be explained as follows it is well known that soluble uvi has a strong affinity for carbonates owing to the formation of stable aqueous uranyl carbonates uo2 co3 3 4 cauo2 co3 3 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 which prevent the adsorption of u onto surfaces such as fe oxyhydroxides and maintain u mobility in groundwater cumberland et al 2016 swift bird et al 2020 even under anoxic conditions immobile uiv may be oxidized into aqueous uvi carbonate species via carbonate promoted oxidative dissolution seder colomina et al 2018 therefore the greater levels of u in the groundwater of the mountainous sectors may be due to the high concentrations of dissolved hco3 and ca which enhance the mobility of u because of the formation of uvi carbonate complexes even in reducing groundwater indeed this has led to three groundwater samples collected in this sector with u levels higher than the maximum levels of 30 μg l proposed by the who 2018 consistently the low levels of both ca2 and hco3 in the alluvial aquifer should limit the formation of such uvi carbonate complexes promoting the sequestration of u onto fe oxyhydroxides 5 1 4 group f ti as surrogate of si in quartz group f defined by the double clustering approach comprised the elements si and ti and the parameter orp because si and ti are not redox sensitive their concentrations are not affected by the redox potential of groundwater this may be confirmed by the absence of correlations between the orp and si and ti on the other hand si was highly correlated with ti r 0 90 p 0 001 suggesting similar sources group f was subdivided into two subgroups of cases where the concentrations of si and ti were significantly higher in the subgroup g2 than those in the subgroup g1 indeed the highest si and ti concentrations g2 in fig 4f were found in the alluvial aquifer and wells located in small alluvial deposits of the nazas aquifer where the weathering of alluvial material containing coarse medium sand fractions plays a determinant role in the elevated abundance of dissolved si and ti in groundwater this is because ti is a surrogate of si in quartz and both elements tend to be released by the breakdown of polymineralic grains containing phases such as quartz rich in these elements during the weathering process johnsson et al 1991 finally despite the double clustering approach showed two well defined subgroups no variables of this group si ti and orp showed significant moran s i values whereas the lisa analysis did not present spatial clusters supplementary information fig f1 6 conclusions the double clustering approach applied to the dataset of major and minor constituents of groundwater in the clr has been shown to be a powerful tool for identifying spatial areas where different lithogenic and anthropogenic processes or a combination of both can control the abundance of major ions metalloids and trace elements in general this easy to apply approach can visualize dispersed or randomized small zones where processes such as salinization may affect the quality of groundwater although moran s i and lisa are powerful statistical techniques for clustering locations with high or low values of a specific variable they present a strong limitation when the hotspots of several elements or variables are dispersedly distributed in a large area because large distances avoid spatial autocorrelations and spatial associations in contrast when the lithogenic and or anthropogenic processes are restricted to a specific area such as the release of high as levels in the alluvial aquifer the double clustering approach and the moran s i and lisa analysis provide consistent results indicating the zones or areas where hotspots are located in general this integrated and multi statistical analysis double clustering allowed the delineation of the major processes affecting groundwater quality throughout the clr which can be considered as representative of hotspots for groundwater management in this important region of mexico additionally this study illustrates the advantage of analyzing valorizing complex hydrochemical datasets using the double clustering approach to highlight the natural and human induced processes that potentially threaten human health one of the most important limitations of using the double clustering approach is that the method delineates hotspots relative to a general system that includes several variables whereas other spatial statistics delineate hotspots of a single variable this may provide high uncertainties in the resulting hotspots for several variables included in the general system therefore it is important to complement the double clustering approach with indicators of spatial association for one variable such as the lisa analysis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could
