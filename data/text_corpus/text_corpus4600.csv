23000,the predictive capabilities of the hosford coulomb ductile fracture model for shell elements were evaluated by simulating the penetration of stiffened panel test models the plasticity and ductile fracture of the test model material s235jr grade steel were modeled using the results of tests reported in the literature which consisted of dog bone notched tension central hole tension and shear experiments the loading paths to ductile fracture initiation were extracted from finite element analyses with very fine solid element meshes the hosford coulomb fracture model parameters were identified using the extracted loading paths and adopting a linear damage accumulation law using the concept of the domain of shell to solid equivalence the calibrated fracture model was extended to shell finite elements subsequently the fracture model was used to simulate the stiffened panel penetration tests the calibrated fracture model provides an accurate estimation of ductile fracture initiation and ductile crack propagation while being relatively mesh insensitive for the particular problem considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords ductile fracture hosford coulomb model shell element domain of shell to solid equivalence ship collision and grounding 1 introduction ductile fracture initiation and propagation is an important aspect of the impact analysis of structures subjected to loads that may cause large plastic deformation beyond a moderate level in particular crashworthiness assessment of automobiles and analysis of the consequences of the collision and grounding of ships and offshore structures are important impact problems in which the prediction of ductile fracture has crucial importance for accurate forecasts of the structural behavior theoretical and experimental research in ductile fracture of metals has progressed remarkably in recent years benzerga et al 2016 boyce et al 2016 2014 on the other hand the application of ductile fracture models to the analysis of large plated structures is still cumbersome in industrial settings due to the high computational cost involved with very fine solid element meshes in addition the proto type testing of structures for crashworthiness analysis is apparently not a cost effective method therefore shell element based finite element analysis is often performed in practice shell elements have some limitations in capturing the ductile fracture behavior of plated structures that undergo large plastic deformation particularly after the onset of localized necking the present study examines the performance of a recently proposed approach that attempts to address the limitations of shell elements while maintaining the framework of phenomenological ductile fracture models ductile fracture models may be classified as porous plasticity inspired micro mechanical models gurson 1977 nahshon and hutchinson 2008 nielsen and tvergaard 2010 tvergaard and needleman 1984 xue 2008 continuum damage mechanics cdm based models bonora 1997 bonora et al 2005 lemaitre 1985 and phenomenological uncoupled models based on non porous plasticity and damage indicator framework bai and wierzbicki 2010 2015 bao and wierzbicki 2004 brünig et al 2008 gruben et al 2012 khan and liu 2012 lou et al 2017 2012 2014 mohr and marcadet 2015 wierzbicki et al 2005 phenomenological models might be favorable to practitioners because of their relative ease of calibration and implementation into commercial finite element software packages as well as proven accuracy of predicting ductile fracture initiation in thin plate sheets in phenomenological models ductile fracture initiation is assumed to occur when a scalar variable called damage indicator reaches a critical value the key concept is that the damage indicator accumulates with increasing equivalent plastic strain that is usually weighted using a stress state dependent function based on a comprehensive experimental study covering a wide range of stress states bao and wierzbicki 2004 proposed a fracture locus that was dependent on the stress triaxiality normalized first invariant of the stress tensor as the weighting function xue 2007 reported that the ductile fracture of materials depends on both the stress triaxiality and so called lode angle parameter which is a non dimensional parameter that represents the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor since then advanced ductile fracture models have been developed based on a transformation of the mohr coulomb type stress based fracture criteria to the space of stress triaxiality lode angle parameter and equivalent plastic strain such as the modified mohr coulomb mmc model by bai and wierzbicki 2010 and the hosford coulomb hc model by mohr and marcadet 2015 the latter was proven to be consistent because it preserves the stress based fracture initiation model after a transformation of the stress based failure criterion the hosford coulomb model has recently become quite popular owing to its simplicity accuracy flexibility and ease of calibration the model was applied successfully to simulate the onset of ductile fracture of automotive high strength steels erice et al 2018 mohr and marcadet 2015 pack and marcadet 2016 papasidero et al 2014 aluminum alloys gorji and mohr 2017 2018 papasidero et al 2015 and armor steels fras et al 2018 in addition it was extended to include the effects of the strain rate and temperature pack and roth 2016 roth and mohr 2014 strain reversal marcadet and mohr 2015 application to probabilistic fracture tancogne dejean et al 2016 and shell element based fracture analysis pack and mohr 2017 the last point is possibly the most attractive development for engineering applications including crashworthiness assessments of large thin walled structures such as ships and offshore platforms the plane stress assumption in shell element formulation is invalid after the onset of localized necking localized necking precedes the ductile fracture initiation under membrane biaxial tension loading conditions and it is the main reason behind the mesh size sensitivity of shell finite element solutions in practice simple mesh size dependent critical fracture strain criteria which do not consider the stress state nor loading path effect have often been used as a ductile fracture model see storheim et al 2015b for a detailed review of these approaches walters 2014 explored the idea of utilizing three dimensional fracture models for shell elements using a mesh size dependent fracture locus i e adjusting the fracture strain based on both the shell element size and stress triaxiality earlier lee 2005 proposed a mesh size regularization technique based on a damage indicator averaged over a characteristic volume element which partially eliminated the mesh size sensitivity similarly the averaging unit concept was developed kõrgesaar et al 2014 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 to model fracture initiation with shell elements under biaxial tension conditions kõrgesaar 2019 recently explored the capabilities of different fracture models that differently account low stress triaxialities and deformation history on the other hand storheim et al 2015a proposed an alternative method where a mesh size dependent damage model was used to model material softening after localized necking their model yielded relatively low mesh size sensitivity for predicting the energy dissipation in typical ship and offshore collision scenarios storheim et al 2015a stated that the mesh size effect in shell elements due to limitations of the plane stress assumption and localized necking material mesh sensitivity should be distinguished from geometric mesh sensitivity i e the ability to capture local strain concentrations accurately mesh regularization techniques focus on fracture initiation due to biaxial tension liu et al 2014 2017 the application of mesh scaled fracture strain would lead to an erroneous prediction of the instant of fracture initiation in the case of ductile fracture without localized necking such as in plane shear localization and surface cracking due to pure bending to address this issue pack and mohr 2017 conducted a systematic study on the applicability of shell elements to predict ductile fracture initiation by applying the same plasticity and fracture models solid and shell element solutions were compared for the case of a notched tension experiment where localized necking precedes ductile fracture and a punch experiment where localized necking is delayed until fracture initiation this comparison helped diagnose the issue with shell elements and led to the conclusion that the shell elements can be used confidently with the same fracture models developed for solid elements only if localized necking does not occur the concept of domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse was introduced to define the domain where the shell element solutions are valid a localized necking criterion under proportional load was developed which has a similar mathematical form to the hc model ductile fracture under biaxial stretching was assumed to occur at the instant of localized necking based on the argument that the displacement to fracture initiation is much larger than the thickness of the metal sheets consequently the dsse is combined with the hc model named as dsse hc model that can predict the onset of ductile fracture with shell elements for in plane shear localization surface cracking and biaxial fracture as a consequence of localized necking for both dsse and hc models the damage indicator framework was adopted to handle non proportional loading paths pack et al 2018 performed a validation study of the dsse hc model by simulating several fracture test specimens and triangular cup drawing experiments the dsse hc model provided a reliable estimate of the onset of ductile fracture and reduced the mesh size sensitivity considerably however it was stated by pack et al 2018 that the simulations would need to be repeated for different materials and material models the results presented by pack et al 2018 were quite encouraging and motivated the current study to investigate the performance of the dsse hc model further for the case of biaxial stretching of large plated structures liu et al 2018 reviewed the experiments and calculation procedures for ship collision and grounding and highlighted that membrane deformation and rupture of stiffened panels in side collision or stranding is one of the most primary energy absorbing mechanisms hence the impact scenario considered in the present paper is the quasi static indentation of a plate or a stiffened panel by a rigid punch which is very relevant to a collision and the grounding of ships and offshore structures alsos and amdahl 2009 alsos et al 2009 cho and lee 2009 gruben et al 2016 2017 karlsson et al 2009 kõrgesaar et al 2018 lee et al 2004 liu et al 2013 morin et al 2017 ringsberg et al 2018 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 villavicencio et al 2014 wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 a recently published paper by kõrgesaar et al 2018 presented an experimental study including both fracture specimens and laser welded stiffened panel penetration test results which are appropriate for calibrating the plasticity and fracture model parameters and assessing the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc fracture model in addition the tests by alsos and amdahl 2009 can be simulated using the same calibrated fracture model because the test models were made of the same steel type s235jr grade structural steel in this paper a hybrid experimental numerical approach which was described in detail by dunand and mohr 2010 was followed to obtain the loading path to the onset of fracture in the reported fracture tests by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the dsse hc fracture model parameters were identified using the numerically obtained loading paths to fracture initiation and the hardening function of the material a linear damage accumulation law was adopted to extend the application of the fracture model to non proportional loading paths simulations of the panel indentation tests were performed with different mesh sizes the force displacement responses displacement to fracture to initiation and ductile fracture propagation obtained from the simulations were compared with the test results the stress state at ductile fracture initiation loading path of the first failed elements and damage evolution were discussed 2 description of fracture experiments by kõrgesaar et al 2018 kõrgesaar et al 2018 conducted several quasi static tests to characterize the plasticity and fracture characteristics of 3 mm thick s235jr grade steel plates which were used to fabricate the stiffened panels tested under lateral indentation s235jr is a non alloyed structural steel that has applications in steel construction bridge building production facilities vehicle construction and wind towers although it does not carry the class designation it can be considered as a grade a shipbuilding steel the tests conducted by kõrgesaar et al 2018 consisted of four types of specimen geometries standard dog bone specimen with a 15 mm gauge width denoted as db uniaxial tension specimen with a central hole 4 mm in diameter and gauge width of 20 mm denoted as ch notched tension specimen with a 16 mm gauge width and a circular cut out with notch radius of 5 mm which are denoted as nt and smiley shear specimen which was adopted from the design with two symmetric gauge sections proposed by roth and mohr 2016 and optimized to delay fracture at the free edges prior to fracture initiation at the gauge section this specimen is denoted as sh fig 1 shows the specimen geometries according to kõrgesaar et al 2018 the specimens were cut from the base plate using a band saw while the gauge sections were machined using wire cutting edm the tension tests on these four specimen types were conducted using a servo mechanical loading frame under a constant cross head velocity of 2 1 and 0 2 mm min for the db ch and nt sh specimens respectively the test conditions can be assumed to quasi static and isothermal the dog bone specimen is utilized mainly for characterizing the elasto plastic response before the onset of diffuse necking unlike conventional dog bone specimens the central hole specimen with an optimal hole radius maintains a stress state that is very close to uniaxial tension even after the onset of fracture see roth and mohr 2016 in the notched tension specimen the stress state is the plane strain tension in the initial stages of loading the shear specimen is designed to maintain a pure shear state in the gauge part throughout the loading and eliminate fracture initiation at the edges with these four specimen types a wide of range of stress states can be achieved and the tension test results can be used to calibrate the plasticity and fracture model the digital image correlation dic technique was used to measure the surface strain and gauge displacements of db and nt specimens the dic technique was unsuccessful in the cases of the ch and sh specimens due to severe distortion of the speckle patterns on these specimens at the final stages of loading the dic surface strain measurements were used to identify the displacement at the onset of fracture initiation in each test kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not assess the anisotropy effects and it was assumed that the plasticity of s235jr grade steel is direction independent this assumption was followed in the present paper because general purpose structural steels usually exhibit isotropic plastic behavior 3 finite element analysis of fracture tests all fracture experiments including the tests with dog bone specimens were simulated using the non linear finite element analysis software abaqus explicit following the principles outlined by dunand and mohr 2010 the purpose of the simulations was to identify and validate the plasticity model parameters and obtain stress and strain fields inside the specimens up to ductile fracture initiation so that the loading paths can be identified only one eighth of the ch nt and db specimens were modeled due to symmetry about the mid surface horizontal and vertical planes for the sh specimen symmetry about the mid surface and vertical planes was considered in the symmetry planes the normal displacements were constrained all models were meshed using 8 node solid elements c3d8r from the abaqus element library with reduced the integration and default hourglass controls the gauge sections of the nt ch and db specimens were meshed with eight elements through the half thickness whereas in sh sixteen elements were deemed to be appropriate the resulting element edge lengths are 0 1875 and 0 09375 mm respectively note that these mesh sizes were obtained after performing a convergence study considering equivalent plastic strain and stress state parameters at the critical element that is assumed as the location of fracture initiation the simulations were run using the explicit solver of abaqus by applying the displacement to fracture initiation reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 to decrease the computational cost the mass scaling option was activated to yield approximately 150 000 time increments all specimens were assumed to have the elastic constants young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν as 201 gpa and 0 3 respectively and the material density ρ was taken as 7 85 t m3 fig 2 shows the finite element mesh of the specimens 3 1 plasticity model parameter identification the plastic behavior of s235jr grade steel was modeled using the standard plasticity theory with an isotropic von mises yield surface the von mises yield surface expressed as eq 1 is a function of the von mises equivalent stress σ and the deformation resistance k 1 f σ k σ k 0 2 σ 3 j 2 where j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor in addition the associated flow rule was assumed 3 d ε p d ε p σ σ where d ε p denotes the increment in plastic strain vector and d ε p is the equivalent plastic strain increment which is defined as the work conjugate of von mises equivalent stress 4 σ d ε p σ d ε p the deformation resistance k is a function of only the equivalent plastic strain 5 k f ε p the monotonic loading paths in the tests suggest that isotropic hardening model is appropriate the swift hardening model was adopted and the existence of lüders plateau was considered 6 k f ε p σ 0 if ε p ε l a ε 0 ε p n if ε p ε l kõrgesaar et al 2018 identified the swift law parameters a ε 0 n and the plateau parameters σ 0 ε l from the dog bone specimen test results by curve fitting to the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking these parameters were also used in the present study for the post necking range where the strain distribution becomes non uniform the swift law was extrapolated as a first attempt the force displacement curve of the nt specimen was used for validation because the reduced gauge area ensures that localization occurs all the way to fracture fig 3 compares the simulation and test results beyond the instant of onset of fracture reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 it is apparent that extrapolating the swift law for strains beyond the diffuse necking is appropriate for this particular material a further validation of the adopted plasticity model may be made using the results of other specimens table 1 lists the hardening parameters identified and fig 4 shows the corresponding hardening curve the plasticity model was implemented into abaqus explicit using the vumat user defined material subroutine the return mapping algorithm elastic predictor and plastic corrector scheme was used to obtain the state variables at each strain increment 3 2 description of stress state the stress state of an isotropic ductile solid can be described fully by the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter θ these two non dimensional parameters stress state parameters can be expressed in terms of the stress tensor invariants 7 i 1 tr σ 8 j 2 1 2 s s 9 j 3 det s i 1 is the first invariant of the cauchy stress tensor σ whereas j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor s 10 s σ 1 3 i 1 i where i is the identity matrix the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter 1 θ 1 are expressed as follows 11 η i 1 3 3 j 2 12 θ 1 2 π arccos 3 3 2 j 3 j 2 3 2 under plane stress condition σ 3 0 it may be shown that lode angle parameter is a function of stress triaxiality 13 θ 1 2 π arccos 27 2 η η 2 1 3 using the above equation the possible plane stress states can be plotted easily as shown in fig 5 note the stress triaxiality and lode angle parameter values corresponding to certain plane stress states such as in plane shear uniaxial tension plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension in addition note that the upper limit of stress triaxiality under plane stress condition is 2 3 3 3 loading paths to fracture the loading path to fracture initiation i e stress triaxiality and lode angle parameter histories up to the onset of fracture as a function of the equivalent plastic strain at the most highly strained element were extracted from the numerical simulations because the location of the onset of fracture is not known experimentally the most highly strained element usually changes throughout the loading particularly after the onset of necking the assumed instants of fracture initiation corresponds to those reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 note that in this paper a hybrid numerical experimental analysis was followed in which the results are affected by the uncertainties in both numerical modeling as well as in the experiments see dunand and mohr 2010 for a detailed discussion of this point according to the numerical results in the db ch and nt specimens the most highly strained element is inside the specimen at half thickness while in the sh specimen it is on the surface at the gauge section in the ch specimen it is located on the hole boundary while in the db specimen the onset of fracture is located at the center of the gauge in the nt and sh specimens the critical element is slightly off the center of the gauge section fig 6 shows the exact location and the equivalent plastic strain value of the critical element for each specimen at the instant of fracture initiation observed in the tests fig 7 compares the numerical and experimental force displacement curves up to the displacement corresponding to the assumed instants of fracture initiation this comparison may be considered as a further validation of the adopted plasticity model the force displacement curves of the nt db and sh specimens were predicted accurately whereas some discrepancies exist for the case of the ch specimen particularly before the onset of fracture this issue was also reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 who attempted to address it by employing a rate dependent hardening function in this paper however such adjustment of the numerical results was not deemed necessary kõrgesaar et al 2018 noted that the reproducibility of the ch specimen test results was not good the machining of the central hole has a significant effect on the force displacement response of the ch specimens which causes uncertainty for numerical modeling and simulation for the comparison shown in the present paper the test result of the specimen denoted as ch 1 3 was used in the case of the sh specimen the force displacement curves and displacement to fracture initiation in the two tests performed by kõrgesaar et al 2018 also showed some scatter the test results of the s1 3 specimen was adopted in the present study fig 8 shows the evolution of the stress triaxiality and lode angle parameters for each specimen as a function of the increasing equivalent plastic strain a loading path is considered proportional if the stress state parameters stress triaxiality and lode parameter remain constant up to the point of fracture initiation none of the present tests exhibited a proportional loading path in the db specimen after the onset of diffuse necking the uniaxial tension state was not maintained similarly the loading path of the nt specimen was inclined after the onset of localized necking in contrast to expectation the ch specimen is not perfectly in a uniaxial tension state throughout the loading to fracture initiation as reported by roth and mohr 2016 the optimal central hole diameter for achieving a uniaxial tension state is strongly dependent on the hardening behavior of the material of interest for s235jr a better result could have been achieved with a slightly larger hole diameter regarding the sh specimen the stress triaxiality and particularly lode angle parameter vary towards the onset of fracture it should be noted that the design of a pure shear specimen is an unresolved challenge in the ductile fracture community in the case of highly ductile metals e g s235jr grade steel as evident from fig 8 the design of the test specimens with proportional loading paths to fracture initiation is even more challenging 4 ductile fracture characterization 4 1 hosford coulomb fracture model for proportional loading mohr and marcadet 2015 proposed the phenomenological hosford coulomb hc model to predict ductile fracture initiation under proportional loading the hc fracture model describes the fracture initiation in an un cracked solid undergoing proportional loading paths it defines the ductility limits of a solid for various stress states here the term ductility should be understood as a mesh independent material specific property therefore for each material for the case of marine structures for each grade of steel and aluminum alloys the hc model parameters should be identified separately the hc model was developed based on micro mechanical observations and assumes that the onset of fracture is imminent with the formation of a shear localization on the macroscopic scale such a condition may be expressed conveniently as a stress based criterion mohr and marcadet 2015 modified the mohr coulomb criterion by expressing it as a linear combination of the hosford equivalent stress and the normal stress acting on the plane of maximum shear stress reaching a critical value b 14 σ h f c σ 1 σ 3 b here σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 c is the friction coefficient in the mohr coulomb criterion the hosford equivalent stress can be expressed as 15 σ h f 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 a σ 1 σ 3 a σ 2 σ 3 a 1 a note that for a 2 the hosford equivalent stress becomes the von mises equivalent stress equation 14 can be transformed to spherical coordinates i e so called haigh westergaard space σ η θ and the fracture surface for proportional loading ε f p r can be expressed in mixed stress strain space η θ ε f using the inverse of isotropic power law type hardening law consequently hosford coulomb fracture criterion for a strictly proportional loading can be expressed as 16 ε f p r η θ b 1 c 1 n f g η θ with 17 g η θ 1 2 f 1 f 2 a f 1 f 3 a f 2 f 3 a 1 a c 2 η f 1 f 3 1 n f the lode angle parameter dependent functions can be written as 18 f 1 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ 19 f 2 θ 2 3 cos π 6 3 θ 20 f 3 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ the transformation coefficient n f is always set to 0 1 mohr and marcadet 2015 therefore the hosford coulomb model has three parameters to be identified a b and c the parameter a hosford exponent controls the lode angle sensitivity effect of deviatoric stress while the stress triaxiality sensitivity effect of hydrostatic stress is primarily controlled by the parameter c friction coefficient in mohr coulomb failure criterion the parameter b controls the overall magnitude of the strains to fracture for proportional loading it is equal to the fracture strain for uniaxial tension or equi biaxial tension under proportional loading paths hence it can be identified easily if proportional tests for any of these two cases are available see roth and mohr 2016 for a detailed discussion of this point 4 2 damage accumulation law linear damage accumulation law as given below is used in association with the hosford coulomb fracture model to consider the loading path effects 21 d d h c d ε p ε f p r η θ where d d h c is the differential damage indicator fischer et al 1995 fracture is assumed to initiate when the integration of eq 22 is equal to unity 22 d h c 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 here ε f is the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to the instant of fracture initiation d h c 0 1 is a scalar variable that represents the relative reduction of ductility of the material the damage accumulation law is linear such that there is a linear relationship between the damage indicator d h c and the equivalent plastic strain increment d ε p this form of damage accumulation law works well for monotonous loading conditions such as those observed in the tests utilized in the present study however loading reversals usually require the implementation of non linear damage accumulation law see marcadet and mohr 2015 papasidero et al 2015 the evolution of d h c has no direct physical meaning and is not associated with the micro mechanical behavior of the material void nucleation growth and coalescence process in addition the damage indicator parameter d h c has no effect on the elasto plastic material behavior hence uncoupled model the damage indicator framework for uncoupled models should not be confused with the internal damage variable in cdm which represents the reduction in the effective load carrying capacity due to material degradation and is coupled with elasto plastic behavior the damage indicator parameter should be viewed as a mathematical tool to handle the loading history effect fischer et al 1995 4 3 fracture model parameter identification the hc fracture model parameters α a b c were identified using an inverse method the residual was defined as a square error following the condition that the damage indicator is equal to unity at the instant of fracture initiation 23 r 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 2 consequently the parameter identification problem was formulated as an optimization problem that aimed to minimize the least square error function λ α 24 α arg min λ α with λ α i 1 4 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ i 1 2 here the index i corresponds to the particular test considered for calibration the numerically obtained loading paths of all four experiments were included in the parameter identification process the optimization problem was solved using the matlab program with a derivative free algorithm to solve the constrained minimization problems the hosford coulomb fracture model parameters identified were a 1 501 b 1 489 c 0 023 fig 9 shows a 3d plot of the identified hosford coulomb fracture locus for proportional loading the thick black line highlights the fracture limit for the plane stress conditions the effect of the lode angle parameter on the ductile fracture of s235jr grade steel is evident here the strain to fracture decreases monotonically with increasing stress triaxiality for cases of generalized shear axisymmetric tension and axisymmetric compression however a valley exists between these distinct loading conditions due to the lode angle effect the fracture locus under the plane stress condition is as shown in fig 10 the effect of the lode angle parameter are represented here with the biaxial tension valley in other words the ductility of the s235jr grade steel under plane strain tension is less than that under uniaxial or equi biaxial tension another important effect of the lode angle parameter can be observed on the fracture strain under in plane shear the ductility for in plane shear is less than that for uniaxial tension it should be emphasized that the histories of the stress state parameters and the equivalent plastic strain at the assumed location of fracture initiation used in the fracture model parameter identification were obtained from the finite element analysis the finite element models of the test specimens were meshed with very fine 3d solid elements to obtain a converged resolution of the stress and strain fields the solid elements are not subject to material mesh sensitivity in contrast to the shell elements and a converged solution can be obtained with mesh refinement hence the calibrated hc model for solid elements is not a mesh size related fracture strain model provided that in the parameter identification process a converged mesh configuration for extracting the histories of stress state parameters and equivalent plastic strain of the critical element is used 4 4 domain of shell to solid equivalence the hc ductile fracture model which is originally defined for applications using very fine 3d solid elements cannot be directly used for shell elements under certain circumstances shell elements are based on the assumption of plane stress conditions as demonstrated by pack and mohr 2017 who compared solid and shell element simulation results for various cases employing the hc model the shell element solutions lose their meaning if localized necking precedes ductile fracture the material mesh size sensitivity is due this shortcoming of the shell elements localized necking occurs in the biaxial tension regime 1 3 η 2 3 and only if all through thickness integration points of a shell element satisfy the localized necking criterion pack and mohr 2017 showed that in other cases the hc ductile fracture model can be directly used for shell elements to overcome the shortcoming of the shell elements the onset of localized necking may be defined as a failure condition according to pack and mohr 2017 the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse defines the domain where the plane stress assumption in a shell element formulation remains valid and the same fracture criterion as for solids can be applied to the shell elements after performing marciniak kuczynski type analysis with a unit cell model pack and mohr 2017 developed a localized necking criterion which is valid in the biaxial tension domain 1 3 η 2 3 under a proportional membrane load and has a similar parametric form to that of the hosford coulomb model 25 ε d s s e p r η b 1 2 g 1 g 2 d g 1 d g 2 d 1 d 1 p f the stress triaxiality dependent functions g 1 and g 2 can be expressed as 26 g 1 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 27 g 2 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 where the recommended value of the exponent p f is 0 01 the damage indicator for localized necking under a non proportional loading is defined as being similar to that of the hosford coulomb fracture model 28 d d d s s e d ε p ε d s s e p r η the localized necking criterion is satisfied in a through thickness integration point of a shell element if d d s s e reaches unity to distinguish the membrane and bending loading it is postulated that failure of a shell element due localized necking occurs if all integration points through the thickness in z direction fulfill the necking criterion i e d d s s e z 1 z t 2 t 2 where t is the shell element thickness the key assumption made by pack and mohr 2017 is that when localized necking precedes ductile fracture the difference between the displacement to the onset of localized necking and fracture initiation will be very small because the displacement at the length scale is usually much larger than the plate thickness therefore the displacement to the onset of localized necking may be assumed to be the failure displacement it is claimed that by defining the localized necking as a failure condition and ignoring the post necking zone completely the material mesh size sensitivity which occurs after the onset of localized necking is largely reduced this is the same pragmatic approach followed by alsos et al 2009 who used a stress based forming limit curve namely bwh as the localized necking condition as expressed in eq 25 an extension of the hosford coulomb model for shell element application using the concept of dsse adds another parameter d to be identified identifying this parameter using the hardening function of the material of interest is relatively straightforward first the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to localized necking ε d s s e p s t is determined using the considère criterion for the plane strain tension condition note that diffuse necking does not occur under plane strain tension conditions 29 k ε d s s e p s t 2 3 d k ε d s s e p s t d ε p the parameter d is then obtained by substituting η 1 3 and ε d s s e p s t into eq 25 and solving the following implicit equation 30 1 2 d 1 1 d 3 ε d s s e p s t b p f for s235jr grade steel the above equations yield ε d s s e p s t 0 235 and d 1 6979 fig 11 presents the fracture locus and localized necking envelope of s235jr table 2 lists all parameters identified for the dsse hc model 4 5 numerical implementation of dsse hc model for shell elements as shown in fig 11 the dsse hc model for shell elements is able to describe three types failure fracture preceded by localized necking defined by the dsse localized necking envelope for the domain 1 3 η 2 3 fracture not preceded by localized necking i e surface cracking due to predominant bending loads defined by the hc fracture locus for the domain 1 3 η 2 3 fracture due to in plane shear localization defined by the hc fracture locus for the domain 0 η 1 3 the dsse hc model is based on the damage indicator framework in which a scalar variable d defined separately for ductile fracture and localized necking as d h c and d d s s e respectively is calculated for each through thickness integration point as the accumulated equivalent plastic strain weighted with a stress state dependent function this model has two key features the effect of loading path variations of stress state is taken into account for both ductile fracture and localized necking with a through thickness evaluation of the localized necking criterion the membrane and bending loads are distinguished and the retardation of fracture due to predominant bending loads is accounted for the failure due to the hc model is based on the condition that d h c 1 is satisfied at any through thickness integration point of a shell element once it is satisfied the stress of that particular integration point is set to zero integration point is deleted not the element therefore hc is a local failure model the failure due to the dsse model is based on the condition that d d s s e 1 is satisfied at all through thickness integration points of a shell element once all through thickness integration points satisfy the failure condition the stresses of all integration points are set to zero all integration point are deleted thus dsse is a non local failure model that evaluates the status of a shell element as a whole it is interesting to note that many failure models in the literature which are based on a localized necking criterion such as the bwh criterion by alsos et al 2009 and the forming limit diagrams flds in abaqus consider only the failure of the mid layer integration point as the criterion for element removal the dsse model addresses the shortcoming of this assumption in abaqus a shell element is deleted removed from the mesh if the stresses of all integration points are equal to zero based on the above explanations it is apparent that when using the dsse hc fracture model for shell elements the element removal may occur either due to the hc ductile fracture model or the dsse localized necking model in summary the hc dsse model combines a localized necking criterion enhanced to account for bending effects and ductile fracture initiation model to predict the onset of ductile fracture using shell finite elements a user defined vumat subroutine was developed for shell element applications implementing the return mapping algorithm for the plasticity calculations and the hosford coulomb fracture model coupled with the dsse the plane stress condition was enforced using the nested iteration algorithm which is described elsewhere neto et al 2008 the vumat subroutine calculates the damage and localized necking indicators at the integration points through the thickness of a shell element an element is deleted removed only if all integration points fail either by satisfying the ductile fracture initiation criterion or localized necking criterion 5 simulation of panel penetration tests 5 1 laser welded stiffened panel test by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the calibrated dsse hc model was used to simulate the stiffened panel penetration tests reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the stiffened panels were 1200 1200 mm square plates flat bar stiffeners with a 30 mm web height and 120 mm spacing were welded using a laser welding technique both the plate and stiffeners were 3 mm the test panels were bolted on the testing frame with clamping plates and back support plates the unclamped dimensions of the panels were 960 960 mm a hemispherical indenter with a punch radius of 120 mm was forced to penetrate through the center of the test panels with a velocity of 10 mm min fig 12 shows the stiffened panel geometry and experimental setup the indenter surface was polished to minimize the friction effects in total five penetration tests were conducted of which four of them focused on center indentation the precise location of indentation in each test was also reported following kõrgesaar et al 2018 the force displacement curve and photographs of the test panel denoted as sp 4 were taken as a reference for a comparison with the numerical simulations the stiffened panel penetration tests were simulated using the software package abaqus explicit and employing the developed vumat subroutine the unclamped part of the stiffened panel was modeled and meshed with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r in abaqus element library five through thickness integration points and default hourglassing were chosen a uniform mesh with different element edge lengths mesh size were considered 20 15 10 7 5 5 and 2 5 mm symmetry conditions were not applied because the indenter hit the stiffened panel slightly off center the boundaries of the stiffened panels were set as fully clamped detailed modeling of the clamping setup was not deemed necessary because the numerical force displacement results with fully clamped edges agreed well with the test results the punch was modeled with rigid elements and positioned to hit the stiffened panel at the first contact point measured in the sp 4 test offset from panel corner x 598 mm y 593 mm fig 13 presents the finite element model with a mesh size of 15 mm the contact between the punch and stiffened panel was modeled with the general contact algorithm in abaqus explicit the tangential contact behavior was modeled using a friction coefficient of 0 23 and a penalty type formulation this friction coefficient was given by kõrgesaar et al 2018 citing karlsson et al 2009 who conducted tests with a similar setup and material and measured the friction coefficient the normal contact behavior was modeled with hard contact pressure overclosure the punch was forced to penetrate through the stiffened panel at a constant rate the total simulation duration was set to 0 4 s which is long enough to keep the inertial effects negligible fig 14 shows the force displacement curves obtained with different mesh sizes and compares them with the test results the numerical simulations captured the force displacement response with great accuracy the displacement to the onset of fracture with different mesh sizes is not subject to significant variations and overall is very close to the test result the peak force was underestimated slightly with fine meshes i e 7 5 5 and 2 5 mm mesh sizes the predicted displacement to the onset of fracture also decreased slightly with decreasing element size in addition the sudden decrease in force associated with fracture initiation in the panel was captured well by all mesh sizes fig 15 presents the post fracture initiation shape of the test panel predicted numerically with different mesh sizes with some photographs provided by kõrgesaar et al 2018 according to kõrgesaar et al 2018 fracture was first initiated on the plate between two stiffeners and propagated parallel to the stiffeners independently fracture initiated in a second location and propagated in the transverse direction across the stiffener upon further loading this secondary fracture propagated towards the stiffener and eventually the stiffener was totally fractured see the photos in fig 15 the numerical simulations with different mesh sizes capture the experimentally observed fracture initiation and propagation albeit with some minor differences in the instants of each stage of fracture propagation in all numerical simulations fracture was initiated when the damage indicator parameter for localized necking d d s s e reached unity at all five through thickness integration points fig 16 shows the evolution of d d s s e d h c and η in the integration points located at top contact side and bottom surface of the element that fails first in the model with a 15 mm mesh size the dsse hc model for fracture prediction in the case of biaxial stretching of thin walled structures is illustrated well in this figure the stress state i e stress triaxiality has a significant influence on the damage accumulation for localized necking even though the stress triaxiality varies only slightly from 0 56 to 0 66 throughout loading until failure this result is not surprising because the localized necking envelope showed a sharp decrease in that range of stress triaxialities fig 11 moreover damage indicator for the hc model ductile fracture indicator is less than the damage indicator for the dsse model necking indicator at the instant of localized necking initiation note also the differences between the stress state and damage value evolution for the top and bottom surfaces of the shell element as indicated earlier failure occurs if all integration points satisfy the condition d d s s e 1 for this particular case this condition is first satisfied on the top surface and the element is deleted once the bottom surface integration point also fails kõrgesaar et al 2018 simulated the same tests using so called 2fs and cockcroft latham cl criteria the 2fs criterion is based on the framework proposed by walters 2014 where the fracture locus is scaled between the two extremes defined by a necking locus and a plane stress ductile fracture locus respectively in walters framework the fracture locus is scaled not only based on the mesh size and but also the stress state kõrgesaar et al 2018 employ a diffuse necking criterion swifts diffuse necking criterion as the lower bound which is considered appropriate for coarsely meshed shell elements for very fine shell elements the upper bound applies which is defined by the modified mohr coulomb mmc fracture locus under plane stress assumption the mmc model which is intended for very fine mesh solid elements is calibrated under plane stress assumption using solid elements with different mesh size moreover the fracture model is calibrated based on the average value of stress triaxiality history on the other hand the fracture locus defined by the cl criterion is scaled only with the mesh size it is calibrated in a similar way using different mesh sizes but only considering the fracture strain corresponding to uniaxial tension the default element removal option in abaqus is used for both criteria where the stress of a through thickness integration point is set to zero once it satisfies the failure condition and an element is deleted if all through thickness integration points fail it is evident that there are distinct differences between the approaches used in the present study and by kõrgesaar et al 2018 first of all kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not consider localized necking and fracture are as distinct failure modes instead of a localized necking condition which is the main issue of the shell elements a diffuse necking condition is adopted for coarsely meshed elements we argue that this assumption will yield an early prediction of failure as compared to the localized necking condition further it is assumed that with a mesh refinement the fracture locus under plane stress assumption will converge for shell elements here the main issue with 2fs criterion is the calibration procedure of the mmc criterion a constitutive assumption of the plane stress condition from the beginning to the end of plastic deformation all the way to the fracture is unrealistic if localized necking precedes fracture indeed walters and voormeeren 2014 showed that this assumption is incorrect and has non negligible effects in the tests by kõrgesaar et al 2018 db nt and ch specimens do not satisfy plane stress assumption at the instant of fracture initiation mesh refinement in addition kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not take into account the effect of bending deformation by considering through thickness stress gradients and treating the shell element as whole when localized necking precedes fracture lastly fracture strain is non unique if the average stress triaxiality is used in the fracture locus calibration because there are infinite number of ways to get the same stress triaxiality under varying loading paths in the present paper the calibration is done under varying loading history by minimizing the difference between the calculated damage indicator using the measured displacement to fracture and the value of unity fig 17 shows the force displacement curves reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 using the 2fs and cl criteria the 2fs criterion with mesh size regularization provides an accurate estimate of the displacement to fracture initiation with very low scatter with respect to the mesh size this is not surprising because considering the range of stress triaxialities observed in the first failed element which are reported in the present study the mesh size regularization in the 2fs criterion yields a relatively small scale factor for the diffuse necking criterion therefore it may be argued that even without a mesh size regularization the scatter in fracture displacement would be less this is consistent with the results obtained using the fracture modeling approach adopted in the present study the inclusion of the bending effects and the definition of the lower bound with a localized necking criterion would improve the accuracy as shown in the present study on the other hand the cl criterion with a mesh size regularization exhibits a very large scatter in predicting fracture displacement it is evident that the use of a fracture locus in this case cl criterion which is actually intended for very fine solid elements with a mesh size regularization for shell element applications is less credible as compared to the dsse hc model 5 2 unstiffened and stiffened panel tests by alsos and amdahl 2009 the unstiffened and stiffened panel penetration test results presented by alsos and amdahl 2009 provides an additional opportunity to assess the capabilities of the calibrated dsse hc model for s235jr steel because the test models were fabricated using the same material these tests have been the subject of many numerical studies which focused on ship grounding and collision analysis abubakar and dow 2013 alsos et al 2009 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b woelke et al 2013 a comparison of all the numerical results reported in the literature and the dsse hc model predictions in the present paper would be beyond the scope of the study however the readers are encouraged to refer to the cited sources for a better understanding of the contribution and potential of the dsse hc model fig 18 shows the geometry and dimensions of the test models and experimental setup two test models were considered an unstiffened monolithic plate us and a plate with a flat bar stiffener welded at the center 1 fb the panels penetrated at the center with a slowly moving rigid cone shaped indenter with a spherical nose the target plates were 5 mm thick and arc welded to a frame made from 12 5 mm thick high strength steel grade s355nh plates both the plate and stiffeners were s235jr steel which mechanical properties obtained by alsos and amdahl 2009 using standard tensile tests the swift law hardening parameters given in alsos and amdahl 2009 were different for the plate and flat bar stiffener components and more importantly were not similar to those given by kõrgesaar et al 2018 in the numerical simulations the hardening parameters provided by alsos and amdahl 2009 were used even though this may cause some uncertainty in the calibrated fracture model alsos and amdahl did not measure the friction coefficient in their numerical simulations alsos et al 2009 it was assumed that the friction coefficient would be equal to 0 3 claiming that this is a reasonable assumption for friction between coated steel surfaces in the present study the friction coefficient was assumed to be 0 23 for the sake of consistency with the simulations in the previous section the numerical simulations were performed using the same modeling details as those applied in the previous section the numerical model included the thick support frame welded to the target plates the bottom surface of the support frame was assumed to be simply supported in their numerical simulations of stiffened panels alsos et al 2009 increased the thickness of the elements in the vicinity of the welds this modeling approach has been followed elsewhere abubakar and dow 2013 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b however in the present work the weld elements with an artificially increased thickness were not included because they require a much smaller mesh size than the rest of the model in the numerical simulations mesh sizes of 25 20 and 15 mm which correspond to 5 t 4 t and 3 t respectively were considered alsos et al 2009 stated that there was some offset between the target center and the punch and in the numerical simulations the punch was set to hit the plate 5 mm from the center the same assumption was made in the present study fig 19 compares the numerical and test results in terms of the force displacement response note that the unloading reloading in the test result was due to the limited stroke of the hydraulic jack used in the tests overall the agreement between the test and numerical results with a relatively coarse mesh is very close in the case of us and the mesh size effect is not significant the process of fracture initiation and propagation is similar to that of the laser welded stiffened panel examined in the previous section in all numerical simulations fracture initiates due to dsse on one side of the plate approximately 100 mm off the center in the undeformed configuration which is in perfect agreement with the experimental observations reported in alsos and amdahl 2009 fig 20 shows the post fracture initiation shapes obtained numerically with 20 and 15 mm mesh sizes and compares with a photograph of the test model fracture propagation could not be captured well with a cartesian mesh in this particular case as discussed in detail by woelke et al 2013 the results obtained for 1 fb were less satisfactory first of all the force displacement curves did not agree well after a certain punch displacement this issue has also been observed in other references abubakar and dow 2013 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b in the experiment the stiffener tripped and folded to the side subsequently fracture initiated in the base plate next to the weld toe as shown in fig 21 stiffener tripping was captured in the numerical simulation but the location of fracture initiation was not correct in addition fig 19 shows that for this particular case of 1 fb the displacement to fracture initiation increases with decreasing element size this mesh size sensitivity might be a geometrical one where the strain concentrations close to the weld toe cannot be captured with the relatively coarse mesh size considered the omission of weld modeling makes the numerical prediction of both force displacement response and ductile fracture prediction less credible therefore this particular experiment was less appropriate for assessing the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc model than the previous tests considered lastly a comparison is made with the results obtained by alsos et al 2009 in the simulation of their tests figs 22 and 23 show the force displacement curves obtained by alsos et al 2009 using the bwh and rtcl criteria for us and 1 fb respectively as mentioned earlier the bwh criterion is a stress based localized necking criterion therefore as evident in figs 22 and 23 the scatter of the predictions with respect to the mesh size is low the predicted displacements to fracture for the case of us are much lower than the experimental result as compared to the approach adopted in the present study the bwh criterion does not take into account the retardation of fracture due to bending loads and the loading path effect is not considered explicitly it may be argued that these two points cause the prediction of early fracture further the definition of the localized necking condition itself may be one of the reasons of the observed discrepancy as for the rtcl criterion the numerical results have a discrepancy with the test results similar to the results by kõrgesaar et al 2018 obtained with the cl criterion we emphasize that the mesh size regularization of fracture loci does not address the source of the mesh size sensitivity issue of shell elements properly which occurs if localized necking precedes fracture 6 final remarks a comprehensive numerical study was performed to evaluate the suitability of the dsse hc fracture model to simulate rupture in large thin walled structures due to biaxial stretching a step by step procedure was described which included the plasticity and ductile fracture model parameter identification and successful application of the calibrated fracture model with shell elements to an impact problem that is particularly important for the marine structures community the dsse hc model provides accurate estimates of the displacement to fracture initiation in the stiffened panel penetration tests the mesh size sensitivity is negligibly small with the dsse model because a localized necking criterion is adopted as the failure condition and mesh scaling is avoided in addition non proportionality of the loading path and bending effects were considered in a pragmatic way using the damage indicator framework and through thickness evaluation of localized necking criterion the simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the adopted approach as a result of this study further confidence in the dsse hc model was developed for practical applications on the other hand some important points that need to be considered in the future experimental and numerical studies should be mentioned here the presented fracture model is specific to s235jr grade steel further experimental research will be necessary to establish a dsse hc model parameter database for other metals of interest to impact engineering e g the steel grades used in ships and offshore structures an extension of the dsse hc model for the inclusion of rate dependent fracture and experimental validation is another pending topic such extension would be very beneficial for practitioners who deal with structural impact problems because most of the impact phenomena is due to loads applied suddenly

23000,the predictive capabilities of the hosford coulomb ductile fracture model for shell elements were evaluated by simulating the penetration of stiffened panel test models the plasticity and ductile fracture of the test model material s235jr grade steel were modeled using the results of tests reported in the literature which consisted of dog bone notched tension central hole tension and shear experiments the loading paths to ductile fracture initiation were extracted from finite element analyses with very fine solid element meshes the hosford coulomb fracture model parameters were identified using the extracted loading paths and adopting a linear damage accumulation law using the concept of the domain of shell to solid equivalence the calibrated fracture model was extended to shell finite elements subsequently the fracture model was used to simulate the stiffened panel penetration tests the calibrated fracture model provides an accurate estimation of ductile fracture initiation and ductile crack propagation while being relatively mesh insensitive for the particular problem considered graphical abstract image 1 keywords ductile fracture hosford coulomb model shell element domain of shell to solid equivalence ship collision and grounding 1 introduction ductile fracture initiation and propagation is an important aspect of the impact analysis of structures subjected to loads that may cause large plastic deformation beyond a moderate level in particular crashworthiness assessment of automobiles and analysis of the consequences of the collision and grounding of ships and offshore structures are important impact problems in which the prediction of ductile fracture has crucial importance for accurate forecasts of the structural behavior theoretical and experimental research in ductile fracture of metals has progressed remarkably in recent years benzerga et al 2016 boyce et al 2016 2014 on the other hand the application of ductile fracture models to the analysis of large plated structures is still cumbersome in industrial settings due to the high computational cost involved with very fine solid element meshes in addition the proto type testing of structures for crashworthiness analysis is apparently not a cost effective method therefore shell element based finite element analysis is often performed in practice shell elements have some limitations in capturing the ductile fracture behavior of plated structures that undergo large plastic deformation particularly after the onset of localized necking the present study examines the performance of a recently proposed approach that attempts to address the limitations of shell elements while maintaining the framework of phenomenological ductile fracture models ductile fracture models may be classified as porous plasticity inspired micro mechanical models gurson 1977 nahshon and hutchinson 2008 nielsen and tvergaard 2010 tvergaard and needleman 1984 xue 2008 continuum damage mechanics cdm based models bonora 1997 bonora et al 2005 lemaitre 1985 and phenomenological uncoupled models based on non porous plasticity and damage indicator framework bai and wierzbicki 2010 2015 bao and wierzbicki 2004 brünig et al 2008 gruben et al 2012 khan and liu 2012 lou et al 2017 2012 2014 mohr and marcadet 2015 wierzbicki et al 2005 phenomenological models might be favorable to practitioners because of their relative ease of calibration and implementation into commercial finite element software packages as well as proven accuracy of predicting ductile fracture initiation in thin plate sheets in phenomenological models ductile fracture initiation is assumed to occur when a scalar variable called damage indicator reaches a critical value the key concept is that the damage indicator accumulates with increasing equivalent plastic strain that is usually weighted using a stress state dependent function based on a comprehensive experimental study covering a wide range of stress states bao and wierzbicki 2004 proposed a fracture locus that was dependent on the stress triaxiality normalized first invariant of the stress tensor as the weighting function xue 2007 reported that the ductile fracture of materials depends on both the stress triaxiality and so called lode angle parameter which is a non dimensional parameter that represents the third invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor since then advanced ductile fracture models have been developed based on a transformation of the mohr coulomb type stress based fracture criteria to the space of stress triaxiality lode angle parameter and equivalent plastic strain such as the modified mohr coulomb mmc model by bai and wierzbicki 2010 and the hosford coulomb hc model by mohr and marcadet 2015 the latter was proven to be consistent because it preserves the stress based fracture initiation model after a transformation of the stress based failure criterion the hosford coulomb model has recently become quite popular owing to its simplicity accuracy flexibility and ease of calibration the model was applied successfully to simulate the onset of ductile fracture of automotive high strength steels erice et al 2018 mohr and marcadet 2015 pack and marcadet 2016 papasidero et al 2014 aluminum alloys gorji and mohr 2017 2018 papasidero et al 2015 and armor steels fras et al 2018 in addition it was extended to include the effects of the strain rate and temperature pack and roth 2016 roth and mohr 2014 strain reversal marcadet and mohr 2015 application to probabilistic fracture tancogne dejean et al 2016 and shell element based fracture analysis pack and mohr 2017 the last point is possibly the most attractive development for engineering applications including crashworthiness assessments of large thin walled structures such as ships and offshore platforms the plane stress assumption in shell element formulation is invalid after the onset of localized necking localized necking precedes the ductile fracture initiation under membrane biaxial tension loading conditions and it is the main reason behind the mesh size sensitivity of shell finite element solutions in practice simple mesh size dependent critical fracture strain criteria which do not consider the stress state nor loading path effect have often been used as a ductile fracture model see storheim et al 2015b for a detailed review of these approaches walters 2014 explored the idea of utilizing three dimensional fracture models for shell elements using a mesh size dependent fracture locus i e adjusting the fracture strain based on both the shell element size and stress triaxiality earlier lee 2005 proposed a mesh size regularization technique based on a damage indicator averaged over a characteristic volume element which partially eliminated the mesh size sensitivity similarly the averaging unit concept was developed kõrgesaar et al 2014 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 to model fracture initiation with shell elements under biaxial tension conditions kõrgesaar 2019 recently explored the capabilities of different fracture models that differently account low stress triaxialities and deformation history on the other hand storheim et al 2015a proposed an alternative method where a mesh size dependent damage model was used to model material softening after localized necking their model yielded relatively low mesh size sensitivity for predicting the energy dissipation in typical ship and offshore collision scenarios storheim et al 2015a stated that the mesh size effect in shell elements due to limitations of the plane stress assumption and localized necking material mesh sensitivity should be distinguished from geometric mesh sensitivity i e the ability to capture local strain concentrations accurately mesh regularization techniques focus on fracture initiation due to biaxial tension liu et al 2014 2017 the application of mesh scaled fracture strain would lead to an erroneous prediction of the instant of fracture initiation in the case of ductile fracture without localized necking such as in plane shear localization and surface cracking due to pure bending to address this issue pack and mohr 2017 conducted a systematic study on the applicability of shell elements to predict ductile fracture initiation by applying the same plasticity and fracture models solid and shell element solutions were compared for the case of a notched tension experiment where localized necking precedes ductile fracture and a punch experiment where localized necking is delayed until fracture initiation this comparison helped diagnose the issue with shell elements and led to the conclusion that the shell elements can be used confidently with the same fracture models developed for solid elements only if localized necking does not occur the concept of domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse was introduced to define the domain where the shell element solutions are valid a localized necking criterion under proportional load was developed which has a similar mathematical form to the hc model ductile fracture under biaxial stretching was assumed to occur at the instant of localized necking based on the argument that the displacement to fracture initiation is much larger than the thickness of the metal sheets consequently the dsse is combined with the hc model named as dsse hc model that can predict the onset of ductile fracture with shell elements for in plane shear localization surface cracking and biaxial fracture as a consequence of localized necking for both dsse and hc models the damage indicator framework was adopted to handle non proportional loading paths pack et al 2018 performed a validation study of the dsse hc model by simulating several fracture test specimens and triangular cup drawing experiments the dsse hc model provided a reliable estimate of the onset of ductile fracture and reduced the mesh size sensitivity considerably however it was stated by pack et al 2018 that the simulations would need to be repeated for different materials and material models the results presented by pack et al 2018 were quite encouraging and motivated the current study to investigate the performance of the dsse hc model further for the case of biaxial stretching of large plated structures liu et al 2018 reviewed the experiments and calculation procedures for ship collision and grounding and highlighted that membrane deformation and rupture of stiffened panels in side collision or stranding is one of the most primary energy absorbing mechanisms hence the impact scenario considered in the present paper is the quasi static indentation of a plate or a stiffened panel by a rigid punch which is very relevant to a collision and the grounding of ships and offshore structures alsos and amdahl 2009 alsos et al 2009 cho and lee 2009 gruben et al 2016 2017 karlsson et al 2009 kõrgesaar et al 2018 lee et al 2004 liu et al 2013 morin et al 2017 ringsberg et al 2018 simonsen and lauridsen 2000 villavicencio et al 2014 wang et al 2000 zhang et al 2018 a recently published paper by kõrgesaar et al 2018 presented an experimental study including both fracture specimens and laser welded stiffened panel penetration test results which are appropriate for calibrating the plasticity and fracture model parameters and assessing the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc fracture model in addition the tests by alsos and amdahl 2009 can be simulated using the same calibrated fracture model because the test models were made of the same steel type s235jr grade structural steel in this paper a hybrid experimental numerical approach which was described in detail by dunand and mohr 2010 was followed to obtain the loading path to the onset of fracture in the reported fracture tests by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the dsse hc fracture model parameters were identified using the numerically obtained loading paths to fracture initiation and the hardening function of the material a linear damage accumulation law was adopted to extend the application of the fracture model to non proportional loading paths simulations of the panel indentation tests were performed with different mesh sizes the force displacement responses displacement to fracture to initiation and ductile fracture propagation obtained from the simulations were compared with the test results the stress state at ductile fracture initiation loading path of the first failed elements and damage evolution were discussed 2 description of fracture experiments by kõrgesaar et al 2018 kõrgesaar et al 2018 conducted several quasi static tests to characterize the plasticity and fracture characteristics of 3 mm thick s235jr grade steel plates which were used to fabricate the stiffened panels tested under lateral indentation s235jr is a non alloyed structural steel that has applications in steel construction bridge building production facilities vehicle construction and wind towers although it does not carry the class designation it can be considered as a grade a shipbuilding steel the tests conducted by kõrgesaar et al 2018 consisted of four types of specimen geometries standard dog bone specimen with a 15 mm gauge width denoted as db uniaxial tension specimen with a central hole 4 mm in diameter and gauge width of 20 mm denoted as ch notched tension specimen with a 16 mm gauge width and a circular cut out with notch radius of 5 mm which are denoted as nt and smiley shear specimen which was adopted from the design with two symmetric gauge sections proposed by roth and mohr 2016 and optimized to delay fracture at the free edges prior to fracture initiation at the gauge section this specimen is denoted as sh fig 1 shows the specimen geometries according to kõrgesaar et al 2018 the specimens were cut from the base plate using a band saw while the gauge sections were machined using wire cutting edm the tension tests on these four specimen types were conducted using a servo mechanical loading frame under a constant cross head velocity of 2 1 and 0 2 mm min for the db ch and nt sh specimens respectively the test conditions can be assumed to quasi static and isothermal the dog bone specimen is utilized mainly for characterizing the elasto plastic response before the onset of diffuse necking unlike conventional dog bone specimens the central hole specimen with an optimal hole radius maintains a stress state that is very close to uniaxial tension even after the onset of fracture see roth and mohr 2016 in the notched tension specimen the stress state is the plane strain tension in the initial stages of loading the shear specimen is designed to maintain a pure shear state in the gauge part throughout the loading and eliminate fracture initiation at the edges with these four specimen types a wide of range of stress states can be achieved and the tension test results can be used to calibrate the plasticity and fracture model the digital image correlation dic technique was used to measure the surface strain and gauge displacements of db and nt specimens the dic technique was unsuccessful in the cases of the ch and sh specimens due to severe distortion of the speckle patterns on these specimens at the final stages of loading the dic surface strain measurements were used to identify the displacement at the onset of fracture initiation in each test kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not assess the anisotropy effects and it was assumed that the plasticity of s235jr grade steel is direction independent this assumption was followed in the present paper because general purpose structural steels usually exhibit isotropic plastic behavior 3 finite element analysis of fracture tests all fracture experiments including the tests with dog bone specimens were simulated using the non linear finite element analysis software abaqus explicit following the principles outlined by dunand and mohr 2010 the purpose of the simulations was to identify and validate the plasticity model parameters and obtain stress and strain fields inside the specimens up to ductile fracture initiation so that the loading paths can be identified only one eighth of the ch nt and db specimens were modeled due to symmetry about the mid surface horizontal and vertical planes for the sh specimen symmetry about the mid surface and vertical planes was considered in the symmetry planes the normal displacements were constrained all models were meshed using 8 node solid elements c3d8r from the abaqus element library with reduced the integration and default hourglass controls the gauge sections of the nt ch and db specimens were meshed with eight elements through the half thickness whereas in sh sixteen elements were deemed to be appropriate the resulting element edge lengths are 0 1875 and 0 09375 mm respectively note that these mesh sizes were obtained after performing a convergence study considering equivalent plastic strain and stress state parameters at the critical element that is assumed as the location of fracture initiation the simulations were run using the explicit solver of abaqus by applying the displacement to fracture initiation reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 to decrease the computational cost the mass scaling option was activated to yield approximately 150 000 time increments all specimens were assumed to have the elastic constants young s modulus e and poisson s ratio ν as 201 gpa and 0 3 respectively and the material density ρ was taken as 7 85 t m3 fig 2 shows the finite element mesh of the specimens 3 1 plasticity model parameter identification the plastic behavior of s235jr grade steel was modeled using the standard plasticity theory with an isotropic von mises yield surface the von mises yield surface expressed as eq 1 is a function of the von mises equivalent stress σ and the deformation resistance k 1 f σ k σ k 0 2 σ 3 j 2 where j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor in addition the associated flow rule was assumed 3 d ε p d ε p σ σ where d ε p denotes the increment in plastic strain vector and d ε p is the equivalent plastic strain increment which is defined as the work conjugate of von mises equivalent stress 4 σ d ε p σ d ε p the deformation resistance k is a function of only the equivalent plastic strain 5 k f ε p the monotonic loading paths in the tests suggest that isotropic hardening model is appropriate the swift hardening model was adopted and the existence of lüders plateau was considered 6 k f ε p σ 0 if ε p ε l a ε 0 ε p n if ε p ε l kõrgesaar et al 2018 identified the swift law parameters a ε 0 n and the plateau parameters σ 0 ε l from the dog bone specimen test results by curve fitting to the true stress equivalent plastic strain data before the onset of diffuse necking these parameters were also used in the present study for the post necking range where the strain distribution becomes non uniform the swift law was extrapolated as a first attempt the force displacement curve of the nt specimen was used for validation because the reduced gauge area ensures that localization occurs all the way to fracture fig 3 compares the simulation and test results beyond the instant of onset of fracture reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 it is apparent that extrapolating the swift law for strains beyond the diffuse necking is appropriate for this particular material a further validation of the adopted plasticity model may be made using the results of other specimens table 1 lists the hardening parameters identified and fig 4 shows the corresponding hardening curve the plasticity model was implemented into abaqus explicit using the vumat user defined material subroutine the return mapping algorithm elastic predictor and plastic corrector scheme was used to obtain the state variables at each strain increment 3 2 description of stress state the stress state of an isotropic ductile solid can be described fully by the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter θ these two non dimensional parameters stress state parameters can be expressed in terms of the stress tensor invariants 7 i 1 tr σ 8 j 2 1 2 s s 9 j 3 det s i 1 is the first invariant of the cauchy stress tensor σ whereas j 2 and j 3 are the second and third invariants of the deviatoric part of the cauchy stress tensor s 10 s σ 1 3 i 1 i where i is the identity matrix the stress triaxiality η and lode angle parameter 1 θ 1 are expressed as follows 11 η i 1 3 3 j 2 12 θ 1 2 π arccos 3 3 2 j 3 j 2 3 2 under plane stress condition σ 3 0 it may be shown that lode angle parameter is a function of stress triaxiality 13 θ 1 2 π arccos 27 2 η η 2 1 3 using the above equation the possible plane stress states can be plotted easily as shown in fig 5 note the stress triaxiality and lode angle parameter values corresponding to certain plane stress states such as in plane shear uniaxial tension plane strain tension and equi biaxial tension in addition note that the upper limit of stress triaxiality under plane stress condition is 2 3 3 3 loading paths to fracture the loading path to fracture initiation i e stress triaxiality and lode angle parameter histories up to the onset of fracture as a function of the equivalent plastic strain at the most highly strained element were extracted from the numerical simulations because the location of the onset of fracture is not known experimentally the most highly strained element usually changes throughout the loading particularly after the onset of necking the assumed instants of fracture initiation corresponds to those reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 note that in this paper a hybrid numerical experimental analysis was followed in which the results are affected by the uncertainties in both numerical modeling as well as in the experiments see dunand and mohr 2010 for a detailed discussion of this point according to the numerical results in the db ch and nt specimens the most highly strained element is inside the specimen at half thickness while in the sh specimen it is on the surface at the gauge section in the ch specimen it is located on the hole boundary while in the db specimen the onset of fracture is located at the center of the gauge in the nt and sh specimens the critical element is slightly off the center of the gauge section fig 6 shows the exact location and the equivalent plastic strain value of the critical element for each specimen at the instant of fracture initiation observed in the tests fig 7 compares the numerical and experimental force displacement curves up to the displacement corresponding to the assumed instants of fracture initiation this comparison may be considered as a further validation of the adopted plasticity model the force displacement curves of the nt db and sh specimens were predicted accurately whereas some discrepancies exist for the case of the ch specimen particularly before the onset of fracture this issue was also reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 who attempted to address it by employing a rate dependent hardening function in this paper however such adjustment of the numerical results was not deemed necessary kõrgesaar et al 2018 noted that the reproducibility of the ch specimen test results was not good the machining of the central hole has a significant effect on the force displacement response of the ch specimens which causes uncertainty for numerical modeling and simulation for the comparison shown in the present paper the test result of the specimen denoted as ch 1 3 was used in the case of the sh specimen the force displacement curves and displacement to fracture initiation in the two tests performed by kõrgesaar et al 2018 also showed some scatter the test results of the s1 3 specimen was adopted in the present study fig 8 shows the evolution of the stress triaxiality and lode angle parameters for each specimen as a function of the increasing equivalent plastic strain a loading path is considered proportional if the stress state parameters stress triaxiality and lode parameter remain constant up to the point of fracture initiation none of the present tests exhibited a proportional loading path in the db specimen after the onset of diffuse necking the uniaxial tension state was not maintained similarly the loading path of the nt specimen was inclined after the onset of localized necking in contrast to expectation the ch specimen is not perfectly in a uniaxial tension state throughout the loading to fracture initiation as reported by roth and mohr 2016 the optimal central hole diameter for achieving a uniaxial tension state is strongly dependent on the hardening behavior of the material of interest for s235jr a better result could have been achieved with a slightly larger hole diameter regarding the sh specimen the stress triaxiality and particularly lode angle parameter vary towards the onset of fracture it should be noted that the design of a pure shear specimen is an unresolved challenge in the ductile fracture community in the case of highly ductile metals e g s235jr grade steel as evident from fig 8 the design of the test specimens with proportional loading paths to fracture initiation is even more challenging 4 ductile fracture characterization 4 1 hosford coulomb fracture model for proportional loading mohr and marcadet 2015 proposed the phenomenological hosford coulomb hc model to predict ductile fracture initiation under proportional loading the hc fracture model describes the fracture initiation in an un cracked solid undergoing proportional loading paths it defines the ductility limits of a solid for various stress states here the term ductility should be understood as a mesh independent material specific property therefore for each material for the case of marine structures for each grade of steel and aluminum alloys the hc model parameters should be identified separately the hc model was developed based on micro mechanical observations and assumes that the onset of fracture is imminent with the formation of a shear localization on the macroscopic scale such a condition may be expressed conveniently as a stress based criterion mohr and marcadet 2015 modified the mohr coulomb criterion by expressing it as a linear combination of the hosford equivalent stress and the normal stress acting on the plane of maximum shear stress reaching a critical value b 14 σ h f c σ 1 σ 3 b here σ 1 σ 2 and σ 3 are the principal stresses σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 c is the friction coefficient in the mohr coulomb criterion the hosford equivalent stress can be expressed as 15 σ h f 1 2 σ 1 σ 2 a σ 1 σ 3 a σ 2 σ 3 a 1 a note that for a 2 the hosford equivalent stress becomes the von mises equivalent stress equation 14 can be transformed to spherical coordinates i e so called haigh westergaard space σ η θ and the fracture surface for proportional loading ε f p r can be expressed in mixed stress strain space η θ ε f using the inverse of isotropic power law type hardening law consequently hosford coulomb fracture criterion for a strictly proportional loading can be expressed as 16 ε f p r η θ b 1 c 1 n f g η θ with 17 g η θ 1 2 f 1 f 2 a f 1 f 3 a f 2 f 3 a 1 a c 2 η f 1 f 3 1 n f the lode angle parameter dependent functions can be written as 18 f 1 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ 19 f 2 θ 2 3 cos π 6 3 θ 20 f 3 θ 2 3 cos π 6 1 θ the transformation coefficient n f is always set to 0 1 mohr and marcadet 2015 therefore the hosford coulomb model has three parameters to be identified a b and c the parameter a hosford exponent controls the lode angle sensitivity effect of deviatoric stress while the stress triaxiality sensitivity effect of hydrostatic stress is primarily controlled by the parameter c friction coefficient in mohr coulomb failure criterion the parameter b controls the overall magnitude of the strains to fracture for proportional loading it is equal to the fracture strain for uniaxial tension or equi biaxial tension under proportional loading paths hence it can be identified easily if proportional tests for any of these two cases are available see roth and mohr 2016 for a detailed discussion of this point 4 2 damage accumulation law linear damage accumulation law as given below is used in association with the hosford coulomb fracture model to consider the loading path effects 21 d d h c d ε p ε f p r η θ where d d h c is the differential damage indicator fischer et al 1995 fracture is assumed to initiate when the integration of eq 22 is equal to unity 22 d h c 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 here ε f is the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to the instant of fracture initiation d h c 0 1 is a scalar variable that represents the relative reduction of ductility of the material the damage accumulation law is linear such that there is a linear relationship between the damage indicator d h c and the equivalent plastic strain increment d ε p this form of damage accumulation law works well for monotonous loading conditions such as those observed in the tests utilized in the present study however loading reversals usually require the implementation of non linear damage accumulation law see marcadet and mohr 2015 papasidero et al 2015 the evolution of d h c has no direct physical meaning and is not associated with the micro mechanical behavior of the material void nucleation growth and coalescence process in addition the damage indicator parameter d h c has no effect on the elasto plastic material behavior hence uncoupled model the damage indicator framework for uncoupled models should not be confused with the internal damage variable in cdm which represents the reduction in the effective load carrying capacity due to material degradation and is coupled with elasto plastic behavior the damage indicator parameter should be viewed as a mathematical tool to handle the loading history effect fischer et al 1995 4 3 fracture model parameter identification the hc fracture model parameters α a b c were identified using an inverse method the residual was defined as a square error following the condition that the damage indicator is equal to unity at the instant of fracture initiation 23 r 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ 1 2 consequently the parameter identification problem was formulated as an optimization problem that aimed to minimize the least square error function λ α 24 α arg min λ α with λ α i 1 4 0 ε f d ε p ε f p r η θ i 1 2 here the index i corresponds to the particular test considered for calibration the numerically obtained loading paths of all four experiments were included in the parameter identification process the optimization problem was solved using the matlab program with a derivative free algorithm to solve the constrained minimization problems the hosford coulomb fracture model parameters identified were a 1 501 b 1 489 c 0 023 fig 9 shows a 3d plot of the identified hosford coulomb fracture locus for proportional loading the thick black line highlights the fracture limit for the plane stress conditions the effect of the lode angle parameter on the ductile fracture of s235jr grade steel is evident here the strain to fracture decreases monotonically with increasing stress triaxiality for cases of generalized shear axisymmetric tension and axisymmetric compression however a valley exists between these distinct loading conditions due to the lode angle effect the fracture locus under the plane stress condition is as shown in fig 10 the effect of the lode angle parameter are represented here with the biaxial tension valley in other words the ductility of the s235jr grade steel under plane strain tension is less than that under uniaxial or equi biaxial tension another important effect of the lode angle parameter can be observed on the fracture strain under in plane shear the ductility for in plane shear is less than that for uniaxial tension it should be emphasized that the histories of the stress state parameters and the equivalent plastic strain at the assumed location of fracture initiation used in the fracture model parameter identification were obtained from the finite element analysis the finite element models of the test specimens were meshed with very fine 3d solid elements to obtain a converged resolution of the stress and strain fields the solid elements are not subject to material mesh sensitivity in contrast to the shell elements and a converged solution can be obtained with mesh refinement hence the calibrated hc model for solid elements is not a mesh size related fracture strain model provided that in the parameter identification process a converged mesh configuration for extracting the histories of stress state parameters and equivalent plastic strain of the critical element is used 4 4 domain of shell to solid equivalence the hc ductile fracture model which is originally defined for applications using very fine 3d solid elements cannot be directly used for shell elements under certain circumstances shell elements are based on the assumption of plane stress conditions as demonstrated by pack and mohr 2017 who compared solid and shell element simulation results for various cases employing the hc model the shell element solutions lose their meaning if localized necking precedes ductile fracture the material mesh size sensitivity is due this shortcoming of the shell elements localized necking occurs in the biaxial tension regime 1 3 η 2 3 and only if all through thickness integration points of a shell element satisfy the localized necking criterion pack and mohr 2017 showed that in other cases the hc ductile fracture model can be directly used for shell elements to overcome the shortcoming of the shell elements the onset of localized necking may be defined as a failure condition according to pack and mohr 2017 the domain of shell to solid equivalence dsse defines the domain where the plane stress assumption in a shell element formulation remains valid and the same fracture criterion as for solids can be applied to the shell elements after performing marciniak kuczynski type analysis with a unit cell model pack and mohr 2017 developed a localized necking criterion which is valid in the biaxial tension domain 1 3 η 2 3 under a proportional membrane load and has a similar parametric form to that of the hosford coulomb model 25 ε d s s e p r η b 1 2 g 1 g 2 d g 1 d g 2 d 1 d 1 p f the stress triaxiality dependent functions g 1 and g 2 can be expressed as 26 g 1 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 27 g 2 η 3 2 η 1 3 3 4 η 2 where the recommended value of the exponent p f is 0 01 the damage indicator for localized necking under a non proportional loading is defined as being similar to that of the hosford coulomb fracture model 28 d d d s s e d ε p ε d s s e p r η the localized necking criterion is satisfied in a through thickness integration point of a shell element if d d s s e reaches unity to distinguish the membrane and bending loading it is postulated that failure of a shell element due localized necking occurs if all integration points through the thickness in z direction fulfill the necking criterion i e d d s s e z 1 z t 2 t 2 where t is the shell element thickness the key assumption made by pack and mohr 2017 is that when localized necking precedes ductile fracture the difference between the displacement to the onset of localized necking and fracture initiation will be very small because the displacement at the length scale is usually much larger than the plate thickness therefore the displacement to the onset of localized necking may be assumed to be the failure displacement it is claimed that by defining the localized necking as a failure condition and ignoring the post necking zone completely the material mesh size sensitivity which occurs after the onset of localized necking is largely reduced this is the same pragmatic approach followed by alsos et al 2009 who used a stress based forming limit curve namely bwh as the localized necking condition as expressed in eq 25 an extension of the hosford coulomb model for shell element application using the concept of dsse adds another parameter d to be identified identifying this parameter using the hardening function of the material of interest is relatively straightforward first the equivalent plastic strain corresponding to localized necking ε d s s e p s t is determined using the considère criterion for the plane strain tension condition note that diffuse necking does not occur under plane strain tension conditions 29 k ε d s s e p s t 2 3 d k ε d s s e p s t d ε p the parameter d is then obtained by substituting η 1 3 and ε d s s e p s t into eq 25 and solving the following implicit equation 30 1 2 d 1 1 d 3 ε d s s e p s t b p f for s235jr grade steel the above equations yield ε d s s e p s t 0 235 and d 1 6979 fig 11 presents the fracture locus and localized necking envelope of s235jr table 2 lists all parameters identified for the dsse hc model 4 5 numerical implementation of dsse hc model for shell elements as shown in fig 11 the dsse hc model for shell elements is able to describe three types failure fracture preceded by localized necking defined by the dsse localized necking envelope for the domain 1 3 η 2 3 fracture not preceded by localized necking i e surface cracking due to predominant bending loads defined by the hc fracture locus for the domain 1 3 η 2 3 fracture due to in plane shear localization defined by the hc fracture locus for the domain 0 η 1 3 the dsse hc model is based on the damage indicator framework in which a scalar variable d defined separately for ductile fracture and localized necking as d h c and d d s s e respectively is calculated for each through thickness integration point as the accumulated equivalent plastic strain weighted with a stress state dependent function this model has two key features the effect of loading path variations of stress state is taken into account for both ductile fracture and localized necking with a through thickness evaluation of the localized necking criterion the membrane and bending loads are distinguished and the retardation of fracture due to predominant bending loads is accounted for the failure due to the hc model is based on the condition that d h c 1 is satisfied at any through thickness integration point of a shell element once it is satisfied the stress of that particular integration point is set to zero integration point is deleted not the element therefore hc is a local failure model the failure due to the dsse model is based on the condition that d d s s e 1 is satisfied at all through thickness integration points of a shell element once all through thickness integration points satisfy the failure condition the stresses of all integration points are set to zero all integration point are deleted thus dsse is a non local failure model that evaluates the status of a shell element as a whole it is interesting to note that many failure models in the literature which are based on a localized necking criterion such as the bwh criterion by alsos et al 2009 and the forming limit diagrams flds in abaqus consider only the failure of the mid layer integration point as the criterion for element removal the dsse model addresses the shortcoming of this assumption in abaqus a shell element is deleted removed from the mesh if the stresses of all integration points are equal to zero based on the above explanations it is apparent that when using the dsse hc fracture model for shell elements the element removal may occur either due to the hc ductile fracture model or the dsse localized necking model in summary the hc dsse model combines a localized necking criterion enhanced to account for bending effects and ductile fracture initiation model to predict the onset of ductile fracture using shell finite elements a user defined vumat subroutine was developed for shell element applications implementing the return mapping algorithm for the plasticity calculations and the hosford coulomb fracture model coupled with the dsse the plane stress condition was enforced using the nested iteration algorithm which is described elsewhere neto et al 2008 the vumat subroutine calculates the damage and localized necking indicators at the integration points through the thickness of a shell element an element is deleted removed only if all integration points fail either by satisfying the ductile fracture initiation criterion or localized necking criterion 5 simulation of panel penetration tests 5 1 laser welded stiffened panel test by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the calibrated dsse hc model was used to simulate the stiffened panel penetration tests reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 the stiffened panels were 1200 1200 mm square plates flat bar stiffeners with a 30 mm web height and 120 mm spacing were welded using a laser welding technique both the plate and stiffeners were 3 mm the test panels were bolted on the testing frame with clamping plates and back support plates the unclamped dimensions of the panels were 960 960 mm a hemispherical indenter with a punch radius of 120 mm was forced to penetrate through the center of the test panels with a velocity of 10 mm min fig 12 shows the stiffened panel geometry and experimental setup the indenter surface was polished to minimize the friction effects in total five penetration tests were conducted of which four of them focused on center indentation the precise location of indentation in each test was also reported following kõrgesaar et al 2018 the force displacement curve and photographs of the test panel denoted as sp 4 were taken as a reference for a comparison with the numerical simulations the stiffened panel penetration tests were simulated using the software package abaqus explicit and employing the developed vumat subroutine the unclamped part of the stiffened panel was modeled and meshed with four node reduced integration shell elements s4r in abaqus element library five through thickness integration points and default hourglassing were chosen a uniform mesh with different element edge lengths mesh size were considered 20 15 10 7 5 5 and 2 5 mm symmetry conditions were not applied because the indenter hit the stiffened panel slightly off center the boundaries of the stiffened panels were set as fully clamped detailed modeling of the clamping setup was not deemed necessary because the numerical force displacement results with fully clamped edges agreed well with the test results the punch was modeled with rigid elements and positioned to hit the stiffened panel at the first contact point measured in the sp 4 test offset from panel corner x 598 mm y 593 mm fig 13 presents the finite element model with a mesh size of 15 mm the contact between the punch and stiffened panel was modeled with the general contact algorithm in abaqus explicit the tangential contact behavior was modeled using a friction coefficient of 0 23 and a penalty type formulation this friction coefficient was given by kõrgesaar et al 2018 citing karlsson et al 2009 who conducted tests with a similar setup and material and measured the friction coefficient the normal contact behavior was modeled with hard contact pressure overclosure the punch was forced to penetrate through the stiffened panel at a constant rate the total simulation duration was set to 0 4 s which is long enough to keep the inertial effects negligible fig 14 shows the force displacement curves obtained with different mesh sizes and compares them with the test results the numerical simulations captured the force displacement response with great accuracy the displacement to the onset of fracture with different mesh sizes is not subject to significant variations and overall is very close to the test result the peak force was underestimated slightly with fine meshes i e 7 5 5 and 2 5 mm mesh sizes the predicted displacement to the onset of fracture also decreased slightly with decreasing element size in addition the sudden decrease in force associated with fracture initiation in the panel was captured well by all mesh sizes fig 15 presents the post fracture initiation shape of the test panel predicted numerically with different mesh sizes with some photographs provided by kõrgesaar et al 2018 according to kõrgesaar et al 2018 fracture was first initiated on the plate between two stiffeners and propagated parallel to the stiffeners independently fracture initiated in a second location and propagated in the transverse direction across the stiffener upon further loading this secondary fracture propagated towards the stiffener and eventually the stiffener was totally fractured see the photos in fig 15 the numerical simulations with different mesh sizes capture the experimentally observed fracture initiation and propagation albeit with some minor differences in the instants of each stage of fracture propagation in all numerical simulations fracture was initiated when the damage indicator parameter for localized necking d d s s e reached unity at all five through thickness integration points fig 16 shows the evolution of d d s s e d h c and η in the integration points located at top contact side and bottom surface of the element that fails first in the model with a 15 mm mesh size the dsse hc model for fracture prediction in the case of biaxial stretching of thin walled structures is illustrated well in this figure the stress state i e stress triaxiality has a significant influence on the damage accumulation for localized necking even though the stress triaxiality varies only slightly from 0 56 to 0 66 throughout loading until failure this result is not surprising because the localized necking envelope showed a sharp decrease in that range of stress triaxialities fig 11 moreover damage indicator for the hc model ductile fracture indicator is less than the damage indicator for the dsse model necking indicator at the instant of localized necking initiation note also the differences between the stress state and damage value evolution for the top and bottom surfaces of the shell element as indicated earlier failure occurs if all integration points satisfy the condition d d s s e 1 for this particular case this condition is first satisfied on the top surface and the element is deleted once the bottom surface integration point also fails kõrgesaar et al 2018 simulated the same tests using so called 2fs and cockcroft latham cl criteria the 2fs criterion is based on the framework proposed by walters 2014 where the fracture locus is scaled between the two extremes defined by a necking locus and a plane stress ductile fracture locus respectively in walters framework the fracture locus is scaled not only based on the mesh size and but also the stress state kõrgesaar et al 2018 employ a diffuse necking criterion swifts diffuse necking criterion as the lower bound which is considered appropriate for coarsely meshed shell elements for very fine shell elements the upper bound applies which is defined by the modified mohr coulomb mmc fracture locus under plane stress assumption the mmc model which is intended for very fine mesh solid elements is calibrated under plane stress assumption using solid elements with different mesh size moreover the fracture model is calibrated based on the average value of stress triaxiality history on the other hand the fracture locus defined by the cl criterion is scaled only with the mesh size it is calibrated in a similar way using different mesh sizes but only considering the fracture strain corresponding to uniaxial tension the default element removal option in abaqus is used for both criteria where the stress of a through thickness integration point is set to zero once it satisfies the failure condition and an element is deleted if all through thickness integration points fail it is evident that there are distinct differences between the approaches used in the present study and by kõrgesaar et al 2018 first of all kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not consider localized necking and fracture are as distinct failure modes instead of a localized necking condition which is the main issue of the shell elements a diffuse necking condition is adopted for coarsely meshed elements we argue that this assumption will yield an early prediction of failure as compared to the localized necking condition further it is assumed that with a mesh refinement the fracture locus under plane stress assumption will converge for shell elements here the main issue with 2fs criterion is the calibration procedure of the mmc criterion a constitutive assumption of the plane stress condition from the beginning to the end of plastic deformation all the way to the fracture is unrealistic if localized necking precedes fracture indeed walters and voormeeren 2014 showed that this assumption is incorrect and has non negligible effects in the tests by kõrgesaar et al 2018 db nt and ch specimens do not satisfy plane stress assumption at the instant of fracture initiation mesh refinement in addition kõrgesaar et al 2018 did not take into account the effect of bending deformation by considering through thickness stress gradients and treating the shell element as whole when localized necking precedes fracture lastly fracture strain is non unique if the average stress triaxiality is used in the fracture locus calibration because there are infinite number of ways to get the same stress triaxiality under varying loading paths in the present paper the calibration is done under varying loading history by minimizing the difference between the calculated damage indicator using the measured displacement to fracture and the value of unity fig 17 shows the force displacement curves reported by kõrgesaar et al 2018 using the 2fs and cl criteria the 2fs criterion with mesh size regularization provides an accurate estimate of the displacement to fracture initiation with very low scatter with respect to the mesh size this is not surprising because considering the range of stress triaxialities observed in the first failed element which are reported in the present study the mesh size regularization in the 2fs criterion yields a relatively small scale factor for the diffuse necking criterion therefore it may be argued that even without a mesh size regularization the scatter in fracture displacement would be less this is consistent with the results obtained using the fracture modeling approach adopted in the present study the inclusion of the bending effects and the definition of the lower bound with a localized necking criterion would improve the accuracy as shown in the present study on the other hand the cl criterion with a mesh size regularization exhibits a very large scatter in predicting fracture displacement it is evident that the use of a fracture locus in this case cl criterion which is actually intended for very fine solid elements with a mesh size regularization for shell element applications is less credible as compared to the dsse hc model 5 2 unstiffened and stiffened panel tests by alsos and amdahl 2009 the unstiffened and stiffened panel penetration test results presented by alsos and amdahl 2009 provides an additional opportunity to assess the capabilities of the calibrated dsse hc model for s235jr steel because the test models were fabricated using the same material these tests have been the subject of many numerical studies which focused on ship grounding and collision analysis abubakar and dow 2013 alsos et al 2009 kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b woelke et al 2013 a comparison of all the numerical results reported in the literature and the dsse hc model predictions in the present paper would be beyond the scope of the study however the readers are encouraged to refer to the cited sources for a better understanding of the contribution and potential of the dsse hc model fig 18 shows the geometry and dimensions of the test models and experimental setup two test models were considered an unstiffened monolithic plate us and a plate with a flat bar stiffener welded at the center 1 fb the panels penetrated at the center with a slowly moving rigid cone shaped indenter with a spherical nose the target plates were 5 mm thick and arc welded to a frame made from 12 5 mm thick high strength steel grade s355nh plates both the plate and stiffeners were s235jr steel which mechanical properties obtained by alsos and amdahl 2009 using standard tensile tests the swift law hardening parameters given in alsos and amdahl 2009 were different for the plate and flat bar stiffener components and more importantly were not similar to those given by kõrgesaar et al 2018 in the numerical simulations the hardening parameters provided by alsos and amdahl 2009 were used even though this may cause some uncertainty in the calibrated fracture model alsos and amdahl did not measure the friction coefficient in their numerical simulations alsos et al 2009 it was assumed that the friction coefficient would be equal to 0 3 claiming that this is a reasonable assumption for friction between coated steel surfaces in the present study the friction coefficient was assumed to be 0 23 for the sake of consistency with the simulations in the previous section the numerical simulations were performed using the same modeling details as those applied in the previous section the numerical model included the thick support frame welded to the target plates the bottom surface of the support frame was assumed to be simply supported in their numerical simulations of stiffened panels alsos et al 2009 increased the thickness of the elements in the vicinity of the welds this modeling approach has been followed elsewhere abubakar and dow 2013 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b however in the present work the weld elements with an artificially increased thickness were not included because they require a much smaller mesh size than the rest of the model in the numerical simulations mesh sizes of 25 20 and 15 mm which correspond to 5 t 4 t and 3 t respectively were considered alsos et al 2009 stated that there was some offset between the target center and the punch and in the numerical simulations the punch was set to hit the plate 5 mm from the center the same assumption was made in the present study fig 19 compares the numerical and test results in terms of the force displacement response note that the unloading reloading in the test result was due to the limited stroke of the hydraulic jack used in the tests overall the agreement between the test and numerical results with a relatively coarse mesh is very close in the case of us and the mesh size effect is not significant the process of fracture initiation and propagation is similar to that of the laser welded stiffened panel examined in the previous section in all numerical simulations fracture initiates due to dsse on one side of the plate approximately 100 mm off the center in the undeformed configuration which is in perfect agreement with the experimental observations reported in alsos and amdahl 2009 fig 20 shows the post fracture initiation shapes obtained numerically with 20 and 15 mm mesh sizes and compares with a photograph of the test model fracture propagation could not be captured well with a cartesian mesh in this particular case as discussed in detail by woelke et al 2013 the results obtained for 1 fb were less satisfactory first of all the force displacement curves did not agree well after a certain punch displacement this issue has also been observed in other references abubakar and dow 2013 marinatos and samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015a b in the experiment the stiffener tripped and folded to the side subsequently fracture initiated in the base plate next to the weld toe as shown in fig 21 stiffener tripping was captured in the numerical simulation but the location of fracture initiation was not correct in addition fig 19 shows that for this particular case of 1 fb the displacement to fracture initiation increases with decreasing element size this mesh size sensitivity might be a geometrical one where the strain concentrations close to the weld toe cannot be captured with the relatively coarse mesh size considered the omission of weld modeling makes the numerical prediction of both force displacement response and ductile fracture prediction less credible therefore this particular experiment was less appropriate for assessing the predictive capabilities of the dsse hc model than the previous tests considered lastly a comparison is made with the results obtained by alsos et al 2009 in the simulation of their tests figs 22 and 23 show the force displacement curves obtained by alsos et al 2009 using the bwh and rtcl criteria for us and 1 fb respectively as mentioned earlier the bwh criterion is a stress based localized necking criterion therefore as evident in figs 22 and 23 the scatter of the predictions with respect to the mesh size is low the predicted displacements to fracture for the case of us are much lower than the experimental result as compared to the approach adopted in the present study the bwh criterion does not take into account the retardation of fracture due to bending loads and the loading path effect is not considered explicitly it may be argued that these two points cause the prediction of early fracture further the definition of the localized necking condition itself may be one of the reasons of the observed discrepancy as for the rtcl criterion the numerical results have a discrepancy with the test results similar to the results by kõrgesaar et al 2018 obtained with the cl criterion we emphasize that the mesh size regularization of fracture loci does not address the source of the mesh size sensitivity issue of shell elements properly which occurs if localized necking precedes fracture 6 final remarks a comprehensive numerical study was performed to evaluate the suitability of the dsse hc fracture model to simulate rupture in large thin walled structures due to biaxial stretching a step by step procedure was described which included the plasticity and ductile fracture model parameter identification and successful application of the calibrated fracture model with shell elements to an impact problem that is particularly important for the marine structures community the dsse hc model provides accurate estimates of the displacement to fracture initiation in the stiffened panel penetration tests the mesh size sensitivity is negligibly small with the dsse model because a localized necking criterion is adopted as the failure condition and mesh scaling is avoided in addition non proportionality of the loading path and bending effects were considered in a pragmatic way using the damage indicator framework and through thickness evaluation of localized necking criterion the simulation results demonstrated the effectiveness of the adopted approach as a result of this study further confidence in the dsse hc model was developed for practical applications on the other hand some important points that need to be considered in the future experimental and numerical studies should be mentioned here the presented fracture model is specific to s235jr grade steel further experimental research will be necessary to establish a dsse hc model parameter database for other metals of interest to impact engineering e g the steel grades used in ships and offshore structures an extension of the dsse hc model for the inclusion of rate dependent fracture and experimental validation is another pending topic such extension would be very beneficial for practitioners who deal with structural impact problems because most of the impact phenomena is due to loads applied suddenly

23001,with the increasing marine activities in the arctic area the demand for reliable designs of marine structures in this area is growing there have been many studies published regarding simulation of ice marine structure interaction in these studies ice models are established without considering initial defects however natural ice usually contains lots of initial defects including cracks inclusions pores etc in this paper this issue is studied by applying defect model and cohesive element method cem several ice bulk elements labeled as initial defects are deleted from the ice sheet then cohesive elements are inserted in the ice sheet model that is meshed with tetrahedron elements collision between ice sheet and a lighthouse is simulated in full scale initiation and propagation of ice sheet cracks are achieved by deleting the cohesive elements that reach fracture energy horizontal force and failure process of ice sheet are analyzed the results show that the initial defects can affect both the horizontal force and fracture of ice sheet then a series of simulations in terms of distribution percentage and size of ice sheet defects are performed effects of these factors on the horizontal force and crack propagation are discussed keywords ice lighthouse interaction initial defects fracture behaviors cohesive element method 1 introduction ships and marine structures operating in the arctic ocean suffer a big risk of collision with ice sheet on the collision interface of marine structure and ice micro structure changes such as micro cracks pressure melting and recrystallization dominate ice failure process xiao 1997 jordaan 2001 while in the area near and far from the collision interface large cracks play an important role in ice sheet failure palmer et al 1983 as shown in fig 1 there are four typical fracture modes generated in the collision between vertical cylinder structure and ice sheet a crushing fracture involves the growth of cracks in different directions with no obvious preferred orientation through a zone whose dimensions are of the same order as the contact breadth and less than the ice thickness b indentation spalling occurs when horizontal cracks run roughly parallel to the plane of the ice until they run out on the upper or lower surface c radial crack is the growth of vertical cracks directed radially from the contact region and running through the whole thickness d circumferential crack often happens when the contact region undergoes local crushing while radial cracks develop further away to study the influence of large cracks on collision process between ice sheet and marine structure many researchers built theoretical failure modes of ice sheet for example zou et al 1996 applied kendall s double cantilever beam theory to the study of the role of fracture and spalling in ice structure interaction lu et al 2015 built a theory model of splitting cracks that run along navigation direction in front of the ship bow numerical method is another important way to study ice sheet crack comparing with theoretical method numerical method can analyze problems with much more complicated boundary currently there are three prevailing kinds of numerical methods applied to the simulation of ice sheet fracture gürtner 2009 discrete element method dem lattice method and finite element method fem since 2009 cohesive element method has been gradually introduced to ice crack simulation it belongs to the fem method and had been widely applied to the brittle crack simulation needleman 1987 xu and needleman 1994 turon et al 2006 gürtner 2009 inserted cohesive elements at all inter element boundaries of regular hexahedron ice elements and simulated initiation and propagation of ice fractures using opening and deletion of cohesive elements konuk et al 2009a 2009b 2010 made a comprehensive review of the cohesive element framework for dynamic ice structure interaction problems including brief introduction of cohesive zone model that is the basis of cohesive element method the formulation of cohesive element method and some simple simulation cases gürtner et al 2010 and hilding et al 2011 simulated interaction between ice sheet and the vertical sided lighthouse norströmsgrund they discussed response of the lighthouse time histories of contact forces and effects of ice model määttänen et al 2011 conducted impact experiments between ice sheet and vertical steel plate in laboratory scale and kuutti et al 2013 simulated these experiments using cohesive elements and triangular ice element in two dimension scale lu et al 2014 inserted cohesive elements between each triangular prism ice elements making crack propagate more arbitrarily than that of ice sheet meshed with hexahedron elements nevertheless their ice sheet model consisted of only one layer of ice elements which means crack randomness can only be satisfied in plane instead of in the whole 3d ice sheet feng et al 2016 studied parameter sensitivities of cohesive element method such as energy release rate elastic stiffness and stress separation relations wang et al 2018 simulated the interaction between sloping marine structure and level ice based on cohesive element model and conducted the mesh dependency study and a series of parametric analysis on the main parameters of models the ice sheet studied by previous researchers is considered as a structure without any defects however a natural ice sheet contains lots of defects including cracks inclusions pores grain boundaries and others gold 1963 geoge 1986 grishina and buch 2004 stander 2006 the size of these defects is on micro level and can be observed by eyes sometimes li et al 2010 made some in situ observations of ice growth and decay processes according to their study four kinds of air bubbles were observed in the ice the size of these air bubbles ranged from 0 mm to 800 mm and they distributed randomly in the ice more importantly these defects have great effect on the property of ice sheet and cracks are apt to propagate in the area with defects moslet 2007 in this paper some ice bulk elements with random numbering are deleted to simulate natural ice sheet with initial defects then cohesive elements are inserted in ice sheet model which is meshed with tetrahedron elements therefore crack branching and propagation path can be simulated as a natural outcome of the initial boundary value problem without additional assumptions of fracture path collision between ice sheet and the lighthouse norströmsgrund bjerkås et al 2003 is simulated in full scale horizontal force and failure process of ice sheet are analyzed the influences of initial defect distribution the percentage of initial defects and the size of the defects are discussed 2 cohesive element method and the applied constitutive relation since the fracture behavior and fragment interaction during ice structure collision cannot be suitably captured by the constitutive model of ice fracture mechanics was introduced in ice structure interaction xiao 1997 dugdale barenblatt model is one of the most popular models to describe the viscous crack behavior at crack tip barenblatt 1962 based on it needleman 1987 innovatively named the viscous crack zone as cohesive zone as one of the numerically implemented methods of cohesive zone model cohesive element method cem has been widely applied to fracture simulation in this paper the ice sheet is modeled using the cohesive element method all the boundaries of ice sheet elements are inserted with cohesive elements and the discretized ice sheet elements are connected to each other by the inserted cohesive elements the cohesive elements that reach a specific failure criterion will be deleted regarding the mesh pattern the use of hexahedral elements will cause zig zag crack paths that are not applicable for the cohesive zone method a structured mesh with rectangular elements will create a 45 crack which will travel 2 times longer than the actual one leading to an extra energy consumption lu et al 2014 this effect could not be attenuated by refining meshes for these reasons a tetrahedron mesh pattern has been generated in the present study the commercial software used in this paper is abaqus 1 1 abaqus version 6 14 1 dassault systèmes 2014 which does not offer the function of automatically inserting cohesive elements among ice sheet elements therefore a fortran code is written to automatically create the input file for abaqus with a mesh pattern as shown in fig 2 the traction separation law tsl curve used in cem represents the relation between δ and σ where δ is the crack separation of cohesive elements and σ is the stress kuutti et al 2013 there are mainly three types of tsl curves linear exponential and trapezoid as shown in fig 3 cohesive relations usually behave linearly at the beginning of tensile however once reaching the failure stress shown as σ 0 in fig 3 the traction between crack faces decreases or keeps constant to represent the opening process of crack faces when the stress decreases to zero shown as δ m f in fig 3 the crack is regarded as completely opened then cohesive element is deleted the area under the relation curve equals to the fracture energy per unit area which equals to the driving energy of fracture propagation in order to describe the constitutive relations of cohesive element in commercial software damage function is introduced in abaqus the fracture starting point is treated as damage initiation after this point stiffness softening is realized by introducing damage factor d to stress expression τ 1 d τ where τ is the actual stress and τ is the stress without damage by controlling expression of d different constitutive relations of cohesive element can be achieved the solid line in fig 3 denotes linear softening behavior described by eq 1 the dash line denotes exponential softening behavior described by eq 2 and the chain line denotes trapezoidal softening behavior described by eq 3 1 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 δ m f δ δ m f δ m 0 δ m 0 δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f 2 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 1 1 exp α δ δ m 0 δ m f δ m 0 1 exp α δ m 0 δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f 3 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 δ m 0 δ δ m m k δ δ m m δ m 0 δ m f 0 δ δ m m δ m f 0 δ m 0 δ m m δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f where k is the elastic stiffness of cohesive element δ m 0 is the separation at damage initiation δ m f 0 is the failure separation without considering softening phase δ m m is the softening initiation separation of trapezoidal model δ m f is the failure separation the presence of the cohesive elements with certain stiffness value would alter the overall structural stiffness based on the research of lu et al 2014 k also defines the slope of loading phase and has an influence on the global effective young s modulus by a function as 4 e e f f e 1 1 e k l m where e e f f is the effective young s modulus of the structure e is the young s modulus of ice or the bulk material l m is the bulk element size ideally the cohesive element should be infinitely stiff before the fracture starts however elements with infinite stiffness are numerically difficult to implement therefore a stiffness value has to be assigned to these cohesive elements in the simulations according to eq 4 it is necessary to set the value of k as large as possible however it should be noted that an extremely high value of k may cause instability due to ill contribution to the traction in this paper the value of k is set to be not less than 8 e even with the most refined mesh used in the simulation l m 500 mm the error induced by cohesive element is less than 20 therefore the stiffness of ice bulk elements has to be increased to compensate the deformations of cohesive elements this problem is further explored for a three points beam bending problem in the appendix 3 numerical model 3 1 model of the lighthouse norströmsgrund the european commission had supported two research projects named validation of low level ice forces loleif and measurements on structures in ice strice in which the ice forces against the lighthouse norströmsgrund in northern gulf of bothnia were monitored from 1997 to 2003 large number of ice force records and ice sheet failure process are published in lots of papers høyland et al 2000 schwarz and jochmann 2001 bjerkås and skiple 2005 frederking 2005 konuk et al 2009c gürtner et al 2010 hilding et al 2011 bjerkås et al 2013 based on this information the model of lighthouse is established the general geometry and simplified finite element model of the lighthouse established in this study are shown in fig 4 the basement of the lighthouse see fig 4 a is cylindrical with six internal ribs and is fulfilled with gravel and sand therefore the lighthouse can be regarded as clamped at the top of the basement and the finite element model is established from the height of 7 5 m the bottom of the model is fixed in all directions the finite element model of the lighthouse norströmsgrund is illustrated in fig 4 b average length of shell element is 680 mm the material of the lighthouse is set as rigid without considering the deformation during interaction and the total mass of the lighthouse is 3 106kg 3 2 ice sheet model and collision scenario the geometry size of ice sheet is 40 m length 40 m width 0 69 m thickness in order to consider both the computational cost and the accuracy in the simulation of ice sheet fracture process only a square region 14 m 20 m of ice sheet near the contact interface is inserted with cohesive elements as shown in fig 5 the element types of the ice bulk element and cohesive element are c3d4 and coh3d6 respectively the numbers of nodes in ice sheet model and cohesive element model are 2951 and 12527 respectively ice bulk element is assumed as elastic perfect plastic material which is widely used in ice structure interaction simulation the microstructure changes of ice such as recrystallization and pressure melting are reflected by plastic deformation based on trial and error simulations when plastic deformation is larger than 0 3 the ice bulk element is treated as losing stress bearing capacity and is deleted the traction separation relations of cohesive element in three directions one normal direction and two shear directions in plane are independent referring to the values of material parameters used in researches as mentioned in appendix and according to trial and error simulations the material parameters of ice bulk elements and cohesive elements listed in table 1 are used in this paper the measured value of 15 j m2 fracture energy for first year ice was obtained by in situ cyclic loading and fracture tests by dempsey et al 2004 2012 and the value ranges from 23 to 47 j m2 for multi year ice however researchers mentioned in appendix used higher fracture energy than measured data in this simulations the model become so brittle that the elements at the far end collapse under the action of bending moment when the value of fracture energy is less than 100 j m2 the discrepancy of fracture energy between simulations and tests may come from two reasons the first one is that the loading rate in simulation is different from that in test the other one may be that there exists a size effect on the value of fracture energy although the mechanism of this effect is not entirely clear yet timco and weeks 2010 hilding et al 2011 suggested using a larger fracture energy compared to the norm value fig 6 illustrates the whole cohesive element area where ice bulk elements are hidden cohesive elements are only inserted among the fine element zone the thickness of cohesive element is 1 mm there were free ice edges before collision in the real ice situation as observed by schwarz and jochmann 2001 therefore the collision scenario is designed based on the real ice situation as shown in fig 7 in order to simulate infinite ice sheet condition the three boundaries of ice sheet which do not contact with the lighthouse are fixed in all directions except for x direction and a constant velocity of 1 2 m s in x direction is applied to these boundaries moreover in order to reduce internal stress generated by applying load a predefined velocity of 1 2 m s is added to the ice sheet the general contact is applied in this paper in general contact default domain is defined automatically via an all inclusive element based surface the command of contact inclusions all exterior is used here which means all inclusive surface including all element based surface facets and all analytical rigid surfaces contact is divided into two directions including tangential direction and normal one friction formulation in tangential behavior is static kinetic exponential decay values of the static friction coefficient and the kinetic friction coefficient are both 0 3 the pressure overclosure in normal behavior is hard contact abaqus explicit is utilized to conduct the analysis 3 3 buoyancy model near the contact area the failed ice sheet will be extruded from the impact interface to the upper and lower face of ice sheet under the effects of buoyance and gravity these failed ices will form ice rubble pile and may significantly affect the ice loads the buoyancy model used in wang et al 2018 is adopted in this paper assuming that the z axis is pointing upwards and the water level is at z 0 the buoyancy pressure f b of a submerged surface is defined by 5 f b 0 z 0 ρ g z s c l c z 0 ρ g s c l c z l c where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration s c and l c are the sectional area and the thickness of ice bulk element respectively despite of the size of fragments vertical buoyancy force f b is applied to each single element as the body force the position of the element is determined by the vertical coordinate z of integral point the buoyance is added to ice sheet using subroutine vdload in abaqus 4 numerical study on mesh dependency and softening models 4 1 mesh dependency in this subsection the effect of the size of ice bulk element in fine element zone on collision is studied four groups of meshes m0 m1 m2 and m3 are chosen whose lengths vary from 350 mm to 800 mm see table 2 the other parameters of simulations are listed in table 1 unfortunately the convergence is very poor and the computation time is extremely long in m0 and no results were obtained in this case fig 8 shows the time histories of the horizontal forces in cases m1 m2 and m3 it can be observed that m3 derives obviously more peak loads than other cases the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 3 which are obtained by averaging the forces at the period from 1s to 10s the mean horizontal force of m3 is apparently smaller than those of other two cases in addition the computation time of m1 is three times that of m2 while the mean horizontal force of the two cases is similar therefore weighing the computation accuracy and efficiency the mesh size of 650 mm is adopted in all of the subsequent simulations all the computations are conducted under the condition of intel core xeon e5 2683 v3 cpu 16 00 gb memory ram and 16 cores 4 2 softening models of cohesive elements usually the linear and exponential softening curves are applied to brittle fractures while the trapezoid type is mainly used to describe ductile crack which behaves distinctly plateau of stress after fracture starting point in this subsection the effect of tsl shape of cohesive elements on collision is investigated the size of ice bulk element in fine element zone is set to be 650 mm the other parameters of simulations are listed in table 1 three softening laws linear exponential and trapezoidal shown in fig 3 are considered the area under each tsl curve is adjusted to the same value to keep uniform fracture energy the computed horizontal force is presented in fig 9 and table 4 it can be seen that the mean horizontal force of the case applying exponential softening model is slightly higher than those of the other two cases however the difference among the three softening models is small which means that the influence of different tsl shapes is limited this result is similar with that of wang et al 2018 therefore the linear softening curve is applied in this paper 5 ice sheet model with initial defects 5 1 method of creating initial defects the strategy of creating initial defects is divided into six steps as shown in fig 10 step 1 mesh the studied model by using fem pre processing software hypermesh 2 2 hypermesh version 14 0 hyperworks 2016 and export information text of the elements including the number of elements and the corresponding node numbers step 2 read the mesh information from the model step 3 input the percentage of initial defects and calculate the number of elements that should be deleted step 4 call a loop statement the loop count equals to the number of defect elements and in each loop delete one of the elements whose serial number is random step 5 output the new element information and replace the original one step 6 renumber nodes and elements using fem pre processing software to make their number continuous 5 2 ice sheet defect model as mentioned in section 1 li et al 2010 described the macroscopic morphology of air bubbles in ice it was found that the percentage of air bubbles reduces as the ice depth increases they presented the relationship between the percentage of air bubbles and the density of natural ice and showed that the density of natural ice decreases with the increase of the air bubbles percentage it was observed that the percentage of air bubbles is around 2 when the density of ice is 900 kg m3 referring to li et al 2010 2 elements in the fine element zone of ice sheet are deleted in the present study as shown in fig 11 since it is hard to generate defects of different sizes in one ice sheet model only one kind of defect size in a single simulation is considered the length of ice bulk element in the fine element zone is set as 650 mm considering the computation efficiency and accuracy the main size of defect is about 650 mm which is the same as the size of ice bulk element 6 simulation results of collision scenario as presented by schwarz and jochmann 2001 spalling and crushing failures as well as radial cracks are obvious in the ice sheet the crushing failure of ice sheet with induced bending failure is due to the weight of the rubble pile up on the lighthouse norströmsgrund fig 12 shows the snap shots of the simulation results in the cases considering and without considering initial defects at t 1 5s 5s and 10s it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the difference of the ice failure pattern between two cases is small at the stage of initial contact with the continuous interaction between ice sheet and the lighthouse radial cracks can be observed in two cases as shown in fig 12 c and d however the number of cracks near the free edges of the ice sheet in two cases are different in addition load carrying center of two cases are different at the end stage of simulation as shown in fig 12 e and f large piece of ice spalls can be seen in fig 12 f which were also observed in the experiment schwarz and jochmann 2001 however the spalling fracture cannot be observed in both cases indicating that the interaction model used in the present study still has some shortcomings with regard to the simulated fracture behavior in fig 13 the simulation results of horizontal force are compared with the measured one given by hilding et al 2011 it can be seen that the force variations are larger in the simulations than in reality the reason is that the measured data is filtered however the filtered method used in the measurement is unknown in order to make the frequency of the simulation results for the two cases close to the measured data the simulated time histories of the horizontal forces are filtered by two filtering methods provided in ls dyna 3 3 dyna version r 7 0 0 livermore software 2013 as shown in fig 14 it can be observed that there are large deviations in the moving average of the simulated force by using filtering method one as shown in fig 14 a while the curve of the case with initial defects is closer to the measured data than the one without considering defects by using filtering method two as shown in fig 14 b the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 5 it can be seen that the mean horizontal force of the case considering initial defects are smaller than the one without considering initial defects in order to investigate the effect of initial defect on the crack propagation the fine element zone of ice sheet is divided into three zones as shown in fig 15 zone 1 is the area directly contacting the lighthouse while zone 2 and zone 3 are on two sides of zone 1 in this paper only the defects in the top view will be studied the label of each defect is illustrated in fig 16 fig 17 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 1 at t 1 5s 2 2s 5s 9s at the stage of initial contact small cracks around four defects are formed in the ice sheet as shown in fig 17 a at t 2 2s fig 17 b the cracks marked by the ellipses propagate around the crushing field two of these cracks propagate around the defect 1 5 with the continuous interaction with the lighthouse large cracks around the defects 1 8 and 1 9 propagate as shown in fig 17 c near the final stage of interaction as shown in fig 17 d a large piece of ice spalls containing a through crack is formed it can be seen that this crack propagates around defect 1 10 fig 18 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 2 at t 3s 5 2s 5 5s 10s from fig 18 a it can be seen that the first crack in zone 2 is generated around the defect 2 1 after 2 2 s cracks between defects 2 6 and 1 9 generate as shown in fig 18 b these cracks propagate around a large ice spall fig 18 c shows that the ice spall that is generated 0 3 s earlier sinks into the water at the final stage of this simulation cracks around defects 2 3 and 2 4 are formed as shown in fig 18 d it is obvious that with the continuous interaction of ice sheet with the lighthouse ice spalls will be generated from the cracks fig 19 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 3 at t 1 8s 4 1s 5 9s 8 1s as shown in fig 19 a the first crack is initiated from defect 3 1 at t 1 8s then as shown in fig 19 b a few seconds later a large piece of ice spalls off the ice sheet it can be observed that a small crack next to the defect 3 2 near the ice sheet edge is initiated after 1 8 s a straight crack near defect 3 3 is formed and a piece of ice is generated by the crack as show in fig 19 c the similar phenomenon can be observed in fig 19 d around defect 3 5 in terms of crack propagation presented in figs 17 19 it can be concluded that some defects can initiate or propagate the crack and some of the propagations would result in large pieces of ice fragment spalling off the ice sheet moreover it can be found that most of the ice spalls are located near the uncontacted sides of the ice sheet this phenomenon was also observed by xiao and jordaan 1991 7 numerical study on ice sheet defect parameters 7 1 distribution of ice sheet initial defects in this subsection in order to study the relationship between the distribution of initial defects and the fracture behavior of ice sheet another two ice sheet models with the same percentage 2 and different distribution of initial defects are used to simulate the collision process between ice sheet and the lighthouse the material parameters of ice bulk element and cohesive element are given in table 1 the fine element zones of these ice sheets are shown in fig 20 the top view and bottom view of the fine element zone in case 1 are shown in fig 20 a and b the distribution of initial defects in case 1 is random fig 20 c and d show the top view and bottom view of the fine element zone in case 2 it can be observed that most of the initial defects in case 2 are located in zone 1 while the initial defects of case 3 are distributed in zone 1 and zone 2 as shown in fig 20 e and f the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 6 from table 6 it can be seen that the mean horizontal forces present a monotonically increasing tendency with the increase of defects in zone 2 and zone 3 denote the computed mean horizontal forces in the three cases as f r f c and f s for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively the solution changes ε r c and ε s r for case 1 case 2 and case 3 case 1 and the convergence factor r m are defined by 6 ε r c f r f c 7 ε s r f s f r 8 r m ε r c ε s r based on the computed data r m 0 107 since r m is in the range of 0 1 the mean horizontal forces present a monotonic convergence behavior this result can be explained from two respects firstly zone 1 is the area that directly contacts with the lighthouse therefore the horizontal force in this area is mainly caused by collision defects can reduce the stiffness of ice sheet which means that the horizontal forces will decrease with the increase of defects in this area in zone 1 the defects of case 2 are obviously more than those of other cases as shown in fig 20 indicating that the stiffness of zone 1 in case 2 is the smallest among the three cases secondly in the whole process of collision rubble accumulations can be clearly observed around the lighthouse these rubble piles are mainly composed of small ice fragments with the continuous invasion of ice sheet the amount of rubble accumulations around the lighthouse is increasing the generated ice fragments keep on interacting with unbroken ice sheet and influence the horizontal force fig 21 shows the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse varying with different distribution of ice sheet defects at t 10s the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse is the smallest in case 2 among the three cases fig 22 shows the failure pattern of ice sheet of three cases at the final stage it is obvious that cracks of case 3 are more than those of case 1 and case 2 fig 23 shows the time histories of horizontal force with different distribution of initial defects it can be observed that case 3 derives obviously higher peak forces than case 1 and case 2 in case 3 more cracks and ice spalls are generated which corresponds to longer crack path the propagation of longer cracks needs to dissipate fracture energy which causes the increase of peak forces wang et al 2018 7 2 percentage of ice sheet defect in this subsection the effects of defect percentage on the horizontal forces are investigated seven defect percentages listed in table 7 are chosen while other material parameters except the densities of ice and cohesive element are kept constant as given in table 1 the densities of ice and cohesive element are listed in table 7 too fig 24 shows the mean horizontal forces changing with defect percentage at defect percentage 1 4 a fluctuation of mean horizontal forces can be observed then the mean horizontal force decreases with the increase of defect percentage as mentioned above the horizontal forces are mainly influenced by the stiffness of zone 1 and the accumulations of ice fragments fig 25 shows the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse under different initial defect percentages at t 10s it can be observed that the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse increases with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage for small ice sheet defect percentage the stiffness of zone 1 reduces with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage however the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse increases resulting in a larger horizontal force on the lighthouse at defect percentages larger than 4 with the continuous increase of the ice sheet defect percentage the difference of the number of ice fragment elements under different initial defect percentages is negligibly small however the stiffness of the ice sheet keeps dropping therefore the horizontal force reduces with the increase of the defect percentage 7 3 size of defect in ice sheet in this subsection the effect of defect size on the horizontal forces are investigated two groups of defect size d1 and d2 are chosen the defect sizes of d1 and d2 are 500 mm and 650 mm respectively the ice bulk elements with same percentage 2 are deleted in both ice sheet models the material parameters of ice bulk element and cohesive element are given in table 1 the top view and bottom view of fine element zone of d1 are shown in fig 26 fig 27 shows the snap shots of the simulation results in cases d1 and d2 at t 10s it can be seen from fig 27 a and b that more ice spall rubbles pile up on the lighthouse the reason is that the element size of d1 is smaller than that of d2 which means that the number of fragments in d1 is larger than that of d2 under the same contact condition the simulation results of horizontal force of two cases are shown in fig 28 it can be observed that the number of peak force in d2 is larger than that of d1 and the value of peak force is larger than that of d1 too this means that the curve of d1 is more stable than that of d2 in addition the mean horizontal force of d1 is larger than that of d2 as shown in table 8 the reason is that the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse in d1 is larger than that of d2 resulting in a larger horizontal force 8 conclusions in this paper the interaction between ice sheet with initial defects and the lighthouse norströmsgrund is numerically simulated the effect of mesh size and the shape of tsl on simulation are investigated a mathematic method of creating initial defects in ice sheet is proposed the numerical models of the ice sheet and the lighthouse are incorporated in the finite element software abaqus the simulation results are compared with available measured data to validate the numerical method certainly the existence of initial defects can affect stiffness of ice sheet the numerical results show that it also affects the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse which has a certain influence on the horizontal forces on the lighthouse initial defects in ice sheet can possibly initiate cracks or make the cracks propagate and large pieces of ice induced by some of these cracks might spall off the ice sheet and locate near the uncontacted sides of the ice sheet at last a series of simulations concerning the distribution percentage and size of the defects are conducted the distribution of ice sheet defects has obvious influence on the horizontal forces and the propagation of cracks ice sheet defects distributed in the collision path can reduce the horizontal forces moreover defects in other areas can cause more cracks and ice fragments that will increase the horizontal forces the mean horizontal force is mainly affected by the distribution of ice sheet defects when the defect percentage is less than 4 when the defect percentage is larger than 4 the mean horizontal force decreases with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage the decrease of defect size can increase the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse which makes the horizontal force larger the main purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for modeling ice sheet with initial defects and to study the effects of the initial defects in ice sheet on the interaction between ice sheet and marine structures it should be noted that the interaction model still has some shortcomings with regard to the simulated fracture behavior and the conclusions above are only valid for the cases studied in this paper to draw a general conclusion further researches are needed such as considering the uncertainties of material model choosing the ice sheet model closer to the real one extending the simulation time carrying out more corresponding experiments etc the further study will focus on improving the applicability of the interaction model from these aspects in order to give better simulation results of fracture behavior appendix the compensated value of elastic modulus of ice sheet in three points bending problem fig 29 shows the three points bending simulation scenario abaqus explicit is utilized to conduct the analysis referring to the values of material parameters used in gürtner et al 2010 hilding et al 2011 kuutti et al 2013 lu et al

and cases with cohesive elements of different mesh sizes as can be seen in table 9 the computed deflection of t3 is closest to t1 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t3 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 500 mm similarly as can be seen in table 10 the computed deflection of t8 is closest to t6 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t8 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 650 mm as can be seen in table 11 the computed deflection of t12 is closest to t11 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t12 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 800 mm

23001,with the increasing marine activities in the arctic area the demand for reliable designs of marine structures in this area is growing there have been many studies published regarding simulation of ice marine structure interaction in these studies ice models are established without considering initial defects however natural ice usually contains lots of initial defects including cracks inclusions pores etc in this paper this issue is studied by applying defect model and cohesive element method cem several ice bulk elements labeled as initial defects are deleted from the ice sheet then cohesive elements are inserted in the ice sheet model that is meshed with tetrahedron elements collision between ice sheet and a lighthouse is simulated in full scale initiation and propagation of ice sheet cracks are achieved by deleting the cohesive elements that reach fracture energy horizontal force and failure process of ice sheet are analyzed the results show that the initial defects can affect both the horizontal force and fracture of ice sheet then a series of simulations in terms of distribution percentage and size of ice sheet defects are performed effects of these factors on the horizontal force and crack propagation are discussed keywords ice lighthouse interaction initial defects fracture behaviors cohesive element method 1 introduction ships and marine structures operating in the arctic ocean suffer a big risk of collision with ice sheet on the collision interface of marine structure and ice micro structure changes such as micro cracks pressure melting and recrystallization dominate ice failure process xiao 1997 jordaan 2001 while in the area near and far from the collision interface large cracks play an important role in ice sheet failure palmer et al 1983 as shown in fig 1 there are four typical fracture modes generated in the collision between vertical cylinder structure and ice sheet a crushing fracture involves the growth of cracks in different directions with no obvious preferred orientation through a zone whose dimensions are of the same order as the contact breadth and less than the ice thickness b indentation spalling occurs when horizontal cracks run roughly parallel to the plane of the ice until they run out on the upper or lower surface c radial crack is the growth of vertical cracks directed radially from the contact region and running through the whole thickness d circumferential crack often happens when the contact region undergoes local crushing while radial cracks develop further away to study the influence of large cracks on collision process between ice sheet and marine structure many researchers built theoretical failure modes of ice sheet for example zou et al 1996 applied kendall s double cantilever beam theory to the study of the role of fracture and spalling in ice structure interaction lu et al 2015 built a theory model of splitting cracks that run along navigation direction in front of the ship bow numerical method is another important way to study ice sheet crack comparing with theoretical method numerical method can analyze problems with much more complicated boundary currently there are three prevailing kinds of numerical methods applied to the simulation of ice sheet fracture gürtner 2009 discrete element method dem lattice method and finite element method fem since 2009 cohesive element method has been gradually introduced to ice crack simulation it belongs to the fem method and had been widely applied to the brittle crack simulation needleman 1987 xu and needleman 1994 turon et al 2006 gürtner 2009 inserted cohesive elements at all inter element boundaries of regular hexahedron ice elements and simulated initiation and propagation of ice fractures using opening and deletion of cohesive elements konuk et al 2009a 2009b 2010 made a comprehensive review of the cohesive element framework for dynamic ice structure interaction problems including brief introduction of cohesive zone model that is the basis of cohesive element method the formulation of cohesive element method and some simple simulation cases gürtner et al 2010 and hilding et al 2011 simulated interaction between ice sheet and the vertical sided lighthouse norströmsgrund they discussed response of the lighthouse time histories of contact forces and effects of ice model määttänen et al 2011 conducted impact experiments between ice sheet and vertical steel plate in laboratory scale and kuutti et al 2013 simulated these experiments using cohesive elements and triangular ice element in two dimension scale lu et al 2014 inserted cohesive elements between each triangular prism ice elements making crack propagate more arbitrarily than that of ice sheet meshed with hexahedron elements nevertheless their ice sheet model consisted of only one layer of ice elements which means crack randomness can only be satisfied in plane instead of in the whole 3d ice sheet feng et al 2016 studied parameter sensitivities of cohesive element method such as energy release rate elastic stiffness and stress separation relations wang et al 2018 simulated the interaction between sloping marine structure and level ice based on cohesive element model and conducted the mesh dependency study and a series of parametric analysis on the main parameters of models the ice sheet studied by previous researchers is considered as a structure without any defects however a natural ice sheet contains lots of defects including cracks inclusions pores grain boundaries and others gold 1963 geoge 1986 grishina and buch 2004 stander 2006 the size of these defects is on micro level and can be observed by eyes sometimes li et al 2010 made some in situ observations of ice growth and decay processes according to their study four kinds of air bubbles were observed in the ice the size of these air bubbles ranged from 0 mm to 800 mm and they distributed randomly in the ice more importantly these defects have great effect on the property of ice sheet and cracks are apt to propagate in the area with defects moslet 2007 in this paper some ice bulk elements with random numbering are deleted to simulate natural ice sheet with initial defects then cohesive elements are inserted in ice sheet model which is meshed with tetrahedron elements therefore crack branching and propagation path can be simulated as a natural outcome of the initial boundary value problem without additional assumptions of fracture path collision between ice sheet and the lighthouse norströmsgrund bjerkås et al 2003 is simulated in full scale horizontal force and failure process of ice sheet are analyzed the influences of initial defect distribution the percentage of initial defects and the size of the defects are discussed 2 cohesive element method and the applied constitutive relation since the fracture behavior and fragment interaction during ice structure collision cannot be suitably captured by the constitutive model of ice fracture mechanics was introduced in ice structure interaction xiao 1997 dugdale barenblatt model is one of the most popular models to describe the viscous crack behavior at crack tip barenblatt 1962 based on it needleman 1987 innovatively named the viscous crack zone as cohesive zone as one of the numerically implemented methods of cohesive zone model cohesive element method cem has been widely applied to fracture simulation in this paper the ice sheet is modeled using the cohesive element method all the boundaries of ice sheet elements are inserted with cohesive elements and the discretized ice sheet elements are connected to each other by the inserted cohesive elements the cohesive elements that reach a specific failure criterion will be deleted regarding the mesh pattern the use of hexahedral elements will cause zig zag crack paths that are not applicable for the cohesive zone method a structured mesh with rectangular elements will create a 45 crack which will travel 2 times longer than the actual one leading to an extra energy consumption lu et al 2014 this effect could not be attenuated by refining meshes for these reasons a tetrahedron mesh pattern has been generated in the present study the commercial software used in this paper is abaqus 1 1 abaqus version 6 14 1 dassault systèmes 2014 which does not offer the function of automatically inserting cohesive elements among ice sheet elements therefore a fortran code is written to automatically create the input file for abaqus with a mesh pattern as shown in fig 2 the traction separation law tsl curve used in cem represents the relation between δ and σ where δ is the crack separation of cohesive elements and σ is the stress kuutti et al 2013 there are mainly three types of tsl curves linear exponential and trapezoid as shown in fig 3 cohesive relations usually behave linearly at the beginning of tensile however once reaching the failure stress shown as σ 0 in fig 3 the traction between crack faces decreases or keeps constant to represent the opening process of crack faces when the stress decreases to zero shown as δ m f in fig 3 the crack is regarded as completely opened then cohesive element is deleted the area under the relation curve equals to the fracture energy per unit area which equals to the driving energy of fracture propagation in order to describe the constitutive relations of cohesive element in commercial software damage function is introduced in abaqus the fracture starting point is treated as damage initiation after this point stiffness softening is realized by introducing damage factor d to stress expression τ 1 d τ where τ is the actual stress and τ is the stress without damage by controlling expression of d different constitutive relations of cohesive element can be achieved the solid line in fig 3 denotes linear softening behavior described by eq 1 the dash line denotes exponential softening behavior described by eq 2 and the chain line denotes trapezoidal softening behavior described by eq 3 1 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 δ m f δ δ m f δ m 0 δ m 0 δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f 2 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 1 1 exp α δ δ m 0 δ m f δ m 0 1 exp α δ m 0 δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f 3 σ k δ δ δ m 0 k δ m 0 δ m 0 δ δ m m k δ δ m m δ m 0 δ m f 0 δ δ m m δ m f 0 δ m 0 δ m m δ δ m f 0 δ δ m f where k is the elastic stiffness of cohesive element δ m 0 is the separation at damage initiation δ m f 0 is the failure separation without considering softening phase δ m m is the softening initiation separation of trapezoidal model δ m f is the failure separation the presence of the cohesive elements with certain stiffness value would alter the overall structural stiffness based on the research of lu et al 2014 k also defines the slope of loading phase and has an influence on the global effective young s modulus by a function as 4 e e f f e 1 1 e k l m where e e f f is the effective young s modulus of the structure e is the young s modulus of ice or the bulk material l m is the bulk element size ideally the cohesive element should be infinitely stiff before the fracture starts however elements with infinite stiffness are numerically difficult to implement therefore a stiffness value has to be assigned to these cohesive elements in the simulations according to eq 4 it is necessary to set the value of k as large as possible however it should be noted that an extremely high value of k may cause instability due to ill contribution to the traction in this paper the value of k is set to be not less than 8 e even with the most refined mesh used in the simulation l m 500 mm the error induced by cohesive element is less than 20 therefore the stiffness of ice bulk elements has to be increased to compensate the deformations of cohesive elements this problem is further explored for a three points beam bending problem in the appendix 3 numerical model 3 1 model of the lighthouse norströmsgrund the european commission had supported two research projects named validation of low level ice forces loleif and measurements on structures in ice strice in which the ice forces against the lighthouse norströmsgrund in northern gulf of bothnia were monitored from 1997 to 2003 large number of ice force records and ice sheet failure process are published in lots of papers høyland et al 2000 schwarz and jochmann 2001 bjerkås and skiple 2005 frederking 2005 konuk et al 2009c gürtner et al 2010 hilding et al 2011 bjerkås et al 2013 based on this information the model of lighthouse is established the general geometry and simplified finite element model of the lighthouse established in this study are shown in fig 4 the basement of the lighthouse see fig 4 a is cylindrical with six internal ribs and is fulfilled with gravel and sand therefore the lighthouse can be regarded as clamped at the top of the basement and the finite element model is established from the height of 7 5 m the bottom of the model is fixed in all directions the finite element model of the lighthouse norströmsgrund is illustrated in fig 4 b average length of shell element is 680 mm the material of the lighthouse is set as rigid without considering the deformation during interaction and the total mass of the lighthouse is 3 106kg 3 2 ice sheet model and collision scenario the geometry size of ice sheet is 40 m length 40 m width 0 69 m thickness in order to consider both the computational cost and the accuracy in the simulation of ice sheet fracture process only a square region 14 m 20 m of ice sheet near the contact interface is inserted with cohesive elements as shown in fig 5 the element types of the ice bulk element and cohesive element are c3d4 and coh3d6 respectively the numbers of nodes in ice sheet model and cohesive element model are 2951 and 12527 respectively ice bulk element is assumed as elastic perfect plastic material which is widely used in ice structure interaction simulation the microstructure changes of ice such as recrystallization and pressure melting are reflected by plastic deformation based on trial and error simulations when plastic deformation is larger than 0 3 the ice bulk element is treated as losing stress bearing capacity and is deleted the traction separation relations of cohesive element in three directions one normal direction and two shear directions in plane are independent referring to the values of material parameters used in researches as mentioned in appendix and according to trial and error simulations the material parameters of ice bulk elements and cohesive elements listed in table 1 are used in this paper the measured value of 15 j m2 fracture energy for first year ice was obtained by in situ cyclic loading and fracture tests by dempsey et al 2004 2012 and the value ranges from 23 to 47 j m2 for multi year ice however researchers mentioned in appendix used higher fracture energy than measured data in this simulations the model become so brittle that the elements at the far end collapse under the action of bending moment when the value of fracture energy is less than 100 j m2 the discrepancy of fracture energy between simulations and tests may come from two reasons the first one is that the loading rate in simulation is different from that in test the other one may be that there exists a size effect on the value of fracture energy although the mechanism of this effect is not entirely clear yet timco and weeks 2010 hilding et al 2011 suggested using a larger fracture energy compared to the norm value fig 6 illustrates the whole cohesive element area where ice bulk elements are hidden cohesive elements are only inserted among the fine element zone the thickness of cohesive element is 1 mm there were free ice edges before collision in the real ice situation as observed by schwarz and jochmann 2001 therefore the collision scenario is designed based on the real ice situation as shown in fig 7 in order to simulate infinite ice sheet condition the three boundaries of ice sheet which do not contact with the lighthouse are fixed in all directions except for x direction and a constant velocity of 1 2 m s in x direction is applied to these boundaries moreover in order to reduce internal stress generated by applying load a predefined velocity of 1 2 m s is added to the ice sheet the general contact is applied in this paper in general contact default domain is defined automatically via an all inclusive element based surface the command of contact inclusions all exterior is used here which means all inclusive surface including all element based surface facets and all analytical rigid surfaces contact is divided into two directions including tangential direction and normal one friction formulation in tangential behavior is static kinetic exponential decay values of the static friction coefficient and the kinetic friction coefficient are both 0 3 the pressure overclosure in normal behavior is hard contact abaqus explicit is utilized to conduct the analysis 3 3 buoyancy model near the contact area the failed ice sheet will be extruded from the impact interface to the upper and lower face of ice sheet under the effects of buoyance and gravity these failed ices will form ice rubble pile and may significantly affect the ice loads the buoyancy model used in wang et al 2018 is adopted in this paper assuming that the z axis is pointing upwards and the water level is at z 0 the buoyancy pressure f b of a submerged surface is defined by 5 f b 0 z 0 ρ g z s c l c z 0 ρ g s c l c z l c where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration s c and l c are the sectional area and the thickness of ice bulk element respectively despite of the size of fragments vertical buoyancy force f b is applied to each single element as the body force the position of the element is determined by the vertical coordinate z of integral point the buoyance is added to ice sheet using subroutine vdload in abaqus 4 numerical study on mesh dependency and softening models 4 1 mesh dependency in this subsection the effect of the size of ice bulk element in fine element zone on collision is studied four groups of meshes m0 m1 m2 and m3 are chosen whose lengths vary from 350 mm to 800 mm see table 2 the other parameters of simulations are listed in table 1 unfortunately the convergence is very poor and the computation time is extremely long in m0 and no results were obtained in this case fig 8 shows the time histories of the horizontal forces in cases m1 m2 and m3 it can be observed that m3 derives obviously more peak loads than other cases the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 3 which are obtained by averaging the forces at the period from 1s to 10s the mean horizontal force of m3 is apparently smaller than those of other two cases in addition the computation time of m1 is three times that of m2 while the mean horizontal force of the two cases is similar therefore weighing the computation accuracy and efficiency the mesh size of 650 mm is adopted in all of the subsequent simulations all the computations are conducted under the condition of intel core xeon e5 2683 v3 cpu 16 00 gb memory ram and 16 cores 4 2 softening models of cohesive elements usually the linear and exponential softening curves are applied to brittle fractures while the trapezoid type is mainly used to describe ductile crack which behaves distinctly plateau of stress after fracture starting point in this subsection the effect of tsl shape of cohesive elements on collision is investigated the size of ice bulk element in fine element zone is set to be 650 mm the other parameters of simulations are listed in table 1 three softening laws linear exponential and trapezoidal shown in fig 3 are considered the area under each tsl curve is adjusted to the same value to keep uniform fracture energy the computed horizontal force is presented in fig 9 and table 4 it can be seen that the mean horizontal force of the case applying exponential softening model is slightly higher than those of the other two cases however the difference among the three softening models is small which means that the influence of different tsl shapes is limited this result is similar with that of wang et al 2018 therefore the linear softening curve is applied in this paper 5 ice sheet model with initial defects 5 1 method of creating initial defects the strategy of creating initial defects is divided into six steps as shown in fig 10 step 1 mesh the studied model by using fem pre processing software hypermesh 2 2 hypermesh version 14 0 hyperworks 2016 and export information text of the elements including the number of elements and the corresponding node numbers step 2 read the mesh information from the model step 3 input the percentage of initial defects and calculate the number of elements that should be deleted step 4 call a loop statement the loop count equals to the number of defect elements and in each loop delete one of the elements whose serial number is random step 5 output the new element information and replace the original one step 6 renumber nodes and elements using fem pre processing software to make their number continuous 5 2 ice sheet defect model as mentioned in section 1 li et al 2010 described the macroscopic morphology of air bubbles in ice it was found that the percentage of air bubbles reduces as the ice depth increases they presented the relationship between the percentage of air bubbles and the density of natural ice and showed that the density of natural ice decreases with the increase of the air bubbles percentage it was observed that the percentage of air bubbles is around 2 when the density of ice is 900 kg m3 referring to li et al 2010 2 elements in the fine element zone of ice sheet are deleted in the present study as shown in fig 11 since it is hard to generate defects of different sizes in one ice sheet model only one kind of defect size in a single simulation is considered the length of ice bulk element in the fine element zone is set as 650 mm considering the computation efficiency and accuracy the main size of defect is about 650 mm which is the same as the size of ice bulk element 6 simulation results of collision scenario as presented by schwarz and jochmann 2001 spalling and crushing failures as well as radial cracks are obvious in the ice sheet the crushing failure of ice sheet with induced bending failure is due to the weight of the rubble pile up on the lighthouse norströmsgrund fig 12 shows the snap shots of the simulation results in the cases considering and without considering initial defects at t 1 5s 5s and 10s it can be seen from fig 12 a and b that the difference of the ice failure pattern between two cases is small at the stage of initial contact with the continuous interaction between ice sheet and the lighthouse radial cracks can be observed in two cases as shown in fig 12 c and d however the number of cracks near the free edges of the ice sheet in two cases are different in addition load carrying center of two cases are different at the end stage of simulation as shown in fig 12 e and f large piece of ice spalls can be seen in fig 12 f which were also observed in the experiment schwarz and jochmann 2001 however the spalling fracture cannot be observed in both cases indicating that the interaction model used in the present study still has some shortcomings with regard to the simulated fracture behavior in fig 13 the simulation results of horizontal force are compared with the measured one given by hilding et al 2011 it can be seen that the force variations are larger in the simulations than in reality the reason is that the measured data is filtered however the filtered method used in the measurement is unknown in order to make the frequency of the simulation results for the two cases close to the measured data the simulated time histories of the horizontal forces are filtered by two filtering methods provided in ls dyna 3 3 dyna version r 7 0 0 livermore software 2013 as shown in fig 14 it can be observed that there are large deviations in the moving average of the simulated force by using filtering method one as shown in fig 14 a while the curve of the case with initial defects is closer to the measured data than the one without considering defects by using filtering method two as shown in fig 14 b the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 5 it can be seen that the mean horizontal force of the case considering initial defects are smaller than the one without considering initial defects in order to investigate the effect of initial defect on the crack propagation the fine element zone of ice sheet is divided into three zones as shown in fig 15 zone 1 is the area directly contacting the lighthouse while zone 2 and zone 3 are on two sides of zone 1 in this paper only the defects in the top view will be studied the label of each defect is illustrated in fig 16 fig 17 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 1 at t 1 5s 2 2s 5s 9s at the stage of initial contact small cracks around four defects are formed in the ice sheet as shown in fig 17 a at t 2 2s fig 17 b the cracks marked by the ellipses propagate around the crushing field two of these cracks propagate around the defect 1 5 with the continuous interaction with the lighthouse large cracks around the defects 1 8 and 1 9 propagate as shown in fig 17 c near the final stage of interaction as shown in fig 17 d a large piece of ice spalls containing a through crack is formed it can be seen that this crack propagates around defect 1 10 fig 18 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 2 at t 3s 5 2s 5 5s 10s from fig 18 a it can be seen that the first crack in zone 2 is generated around the defect 2 1 after 2 2 s cracks between defects 2 6 and 1 9 generate as shown in fig 18 b these cracks propagate around a large ice spall fig 18 c shows that the ice spall that is generated 0 3 s earlier sinks into the water at the final stage of this simulation cracks around defects 2 3 and 2 4 are formed as shown in fig 18 d it is obvious that with the continuous interaction of ice sheet with the lighthouse ice spalls will be generated from the cracks fig 19 shows the partially magnified snap shots of zone 3 at t 1 8s 4 1s 5 9s 8 1s as shown in fig 19 a the first crack is initiated from defect 3 1 at t 1 8s then as shown in fig 19 b a few seconds later a large piece of ice spalls off the ice sheet it can be observed that a small crack next to the defect 3 2 near the ice sheet edge is initiated after 1 8 s a straight crack near defect 3 3 is formed and a piece of ice is generated by the crack as show in fig 19 c the similar phenomenon can be observed in fig 19 d around defect 3 5 in terms of crack propagation presented in figs 17 19 it can be concluded that some defects can initiate or propagate the crack and some of the propagations would result in large pieces of ice fragment spalling off the ice sheet moreover it can be found that most of the ice spalls are located near the uncontacted sides of the ice sheet this phenomenon was also observed by xiao and jordaan 1991 7 numerical study on ice sheet defect parameters 7 1 distribution of ice sheet initial defects in this subsection in order to study the relationship between the distribution of initial defects and the fracture behavior of ice sheet another two ice sheet models with the same percentage 2 and different distribution of initial defects are used to simulate the collision process between ice sheet and the lighthouse the material parameters of ice bulk element and cohesive element are given in table 1 the fine element zones of these ice sheets are shown in fig 20 the top view and bottom view of the fine element zone in case 1 are shown in fig 20 a and b the distribution of initial defects in case 1 is random fig 20 c and d show the top view and bottom view of the fine element zone in case 2 it can be observed that most of the initial defects in case 2 are located in zone 1 while the initial defects of case 3 are distributed in zone 1 and zone 2 as shown in fig 20 e and f the computed mean horizontal forces are presented in table 6 from table 6 it can be seen that the mean horizontal forces present a monotonically increasing tendency with the increase of defects in zone 2 and zone 3 denote the computed mean horizontal forces in the three cases as f r f c and f s for case 1 case 2 and case 3 respectively the solution changes ε r c and ε s r for case 1 case 2 and case 3 case 1 and the convergence factor r m are defined by 6 ε r c f r f c 7 ε s r f s f r 8 r m ε r c ε s r based on the computed data r m 0 107 since r m is in the range of 0 1 the mean horizontal forces present a monotonic convergence behavior this result can be explained from two respects firstly zone 1 is the area that directly contacts with the lighthouse therefore the horizontal force in this area is mainly caused by collision defects can reduce the stiffness of ice sheet which means that the horizontal forces will decrease with the increase of defects in this area in zone 1 the defects of case 2 are obviously more than those of other cases as shown in fig 20 indicating that the stiffness of zone 1 in case 2 is the smallest among the three cases secondly in the whole process of collision rubble accumulations can be clearly observed around the lighthouse these rubble piles are mainly composed of small ice fragments with the continuous invasion of ice sheet the amount of rubble accumulations around the lighthouse is increasing the generated ice fragments keep on interacting with unbroken ice sheet and influence the horizontal force fig 21 shows the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse varying with different distribution of ice sheet defects at t 10s the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse is the smallest in case 2 among the three cases fig 22 shows the failure pattern of ice sheet of three cases at the final stage it is obvious that cracks of case 3 are more than those of case 1 and case 2 fig 23 shows the time histories of horizontal force with different distribution of initial defects it can be observed that case 3 derives obviously higher peak forces than case 1 and case 2 in case 3 more cracks and ice spalls are generated which corresponds to longer crack path the propagation of longer cracks needs to dissipate fracture energy which causes the increase of peak forces wang et al 2018 7 2 percentage of ice sheet defect in this subsection the effects of defect percentage on the horizontal forces are investigated seven defect percentages listed in table 7 are chosen while other material parameters except the densities of ice and cohesive element are kept constant as given in table 1 the densities of ice and cohesive element are listed in table 7 too fig 24 shows the mean horizontal forces changing with defect percentage at defect percentage 1 4 a fluctuation of mean horizontal forces can be observed then the mean horizontal force decreases with the increase of defect percentage as mentioned above the horizontal forces are mainly influenced by the stiffness of zone 1 and the accumulations of ice fragments fig 25 shows the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse under different initial defect percentages at t 10s it can be observed that the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse increases with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage for small ice sheet defect percentage the stiffness of zone 1 reduces with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage however the number of ice fragment elements around the lighthouse increases resulting in a larger horizontal force on the lighthouse at defect percentages larger than 4 with the continuous increase of the ice sheet defect percentage the difference of the number of ice fragment elements under different initial defect percentages is negligibly small however the stiffness of the ice sheet keeps dropping therefore the horizontal force reduces with the increase of the defect percentage 7 3 size of defect in ice sheet in this subsection the effect of defect size on the horizontal forces are investigated two groups of defect size d1 and d2 are chosen the defect sizes of d1 and d2 are 500 mm and 650 mm respectively the ice bulk elements with same percentage 2 are deleted in both ice sheet models the material parameters of ice bulk element and cohesive element are given in table 1 the top view and bottom view of fine element zone of d1 are shown in fig 26 fig 27 shows the snap shots of the simulation results in cases d1 and d2 at t 10s it can be seen from fig 27 a and b that more ice spall rubbles pile up on the lighthouse the reason is that the element size of d1 is smaller than that of d2 which means that the number of fragments in d1 is larger than that of d2 under the same contact condition the simulation results of horizontal force of two cases are shown in fig 28 it can be observed that the number of peak force in d2 is larger than that of d1 and the value of peak force is larger than that of d1 too this means that the curve of d1 is more stable than that of d2 in addition the mean horizontal force of d1 is larger than that of d2 as shown in table 8 the reason is that the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse in d1 is larger than that of d2 resulting in a larger horizontal force 8 conclusions in this paper the interaction between ice sheet with initial defects and the lighthouse norströmsgrund is numerically simulated the effect of mesh size and the shape of tsl on simulation are investigated a mathematic method of creating initial defects in ice sheet is proposed the numerical models of the ice sheet and the lighthouse are incorporated in the finite element software abaqus the simulation results are compared with available measured data to validate the numerical method certainly the existence of initial defects can affect stiffness of ice sheet the numerical results show that it also affects the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse which has a certain influence on the horizontal forces on the lighthouse initial defects in ice sheet can possibly initiate cracks or make the cracks propagate and large pieces of ice induced by some of these cracks might spall off the ice sheet and locate near the uncontacted sides of the ice sheet at last a series of simulations concerning the distribution percentage and size of the defects are conducted the distribution of ice sheet defects has obvious influence on the horizontal forces and the propagation of cracks ice sheet defects distributed in the collision path can reduce the horizontal forces moreover defects in other areas can cause more cracks and ice fragments that will increase the horizontal forces the mean horizontal force is mainly affected by the distribution of ice sheet defects when the defect percentage is less than 4 when the defect percentage is larger than 4 the mean horizontal force decreases with the increase of ice sheet defect percentage the decrease of defect size can increase the number of ice fragments around the lighthouse which makes the horizontal force larger the main purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for modeling ice sheet with initial defects and to study the effects of the initial defects in ice sheet on the interaction between ice sheet and marine structures it should be noted that the interaction model still has some shortcomings with regard to the simulated fracture behavior and the conclusions above are only valid for the cases studied in this paper to draw a general conclusion further researches are needed such as considering the uncertainties of material model choosing the ice sheet model closer to the real one extending the simulation time carrying out more corresponding experiments etc the further study will focus on improving the applicability of the interaction model from these aspects in order to give better simulation results of fracture behavior appendix the compensated value of elastic modulus of ice sheet in three points bending problem fig 29 shows the three points bending simulation scenario abaqus explicit is utilized to conduct the analysis referring to the values of material parameters used in gürtner et al 2010 hilding et al 2011 kuutti et al 2013 lu et al 2014 and wang et al 2018 the value of elastic moudulus of ice bulk element should be set to 5 gpa tables 9 10 and 11 present the comparison of the deflections among the case without cohesive elements and cases with cohesive elements of different mesh sizes as can be seen in table 9 the computed deflection of t3 is closest to t1 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t3 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 500 mm similarly as can be seen in table 10 the computed deflection of t8 is closest to t6 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t8 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 650 mm as can be seen in table 11 the computed deflection of t12 is closest to t11 therefore the value of elastic stiffness used in t12 will be used in cases whose mesh size are 800 mm

the requirements of marine ship design and ship manoeuvring and operation the development of numerical computation makes it possible to simulate the ship response travelling with the complicated environmental disturbance and vessel simulators are playing an important role in the testing and verification of the computer software of the complex system such as dynamic positioning dp ships sørensen 2011 remotely operated vehicles rovs operations and control systems moreira and guedes soares 2011 fernandes et al 2015 ridao et al 2015 and ship simulators varela and guedes soares 2015a 2015b many mathematical models of marine vessels have been proposed to meet application requirements such as abkowitz model abkowitz 1980 maneuvering modelling group mmg model yoshimura 2005 nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 a core mathematical model for hard manoeuvres sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b sutulo and guedes soares 2011 and vectorial model fossen 2011 these models have different features and are proposed for different application purposes considering the trade off between the complexity and fidelity for example nomoto model was proposed for autopilot design only considering the yaw motion the vectorial model proposed by fossen 2011 is describing the motion of ships in a vectorial setting vectorial models are extensively used in the stability analysis and designing controllers and observers for marine ships the model of sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b 2011 allows describing arbitrary 3dof ship manoeuvring motions estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is a challenge and an interesting topic ittc 2002 captive model test carried out in a multi purpose towing tank sintef is a reliable and effective method to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments from which hydrodynamic coefficients in manoeuvring model can be determined sutulo and guedes soares 2006 system identification is a mature technique for building mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data ljung 1999 now it has been widely used for estimation the hydrodynamics coefficients for marine vessels åström and källström 1976 golding et al 2006 perera et al 2012 luo et al 2014 luo and zou 2009 ross et al 2015 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 van de ven et al 2007 xu et al 2018b many methods have been developed for system identification and least squares ls is one of the most popular methods in golding et al 2006 the nonlinear viscous damping forces of a surface vessel in the horizontal plane was estimated using the least squares method in ross et al 2015 the least squares method was used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients based on planar motion mechanism pmm tests the obtained mathematical model was then validated by reproducing the manoeuvring test conducted in full scale hassani et al 2015 in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b 2014 an optimal offline system identification method combined the least squares with genetic algorithm was proposed to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model other methods have been employed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for example van de ven et al 2007 used a neural network to estimate the damping matrix of an underwater vehicle moreira and guedes soares 2003 adopted recursive neural networks for a dynamic model of manoeuvrability extended kalman filter ekf is also a good option and it was used for parameter estimation fossen et al 1996 proposed an off line parallel extended kalman filter algorithm utilizing two measurement series in parallel to estimate the parameters of the dynamic positioning ship model an adaptive wave filter coupled with a maximum likelihood parameter identification technique was proposed by hassani et al 2013 and used for dynamic positioning control of marine vessels in perera et al 2016 2015 the parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering were identified using an extended kalman filter recently the support vector machine svm has been applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a ship model luo and zou 2009 luo et al 2016 svm is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classifications suykens and vandewalle 1999 or regression challenges cortes and vapnik 1995 suykens et al 2002 it has been receiving much attention in the last decade and was one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in hou et al 2018 a roll motion equation for floating structures in irregular waves was identified using a ε support vector regression a modified version least squares support vector machine lssvm was applied to model the controller of the marine surface vehicle for path following scenarios based on manoeuvring test xu and guedes soares 2018 2016 an online version of lssvm was used for dynamic ship steering modelling based on free running model tests xu et al 2018a least squares is a simple and popular method for parameter estimation but there are also some disadvantages chen and ljung 2013 ljung 1999 the parameters estimated by least squares method are usually largely affected by the noise of training data and it usually leads to non consistent estimates söderström 2013 truncated singular value decomposition tsvd golub and reinsch 1970 is a good option to solve the ill conditioned problem of the least squares method chan and hansen 1990 the main assumption is to neglect its smallest singular values hansen 1998 because the data corresponding to smaller singular values usually imposes more uncertainty in the process of estimating uncertain parameters liu et al 2017 proposed a novel method to establish a model which can efficiently reduce the ill posedness combining with the singular value decomposition in chen and ljung 2013 a regularized least square method was used to solve the hyper parameter estimation problem with large data sets and ill conditioned computations tikhonov regularization bell et al 1978 is the most commonly used method of regularization of ill posed problems it can significantly improve the condition number by modifying the normal equations in the least squares method while leaving the estimated parameter relatively unchanged the effect of tikhonov regularization is to estimate the parameters while also keep them near the reference values golub et al 1999 hansen and o leary 1993 ma et al 2017 the uncertainty of the identified parameters due to the ill conditioned problem is also a challenge problem in marine ship modelling the obtained parameters with a large uncertainty are very sensitive to the noise in the measured data and usually drift from the true values which was called parameter drift hwang 1980 liu et al 2016 in hwang 1980 the dynamic cancellation was found and the linear hydrodynamic coefficients drift simultaneously using slender body theory in luo and li 2017 nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients was also found due to the so called multicollinearity the parameter drift cannot be eliminated due to physical reasons and several methods were proposed in hwang 1980 luo and li 2017 to diminish the parameters drift such as parallel processing and additional excitation it is necessary to point that the main purpose of these methods is to reconstruct the samples and improve the condition number the main contribution of this paper is to give a mathematical explanation for the parameter drift and two methods truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization are introduced to diminish the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in the measured data a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 degrees of freedom dof is derived using lagrange s method in order to compare the coefficients of different ships the hydrodynamic coefficients have been converted to the dimensionless ones using the prime system of sname sname 1950 the identification procedure uses a data set from a series of pmm tests carried out by sintef ocean on their multi purpose towing tank sintef using a scaled ship model of research vessel gunnerus hassani et al 2015 various captive model tests recommended by ittc 2002 have been carried out such as pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw the nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained using the classical least square tsvd and tikhonov regularization the resulted nonlinear manoeuvring models were further tested against the portion of the data that was not used in the identification process the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained models uncertainty analysis of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients is carried out the results show that tsvd and tikhonov regularization can provide more stable results and diminish the parameter drift the rest paper is organized as follows in section 2 a nonlinear manoeuvring modelling in 3 dofs is derived using lagrange s method and dimensionless form is given using the prime system of sname in section 3 uncertainty analysis of the identified parameters is given using singular value decomposition in order to diminish the parameter uncertainty the least squares and tikhonov regularization combined with the singular value decomposition are presented in section 4 section 5 describes the planar motion mechanism pmm tests in section 6 validation and uncertainty analysis of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients using pmm test data are presented the final section is the conclusion 2 nonlinear manoeuvring modelling using lagrange s method the newton s second law is one of the widely used methods for the mathematical modelling of a rigid body motion but the disadvantage is that it describes the motion in an inertial reference frame and difficult to switch to a different coordinate system the lagrangian method in contrast is independent of the coordinates lurie 2002 in this section the manoeuvring model for a marine ship is derived using kirchhoff s equations kirchhoff 1869 consider a ship with linear velocity v 1 u v w t and angular velocity v 2 p q r t the kirchhoff s equations is given fossen 2011 1 d d t t ν 1 m a s s t e r m s s ν 2 t ν 1 c

the rigid body s is the skew symmetric cross product operator τ represents the forces and moment τ 1 x y z t and τ 2 k m n t for convenience we assumed that the equations are solved at the centre of

the above equations are rewritten in a vectorial setting with emphasis placed on matrix properties like positiveness symmetry and skew symmetry berge and fossen 2000 those properties benefit the marine control system design controller and observer fossen 2011 so the above equations can be formulated into 5 m r b v c r b v v τ r b where m r b is the mass matrix in 3 dof surge sway and yaw it is same as derived using newton s second law c r b is the rigid body coriolis centripetal matrix and it can be considered to be a correction of the first to compensate for the fact that the equation

the most commonly used normalization forms for the manoeuvring of the marine ship is the prime system of sname sname 1950 the water density ρ the ship length l and the ship speed u are employed as the characteristic dimensional parameter the list of the nondimensionalized factors and corresponding coefficients in eqs 14 16 is shown in table 1 3 uncertainty analysis of the estimated hydrodynamic coefficients the uncertainty of the estimated hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise is discussed in this section the parameter with a large uncertainty is very sensitive to the noise and usually drift from the true value this phenomenon was observed by hwang hwang 1980 and was called parameter drift the physical reason for the parameter drift was discussed by hwang using slender body theory and the multicollinearity was considered as the main factor hwang 1980 luo 2016 luo and li 2017 in this section the classical parameters estimation method least squares ls is briefly introduced and a mathematical explanation of the parameter drift is discussed using singular value decomposition the above eqs 15 17 need to be reordered in a vector format given by 18 x θ y where the matrix x ℝ n 38 contains the measured data θ ℝ 38 1 represents the uncertain parameters described in eq 19 and y x y n t is the matrix of the recorded forces and moments during the tests in this study there are 38

18 the estimation problem is to find the optimal parameters θ which can minimise the difference between the estimated values y ˆ x θ and the measured data y in addition several assumptions need to be made the first assumption is that the sample of measurements y i are uncorrelated it is reasonable because each measurement is independent each measurement y i has a particular variance σ y 2 due to the environmental disturbance and sensors in order to find the optimal parameters the residual error e y ˆ x i θ y need to be defined first furthermore the error needs to be dominated by the high accuracy data small variance and less affected by the low accuracy data large variance so the weighted sum of the squared residuals also called chi squared is defined in terms of the vectors 20 χ 2 θ x θ y t v y 1 x θ y where v y is the diagonal matrix of variances of y usually it can be assumed to be the identity matrix if the variances of y is unknown in advance the optimal parameters θ corresponds to the minimum value of the χ 2 error function which means the derivative of χ 2 respect to the θ equals to zero 21 χ 2 θ θ θ ˆ 0 x t v y 1 x θ ˆ x t v y 1 y 0 then the optimal values of the parameters can be obtained as 22 θ ˆ x t v y 1 x 1 x t v y 1 y the χ 2 error function can be minimized with respect to the parameters θ the estimated values which have the best agreement with the measured data can be computed using y ˆ x i θ ˆ x θ ˆ 3 2 uncertainty analysis due to the ill conditioned matrix the uncertainty analysis of the identified parameters in the model is of paramount importance to obtain a robust model large uncertainty or covariance of the parameters can be due to noise in data or an ill conditioned model or both if the obtained parameters with a large uncertainty it means that the parameters drift from their true values with higher probability a poorly identified model models with large parametric uncertainty is very sensitive to the disturbance in the input data such a model cannot reproduce the behaviour of the system with high accuracy this is due to the fact that the parameters with large uncertainty will change dramatically with the errors in the measured data in this section singular value decomposition is introduced to analysis the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in data the matrix x can be rewritten as 23 x i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i σ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix x furthermore substitution of eq 23 into the optimal parameter estimation in eq 18 gives 24 θ v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t y σ i as presented in eq 24 the smaller singular values can potentially dominate the solutions θ assume that there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 25 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y the smaller the singular value σ i is the more uncertainty the estimated parameters have for example if σ i is close to the numerical precision of the computation then the singular values σ i and the corresponding columns of u and v contribute negligibly to the matrix x their contribution to the solution can be easily dominated by the noise and round off error in the recorded data y the condition number is usually used to measure how sensitive the matrix x is to the error the recorded data y if the condition number is large then it is ill conditioned the condition number for eqs 15 17 is given in table 2 the uncertainty of parameters is affected by noise and quantified by the error propagation matrix the error propagation matrix or covariance matrix can be used to indicate how the random errors in the recorded data y as described by v y propagate to the optimal parameter θ ˆ the error propagation matrix is given by 26 v θ ˆ θ ˆ y v y θ ˆ y t where the standard error of the parameters σ θ ˆ can get by calculation of the square root of the diagonal of the error propagation matrix then the absolute error can be calculated easily the confidence intervals for the parameters can get by 27 θ ˆ t 1 α 2 σ θ ˆ θ θ ˆ t 1 α 2 σ θ ˆ where 1 α is the desired confidence level and t is the student t statistic 4 the methods for diminishing the parameter uncertainty in this section in order to alleviate or diminish the uncertainty two methods truncated singular value decomposition tsvd and tikhonov regularization are introduced to estimate the parameters 4 1 optimal truncated singular value decomposition in order to get a physically meaningful solution it is necessary to reduce the effect caused by the smaller singular values in most cases tsvd is an effective tool to reduce the uncertainty of the data set tsvd is used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix x by simply retaining the first r singular values of x and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 28 x r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulting x r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered it should be noted that truncation of the original matrix will inevitably increase the bias error for the parameters due to the loss of some information but the uncertainty of the parameters parameters drift can be reduced significantly as presented in the following section the bias error for the parameters increases slightly because the smaller singular values contribute little to the parameters the optimal value of r can be estimated using the l curve it is a log log plot of the norm of a regularized solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm it is a convenient graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the regularization parameter varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 hansen and o leary 1993 as presented in fig 1 in our current data set the optimal r equals to 30 4 2 tikhonov regularization with singular value decomposition tikhonov regularization is the most commonly used method of regularization of ill posed problems bell et al 1978 the goal of regularization is to improve the condition number of the matrix x while leaving the solution relatively unchanged the effect of tikhonov regularization is to estimate model parameters while also keeping the model parameters near some reference values in tikhonov regularization a quadratic term involving the parameters θ is included in the least squares error function consider eq 18 the cost function for tikhonov regularization can be defined as 29 j θ x θ y p 2 β 2 θ θ q 2 where p and q are the weighting matrices and positively defined tikhonov regularization factor β 2 is non negative and weights the relative importance of x θ y p 2 and θ θ q 2 the reference parameter vector θ reflect the way in which we would like to constrain the parameters setting the derivative of j θ respect to the θ equals to zero then one gets 30 j θ t θ 2 x t p x θ 2 x t p y 2 β 2 q θ 2 β 2 q θ 0 solving for the parameter θ then 31 θ ˆ x t p x β 2 q 1 x t p y β 2 q θ in most cases every measurement y i has the same distribution of measurement errors and the measurement errors are uncorrelated in order to simplify the problem the difference between the parameters θ θ are assumed to be equally important so the weighting matrix p and q can be set to the identity matrix if there is no reference parameter set it is common to set θ 0 then substitute the singular value decomposition of x into eq 31 32 θ ˆ v σ u t u σ v t β 2 i 1 v σ u t y v σ 2 β 2 i 1 σ u t y i 1 n v i σ i σ i 2 β 2 u i t y as shown in eq 32 the singular values of the matrix x are damped by the tikhonov regularization factor it is equivalent to a singular value decomposition solution in which the inverse of each singular value 1 σ i is replaced by σ i σ i 2 β 2 obviously the largest singular values are negligibly affected by the regularization factor but the effects of the smallest singular values on the solution are suppressed 5 planar motion mechanism pmm tests a series of captive model tests were carried out by sintef ocean ocean during a research project simval on the scaled ship model according to the recommended procedures by ittc 2002 the captive model test is nowadays commonly used to provide data for the identification and validation of mathematical models of ship manoeuvring motion it can provide a reasonable estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients however performing such tests is costly in this section a brief summary of different pmm tests is presented such as pure surge pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw which were carried out in sintef ocean s multi purpose towing tank sintef using the scaled ship model presented in fig 2 the motions in the surge sway and yaw were controlled using a 6 dof hexapod motion platform which is mounted on the carriage each type of test emphasises different dynamic characteristics pure surge a pure surge test tows the model forward with oscillations around a fixed velocity it is usually sinusoidal oscillations this test aims to achieve the full response of surge motion pure drift a pure drift test tows the model forward with a fixed oblique angle this test is usually used to isolate the static derivatives from yaw motion ross et al 2015 pure sway a pure sway test is used to isolate the sway dynamics from the yaw motion the ship will move forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway this test aims to achieve the full response of sway motion pure yaw similarly in a pure yaw test the model will move forward with a sinusoidal oscillation in yaw the effect of sway can be neglected owing to the zero velocity in sway motion mixed sway and yaw this test was carried out using a ship model at a set of sway velocity and yaw rate it is a generalization of pure yaw except the model is held at a nonzero sway ross 2008 6 validation and sensitive analysis of the hydrodynamic coefficients in this section the parameter estimation based on the least squares method is presented using the pmm test data the uncertainty of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients is discussed in order to diminish the uncertainty or parameter drift due to the noise the previously discussed methods truncated singular value decomposition and tikhonov regularization are employed to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients the absolute error of the obtained parameters is compared with results using the least squares method before the identification process the data needs to be regrouped to be used as a training set in the identification process the training set should contain enough information to excite the 3 dof manoeuvring model surge sway and yaw motion here the training set contains data collected from surge acceleration pure drift pure surge pure sway and mixed sway and yaw tests it is built by simply joining all the data in sequence a small portion of the data was kept for validation the same process is carried out to construct a new data set for validation purpose in order to assess the performance of the numerical model the data for validation was not used for training in the first phase the parameter estimation based on least squares method has been carried out using training set the prediction of forces and moments compared with training data is presented in fig 3 a from this figure the curves fit well with each other especially for sway force and yaw moments a similar process was also carried out after treating the data set using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization as shown in fig 3 b and c furthermore the obtained numerical model also can predict the system response successfully the performance of both numerical models needs to be verified the manoeuvring model is validated if the model can approximate the measured force and moments of the validation data set with high accuracy the validation data set is a small portion of all pmm data and is not used for training purpose the fit of the models obtained by least square tsvd and tikhonov regularization is presented in fig 4 from the figures all the models work well and can successfully predict the test data the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the goodness of the fitness the r 2 is the ratio of the variability in the data that is not explained by the model to the total variability in the data if r 2 equal to zero it means that the model fails to explain the measurement variability otherwise if r 2 equal to 1 it means that all the variability of measured data can be fully explained by the model if r 2 is negative it means the model can explain the data worse than the mean value the r 2 for the validation process is presented in table 3 from this table the three methods have almost equal accuracy in predicting the test data however the uncertainty of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients can be diminished significantly using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization method the obtained nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients of the lagrange s model are presented in table 4 the error propagation matrix of the estimated parameters is calculated using eq 25 the absolute errors of the obtained parameters are presented in table 4 the bar plot is presented in fig 5 here it is assumed that if the absolute error bigger than 100 the obtained parameters are not stable and easily affected by the noise the identify values will drift from the true value with a large probability as presented in fig 5 there are 5 parameters are failed to be estimated using the least squares method 4 parameters using tsvd and 1 parameter using tikhonov regularization obviously for example x u u l and x u u u l are highly linearly correlated the so called multicollinearity happens tsvd and tikhonov regularization can significantly improve this condition observing the absolute errors in table 5 the proposed methods provide very stable results for the yaw motion equation the absolute errors are smaller than 6 it is because that the yaw motion is fully excited using the pmm test the structure of the yaw motion equation is reasonable the largest uncertainty occurs in the surge motion because the surging speed is kept as constant during the most pmm test so the surge motion is not fully excited for sway motion the uncertainty is significantly diminished using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization 7 conclusions this paper discussed the parameter uncertainty also called parameter drift of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 dof and truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization were employed to diminish the uncertainty first a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 dof was derived using lagrange s method in order to compare the coefficients of different ships the hydrodynamic coefficients have been converted to the dimensionless ones using the prime system of sname 1950 a series of captive model tests were carried out by sintef ocean ocean on the scaled ship model according to the recommended procedures by ittc the data was used for the parameter estimation of the manoeuvring model and validation the classical parameters estimation method least squares method is briefly introduced and the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in the measured data is analysed using singular value decomposition the parameters with large uncertainty are very sensitive to the noise and easily drift the true values a mathematical explanation for the parameter uncertainty or parameter drift was given using singular values decomposition the estimation of the hydrodynamic manoeuvring coefficients is a typically ill posed problem so truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization was employed to reduce the uncertainty and diminish the parameter drift the nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained using a least squares method truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization based on pmm test data the performance of the resulting nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the portion of the data which was not used in the identification process the r 2 goodness of fit criterion was used to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained models identification of the uncertain parameters using truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization resulted in good estimating the parameters with smaller uncertainty

the requirements of marine ship design and ship manoeuvring and operation the development of numerical computation makes it possible to simulate the ship response travelling with the complicated environmental disturbance and vessel simulators are playing an important role in the testing and verification of the computer software of the complex system such as dynamic positioning dp ships sørensen 2011 remotely operated vehicles rovs operations and control systems moreira and guedes soares 2011 fernandes et al 2015 ridao et al 2015 and ship simulators varela and guedes soares 2015a 2015b many mathematical models of marine vessels have been proposed to meet application requirements such as abkowitz model abkowitz 1980 maneuvering modelling group mmg model yoshimura 2005 nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 a core mathematical model for hard manoeuvres sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b sutulo and guedes soares 2011 and vectorial model fossen 2011 these models have different features and are proposed for different application purposes considering the trade off between the complexity and fidelity for example nomoto model was proposed for autopilot design only considering the yaw motion the vectorial model proposed by fossen 2011 is describing the motion of ships in a vectorial setting vectorial models are extensively used in the stability analysis and designing controllers and observers for marine ships the model of sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b 2011 allows describing arbitrary 3dof ship manoeuvring motions estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is a challenge and an interesting topic ittc 2002 captive model test carried out in a multi purpose towing tank sintef is a reliable and effective method to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments from which hydrodynamic coefficients in manoeuvring model can be determined sutulo and guedes soares 2006 system identification is a mature technique for building mathematical models of dynamical systems from measured data ljung 1999 now it has been widely used for estimation the hydrodynamics coefficients for marine vessels åström and källström 1976 golding et al 2006 perera et al 2012 luo et al 2014 luo and zou 2009 ross et al 2015 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 van de ven et al 2007 xu et al 2018b many methods have been developed for system identification and least squares ls is one of the most popular methods in golding et al 2006 the nonlinear viscous damping forces of a surface vessel in the horizontal plane was estimated using the least squares method in ross et al 2015 the least squares method was used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients based on planar motion mechanism pmm tests the obtained mathematical model was then validated by reproducing the manoeuvring test conducted in full scale hassani et al 2015 in sutulo and guedes soares 2015a b 2014 an optimal offline system identification method combined the least squares with genetic algorithm was proposed to estimate the parameters of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model other methods have been employed to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for example van de ven et al 2007 used a neural network to estimate the damping matrix of an underwater vehicle moreira and guedes soares 2003 adopted recursive neural networks for a dynamic model of manoeuvrability extended kalman filter ekf is also a good option and it was used for parameter estimation fossen et al 1996 proposed an off line parallel extended kalman filter algorithm utilizing two measurement series in parallel to estimate the parameters of the dynamic positioning ship model an adaptive wave filter coupled with a maximum likelihood parameter identification technique was proposed by hassani et al 2013 and used for dynamic positioning control of marine vessels in perera et al 2016 2015 the parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering were identified using an extended kalman filter recently the support vector machine svm has been applied to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of a ship model luo and zou 2009 luo et al 2016 svm is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classifications suykens and vandewalle 1999 or regression challenges cortes and vapnik 1995 suykens et al 2002 it has been receiving much attention in the last decade and was one of the most popular machine learning algorithms in hou et al 2018 a roll motion equation for floating structures in irregular waves was identified using a ε support vector regression a modified version least squares support vector machine lssvm was applied to model the controller of the marine surface vehicle for path following scenarios based on manoeuvring test xu and guedes soares 2018 2016 an online version of lssvm was used for dynamic ship steering modelling based on free running model tests xu et al 2018a least squares is a simple and popular method for parameter estimation but there are also some disadvantages chen and ljung 2013 ljung 1999 the parameters estimated by least squares method are usually largely affected by the noise of training data and it usually leads to non consistent estimates söderström 2013 truncated singular value decomposition tsvd golub and reinsch 1970 is a good option to solve the ill conditioned problem of the least squares method chan and hansen 1990 the main assumption is to neglect its smallest singular values hansen 1998 because the data corresponding to smaller singular values usually imposes more uncertainty in the process of estimating uncertain parameters liu et al 2017 proposed a novel method to establish a model which can efficiently reduce the ill posedness combining with the singular value decomposition in chen and ljung 2013 a regularized least square method was used to solve the hyper parameter estimation problem with large data sets and ill conditioned computations tikhonov regularization bell et al 1978 is the most commonly used method of regularization of ill posed problems it can significantly improve the condition number by modifying the normal equations in the least squares method while leaving the estimated parameter relatively unchanged the effect of tikhonov regularization is to estimate the parameters while also keep them near the reference values golub et al 1999 hansen and o leary 1993 ma et al 2017 the uncertainty of the identified parameters due to the ill conditioned problem is also a challenge problem in marine ship modelling the obtained parameters with a large uncertainty are very sensitive to the noise in the measured data and usually drift from the true values which was called parameter drift hwang 1980 liu et al 2016 in hwang 1980 the dynamic cancellation was found and the linear hydrodynamic coefficients drift simultaneously using slender body theory in luo and li 2017 nonlinear hydrodynamic coefficients was also found due to the so called multicollinearity the parameter drift cannot be eliminated due to physical reasons and several methods were proposed in hwang 1980 luo and li 2017 to diminish the parameters drift such as parallel processing and additional excitation it is necessary to point that the main purpose of these methods is to reconstruct the samples and improve the condition number the main contribution of this paper is to give a mathematical explanation for the parameter drift and two methods truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization are introduced to diminish the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in the measured data a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 degrees of freedom dof is derived using lagrange s method in order to compare the coefficients of different ships the hydrodynamic coefficients have been converted to the dimensionless ones using the prime system of sname sname 1950 the identification procedure uses a data set from a series of pmm tests carried out by sintef ocean on their multi purpose towing tank sintef using a scaled ship model of research vessel gunnerus hassani et al 2015 various captive model tests recommended by ittc 2002 have been carried out such as pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw the nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients are obtained using the classical least square tsvd and tikhonov regularization the resulted nonlinear manoeuvring models were further tested against the portion of the data that was not used in the identification process the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained models uncertainty analysis of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients is carried out the results show that tsvd and tikhonov regularization can provide more stable results and diminish the parameter drift the rest paper is organized as follows in section 2 a nonlinear manoeuvring modelling in 3 dofs is derived using lagrange s method and dimensionless form is given using the prime system of sname in section 3 uncertainty analysis of the identified parameters is given using singular value decomposition in order to diminish the parameter uncertainty the least squares and tikhonov regularization combined with the singular value decomposition are presented in section 4 section 5 describes the planar motion mechanism pmm tests in section 6 validation and uncertainty analysis of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients using pmm test data are presented the final section is the conclusion 2 nonlinear manoeuvring modelling using lagrange s method the newton s second law is one of the widely used methods for the mathematical modelling of a rigid body motion but the disadvantage is that it describes the motion in an inertial reference frame and difficult to switch to a different coordinate system the lagrangian method in contrast is independent of the coordinates lurie 2002 in this section the manoeuvring model for a marine ship is derived using kirchhoff s equations kirchhoff 1869 consider a ship with linear velocity v 1 u v w t and angular velocity v 2 p q r t the kirchhoff s equations is given fossen 2011 1 d d t t ν 1 m a s s t e r m s s ν 2 t ν 1 c

the rigid body s is the skew symmetric cross product operator τ represents the forces and moment τ 1 x y z t and τ 2 k m n t for convenience we assumed that the equations are solved at the centre of gravity and the ship is port starboard symmetric the mass matrix in 6 degrees of freedom dof can be formed as 2 m r b 6 d o f m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 m 0 0 0 0 0 0 i x 0 i x z 0 0 0 0 i y 0 0 0 0

the above equations are rewritten in a vectorial setting with emphasis placed on matrix properties like positiveness symmetry and skew symmetry berge and fossen 2000 those properties benefit the marine control system design controller and observer fossen 2011 so the above equations can be formulated into 5 m r b v c r b v v τ r b where m r b is the mass matrix in 3 dof surge sway and yaw it is same as derived using newton s second law c r b is the rigid body coriolis centripetal matrix and it can be considered to be a correction of the first to compensate for the fact that the equation

energy is imparted to the fluid these forces due to the water around the ship are usually proportioned to the acceleration of the ship so they are denoted as added mass represented as in fossen 2011 9 m a x u 0 0 0 y v y r 0 n v n r where x u and y v are the added mass in surge and sway motion respectively n r is the add inertia moment y r and n v are the cross inertia terms then the kinetic energy

2011 applying the kirchhoff s equations then the forces on the rigid body due to added mass can get 11 x a d d t t a u r t a v y a d d t t a v r t a u n a d d t t a r a d d e d m a s s v t a u u t a v

the most commonly used normalization forms for the manoeuvring of the marine ship is the prime system of sname sname 1950 the water density ρ the ship length l and the ship speed u are employed as the characteristic dimensional parameter the list of the nondimensionalized factors and corresponding coefficients in eqs 14 16 is shown in table 1 3 uncertainty analysis of the estimated hydrodynamic coefficients the uncertainty of the estimated hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise is discussed in this section the parameter with a large uncertainty is very sensitive to the noise and usually drift from the true value this phenomenon was observed by hwang hwang 1980 and was called parameter drift the physical reason for the parameter drift was discussed by hwang using slender body theory and the multicollinearity was considered as the main factor hwang 1980 luo 2016 luo and li 2017 in this section the classical parameters estimation method least squares ls is briefly introduced and a mathematical explanation of the parameter drift is discussed using singular value decomposition the above eqs 15 17 need to be reordered in a vector format given by 18 x θ y where the matrix x ℝ n 38

18 the estimation problem is to find the optimal parameters θ which can minimise the difference between the estimated values y ˆ x θ and the measured data y in addition several assumptions need to be made the first assumption is that the sample of measurements y i are uncorrelated it is reasonable because each measurement is independent each measurement y i has a particular variance σ y 2 due to the environmental disturbance and sensors in order to find the optimal parameters the residual error e y ˆ x i θ y need to be defined first furthermore the error needs to be dominated by the high accuracy data small variance and less affected by the low accuracy data large variance so the weighted sum of the squared residuals also called chi squared is defined in terms of the vectors 20 χ 2 θ x θ y t v y 1 x θ y where v y is the diagonal matrix of variances of y usually it can be assumed to be the identity matrix if the variances of y is unknown in advance the optimal parameters θ corresponds to the minimum value of the χ 2 error function which means the derivative of χ 2 respect to the θ equals to zero 21 χ 2 θ θ θ ˆ 0 x t v y 1 x θ ˆ x t v y 1 y 0 then the optimal values of the parameters can be obtained as 22 θ ˆ x t v y 1 x 1 x t v y 1 y the χ 2 error function can be minimized with respect to the parameters θ the estimated values which have the best agreement with the measured data can be computed using y ˆ x i θ ˆ x θ ˆ 3 2 uncertainty analysis due to the ill conditioned matrix the uncertainty analysis of the identified parameters in the model is of paramount importance to obtain a robust model large uncertainty or covariance of the parameters can be due to noise in data or an ill conditioned model or both if the obtained parameters with a large uncertainty it means that the parameters drift from their true values with higher probability a poorly identified model models with large parametric uncertainty is very sensitive to the disturbance in the input data such a model cannot reproduce the behaviour of the system with high accuracy this is due to the fact that the parameters with large uncertainty will change dramatically with the errors in the measured data in this section singular value decomposition is introduced to analysis the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in data the matrix x can be rewritten as 23 x i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i σ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix x furthermore substitution of eq 23 into the optimal parameter estimation in eq 18 gives 24 θ v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t y σ i as presented in eq 24 the smaller singular values can potentially dominate the solutions θ assume that there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 25 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y the smaller the singular value σ i is the more uncertainty the estimated parameters have for example if σ i is close to the numerical precision of the computation then the singular values σ i and the corresponding columns of u and v contribute negligibly to the matrix x their contribution to the solution can be easily dominated by the noise and round off error in the recorded data y the condition number is usually used to measure how sensitive the matrix x is to the error the recorded data y if the condition number is large then it is ill conditioned the condition number for eqs 15 17 is given in table 2 the uncertainty of parameters is affected by noise and quantified by the error propagation matrix the error propagation matrix or covariance matrix can be used to indicate how the random errors in the recorded data y as described by v y propagate to the optimal parameter θ ˆ the error propagation matrix is given by 26 v θ ˆ θ ˆ y v y θ ˆ y t where the standard error of the parameters σ θ ˆ can get by calculation of the square root of the diagonal of the error propagation matrix then the absolute error can be calculated easily the confidence intervals for the parameters can get by 27 θ ˆ t 1 α 2 σ θ ˆ θ θ ˆ t 1 α 2 σ θ ˆ where 1 α is the desired confidence level and t is the student t statistic 4 the methods for diminishing the parameter uncertainty in this section in order to alleviate or diminish the uncertainty two methods truncated singular value decomposition tsvd and tikhonov regularization are introduced to estimate the parameters 4 1 optimal truncated singular value decomposition in order to get a physically meaningful solution it is necessary to reduce the effect caused by the smaller singular values in most cases tsvd is an effective tool to reduce the uncertainty of the data set tsvd is used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix x by simply retaining the first r singular values of x and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 28 x r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulting x r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered it should be noted that truncation of the original matrix will inevitably increase the bias error for the parameters due to the loss of some information but the uncertainty of the parameters parameters drift can be reduced significantly as presented in the following section the bias error for the parameters increases slightly because the smaller singular values contribute little to the parameters the optimal value of r can be estimated using the l curve it is a log log plot of the norm of a regularized solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm it is a convenient graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the regularization parameter varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 hansen and o leary 1993 as presented in fig 1 in our current data set the optimal r equals to 30 4 2 tikhonov regularization with singular value decomposition tikhonov regularization is the most commonly used method of regularization of ill posed problems bell et al 1978 the goal of regularization is to improve the condition number of the matrix x while leaving the solution relatively unchanged the effect of tikhonov regularization is to estimate model parameters while also keeping the model parameters near some reference values in tikhonov regularization a quadratic term involving the parameters θ is included in the least squares error function consider eq 18 the cost function for tikhonov regularization can be defined as 29 j θ x θ y p 2 β 2 θ θ q 2 where p and q are the weighting matrices and positively defined tikhonov regularization factor β 2 is non negative and weights the relative importance of x θ y p 2 and θ θ q 2 the reference parameter vector θ reflect the way in which we would like to constrain the parameters setting the derivative of j θ respect to the θ equals to zero then one gets 30 j θ t θ 2 x t p x θ 2 x t p y 2 β 2 q θ 2 β 2 q θ 0 solving for the parameter θ then 31 θ ˆ x t p x β 2 q 1 x t p y β 2 q θ in most cases every measurement y i has the same distribution of measurement errors and the measurement errors are uncorrelated in order to simplify the problem the difference between the parameters θ θ are assumed to be equally important so the weighting matrix p and q can be set to the identity matrix if there is no reference parameter set it is common to set θ 0 then substitute the singular value decomposition of x into eq 31 32 θ ˆ v σ u t u σ v t β 2 i 1 v σ u t y v σ 2 β 2 i 1 σ u t y i 1 n v i σ i σ i 2 β 2 u i t y as shown in eq 32 the singular values of the matrix x are damped by the tikhonov regularization factor it is equivalent to a singular value decomposition solution in which the inverse of each singular value 1 σ i is replaced by σ i σ i 2 β 2 obviously the largest singular values are negligibly affected by the regularization factor but the effects of the smallest singular values on the solution are suppressed 5 planar motion mechanism pmm tests a series of captive model tests were carried out by sintef ocean ocean during a research project simval on the scaled ship model according to the recommended procedures by ittc 2002 the captive model test is nowadays commonly used to provide data for the identification and validation of mathematical models of ship manoeuvring motion it can provide a reasonable estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients however performing such tests is costly in this section a brief summary of different pmm tests is presented such as pure surge pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw which were carried out in sintef ocean s multi purpose towing tank sintef using the scaled ship model presented in fig 2 the motions in the surge sway and yaw were controlled using a 6 dof hexapod motion platform which is mounted on the carriage each type of test emphasises different dynamic characteristics pure surge a pure surge test tows the model forward with oscillations around a fixed velocity it is usually sinusoidal oscillations this test aims to achieve the full response of surge motion pure drift a pure drift test tows the model forward with a fixed oblique angle this test is usually used to isolate the static derivatives from yaw motion ross et al 2015 pure sway a pure sway test is used to isolate the sway dynamics from the yaw motion the ship will move forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway this test aims to achieve the full response of sway motion pure yaw similarly in a pure yaw test the model will move forward with a sinusoidal oscillation in yaw the effect of sway can be neglected owing to the zero velocity in sway motion mixed sway and yaw this test was carried out using a ship model at a set of sway velocity and yaw rate it is a generalization of pure yaw except the model is held at a nonzero sway ross 2008 6 validation and sensitive analysis of the hydrodynamic coefficients in this section the parameter estimation based on the least squares method is presented using the pmm test data the uncertainty of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients is discussed in order to diminish the uncertainty or parameter drift due to the noise the previously discussed methods truncated singular value decomposition and tikhonov regularization are employed to identify the hydrodynamic coefficients the absolute error of the obtained parameters is compared with results using the least squares method before the identification process the data needs to be regrouped to be used as a training set in the identification process the training set should contain enough information to excite the 3 dof manoeuvring model surge sway and yaw motion here the training set contains data collected from surge acceleration pure drift pure surge pure sway and mixed sway and yaw tests it is built by simply joining all the data in sequence a small portion of the data was kept for validation the same process is carried out to construct a new data set for validation purpose in order to assess the performance of the numerical model the data for validation was not used for training in the first phase the parameter estimation based on least squares method has been carried out using training set the prediction of forces and moments compared with training data is presented in fig 3 a from this figure the curves fit well with each other especially for sway force and yaw moments a similar process was also carried out after treating the data set using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization as shown in fig 3 b and c furthermore the obtained numerical model also can predict the system response successfully the performance of both numerical models needs to be verified the manoeuvring model is validated if the model can approximate the measured force and moments of the validation data set with high accuracy the validation data set is a small portion of all pmm data and is not used for training purpose the fit of the models obtained by least square tsvd and tikhonov regularization is presented in fig 4 from the figures all the models work well and can successfully predict the test data the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the goodness of the fitness the r 2 is the ratio of the variability in the data that is not explained by the model to the total variability in the data if r 2 equal to zero it means that the model fails to explain the measurement variability otherwise if r 2 equal to 1 it means that all the variability of measured data can be fully explained by the model if r 2 is negative it means the model can explain the data worse than the mean value the r 2 for the validation process is presented in table 3 from this table the three methods have almost equal accuracy in predicting the test data however the uncertainty of the obtained hydrodynamic coefficients can be diminished significantly using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization method the obtained nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients of the lagrange s model are presented in table 4 the error propagation matrix of the estimated parameters is calculated using eq 25 the absolute errors of the obtained parameters are presented in table 4 the bar plot is presented in fig 5 here it is assumed that if the absolute error bigger than 100 the obtained parameters are not stable and easily affected by the noise the identify values will drift from the true value with a large probability as presented in fig 5 there are 5 parameters are failed to be estimated using the least squares method 4 parameters using tsvd and 1 parameter using tikhonov regularization obviously for example x u u l and x u u u l are highly linearly correlated the so called multicollinearity happens tsvd and tikhonov regularization can significantly improve this condition observing the absolute errors in table 5 the proposed methods provide very stable results for the yaw motion equation the absolute errors are smaller than 6 it is because that the yaw motion is fully excited using the pmm test the structure of the yaw motion equation is reasonable the largest uncertainty occurs in the surge motion because the surging speed is kept as constant during the most pmm test so the surge motion is not fully excited for sway motion the uncertainty is significantly diminished using the tsvd and tikhonov regularization 7 conclusions this paper discussed the parameter uncertainty also called parameter drift of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 dof and truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization were employed to diminish the uncertainty first a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model of a marine surface ship in 3 dof was derived using lagrange s method in order to compare the coefficients of different ships the hydrodynamic coefficients have been converted to the dimensionless ones using the prime system of sname 1950 a series of captive model tests were carried out by sintef ocean ocean on the scaled ship model according to the recommended procedures by ittc the data was used for the parameter estimation of the manoeuvring model and validation the classical parameters estimation method least squares method is briefly introduced and the uncertainty of the hydrodynamic coefficients due to the noise in the measured data is analysed using singular value decomposition the parameters with large uncertainty are very sensitive to the noise and easily drift the true values a mathematical explanation for the parameter uncertainty or parameter drift was given using singular values decomposition the estimation of the hydrodynamic manoeuvring coefficients is a typically ill posed problem so truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization was employed to reduce the uncertainty and diminish the parameter drift the nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained using a least squares method truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization based on pmm test data the performance of the resulting nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the portion of the data which was not used in the identification process the r 2 goodness of fit criterion was used to demonstrate the accuracy of the obtained models identification of the uncertain parameters using truncated singular values decomposition and tikhonov regularization resulted in good estimating the parameters with smaller uncertainty

keywords finite element method boundary element method hull shaft propeller vibro acoustic response 1 introduction due to good stealth performance submarine is considered as a powerful weapon to carry out tactical or strategic missions however high noise generated from a submarine may expose it to the passive sonar of enemy in the noise sources exist in a submarine the radiated noise due to propeller force which is induced by the rotation of a propeller in a non uniform wake is a major part the propeller force transmits through the shaft bearings and foundations to the hull resulting in the vibration of the hull the vibration correlated to the accordion and bending modes of the hull may lead to significant acoustic radiation the studies about acoustic radiation from underwater structures have been developed for years and the purposes of these works are mainly to help researchers understand the vibration and acoustic radiation of a pressure hull which is one main acoustic radiator in a submarine analytical methods can only solve the problems about simple underwater structures acoustic characteristics such as spherical shell s cylindrical shell s junger and feit 1972 skelton and james 1997 however practical pressure hull is a stiffened coupled shells structure far more complex than a cylindrical shell vibro acoustic responses of a fluid loaded hull in low

and has a good application in engineering zou et al 2018a the coupled finite element boundary element method is widely used to in vibro acoustic analysis due to its high calculation efficiency and precision for instance a study about the influence of a hull s buoyancy on the sound radiation and the acoustic contribution from the rigid modes of the hull peters et al 2015 hull shaft and propeller are the three factors that affect the vibro acoustic responses of a submarine due to propeller force the research efforts concerning the vibration and acoustic analysis of a propeller shaft hull coupled system are introduced below a dynamic model including the propeller shaft system the foundation and the cylindrical hull represented as a one dimensional rod is described by the transmission matrix approach dylejko et al 2007 to reduce the sound radiation from the system the authors discussed the use of a resonance changer and the optimized the connection between the propulsion and hull caresta and kessissoglou 2011 the coupled finite element boundary element model is developed for predicting the radiated sound power from a propeller shafting and pressure hull system merz et al 2009 the propeller shafting system includes the propeller shaft thrust bearing and foundation and the hull was modeled by a thin walled cylinder reinforced by ring stiffeners and bulkheads for the hull the excitation included the propeller forces transmitted through the propeller shaft system and acoustic dipoles via the surrounding fluid the dipoles at the propeller were related to the propeller forces in strength and direction and also contributed to the total sound power however the vibro acoustic responses due to the transversal excitation were not discussed in their work the structural and acoustic characteristics of the suboff submarine under the excitation caused by a propeller at different rotation speeds running in the wake of the submarine are investigated wei and wang 2013 the structure borne sound from the submarine radiated significantly at the propeller harmonics and the resonant frequencies of the breathing and bending modes of the submarine employing semi analytical method the structural vibration and acoustic radiation of a coupled propeller shaft hull system are predicted qu et al 2017 the propeller shaft system consisted of a rigid propeller an elastic shaft a radial bearing and a thrust bearing and the hull was a cylindrical shell closed by hemispherical end caps and with ring stiffeners and longitudinal stringers the authors examined the acoustic contributions from individual circumferential modes of the hull subject to the propeller forces in different directions and also pointed out that the decrease of the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing could reduce the radiated sound power from the coupled system to reduce the sound radiation of a propeller shaft hull coupled system the location and installation scheme of the foundation of thrust bearing are discussed by the three dimensional sono elasticity method qi et al 2018 literature concerning the effect of the dynamic characteristics of the shaft on the vibro acoustic responses of an immersed coupled shaft hull system is rather rare whether the resonance of shaft affects the coupled shaft hull system s acoustic response depends on the sound radiation efficiency of the hull at corresponding resonant frequency li et al 2016b all of the propeller models in the research work introduced above are rigid however the elasticity of propeller affects the dynamic behaviors of a propeller shaft coupled system li et al 2016a in addition both of the propeller and hull generate sound radiation in the far field and affect each other s acoustic characteristics merz et al 2009 to investigate the vibro acoustic responses of a propeller shaft hull coupled system the elasticity of the propeller should be considered in this paper a finite element boundary element coupled model has been developed to investigate the dynamic and acoustic responses of a submerged propeller shaft hull system the acoustic contribution to the total radiated sound power from the hull and the propeller is discussed using the panel acoustic contribution method the modal acoustic contribution method has been adopted to study the influence of the bearings on the acoustic response of the coupled system owing to the transversal propeller force 2 formulations of the problem 2 1 numerical modeling the submerged propeller shaft hull coupled system has been developed by the coupled finite element

contribution from a distinct structural part to the sound power can be analyzed providing a physical insight into the mechanism of sound radiation 2 2 2 modal acoustic contribution analysis using the

numerical investigation 3 1 numerical model the finite element model of the propulsion and hull coupled system is shown in fig 2 the hull is represented by a conical cylindrical hemispherical shells closed at the conical shell with a circular plate the cylinder is divided into 6 cabins by t section ring stiffeners as bulkheads ring stiffeners with a rectangular cross section of 0 018 m 0 009 m are evenly spaced by 0 113 m the other geometrical parameters of the hull are listed in table 1 the main components of the propulsion system are the propeller shaft bearings and foundation a 7 bladed propeller is considered in the paper the diameter of the propeller is 0 26 m and its volume of displaced water is 0 0033 m3 about 1 25 of the volume displaced by the hull the shaft and bearings are simplified as a circular section beam and springs respectively the foundation is modeled as a truncated conical shell closed by a circular plate at the small end to raise the stiffness of the foundation it is reinforced by 4 brackets the geometrical parameters of the shaft are listed in table 2 the hull foundation and shaft are made of steel and the propeller is made of bronze table 3 lists all the material data the displacement of the coupled system is 2640 kg the total mass of the hull shaft and propeller are approximately 628 5 kg to maintain neutral buoyancy of the model the density of steel for the hull is increased to 402 5 the model is submerged in water the density of water is 1000 kg m 3 and the sound velocity is 1500 m s 1 ansys has been used to establish the finite element model the shell and foundation are discretized by 7856 shell elements and the shaft and stiffeners are modeled using the beam elements the solid elements are used to simulate the finite element model of the propeller since the shaft and propeller are modeled by different types of finite elements the multi point constraint mpc ties the shaft to the propeller hub in addition the bearings are modeled using spring elements the acoustic mesh is also generated by ansys as shown in fig 3 at the frequencies of interest the size of the acoustic element is less than one sixth of 1 wavelength 3 2 results the propeller shaft hull coupled system is excited by axial and vertical force excitations applied at the propeller as shown in fig 4 since the model is an axisymmetric structure the response due to horizontal propeller force is the same as that due to vertical propeller force only the response due to the vertical propeller force is studied in this paper the magnitude of each force is 1 7 n for the coupled system it only is excited by propeller force however for the hull in the coupled system the excitation generated from the propeller not only includes the force excitation but also includes the acoustic excitation namely the sound radiation from the propeller owing to the propeller force to eliminate the influence due to the acoustic excitation the dynamic forces transmitted from the shaft to the hull through the bearings are computed and applied at the corresponding positions in the hull as shown in fig 5 in the case of axial force excitation only the thrust bearing transmits the axial dynamic force in the case of vertical force excitation the stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing transmit the vertical dynamic force simultaneously 3 2 1 axial force excitation to analyze acoustic stealth the radiated sound power of the propeller shaft hull coupled system under the axial force excitation is illustrated in fig 6 the resonant peaks at 147 hz 299 hz and 417 hz correspond to the first second and third hull axial resonances respectively due to the radiation damping of the fluid loaded hull increased with the frequencies the peaks corresponding to the hull axial resonant vibration becomes broader the largest peak in the acoustic response curve at 362 hz is attributed to the propeller resonance while the peak at 202 hz is induced by the excitation of the shaft axial resonance the operation deformation shapes corresponding to 202 hz and 362 hz are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the shaft axial resonance and the propeller umbrella mode are local vibration modes which both are coupled to the circumferential wavenumber n 0 vibration modes of the hull the acoustic contributions from the hull and propeller to the radiated sound power are calculated by eq 10 and shown in fig 6 since the sound radiation from the hull and propeller affect each other the radiated sound power from the coupled system does not equal the sum of the amplitudes of sound powers from the hull and propeller below 350 hz the acoustic contribution from the propeller can be neglected compared to that from the hull above 350 hz the acoustic contribution from the propeller is more obvious especially for the frequencies above 420 hz because the decreasing axial dynamic force transmitted from the shaft to the hull as shown in fig 9 in the axial dynamic force curve the 4 peaks are due to the first hull axial resonance the shaft axial resonance the second hull axial resonance and the propeller resonance respectively when the frequency of the propeller force is close to the natural frequencies of the shaft and propeller system high bearing forces will be transmitted to the pressure hull leading to significant acoustic signatures fig 10 compares the acoustic contribution from the hull in the coupled system under axial propeller force and the radiated sound power from the hull subject to the axial dynamic force excitation at the thrust bearing the difference between the amplitudes of the two results is very little below 420 hz above 420 hz the results diverge significantly as the frequency increases the former is higher than the latter according to the results illustrated in figs 6 and 10 in the low frequency domain the acoustic excitation from the propeller to the hull is marginal and the acoustic response of the hull due to the dynamic force predominates however in the higher frequency domain the results are opposite at 362 hz corresponding to the resonant frequency of the propeller the vibration of the propeller affects the acoustic characteristics of the coupled system mainly through the structural excitation in a word in the higher frequencies the influence of the elastic propeller on the acoustic response of the propeller shaft hull coupled system under the axial propeller force excitation should be taken into account qu et al 2017 reported that if the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing was reduced the radiated sound power decreased in this paper the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing k th is decreased from 1 109 n m 1 to 1 108 n m 1 and its influence on the acoustic response is shown in fig 11 the decreasing of the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing detunes the resonant frequency of the shaft from 202 hz to 78 hz and slightly affects the resonant frequencies of the hull and the propeller as well as significantly lowering the radiated sound power however the reduction of the axial stiffness does not decrease the sound power above 475 hz compared to the case of the thrust bearing axial stiffness of 1 109 n m 1 the acoustic contribution from the propeller is predominant over a broader frequency range in the case of axial stiffness of 1 108 n m 1 the reason is that the acoustic contribution from the hull is decreased compared the results shown in figs 6 and 11 the difference between the two results of the propeller s acoustic contribution is little above 250 hz the decreasement of the thrust bearing axial stiffness mainly affects the hull s acoustic characteristics but has little effect on the propeller s 3 2 2 vertical force excitation fig 12 illustrates the sound power from the propeller shaft hull coupled system subject to the vertical force excitation the resonant peaks of the coupled system are mainly attributed to the circumferential wavenumber n 1 modes of the hull except the resonant peaks at 144 and 227 hz induced by the shaft bending modes and the resonant peak at 349 hz induced by the propeller vertical resonance according to fig 12 the acoustic contribution from the hull is higher than that from the propeller over the range of frequencies analyzed the vertical dynamic forces at the three bearings are illustrated in fig 13 the amplitude of the vertical force at the stern bearing is the highest in the frequency ranges below 144 hz and from 233 hz to 449 hz in other frequency ranges the vertical force at the thrust bearing has the highest magnitude similar to the axial dynamic force at the thrust bearing not all of the resonant frequencies in the sound power curve occur in the vertical dynamic force curves for example the sound power curve has a resonant peak at 228 hz but the curve of the vertical dynamic force at the stern bearing does not have a resonant peak at 228 hz as shown in fig 14 in addition to the amplitude difference of the resonant peaks such as the peaks at 228 hz 330 hz and 349 hz and increasing the number of resonant peaks such as those at 363 hz and 409 hz the difference between the sound power from the coupled system under the vertical unit force at the propeller and that from the hull under the vertical dynamic forces at the bearings is not significant the amplitude difference indicates that the acoustic excitation due to the propeller vertical resonance of the is greater than that due to the propeller umbrella mode fig 15 a shows the mode shape corresponding to the 349 hz in the mode shape the vibration magnitude of the propeller is the maximum while that of the hull is relatively little and the circumferential wavenumber of the hull cannot be identified however when the propeller is not shown in the mode shape as shown in fig 15 b it can be judged that the mode of the hull is an n 1 mode the increased number of the resonant peaks is due to the excitation of the resonances of the circumferential wavenumber n 2 modes and the analysis is as follows three vertical unit forces are applied to the three bearings respectively as shown in fig 5 and the corresponding sound power is computed furthermore the sound power is decomposed by the modal decomposition approach to analyze individual modal contribution to the sound power from the hull as shown in fig 16 the six rigid body modes are divided into two groups the first group that is the n 0 modes group including the axial translation mode and breathing mode and the second group regarded as the n 1 modes group including the other four modes li et al 2015 according to fig 16 the acoustic contribution from the circumferential wavenumber n 0 modes of the hull can be neglected indicating that the axial resonances of an axisymmetric hull cannot be excited by vertical force excitations for the case of unit vertical force applied at the stern bearing as shown in fig 16 a the circumferential wavenumber n 1 modes beam modes contribute 100 to the total radiated sound power whereas the acoustic contribution from the n 2 modes is negligible since the stern bearing is located at the antinode position of the hull beam modes the hull beam modes can be excited by the vertical force at the stern bearing additionally the n 1 modes of a cylinder generally results in greater sound radiation compared to the higher circumferential wavenumber mode fahy and gardonio 2007 and therefore the total radiated sound power induced by the force at the stern bearing is the highest among the three cases for the hull under unit vertical force at the middle bearing as shown in fig 16 b below 280 hz the sound power from the n 1 modes outmatches that from the n 2 modes above 280 hz the n 1 and n 2 modes contribute to the total radiated sound power at respective resonant frequencies for the hull under unit vertical force at the thrust bearing as shown in fig 16 c the acoustic contribution from the beam modes dominate the response however the acoustic contribution from the n 2 modes increase the amplitude of the total radiated sound power at the higher frequencies 4 experimental validation in order to verify the influence of propeller elasticity on the propeller shaft hull coupled system an experiment of the coupled system s acoustic responses was carried out in an acoustic testing lake whose depth is about 50 m and width is more than 100 m for a vibration system resonance of any order can be represented by a single degree of freedom system fahy and gardonio 2007 therefore a mass block spring plate mass cylinder system as shown in fig 17 is used to simulate the umbrella mode of an elastic propeller the 1st natural frequency of the mass spring mass system is 252 hz and its corresponding modal shape is shown in fig 18 the block vibrates in the vertical direction while the cylinder remains stationary since the 1st natural frequency of the cylinder is higher than 5000 hz the cylinder can be regarded as a rigid propeller when the block and plate are removed the mass of the block and plate is one ninth of that of the cylinder and the effect of the mass change on the coupled system s vibro acoustic response is ignored by comparing the vibro acoustic responses of the experimental model with an elastic propeller or a rigid propeller the effect of propeller vibration was analyzed to reduce the difficulty and cost of the experiment the shaft cannot rotate the experimental model was excited by an impact hammer as shown in fig 19 and the sound pressure was collected by hydrophones fig 20 illustrates the influence of the vibration of the block plate cylinder system elastic propeller on the acoustic response of the experimental model by experimental and numerical methods the computed and tested resonance frequencies of the block plate cylinder are 252 hz and 253 hz respectively other tested and calculated resonant frequencies such as the resonant frequencies of the shaft and the 2nd hull axial resonance the relative errors are less than 10 due to the lower limit of the hydrophone s test band the experimental results are invalidated below 25 hz for the higher frequencies the amplitude difference mainly is caused by the manufacture tolerance of the experimental model for example the shaft misalignment overall the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the resonant vibration of the elastic propeller amplifies the sound pressure radiated from the model around 252 hz validating the phenomenon that the propeller resonance increases the sound power of the coupled system in the numerical study 5 conclusion numerical and experimental study of the dynamic and acoustic responses of a propeller shaft hull coupled system under propeller force are presented the effects of the elasticity of the propeller on the vibro acoustic response of the coupled system are discussed in the case of axial force excitation the acoustic contribution from the propeller is very little at low frequencies but is significant at higher frequencies consequently the reduction of axial stiffness of the thrust bearing can not decrease the sound power from the coupled system in the higher frequency range according to the numerical and experimental results the influence of the propeller umbrella resonance should be considered the acoustic contribution from the propeller itself at the corresponding resonant frequency is not notable but the propeller umbrella resonance can amplify the dynamic force transmitted from the shaft to the hull increasing the sound radiation in the case of vertical force excitation the hull is also the major sound radiator compared to the propeller the transversal force applied at the stern bearing can cause great sound radiation and the main transmission of transverse force is through the stern bearing therefore the stern bearing is an important factor that affects the dynamic and acoustic responses of the coupled system due to the transversal propeller force acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the referees for their

keywords finite element method boundary element method hull shaft propeller vibro acoustic response 1 introduction due to good stealth performance submarine is considered as a powerful weapon to carry out tactical or strategic missions however high noise generated from a submarine may expose it to the passive sonar of enemy in the noise sources exist in a submarine the radiated noise due to propeller force which is induced by the rotation of a propeller in a non uniform wake is a major part the propeller force transmits through the shaft bearings and foundations to the hull resulting in the vibration of the hull the vibration correlated to the accordion and bending modes of the hull may lead to significant acoustic radiation the studies about acoustic radiation from underwater structures have been developed for years and the purposes of these works are mainly to help researchers understand the vibration and acoustic radiation of a pressure hull which is one main acoustic radiator in a submarine analytical methods can only solve the problems about simple underwater structures acoustic characteristics such as spherical shell s cylindrical shell s junger and feit 1972 skelton and james 1997 however practical pressure hull is a stiffened coupled shells structure far more complex than a cylindrical shell vibro acoustic responses of a fluid loaded hull in low

caresta and kessissoglou 2011 the coupled finite element boundary element model is developed for predicting the radiated sound power from a propeller shafting and pressure hull system merz et al 2009 the propeller shafting system includes the propeller shaft thrust bearing and foundation and the hull was modeled by a thin walled cylinder reinforced by ring stiffeners and bulkheads for the hull the excitation included the propeller forces transmitted through the propeller shaft system and acoustic dipoles via the surrounding fluid the dipoles at the propeller were related to the propeller forces in strength and direction and also contributed to the total sound power however the vibro acoustic responses due to the transversal excitation were not discussed in their work the structural and acoustic characteristics of the suboff submarine under the excitation caused by a propeller at different rotation speeds running in the wake of the submarine are investigated wei and wang 2013 the structure borne sound from the submarine radiated significantly at the propeller harmonics and the resonant frequencies of the breathing and bending modes of the submarine employing semi analytical method the structural vibration and acoustic radiation of a coupled propeller shaft hull system are predicted qu et al 2017 the propeller shaft system consisted of a rigid propeller an elastic shaft a radial bearing and a thrust bearing and the hull was a cylindrical shell closed by hemispherical end caps and with ring stiffeners and longitudinal stringers the authors examined the acoustic contributions from individual circumferential modes of the hull subject to the propeller forces in different directions and also pointed out that the decrease of the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing could reduce the radiated sound power from the coupled system to reduce the sound radiation of a propeller shaft hull coupled system the location and installation scheme of the foundation of thrust bearing are discussed by the three dimensional sono elasticity method qi et al 2018 literature concerning the effect of the dynamic characteristics of the shaft on the vibro acoustic responses of an immersed coupled shaft hull system is rather rare whether the resonance of shaft affects the coupled shaft hull system s acoustic response depends on the sound radiation efficiency of the hull at corresponding resonant frequency li et al 2016b all of the propeller models in the research work introduced above are rigid however the elasticity of propeller affects the dynamic behaviors of a propeller shaft coupled system li et al 2016a in addition both of the propeller and hull generate sound radiation in the far field and affect each other s acoustic characteristics merz et al 2009 to investigate the vibro acoustic responses of a propeller shaft hull coupled system the elasticity of the propeller should be considered in this paper a finite element boundary element coupled model has been developed to investigate the dynamic and acoustic responses of a submerged propeller shaft hull system the acoustic contribution to the total radiated sound power from the hull and the propeller

numerical investigation 3 1 numerical model the finite element model of the propulsion and hull coupled system is shown in fig 2 the hull is represented by a conical cylindrical hemispherical shells closed at the conical shell with a circular plate the cylinder is divided into 6 cabins by t section ring stiffeners as bulkheads ring stiffeners with a rectangular cross section of 0 018 m 0 009 m are evenly spaced by 0 113 m the other geometrical parameters of the hull are listed in table 1 the main components of the propulsion system are the propeller shaft bearings and foundation a 7 bladed propeller is considered in the paper the diameter of the propeller is 0 26 m and its volume of displaced water is 0 0033 m3 about 1 25 of the volume displaced by the hull the shaft and bearings are simplified as a circular section beam and springs respectively the foundation is modeled as a truncated conical shell closed by a circular plate at the small end to raise the stiffness of the foundation it is reinforced by 4 brackets the geometrical parameters of the shaft are listed in table 2 the hull foundation and shaft are made of steel and the propeller is made of bronze table 3 lists all the material data the displacement of the coupled system is 2640 kg the total mass of the hull shaft and propeller are approximately 628 5 kg to maintain neutral buoyancy of the model the density of steel for the hull is increased to 402 5 the model is submerged in water the density of water is 1000 kg m 3 and the sound velocity is 1500 m s 1 ansys has been used to establish the finite element model the shell and foundation are discretized by 7856 shell elements and the shaft and stiffeners are modeled using the beam elements the solid elements are used to simulate the finite element model of the propeller since the shaft and propeller are modeled by different types of finite elements the multi point constraint mpc ties the shaft to the propeller hub in addition the bearings are modeled using spring elements the acoustic mesh is also generated by ansys as shown in fig 3 at the frequencies of interest the size of the acoustic element is less than one sixth of 1 wavelength 3 2 results the propeller shaft hull coupled system is excited by axial and vertical force excitations applied at the propeller as shown in fig 4 since the model is an axisymmetric structure the response due to horizontal propeller force is the same as that due to vertical propeller force only the response due to the vertical propeller force is studied in this paper the magnitude of each force is 1 7 n for the coupled system it only is excited by propeller force however for the hull in the coupled system the excitation generated from the propeller not only includes the force excitation but also includes the acoustic excitation namely the sound radiation from the propeller owing to the propeller force to eliminate the influence due to the acoustic excitation the dynamic forces transmitted from the shaft to the hull through the bearings are computed and applied at the corresponding positions in the hull as shown in fig 5 in the case of axial force excitation only the thrust bearing transmits the axial dynamic force in the case of vertical force excitation the stern bearing middle bearing and thrust bearing transmit the vertical dynamic force simultaneously 3 2 1 axial force excitation to analyze acoustic stealth the radiated sound power of the propeller shaft hull coupled system under the axial force excitation is illustrated in fig 6 the resonant peaks at 147 hz 299 hz and 417 hz correspond to the first second and third hull axial resonances respectively due to the radiation damping of the fluid loaded hull increased with the frequencies the peaks corresponding to the hull axial resonant vibration becomes broader the largest peak in the acoustic response curve at 362 hz is attributed to the propeller resonance while the peak at 202 hz is induced by the excitation of the shaft axial resonance the operation deformation shapes corresponding to 202 hz and 362 hz are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively the shaft axial resonance and the propeller umbrella mode are local vibration modes which both are coupled to the circumferential wavenumber n 0 vibration modes of the hull the acoustic contributions from the hull and propeller to the radiated sound power are calculated by eq 10 and shown in fig 6 since the sound radiation from the hull and propeller affect each other the radiated sound power from the coupled system does not equal the sum of the amplitudes of sound powers from the hull and propeller below 350 hz the acoustic contribution from the propeller can be neglected compared to that from the hull above 350 hz the acoustic contribution from the propeller is more obvious especially for the frequencies above 420 hz because the decreasing axial dynamic force transmitted from the shaft to the hull as shown in fig 9 in the axial dynamic force curve the 4 peaks are due to the first hull axial resonance the shaft axial resonance the second hull axial resonance and the propeller resonance respectively when the frequency of the propeller force is close to the natural frequencies of the shaft and propeller system high bearing forces will be transmitted to the pressure hull leading to significant acoustic signatures fig 10 compares the acoustic contribution from the hull in the coupled system under axial propeller force and the radiated sound power from the hull subject to the axial dynamic force excitation at the thrust bearing the difference between the amplitudes of the two results is very little below 420 hz above 420 hz the results diverge significantly as the frequency increases the former is higher than the latter according to the results illustrated in figs 6 and 10 in the low frequency domain the acoustic excitation from the propeller to the hull is marginal and the acoustic response of the hull due to the dynamic force predominates however in the higher frequency domain the results are opposite at 362 hz corresponding to the resonant frequency of the propeller the vibration of the propeller affects the acoustic characteristics of the coupled system mainly through the structural excitation in a word in the higher frequencies the influence of the elastic propeller on the acoustic response of the propeller shaft hull coupled system under the axial propeller force excitation should be taken into account qu et al 2017 reported that if the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing was reduced the radiated sound power decreased in this paper the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing k th is decreased from 1 109 n m 1 to 1 108 n m 1 and its influence on the acoustic response is shown in fig 11 the decreasing of the axial stiffness of the thrust bearing detunes the resonant frequency of the shaft from 202 hz to 78 hz and slightly affects the resonant frequencies of the hull and the propeller as well as significantly lowering the radiated sound power however the reduction of the axial stiffness does not decrease the sound power above 475 hz compared to the case of the thrust bearing axial stiffness of 1 109 n m 1 the acoustic contribution from the propeller is predominant over a broader frequency range in the case of axial stiffness of 1 108 n m 1 the reason is that the acoustic contribution from the hull is decreased compared the results shown in figs 6 and 11 the difference between the two results of the propeller s acoustic contribution is little above 250 hz the decreasement of the thrust bearing axial stiffness mainly affects the hull s acoustic characteristics but has little effect on the propeller s 3 2 2 vertical force excitation fig 12 illustrates the sound power from the propeller shaft hull coupled system subject to the vertical force excitation the resonant peaks of the coupled system are mainly attributed to the circumferential wavenumber n 1 modes of the hull except the resonant peaks at 144 and 227 hz induced by the shaft bending modes and the resonant peak at 349 hz induced by the propeller vertical resonance according to fig 12 the acoustic contribution from the hull is higher than that from the propeller over the range of frequencies analyzed the vertical dynamic forces at the three bearings are illustrated in fig 13 the amplitude of the vertical force at the stern bearing is the highest in the frequency ranges below 144 hz and from 233 hz to 449 hz in other frequency ranges the vertical force at the thrust bearing has the highest magnitude similar to the axial dynamic force at the thrust bearing not all of the resonant frequencies in the sound power curve occur in the vertical dynamic force curves for example the sound power curve has a resonant peak at 228 hz but the curve of the vertical dynamic force at the stern bearing does not have a resonant peak at 228 hz as shown in fig 14 in addition to the amplitude difference of the resonant peaks such as the peaks at 228 hz 330 hz and 349 hz and increasing the number of resonant peaks such as those at 363 hz and 409 hz the difference between the sound power from the coupled system under the vertical unit force at the propeller and that from the hull under the vertical dynamic forces at the bearings is not significant the amplitude difference indicates that the acoustic excitation due to the propeller vertical resonance of the is greater than that due to the propeller umbrella mode fig 15 a shows the mode shape corresponding to the 349 hz in the mode shape the vibration magnitude of the propeller is the maximum while that of the hull is relatively little and the circumferential wavenumber of the hull cannot be identified however when the propeller is not shown in the mode shape as shown in fig 15 b it can be judged that the mode of the hull is an n 1 mode the increased number of the resonant peaks is due to the excitation of the resonances of the circumferential wavenumber n 2 modes and the analysis is as follows three vertical unit forces are applied to the three bearings respectively as shown in fig 5 and the corresponding sound power is computed furthermore the sound power is decomposed by the modal decomposition approach to analyze individual modal contribution to the sound power from the hull as shown in fig 16 the six rigid body modes are divided into two groups the first group that is the n 0 modes group including the axial translation mode and breathing mode and the second group regarded as the n 1 modes group including the other four modes li et al 2015 according to fig 16 the acoustic contribution from the circumferential wavenumber n 0 modes of the hull can be neglected indicating that the axial resonances of an axisymmetric hull cannot be excited by vertical force excitations for the case of unit vertical force applied at the stern bearing as shown in fig 16 a the circumferential wavenumber n 1 modes beam modes contribute 100 to the total radiated sound power whereas the acoustic contribution from the n 2 modes is negligible since the stern bearing is located at the antinode position of the hull beam modes the hull beam modes can be excited by the vertical force at the stern bearing additionally the n 1 modes of a cylinder generally results in greater sound radiation compared to the higher circumferential wavenumber mode fahy and gardonio 2007 and therefore the total radiated sound power induced by the force at the stern bearing is the highest among the three cases for the hull under unit vertical force at the middle bearing as shown in fig 16 b below 280 hz the sound power from the n 1 modes outmatches that from the n 2 modes above 280 hz the n 1 and n 2 modes contribute to the total radiated sound power at respective resonant frequencies for the hull under unit vertical force at the thrust bearing as shown in fig 16 c the acoustic contribution from the beam modes dominate the response however the acoustic contribution from the n 2 modes increase the amplitude of the total radiated sound power at the higher frequencies 4 experimental validation in order to verify the influence of propeller elasticity on the propeller shaft hull coupled system an experiment of the coupled system s acoustic responses was carried out in an acoustic testing lake whose depth is about 50 m and width is more than 100 m for a vibration system resonance of any order can be represented by a single degree of freedom system fahy and gardonio 2007 therefore a mass block spring plate mass cylinder system as shown in fig 17 is used to simulate the umbrella mode of an elastic propeller the 1st natural frequency of the mass spring mass system is 252 hz and its corresponding modal shape is shown in fig 18 the block vibrates in the vertical direction while the cylinder remains stationary since the 1st natural frequency of the cylinder is higher than 5000 hz the cylinder can be regarded as a rigid propeller when the block and plate are removed the mass of the block and plate is one ninth of that of the cylinder and the effect of the mass change on the coupled system s vibro acoustic response is ignored by comparing the vibro acoustic responses of the experimental model with an elastic propeller or a rigid propeller the effect of propeller vibration was analyzed to reduce the difficulty and cost of the experiment the shaft cannot rotate the experimental model was excited by an impact hammer as shown in fig 19 and the sound pressure was collected by hydrophones fig 20 illustrates the influence of the vibration of the block plate cylinder system elastic propeller on the acoustic response of the experimental model by experimental and numerical methods the computed and tested resonance frequencies of the block plate cylinder are 252 hz and 253 hz respectively other tested and calculated resonant frequencies such as the resonant frequencies of the shaft and the 2nd hull axial resonance the relative errors are less than 10 due to the lower limit of the hydrophone s test band the experimental results are invalidated below 25 hz for the higher frequencies the amplitude difference mainly is caused by the manufacture tolerance of the experimental model for example the shaft misalignment overall the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results the resonant vibration of the elastic propeller amplifies the sound pressure radiated from the model around 252 hz validating the phenomenon that the propeller resonance increases the sound power of the coupled system in the numerical study 5 conclusion numerical and experimental study of the dynamic and acoustic responses of a propeller shaft hull coupled system under propeller force are presented the effects of the elasticity of the propeller on the vibro acoustic response of the coupled system are discussed in the case of axial force excitation the acoustic contribution from the propeller is very little at low frequencies but is significant at higher frequencies consequently the reduction of axial stiffness of the thrust bearing can not decrease the sound power from the coupled system in the higher frequency range according to the numerical and experimental results the influence of the propeller umbrella resonance should be considered the acoustic contribution from the propeller itself at the corresponding resonant frequency is not notable but the propeller umbrella resonance can amplify the dynamic force transmitted from the shaft to the hull increasing the sound radiation in the case of vertical force excitation the hull is also the major sound radiator compared to the propeller the transversal force applied at the stern bearing can cause great sound radiation and the main transmission of transverse force is through the stern bearing therefore the stern bearing is an important factor that affects the dynamic and acoustic responses of the coupled system due to the transversal propeller force acknowledgement the authors are grateful to the referees for their

23004,a methodology is presented to quantify the hydroelastic effects on the impact pressure and stress responses by combining the numerical method and the experimental method for the numerical method it combines the cfd and fem solvers to provide the uncoupled solutions where the hydrodynamic pressure was predicted by the vof method and the structural deflection was obtained by the fem analysis numerical results are verified by comparing the published results for the experimental method a series of drop tests of one segment of the hull structure was carried out to obtain fully coupled solutions experimental uncertainties were analyzed through the repeatable tests and symmetrical analysis in order to correct the experimental data we introduced the wavelet transform and excluded the experimental noise in the measured data hydroelastic effects are divided into two categories kinematic effects and inertial effects and they are quantified by defining the pressure and stress factors respectively finally the hydroelastic effects were discussed in terms of impact velocity and the mechanics causing these oscillations is analyzed through dry modal analysis keywords water entry cfd fem hull structure wavelet transform hydroelastic effects 1 introduction the impact between the marine structure and waves can cause severe slamming loads which damage the local structure although the impact force is not so large it also causes global transient vibration whipping the accurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship hulls and associated responses are crucial in the design of marine structures generally a quasi static method is applied to predict the structural response if the hydroelastic effects are not so important however it is not suitable for some cases where the structural elasticity is obvious such as ship bottom structure according to the research of faltinsen 2000 the larger of impact velocity and the higher of the structural natural period the more important is the hydroelasticity with the development of high speed craft in recent years slamming loads on the light composite structure and therewith related hydroelastic effects are quickly gaining attention in order to predict the structural deflection of an elastic structure impacting the water various phenomena including trapped air fluid structure interaction fluid compressibility non linear free surface should be modeled accurately the detailed definitions and descriptions of hydroelastic impacting problem were firstly introduced in faltinsen 1999 subsequently a variety of numerical models have been presented such as coupled wagner theory and beam theory hua et al 2000 korobkin et al 2006 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 shams and porfiri 2015 wang and soares 2018 coupled boundary element method and finite element method lu et al 2000 qin and batra 2009 coupled fluid dynamics code and finite element method arai and miyauchi 1998 hudson et al 2007 maki et al 2011 xie et al 2018a explicit arbitrary langrange euler and finite element method stenius et al 2007 luo et al 2012 sun and wang 2018 and so on although these methods above mentioned can describe the hydroelastic impact problem of simple flexible wedges most of them are not suitable for the complex structures like ship bottom where the air effect is important for example sun and wang 2018 studied the hydrodynamic problem of the water impact on the stiffened side of elastic stiffened plates through the explicit finite element method with a multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian solver the result shows the air can primarily increase the pressure duration and reduces its maximum value on the other hand most researchers concentrate on the elastic plate but have not much effort on the similar ship hull structure which includes multiple components such as panel longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames generally the simplified uncoupled method is adopted for this case to save cpu time such as faltinsen 1999 luo et al 2012 and yu et al 2018 for example luo et al 2012 studied the water entry problem of stiffened wedge structure through combining wagner theory and the finite element method the matched asymptotic method is extended to predict the free falling rigid impact problem and then the finite element simulation is carried out to analyze the structural response however there will have larger error on the stress response through the uncoupled solution if the structure tends to more flexible arai and miyauchi 1998 one exception is that xie et al 2018a presented a fully coupled cfd fem method to study the hydroelastic impact of ship hull structure in order to verify the numerical results the corresponding experiment was carried out although reasonable agreements between them are observed the cpu time is huge one key purpose of this paper is to put forward a simplified approach for the hydroelastic slamming which can be suitable for the arbitrary structure and have less computation efforts a feasible way is to decompose the hydroelastic response into two parts one is the composition regarding the structure as a rigid body and the other is the composition coming from the structural deformation this can be easily achieved through the uncoupled method such as luo et al 2012 and wang and soares 2018 one difference in this paper is that the uncoupled solution is corrected through the quantified pressure and stress factors so as to be suitable for more flexible bodies although numerical methods have made great progress on the hydroelastic impact problem there are still some difficulties to model complex fluid forms like ventilation air cavity and flow separation at present experimental method is still a powerful tool for understanding the essence of hydroelastic impact many hydroelastic impact experiments have been carried out including flexible panels aarsnes 1994 kvalsvold and faltinsen 1995 peseux et al 2005 battley et al 2009 panciroli et al 2012 stenius et al 2013 panciroli et al 2015 korkmaz and güzel 2017 and elastic ship hull structures luo et al 2012 hassoon et al 2017 sun and wang 2018 and xie et al 2018a however it still faces great challenges on the analysis of experimental data for example peseux et al 2005 proceeded experimental research on flexible bodies and the results were compared with the simulation however it s commented that how to explain the experimental result is difficult because the correlation between experiments and simulations is not obvious luo et al 2012 presented the experimental work on the elastic response of one free drop wedge with stiffened panels hydroelastic effects were discussed by analyzing the high frequency oscillations it is worth questioning that these effects may be not hydroelastic effects but only just dynamic effects as there seems to be no couple between the pressure distribution and structural deformation these phenomena suggest that it is quite difficult to verify the oscillations even though they are clearly identified in the measured signal in addition it is a great concern for the comparison between experimental and numerical results to further understand the hydroelastic effects unfortunately it is quite difficult to compare the numerical and experimental results directly due to a large amount of uncertainties portemont et al 2004 in fact many factors can cause the high frequency oscillations including structural vibration dynamic effect vibration of drop rig and air cavity which of them makes the principal contribution is not clear panciroli and porfiri 2015 generally the fft analysis combining the modal analysis is adopted to recognize the sources of oscillations however it is not effective if there are two similar natural periods in different structures for example the drop rig and test model can causes the oscillations in acceleration and their natural frequencies are same it is hard to confirm the sources of oscillations are the vibration of drop rig or test model because the time information is deleted in the fft analysis so another objective of present work is to cover this shortage by providing a data analysis technology wavelet transform what differs to the fast fourier transform is that this transform remains the time information which can overcome the difficulty of identifying the sources of oscillations when the natural frequencies of different structures are similar the rest of paper is organized as follows the experiments of one segment of elastic hull structure are introduced in section 2 in section 3 a methodology is put forward to quantize the hydroelastic effects for an elastic body impacting the water through combining the numerical and experimental methods the former provides the uncoupled solutions while the latter was corrected through using the wavelet transform in section 4 the hydroelastic effects are firstly confirmed in the wavelet analysis and then quantized through introducing the pressure and stress factors which is based on the uncoupled solutions and experimental ones finally the hydroelastic effects are discussed in terms of increasing impact velocity and the sources of these oscillations are verified through dry modal analysis section 5 draws some significant findings and outlooks the future works 2 experimental methods 2 1 experiment apparatus the experimental apparatus in the present work is designed by the yu 2016 shown in fig 1 it includes three parts a fixed frame used for supporting the experimental system a model shelf used for equipping the test model four vertical guide rails used for controlling the motion of the model shelf the details of other experimental equipment including the electric block ropes and a video camera can be found in our previous study of xie et al 2018a 2 2 test model one segment of hull structure with flat bottom was designed with the size of 1 5 m 0 9 m 0 3 m shown in fig 2 to study the impact problem the test model is made up of a stiffened panel at the bottom four side panels with a ribbed plate and a top panel the side panels and top panel thickness of 10 mm are much stronger than the bottom panel thickness of 4 mm to provide the rigid supports to the edges of bottom panels two endplates in the longitudinal direction are fitted to reduce the three dimensional effects luo et al 2012 the bottom stiffened panel is made up of 3 longitudinal stiffeners and 2 transverse frames in order to study the effect of flexible stiffeners on elastic responses the longitudinal stiffeners are continuous and across the transverse frame directly the sizes of inner structural members are listed in table 1 2 3 instrumentations the physical quantities including the whole acceleration impact pressure on the bottom panel and stress responses of longitudinal stiffeners are recorded in the experiment the accelerometer was placed on the center of the top panel and its range is 500 m s2 the location information of pressure cells and strain gauges is presented in fig 3 two symmetrical center lines c l 1 and c l 2 representing the symmetry of the model can be viewed the pressure cell was installed to the copper cap which is embedded in the bottom panel the diameter of copper cap is 20 mm and the range of pressure cell is 700 mpa the strain gages with the size of 5 mm 3 mm were placed on the top surface of longitudinal stiffeners 2 4 experimental conditions in the test program four different drop heights are chosen and their distances above the calm water level are h1 250 mm h2 400 mm h3 550 mm and h4 700 mm respectively two model weights representing different loading conditions for actual ship were used through adding ballast on the model shelf and they are l1 327 5 kg and l2 447 5 kg the combination of symbols l and h denotes the test condition of model weight and drop height e g the combination l3h1 means the model weight is 327 5 kg and the drop height is 250 mm in the subsequent analysis test condition is simplified to this combined form a series of free drop tests were carried out in a water basin of harbin engineering university by xie et al 2018a some more than 3 drop tests were repeated at least three times to minimize measured errors the experimental data were collected with a sampling frequency of 10 khz by a data acquisition system dh5902 fig 4 shows four stages of pictures for one free drop test in l1h1condition 3 methodology for hydroelastic characterization as reviewed in introduction direct comparison between experimental and numerical results faces great changes due to some experimental uncertainties in order to solve this dilemma a methodology is put forward to quantify experimental hydroelastic characterization this methodology is based on the comparison of uncoupled solution numerical results and fully coupled solution experimental results for the hydrodynamic pressure and structural response of elastic body impacting water the complete response can be decomposed into two parts the displacement and fluid force due to rigid body motion and the remainders from the flexure of the body maki et al 2011 any degree of freedom of the body x can be expressed using this decomposition as 1 x x r x f where the subscripts r and f denote rigid and flexure respectively similarly fluid force on the structure p can be decomposed into two parts one is caused by rigid body displacement and the other depends on flexural displacement 2 p x r x f p r x r p f x f this decomposition divides the hydroelastic effects on pressure and structural deformation into the parts x f and p f as for the parts x r and p r are the results from rigid body which can be obtained by an uncoupled method the pressure p r is firstly obtained through solving the water entry problem of rigid body by cfd solver and then the structural deformation x r is calculated by structural analysis in the fem solver it can be seen that the hydroelastic characterization x f and p f can be quantified by comparing the experimental results representing the complete parts x and p with the uncoupled solutions representing the parts x r and p r in addition the uncertainties including experimental noise and the oscillations of the model shelf can influence the agreement of numerical and experimental results so these factors must be removed before comparison it is worth noting that it is not reasonable to correct the experimental results by filter because the hydroelastic effects may be filtrated therefore we adopt an improved data analysis technology wavelet transform to solve this dilemma see section 3 3 in order to show the complete structure of methodology the technological process is shown in fig 5 there are two individual treatments so as to quantity the hydroelastic effects one is to correct the experimental results by identifying the hydroelastic effects and the other is to provide the uncoupled solution for the impact of elastic body 3 1 hydrodynamic impact the cfd computational fluid dynamic method is adopted to simulate the water entry problem through the commercial code fluent where the fluid was solved based on the vof method and the body motion is treated by a dynamic model numerical accuracy has been verified through comparing the published results in the studies of yang et al 2007 and xie et al 2018b we suppose the two fluids air and water are incompatible and inviscid the continuity and momentum can be simplified as 3 ρ t ρ u 0 4 t ρ u ρ u u p ρ g where u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density g is the gravitational acceleration in order to further consider the fluid compressibility we adopt the ideal gas law in the following form 5 ρ p 0 p m w r t where p 0 is the operating pressure atmospheric pressure p is the local static pressure relative to the operating pressure r is the universal gas constant and m w is the molecular weight the temperature t will be computed from the energy equation written as 6 t ρ e u ρ e p 0 where e is the energy the velocity and pressure fields can be obtained through solving the control equations based on the finite volume method if a 2 d flow is modeled the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1 m to satisfy the finite volume the discretization of time term adopts a first order implicit format the convective term is linearized through assuming one velocity at the current time step and the other velocity at the predicted time step primary discretization schemes are written as 7 u t d v d t u p r u p n v p 8 u u d v d t u n u r f s f δ t f f n u f r δ t where the superscripts n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown respectively the subscript f denotes the value on the grid surface v p is the grid volume δt is the time step s is the area f is the flux however it is quite difficult to solve the control equations directly because the free surface changes with time therefore a vof model is used to trace the interface of water and air according to the volume fraction in each grid the phase equation is established to obtain the volume fraction of air α through the continuous equation eq 3 9 t ρ α α ρ u 0 where α 0 represents the grid is filled with water whereas with air 0 α 1 means the grid is the mixture of water and air free surface whose shape is represented by the geometric reconstruction piecewise linear scheme described in youngs 1982 the scalars ρ and e should be updated because the fluid is treated as a variable density single flow in vof method and they are treated as mass averaged variables 10 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w 11 e α ρ a e a 1 α ρ w e w ρ where the ρ a and ρ w are the density of air and water e a and e w are the energy of air and water respectively in the numerical simulation the gradient terms use a green gauss node based method with a second order accuracy based on the description of rausch et al 1991 the phase equation is firstly solved and the free surface is tracked according to the work of youngs 1982 then the control equations are solved through the finite volume method a piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators scheme presented by issa 1986 is utilized to decouple the velocity and pressure fields in the next time step the acceleration was predicted by the newton s second law based on the impact force in the previous time step then the motion of the dynamic boundary body outline was predicted and the mesh was updated atomically based on the dynamic mesh updating technology 3 2 structural analysis the structural analysis is carried out in the fem finite element method solver which is widely used to complex structures in section 3 1 the pressure distribution on the body surface can be obtained considering the meshes of fluid and structural domain are independent an association should be set to transform the load by the interpolating treatment the treating process has three steps firstly the element center on the body surface fluid domain is mapped to the body surface in the solid domain secondly the spline interpolation for pressure is done thirdly the surface pressure is converted to nodal forces on the finite element model which can be achieved through the equivalent nodal force method the approach of maman and farhat 1995 describes the use of gaussian quadrature to integrate a fluid stress over a structural element and determine the nodal force 12 f i e ω n i p n d s where n is the normal to the structural element ω and n i is the shape function the approximation to the integral can be expressed as the sum of pressure components at the gauss points 13 f i e i 1 i m w i n i x i p x i n where w i is the weight of the gauss point x i and m is the total number of gauss points once the fluid force is transformed the structural responses can be calculated by integrating the equations of motions in the time domain in the structural domain the general equations of motion of a system can be written as 14 m x c x k x f 1 where m c and k are the structural mass damping and stiffness matrix f 1 is the force vector obtained from eq 13 the transient analysis is achieved in a commercial code ansys apdl 3 3 wavelet transform as discussed in introduction identifying the hydroelastic characterization of the measured signals faces great challenges the general way is to analyze the high frequency oscillations by frequency spectral analysis like fourier transform however it is quite difficult to confirm these oscillations coming from the hydroelastic effects or the experimental noise in some situations for example if the drop rig and test model have similar modal frequency which both contributes the oscillations in the acceleration it is hard to confirm the sources of oscillations are the vibration of drop rig experimental disturbance or test model hydroelastic effect through the frequency spectral it suggests that identifying the hydroelastic characterization that experimental signals include not only needs to analyze the frequency information but also understands the time information in order to further discuss the oscillation characters however the traditional fast fourier transform is not applicable because the frequency characteristic in local time quantum is deleted this paper provides a more effective data analysis technology wavelet transform to solve the dilemma through presenting the frequency components in frequency bands over specific time duration the detailed theory of wavelets which is beyond the scope of this work can be found in daubechies 1992 jorgensen and song 2007 and amin et al 2013 a brief mathematical description is recalled as follows the wavelet transform changes an original signal f t into a time frequency function wt s τ by applying an inner product for the analyzed signal f t and daughter waveletψ s τ 15 w t s τ f t ψ s τ d t where ψ s τ t is the conjugation of ψ s τ t the different daughter wavelets can be obtained from a mother wavelet ψ t by stretching and shifting the time axis with defined parameters their relationship can be written as 16 ψ s τ t 1 s ψ t τ s s τ r where s is the scale parameter and τ is the translation parameter the selection of mother wavelet will directly affect the meaningful results for the purpose of this work is to analyze the characteristic of slamming signal the mother wavelet can be chosen as morlet function according to the recent studies of yang and tse 2005 and amin et al 2013 the signal analysis is carried out in the matlab wavelet toolbox misiti et al 2002 and the morlet function is expressed as 17 ψ t 1 π f b e i 2 π f c t e t 2 f b where f b is the bandwidth parameter and f c is the central frequency of wavelet fig 6 shows the mother function in time and frequency domains with parameters f b 2 and f c 1 it can be seen that the bandwidth frequency f b represents the time range and the central frequency f c determines the basic frequency of mother function which means the bandwidth frequency directly influences the shape of mother function and hence its role is to detect frequency change in a time quantum smaller bandwidth will increase the time resolution and reduce the frequency resolution and vice versa amin et al 2013 as for slamming signal f b can be selected as 1 hz the selection of wavelet central frequency f c should be determined according to the specific situation for example when the analysis purpose is to define temporal occurrence of signal the lower frequency of f c less than 1 hz can be chosen otherwise if the purpose is to perform a frequency analysis the higher frequency f c more than 1 hz can be selected once the parameters of motion function are provided the wavelet transform can be presented graphically through a two dimensional nephogram whose value denotes the wavelet coefficient as a function of two parameters the translation parameter time and scale parameter frequency see eq 15 it shows that different wavelet transform coefficients can be presented by selecting multiple scale and translation parameters based on the different purposes in addition actual time t and frequencies f r in the signal can be obtained through the following two equations 18 t t τ 19 f r n 0 f c s where t is the time obtained through wavelet transform and n 0 is the sampling frequency 4 presentation and discussion of results 4 1 experimental and numerical verifications the experimental and numerical results should be verified before the quantitative analysis the experimental verification is carried out by the repeatable tests and symmetrical analysis the numerical ones are verified by comparing the previously published results 4 1 1 experimental verification some drop tests were repeated as three times so as to analyze the experimental uncertainties fig 7 shows the pressure time history at p1 and the stress response at s2 in the three same drop test conditions l1h2 the results have altitudinal consistency in the initial impact stage t 0 12s while the error reaches up to 3 in the subsequent vibrating stage t 0 12s the ventilation occurs at t 0 193s because the measured pressure is negative so the air cavity is the main reason causing the pressure uncertainty as for the structural deflection as shown in fig 7 b the situation is similar to the pressure case the difference becomes obvious 4 after t 0 12s the pressure uncertainty directly leads to the stress uncertainty although the pitch or roll motion is limited in our experiment the effectiveness should be clarified therefore we discuss the experimental symmetry fig 8 a illustrates the comparative pressure results at three symmetrical measured locations p1 p3 and p6 the p1 and p6 show the good agreement while there is larger error about 5 between p1 the p3 it reflects the tiny pitch motion exists x direction and the roll motion is not obvious y direction in fact it is hard to ensure the levelness of model shelf is zero especially for large scale model as for stress presented in fig 8 b the difference 3 also appears at s3 and s7 x direction but is not so important compared to the pressure case although there are some errors in the experiment air cavity and initial levelness make the primary contributions on the other hand the larger differences appear at the subsequent vibrating stage t 0 12s while the uncertainties at the peak values are almost same generally the measured pressure and stress results are reasonable because the error can be limited to 5 4 1 2 numerical verification the numerical verification of the cfd fem code is presented in this part the water entry problem of an elastic wedge with the deadrise β 300 and the constant velocities v 6 15 m s is studied here the length of this wedge is l 0 4 m three mesh sizes for the wedge are chosen with the values of 5 mm 2 5 mm and 1 25 mm denoted as mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 firstly the convergence study of rigid body for the cfd solver is carried out the predicted pressure distribution of the rigid wedge is presented in fig 9 a with the published results where the results of lu et al 2000 and the present study are based on the rigid body while one of wang and guedes soares 2013 is the results of an elastic body with the panel thickness 5 mm the non dimensional coefficients cp and cl are defined as 20 cp p 0 5 ρ w v 2 21 cl c c 0 where the p is pressure ρ w is the water density v is the impact velocity c is the wetted half length defined as 0 5v t c 0 is the half length of wedge defined as 0 5l sin β the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are quite close which means the numerical result is convergence if the mesh is enough small but they are 7 7 larger than the ones of lu et al 2000 for the model of mesh 1 the result is close to the ones of lu with an error 1 5 the main reason is that the mesh size is 4 mm in lu s method in fact the model of mesh1 cannot capture the peak values well in addition the result of wang and guedes soares 2013 is 6 larger than the mesh 2 it means the elastic effect can influence the hydrodynamic impact pressure for the total impact force fig 9 b the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost same and 10 larger than the experimental data from zhao et al 1996 the error source mainly comes from the three dimensional effect the results of mesh 1 is 12 smaller than the experimental ones due to the peak value is not captured the result of an elastic body is 19 larger than the experimental data which means elastic effect can greatly affect the total impact force according to the discussion the models of mesh 2 and mesh 3 can predict the slamming loads well for the rigid body but have about 15 difference for the elastic body impact then the effect of mesh size on the structural response is studied in the fem solver the wedge is made up of steel with the elasticity modulus 2e11pa two thicker plates are considered with the values of 5 mm and 8 mm the mesh sizes in the fluid domain are same to the structural domain fig 10 shows the comparative result of the structural deflection of the elastic wedge where the lu et al 2000 uses a coupled bem fem method wang and guedes soares 2013 is the coupled ale method and the present study is the uncoupled method we can see the trend of the deflection is in good agreement between the mesh2 and lu et al 2000 before flow separation the calculation is stopped in lu et al 2000 when the flow separation happens the water submerges the body completely as we know the impact force will drop fast after flow separation and thus the deflection decreases such the consequence accords with the present results in addition obvious oscillations are observed in the lu et al 2000 while our results are none the oscillations mainly come from the structural elastic effects the main reason is a full coupled solution is adopted in the lu et al 2000 and the present study uses an uncoupled method ignoring the elasticity the results of mesh 2 is 15 smaller than the one of wang and guedes soares 2013 due to the higher impact pressure showed in fig 9 a generally models of mesh 2 and mesh3 have the reasonable results for the structural response considering the larger computation efforts the mesh2 is used to the following simulation 4 2 experimental data analysis before quantifying the hydroelastic characterization we should identify the high frequency oscillations of the measured data whether or not are resulted from the hydroelastic effects fig 11 a shows a typical acceleration signal in l1h2 condition it can be seen that there are some high frequency oscillations fig 11 b presents the frequency distribution using fft analysis there are four main frequencies 19 5 hz 43 9 hz 61 0 hz and 109 9 hz considering the accelerometer is placed on the top surface of the test model the vibrations of the top structure defined as m1 and the model shelf defined as m2 can be captured by accelerometer in addition the added mass and damping of water is not important because the model shelf and the top structure of the test model are always dry during the impact therefore the dry modal analysis is applied to discuss the sources of oscillations some constraint conditions should be applied due to the structural contacts where the top and bottom surfaces of m2 are fixed while the m1 is fixed in the ends the first six order modal frequencies are listed in table 2 we can see frequencies 107 5 hz in m2 and 115 9 hz in m1 are close to the frequency in the acceleration 109 9 hz which means these modal frequencies contribute to the oscillation of acceleration however we cannot clarify which of them plays a major role due to the similar frequencies in m1 and m2 through the frequency spectrum in order to further clarify the sources of oscillations the wavelet transform analysis for this signal is performed the parameters of motion function are f b 2 and f c 5 2π the scale parameter s ranges from 40 to 1024 with an interval of 0 5 and the translation parameter τ is 0 the wavelet coefficients is shown in fig 12 where the actual time and frequency are adopted to replace the time and frequency scales there are four principal frequency compositions with the values of 21 6 hz 43 9 hz 62 6 hz and 110 5 hz which are consistent with the frequency distribution obtained by fourier transformer see fig 11 b the difference is the former includes the time information while the latter does not the time history of wavelet coefficient for specific frequency reflects the importance of this frequency in the oscillation we define a relative importance of each frequency as 22 r a fre a pri where a fre and a pri represent the amplitudes of the evaluative frequency and the primary frequency the first frequency respectively we still take the high frequency composition 109 9 hz as an example in fig 11 b the r of the frequency 109 9 hz is 0 12 which means the importance is 12 in fig 12 b there is a periodic oscillation with the frequency 110 5 hz caused by the vibrations of m1 and m2 the model shelf starts to vibrate once it is released in the drop test while the test model begins to vibrate when it touches the water which suggests the time information of these two kinds of vibrations is different such a consequence makes it possible to separate the vibrations even though their frequencies are very approximate we can suppose the oscillation is only from m1 before 0 05s free drop stage and the r of the frequency is 0 017 after the body touching the water the oscillation comes from the common effect of m1 and m2 and the r is 0 12 t 0 11s according with the value in fft analysis therefore we can clarify this frequency composition is resulted by the vibrations of the model shelf accounting for 16 7 and the top structure of the test model accounting for 83 3 which is not clear in the fft analysis as for the sources of other high frequency oscillations such as 43 4 hz and 62 4 hz we can discuss them through the above analysis way and they are confirmed to be from the vibration of bottom of the test model some uncertainties of the measured data such as experimental noise and vibration of the model shelf should be excluded in order to provide a more reasonable data set for numerical verification the complete signal can be decomposed into the sum of each frequency composition using wavelet packet in the present work we use the wavelet toolbox in matlab to realize the decomposition we still take the acceleration as an example fig 13 shows the decomposition of the measured acceleration where s is the original signal and a7 d1 to d7 are the sub components it can be seen that the a7 is the major frequency composition while d1 to d7 are the time history of different high frequency compositions the compositions a7 d7 d6 and d5 are the most primary with the sample numbers in a time period are 487 191 105 and 55 respectively considering the sample frequency is 10 khz in our experiment so the frequencies of these four compositions can be estimated by the sample frequency dividing the sample number in a time period and they are 20 5 hz 52 3 hz 95 2 hz and 181 8 hz respectively it means these four compositions belong to the frequency range 0 21 hz 21 52 3 hz 53 3 95 2 hz and 95 2 181 8 hz it is noteworthy that the compositions d7 comes from the vibration of test model hydroelastic effects because it starts to appear at the beginning of impact t 0 1s while the d5 should owe to the vibration of model shelf because it starts from the release t 0s and vibrates with the same amplitude the composition d6 is complex which comes from two sources model shelf t 0 1s and the test model t 0 1s and the importance of them has been discussed above considering the d5 is very the small compared to the ones in d7 and d6 so the high frequency oscillations in acceleration is mainly attributed to the vibration of the test model so called hydroelastic effects in addition the time history of each frequency composition is shown clearly which means we can correct the original measured data through excluding the experimental uncertainties the correction can be carried out based on the following formula 23 s cor s ori s vir where the s cor is the corrected result s ori is the original result svir is the experimental uncertainties mainly including noise and the vibrations of model shelf for the acceleration decomposition the experimental uncertainties include the partial composition of d4 and the total compositions d5 d4 d3 d2 and d1 the formula applied to the acceleration can be further written as 24 s cor a 7 d7 d 6 r where r is the importance of hydroelastic in the composition d6 which can be obtained according to the eq 22 the experimental results pressure and stress response provided in the following part are corrected through this dealing way on the other hand the amplitude of d7 is not always same but firstly increases and then decreases such an appearance suggests that the characterization of hydroelastic effects may derive from the different structural parts which will be discussed in section 4 5 4 3 quantization of impact pressure the water entry of test model is simulated in a commercial code fluent where a rigid body model is adopted the fluid domain shown in fig 14 a has a size of 20 m 20 m 15 m with the initial water depth of 10 m according to the study of facci et al 2016 the four sides and bottom of the fluid domain are set to free slip boundaries and the top is the pressure outlet the body motion is treated as the rigid motion and dynamic mesh model is used to improve the grid quality the computational domain is discretized through the mesh pre processor icem cfd and hexa dominant unstructured mesh type is adopted see fig 14 b maximum cell dimension is 0 34 m and the minimum one is 0 03 m with the total number of mesh is 3 1e6 in the simulation the initial velocity is obtained from the experimental data when the body is 0 1 m above the clam water surface and then it falls freely the initial velocities in different test conditions are listed in table 3 in order to further clarify the numerical procedure the friction f e should be considered given as 25 f e m g g e where m is the model mass g is the gravity acceleration with the value of 9 8 g e is the experimental acceleration in the free drop stage with the value of 9 2 the friction is evaluated as 196 5n the total time is 0 15s with a time interval 0 0001s the cpu time is about 2 h in a pc with intel core i5 4750 3 2 ghz processor and 8 gigabytes of memory for the drop test the symmetry can be guaranteed according to the discussion in section 4 1 2 therefore we only present the results at asymmetrical locations i e p1 p2 and p4 fig 15 shows the comparative pressure time history in the experiment solid line and numerical simulation dotted line in l1 condition considering the impact happens simultaneously the time axis of p2 keeps invariant while the ones of p1 and p4 move forward and backward 0 02s respectively the pressure peaks in the l1h1 condition fig 15 a are 15 larger than the experimental data and the difference enlargers to 40 in the l1h4 condition there are obvious oscillations in the experimental results while there is none in the numerical method in fact the oscillations are resulted from the structural vibration and have been verified from the hydroelastic effects see section 4 2 however hydroelastic effects are not included in our simulation due to the assumption of rigid body the comparative analysis shows hydroelastic effect can decrease the slamming pressure and the influence is more obvious with the impact velocity which is similar to the description in stenius et al 2013 that the hydroelastic effects increase with the impact velocity on the other hand the differences between numerical and experimental results at p1 and p2 are more obvious than the ones shown in p4 which reflects the hydroelastic effect on the hydrodynamic pressure is relative to the space location similarly fig 16 shows the situation of l2 condition rigid results are 25 larger than the elastic results but the oscillations is a little smaller than that in l1condition it reflects the structural mass can also influence the hydroelastic effects a pressure factorγrepresenting the error of numerical and experimental results on pressure is defined in order to quantify hydroelastic effects as 26 γ p m r p m e p m r where p m r and p m e are the pressure peaks in the numerical and experimental results respectively fig 17 illustrates the values of γin the different test conditions this factor increases about 150 from the drop height of 0 25 m 0 7 m which means the impact velocity greatly affect the hydroelastic effect in addition theγ has different values at different locations with the law of p2 p1 p4 the model mass also influences this factor with a 5 increment from l1 condition fig 17 a to l2 condition fig 17 b these characteristics above discussing reflect the γ depends on three main variables impact velocity space location and model mass hence a curve fitting is applied for the expression of this factor in order to correct numerical results in terms of impact pressure in order to better describe this relationship these three variables adopt the dimensionless parameters written as 27 v v ρ w l 3 e i 28 d d d 0 29 m m ρ w l 3 where v d and m are the dimensionless variables of impact velocity location parameter and model mass l is the space of longitudinal stiffeners e is the flexural rigidity i is the second moment of the longitudinal stiffener d is the distance from target location to the center point the intersection point of c l 1 and c l 2 see fig 3 d 0 is the half length of diagonal m is the model mass l is the wetted length which denotes the length of model in this paper the quantized pressure factor can be treated as a function of these variables 30 γ f v d m suppose the variables are mutual independence eq 29 can be expressed as the product of these functions of each variable 31 γ k v v k d d k m m where k v v k d d and k m m are the functions of the dimensionless impact velocity v distance d and model mass m respectively the study on the distribution of slamming pressure on flat bottom structure in chen and xiao 2005 shows that the center position of the slamming surface gets the biggest pressure while the edge gets small which is similar to the result of the present work the regression function of the pressure distribution given in his study is adopted here as 32 k d 1 0 0 14 d 1 04 d 2 0 64 d 3 the k d trends to 1 if the d is close to 0 whereas the k d is smaller than 1 which meets the pressure is biggest in the center position the k d represents the pressure ratio in the target location and the center point chen and xiao 2006 studies the effect of structural mass on the pressure peak founding that there is a linear relation between 1 k m and 1 m in this paper this linear relation is adopted and the formula is given as 33 k m m m 4 195 the k m is closed to 1 when m trends to which means the effect of mass is neglectful it can be seen that the k m increases with the m which accords with the fact shown in fig 17 once the measured location and model mass is specified the γ is only the relative to k v the regression analysis of γ and k v is carried out through using a cubic polynomial where includes three measured locations p1 p2 and p4 and two models mass l1 and l2 mean multinomial coefficients are treated as the final coefficients of the fitted curve as 34 k v 2 15 6 99 v 1 77 v 2 substitute eq 31 33 into eq 30 the expression of γ can be obtained for specified test condition these three variables are known so the γ can be further obtained in order to verify the capacity of this quantized pressure factor fig 18 shows the comparative results of γ between the regression analysis and original data from the experiment reasonable agreement with them can be observed in view of the fundamental purpose in this paper is to calibrate the impact pressure from the simple uncoupled solution so as to accord with the experimental results coupled solution the quantized pressure factor based on the pressure peak is applied to correct the numerical results because the pressure peak is the most important concern in the structural design the pressure time history can be corrected through the following equation 35 p c o r t 1 γ p r i g t where p r i g t is the pressure time history from uncoupled solution p c o r t is the corrected pressure time history examples of the comparison of corrected pressure and experimental data are presented in fig 19 good agreement between them can be found when we ignore the subsequent vibration 4 4 quantization of elastic response the ship hull structure is modeled to analyze the structural responses in ansys where only the bottom stiffened panel is used to save cpu time the shell63 element which is the elastic element type with four nodes is chosen considering the local stiffening of the structure introduced by the pressure sensors the fem model should be considered this influence in the experiment the copper cap was embedded into the bottom panel so as to place the pressure sensors through the screw thread the diameter is about 20 mm the other structures of the test model are made up of aluminum the whole finite element model is shown in fig 20 a and the total number of elements is about 2 1e4 there are nine local strengthen locations and their locations accord with the arrangement of pressure sensors shown in fig 3 and the local grid treatment is showed in fig 20 b the model is supported by the neglectful structures including four side panels and top panel hence fixed boundary conditions on the connections of these structures are applied the dynamic structural response is solved using full solution method with the total time 0 15s and 100 load steps obtained by the corrected pressure in section 4 3 where the hydroelastic effects on the pressure are included through the pressure factor the cpu time is about 1 h in the same pc configuration introduced in section 4 3 similar to the impact pressure we also present the stress response at asymmetrical locations like s1 s2 s4 and s5 fig 21 and fig 22 show the comparison of stress responses between experiments and numerical results for the four drop heights and two model weights the results show there are larger differences at different space locations with a general law of s5 s4 s2 s1 considering the distance between the measured position and the center point see fig 3 has the same law showed in stress response the law can be re summarized that the stress gradually decreases from the center to the border two main reasons may cause such a consequence one is the same law of pressure appeared at the different measured locations and the other is the fixed boundary conditions are applied to the ends of the stiffened panel as shown in fig 19 the pressure at different locations is almost same which means the pressure difference is not so important on the other hand if the uniform pressure is forced to the panel with fixed boundaries applying to the ends structural deflection will decrease from the center to the border therefore the reason causing the difference of stress response in different space locations should owe to the fixed supports on the ends of the stiffened panel the obvious evidence is that the stress responses of s2 and s4 are almost consistent because the distance between s4 position and the center point is same to the s2 position for the numerical results there are some oscillations but they differ to the appearance of the experimental data for example the oscillations in the numerical results are very sharp while it is smoothed in the experiment in fact the former is caused by the structural dynamic effects while the latter is from the oscillations of impact pressure due to hydroelastic effects as shown in figs 21 and 22 the stress responses obtained by the numerical method still have some errors comparing to the experimental data even though the pressure has been calibrated in section 4 3 in order to further analyze the sources of error a quantized stress factor ε is defined as 36 ε s m r s m e s m e where s m e and s m r are the stress peak from experiment and simulation separately the values of ε in the different drop heights and mass model are presented in fig 23 the ε increases about 80 from drop height 0 25 m 0 7 m and the increment is more obvious in the larger drop height generally the stress response is proportional to pressure related to the square of impact velocity the nonlinear trend of ε and drop height suggests there are some other factors to affect the structural response considering the structural deflection happens from the dry condition to wet condition because the water submerges the body gradually so the natural period of the structure is the main reason causing the nonlinear structural response in fact the added mass and damping can greatly affect the natural period of the structure so called rate that structure can response as for the numerical results they are 5 15 larger than the experiments referencing the structural analysis presented in section 3 2 the added mass and damping matrix is not included which is the reason causing the error between the numerical and experimental results as the distribution of stenius et al 2011 the hydroelastic effects can be divided into two different categories kinematic effects and inertial effects the former is the deformation of the structure in response to the hydrodynamic loading affecting the pressure distribution which affects the impact pressure i e quantized pressure factor in our discussion in section 4 3 the latter is the relationship between the loading rate and the rate at which the structure can respond affecting the structural response i e quantized stress factor similar to the quantization of impact pressure the quantized stress factor ε is given to discuss the hydroelastic inertial effects referring the fig 23 the ε is close to zero when the impact velocity is small while it greatly increases with the impact velocity such an appearance shows the ε mainly depends on the impact velocity further considering the nonlinear relationship of ε and impact velocity a second order polynomial is adopted to fit the expression in addition the ε has no better applicability compared to the quantized pressure factor γ due to flexible boundary conditions hence individual regression analysis in each measured point is carried out and the regression function is listed in table 4 fig 24 shows the comparison of corrected and original stress factors where good agreement is achieved 4 5 discussion of hydroelastic effects although the experimental hydroelastic effects on the impact pressure and stress response are quantized through the pressure and stress factors in section 4 3 and section 4 4 it is still not clear the mechanics of structural vibrations on the high frequency oscillations e g which of vibration frequency plays a major role and which of structural components results this frequency in order to further make them clear the importance of each high frequency is firstly discussed through wavelet transform then the hydroelastic effects are discussed with the various impact velocities finally the dry modal analysis of different structures is carried out to analyze the sources of oscillations firstly the frequencies appeared in the measured pressure are recognized through the wavelet analysis fig 25 a shows the time frequency characters of the pressure in l1h1condition four main frequencies 20 hz 50 hz 78 hz and 113 hz can be observed the wavelet coefficients in the first frequency denote the pressure time history during the impact which likes the results of a rigid body the other three compositions represent the high frequency oscillations which are close to the frequencies showed in the acceleration see fig 12 further referring the discussion in section 4 2 these frequencies cannot come from the vibrations of model shelf m1 and the top structure of test model m2 because they cannot transfer to the pressure signal which means these high frequencies are caused by the vibrations of bottom structure in addition the frequency 50 hz plays the primary role due to the larger wavelet coefficient for the case of higher impact velocity shown in fig 25 b on the one hand the frequencies are a little bigger than the ones showed in fig 25 a in fact the air is caught during the impact which leads to the structure vibrate in the mixture of air and water more air is trapped due to the higher impact velocity causing the higher natural frequency on the other hand the maximum value in the frequency 50 hz increases e g the value is 464 in l1h4 condition which is 87 larger than that in the l1h1 condition similarly fig 26 b presents the frequency distribution of stress response in l1h1 condition the main frequencies are almost same to those showed in the pressure signal such a situation suggests that the main sources of these oscillations are not the dynamic effects but the vibrations of the structures otherwise the frequencies cannot completely accord with the results of pressure because the dynamic effect does not influence the pressure in addition the frequency 54 hz makes a major contribution to the oscillations next we discuss the hydroelastic characters in terms of increasing velocity drop height it is cannot confirm the relative importance of hydroelasticity through the wavelet coefficient z value showed in the figs 25 and 26 because the impact velocity can influence the value even if the hydroelastic importance is same in order to exclude the influence of velocity on the wavelet coefficient a relative factor δ is defined as 37 δ c h i g h c l o w where c h i g h and c l o w are the maximum of wavelet coefficients in high and primary frequencies respectively fig 27 shows the values of δ in different drop heights the δ for the frequency 47 hz is much larger than the other high frequencies which reflects this natural frequency plays a major role in the hydroelastic effects for the case of impact pressure fig 27 a it can be observed that the δ increases from 0 55 to 0 82 when the drop height changes from 250 mm h1 to 700 mm h4 which means the hydroelasticity is more important when the impact velocity is larger for the case of stress response fig 27 b the δ almost keeps invariable about 0 7 from h1 to h4 which suggests the hydroelastic effects on the stress response are not so important with the increasing velocity referencing the discussion in section 4 3 and section 4 4 the hydroelectric effects are divided into two categories kinematic effects and inertial effects the former affects the pressure relative to the impact velocity while the latter influences the structural response which is not relevant to the velocity but depended on the natural period of the structure in order to analyze the mechanics causing high frequency oscillations in the structural response a dry modal analysis was carried out in commercial code ansys workbench the different structural components may cause the hydroelastic effects in the discussion of section 4 2 so three structures related to the measured area longitudinal stiffeners are modeled to discuss the mechanics of oscillations one is the stiffened panel with transverse frames model 1 the second is the stiffened panel model 2 and the third one is the longitudinal stiffeners model 3 fixed supports are applied based on the contact relationship e g the ends of model 3 are fixed according to the contact between longitudinal stiffener and four side panels the typical modal shapes of these three models are shown in fig 28 fig 29 and fig 30 the first six order modal frequencies of these three models are shown in fig 31 where two auxiliary lines dotted line are plotted with the frequencies 54 hz and 82 hz representing the main frequency in the stress signal it can be seen that the first order frequencies of model 3 and model 2 agree with the frequency 50 hz and the second order frequency of model 2 is close to 84 hz it implies model 2 and model 3 may affect the stress responses in addition model 1has no obvious influence on the stress due to the larger frequency difference in the elastic response and modal analysis it is worth noting that the frequencies 54 hz and 82 hz are wet frequencies which are smaller than the dry modal frequencies showed in fig 31 the second order frequency of model 3 is a little bigger than 82 hz so this mode frequency may also influence the stress responses 5 conclusions a methodology for quantifying the hydroelastic characterization is put forward based on the simplified numerical method uncoupled solutions and the experimental method fully coupled solutions for the former a cfd solver was adopted to predict the impact pressure and the structural response was obtained by a fem solver the convergence study shows the mesh size greatly influences the hydrodynamic pressure and structural deflection when the mesh size is less than 2 5 mm the numerical accuracy can be guaranteed for the experimental method one segment of hull structure was designed to study the dynamic response of elastic structure impacting calm water this hull structure was made up of a bottom panel with 3 longitudinal stiffeners and 2 transverse frames four side panels with ribbed plate and a top panel an effective drop test system was applied to carry out a series of free drop tests with four drop heights h1 250 mm h2 400 mm h3 550 mm and h4 700 mm and two model weights l1 327 5 kg and l2 447 5 kg the time histories of pressure on the bottom panel and stress on the longitudinal stiffeners were recorded experimental stability is verified through repeatable drop tests and symmetrical analysis and its uncertainties can be limited to 5 the data analysis technology wavelet transform is firstly applied to recognize the oscillations in the measured signal which remains the time information compared to the fourier transform the wavelet analysis of the acceleration is carried out to identify the high frequency oscillations showing there are four main oscillation components with frequencies 19 5 hz 43 9 hz 61 0 hz and 109 9 hz in order to present the time character in each frequency composition the whole signal is decomposed into four different frequency ranges 0 21 hz 21 52 3 hz 53 3 95 2 hz and 95 2 181 8 hz through the wavelet packet the results show the frequency 109 9 hz is caused by the vibrations of the model shelf accounting for 16 7 and top panel of test model accounting for 83 3 while the frequencies 43 9 hz and 61 0 hz are from the vibrations of bottom structures experimental hydroelastic effects have been divided into two different categories kinematic effects influencing the pressure and inertial effects affecting the structural deflection according to the study of stenius et al 2011 the kinematic effects on the pressure were firstly discussed through comparing the uncoupled solutions numerical results and fully coupled solutions experimental data the predicted pressure is about 15 25 larger than the measured data due to the hydroelastic effects related to three factors model mass space location and impact velocity in order to further clarify the hydroelastic effects and calibrate predicted pressure a pressure factor is defined as a function of these three factors and the expression is obtained through the regression analysis good agreements are achieved between the calibrated pressure and experimental ones then the inertial effects on the stress response were discussed the predicted stress responses are obtained through the corrected pressure so as to exclude the kinematic effects of hydroelasticity and they are 5 10 larger than experimental data the quantized stress factor was also defined and expressed through a second order polynomial summarily the hydroelastic effects caused by the added mass and added damping not only reduces hydrodynamic impact pressure about 25 but also alleviates the structural deflection about 10 more details of experiment hydroelastic characterization are discussed through using wavelet analysis the results show the frequency component 50 hz plays a major role on the hydroelastic effects the importance of hydroelasticity δ was defined through the ratio of wavelet coefficient showing the δ increases from 0 59 to 0 81 for impact pressure while it rises from 0 7 for stress response when the drop height changes from h1 to h4 which suggests the hydroelastic effects on the pressure are more significant while the effects on the stress response are almost invariable with impact velocity in order to study the mechanics that causes the high frequency oscillations of the stress responses the dry modal analysis of three structures related to the measured location stiffened panel with transverse frames model 1 stiffened panel model 2 and longitudinal stiffeners model 3 are carried out it suggests that the first order modal frequencies of model 3 and the first order model frequency of model 2 are the major contributors to these oscillations summarily we firstly applied the data analysis technology wavelets transform to discuss the high oscillations in the hydroelastic impact signal and achieve satisfactory results further research is motivated by extending its application such as the analysis of global ship hull vibrations in addition the simplified approach of elastic body impact is suitable to complex geometrical shapes and has less computational efforts so further works should focus on the application in the design of

23004,a methodology is presented to quantify the hydroelastic effects on the impact pressure and stress responses by combining the numerical method and the experimental method for the numerical method it combines the cfd and fem solvers to provide the uncoupled solutions where the hydrodynamic pressure was predicted by the vof method and the structural deflection was obtained by the fem analysis numerical results are verified by comparing the published results for the experimental method a series of drop tests of one segment of the hull structure was carried out to obtain fully coupled solutions experimental uncertainties were analyzed through the repeatable tests and symmetrical analysis in order to correct the experimental data we introduced the wavelet transform and excluded the experimental noise in the measured data hydroelastic effects are divided into two categories kinematic effects and inertial effects and they are quantified by defining the pressure and stress factors respectively finally the hydroelastic effects were discussed in terms of impact velocity and the mechanics causing these oscillations is analyzed through dry modal analysis keywords water entry cfd fem hull structure wavelet transform hydroelastic effects 1 introduction the impact between the marine structure and waves can cause severe slamming loads which damage the local structure although the impact force is not so large it also causes global transient vibration whipping the accurate prediction of hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship hulls and associated responses are crucial in the design of marine structures generally a quasi static method is applied to predict the structural response if the hydroelastic effects are not so important however it is not suitable for some cases where the structural elasticity is obvious such as ship bottom structure according to the research of faltinsen 2000 the larger of impact velocity and the higher of the structural natural period the more important is the hydroelasticity with the development of high speed craft in recent years slamming loads on the light composite structure and therewith related hydroelastic effects are quickly gaining attention in order to predict the structural deflection of an elastic structure impacting the water various phenomena including trapped air fluid structure interaction fluid compressibility non linear free surface should be modeled accurately the detailed definitions and descriptions of hydroelastic impacting problem were firstly introduced in faltinsen 1999 subsequently a variety of numerical models have been presented such as coupled wagner theory and beam theory hua et al 2000 korobkin et al 2006 khabakhpasheva and korobkin 2013 shams and porfiri 2015 wang and soares 2018 coupled boundary element method and finite element method lu et al 2000 qin and batra 2009 coupled fluid dynamics code and finite element method arai and miyauchi 1998 hudson et al 2007 maki et al 2011 xie et al 2018a explicit arbitrary langrange euler and finite element method stenius et al 2007 luo et al 2012 sun and wang 2018 and so on although these methods above mentioned can describe the hydroelastic impact problem of simple flexible wedges most of them are not suitable for the complex structures like ship bottom where the air effect is important for example sun and wang 2018 studied the hydrodynamic problem of the water impact on the stiffened side of elastic stiffened plates through the explicit finite element method with a multi material arbitrary lagrangian eulerian solver the result shows the air can primarily increase the pressure duration and reduces its maximum value on the other hand most researchers concentrate on the elastic plate but have not much effort on the similar ship hull structure which includes multiple components such as panel longitudinal stiffeners and transverse frames generally the simplified uncoupled method is adopted for this case to save cpu time such as faltinsen 1999 luo et al 2012 and yu et al 2018 for example luo et al 2012 studied the water entry problem of stiffened wedge structure through combining wagner theory and the finite element method the matched asymptotic method is extended to predict the free falling rigid impact problem and then the finite element simulation is carried out to analyze the structural response however there will have larger error on the stress response through the uncoupled solution if the structure tends to more flexible arai and miyauchi 1998 one exception is that xie et al 2018a presented a fully coupled cfd fem method to study the hydroelastic impact of ship hull structure in order to verify the numerical results the corresponding experiment was carried out although reasonable agreements between them are observed the cpu time is huge one key purpose of this paper is to put forward a simplified approach for the hydroelastic slamming which can be suitable for the arbitrary structure and have less computation efforts a feasible way is to decompose the hydroelastic response into two parts one is the composition regarding the structure as a rigid body and the other is the composition coming from the structural deformation this can be easily achieved through the uncoupled method such as luo et al 2012 and wang and soares 2018 one difference in this paper is that the uncoupled solution is corrected through the quantified pressure and stress factors so as to be suitable for more flexible bodies although numerical methods have made great progress on the hydroelastic impact problem there are still some difficulties to model complex fluid forms like ventilation air cavity and flow separation at present experimental method is still a powerful tool for understanding the essence of hydroelastic impact many hydroelastic impact experiments have been carried out including flexible panels aarsnes 1994 kvalsvold and faltinsen 1995 peseux et al 2005 battley et al 2009 panciroli et al 2012 stenius et al 2013 panciroli et al 2015 korkmaz and güzel 2017 and elastic ship hull structures luo et al 2012 hassoon et al 2017 sun and wang 2018 and xie et al 2018a however it still faces great challenges on the analysis of experimental data for example peseux et al 2005 proceeded experimental research on flexible bodies and the results were compared with the simulation however it s commented that how to explain the experimental result is difficult because the correlation between experiments and simulations is not obvious luo et al 2012 presented the experimental work on the elastic response of one free drop wedge with stiffened panels hydroelastic effects were discussed by analyzing the high frequency oscillations it is worth questioning that these effects may be not hydroelastic effects but only just dynamic effects as there seems to be no couple between the pressure distribution and structural deformation these phenomena suggest that it is quite difficult to verify the oscillations even though they are clearly identified in the measured signal in addition it is a great concern for the comparison between experimental and numerical results to further understand the hydroelastic effects unfortunately it is quite difficult to compare the numerical and experimental results directly due to a large amount of uncertainties portemont et al 2004 in fact many factors can cause the high frequency oscillations including structural vibration dynamic effect vibration of drop rig and air cavity which of them makes the principal contribution is not clear panciroli and porfiri 2015 generally the fft analysis combining the modal analysis is adopted to recognize the sources of oscillations however it is not effective if there are two similar natural periods in different structures for example the drop rig and test model can causes the oscillations in acceleration and their natural frequencies are same it is hard to confirm the sources of oscillations are the vibration of drop rig or test model because the time information is deleted in the fft analysis so another objective of present work is to cover this shortage by providing a data analysis technology wavelet transform what differs to the fast fourier transform is that this transform remains the time information which can overcome the difficulty of identifying the sources of oscillations when the natural frequencies of different structures are similar the rest of paper is organized as follows the experiments of one segment of elastic hull structure are introduced in section 2 in section 3 a methodology is put forward to quantize the hydroelastic effects for an elastic body impacting the water through combining the numerical and experimental methods the former provides the uncoupled solutions while the latter was corrected through using the wavelet transform in section 4 the hydroelastic effects are firstly confirmed in the wavelet analysis and then quantized through introducing the pressure and stress factors which is based on the uncoupled solutions and experimental ones finally the hydroelastic effects are discussed in terms of increasing impact velocity and the sources of these oscillations are verified through dry modal analysis section 5 draws some significant findings and outlooks the future works 2 experimental methods 2 1 experiment apparatus the experimental apparatus in the present work is designed by the yu 2016 shown in fig 1 it includes three parts a fixed frame used for supporting the experimental system a model shelf used for equipping the test model four vertical guide rails used for controlling the motion of the model shelf the details of other experimental equipment including the electric block ropes and a video camera can be found in our previous study of xie et al 2018a 2 2 test model one segment of hull structure with flat bottom was designed with the size of 1 5 m 0 9 m 0 3 m shown in fig 2 to study the impact problem the test model is made up of a stiffened panel at the bottom four side panels with a ribbed plate and a top panel the side panels and top panel thickness of 10 mm are much stronger than the bottom panel thickness of 4 mm to provide the rigid supports to the edges of bottom panels two endplates in the longitudinal direction are fitted to reduce the three dimensional effects luo et al 2012 the bottom stiffened panel is made up of 3 longitudinal stiffeners and 2 transverse frames in order to study the effect of flexible stiffeners on elastic responses the longitudinal stiffeners are continuous and across the transverse frame directly the sizes of inner structural members are listed in table 1 2 3 instrumentations the physical quantities including the whole acceleration impact pressure on the bottom panel and stress responses of longitudinal stiffeners are recorded in the experiment the accelerometer was placed on the center of the top panel and its range is 500 m s2 the location information of pressure cells and strain gauges is presented in fig 3 two symmetrical center lines c l 1 and c l 2 representing the symmetry of the model can be viewed the pressure cell was installed to the copper cap which is embedded in the bottom panel the diameter of copper cap is 20 mm and the range of pressure cell is 700 mpa the strain gages with the size of 5 mm 3 mm were placed on the top surface of longitudinal stiffeners 2 4 experimental conditions in the test program four different drop heights are chosen and their distances above the calm water level are h1 250 mm h2 400 mm h3 550 mm and h4 700 mm respectively two model weights representing different loading conditions for actual ship were used through adding ballast on the model shelf and they are l1 327 5 kg and l2 447 5 kg the combination of symbols l and h denotes the test condition of model weight and drop height e g the combination l3h1 means the model weight is 327 5 kg and the drop height is 250 mm in the subsequent analysis test condition is simplified to this combined form a series of free drop tests were carried out in a water basin of harbin engineering university by xie et al 2018a some more than 3 drop tests were repeated at least three times to minimize measured errors the experimental data were collected with a sampling frequency of 10 khz by a data acquisition system dh5902 fig 4 shows four stages of pictures for one free drop test in l1h1condition 3 methodology for hydroelastic characterization as reviewed in introduction direct comparison between experimental and numerical results faces great changes due to some experimental uncertainties in order to solve this dilemma a methodology is put forward to quantify experimental hydroelastic characterization this methodology is based on the comparison of uncoupled solution numerical results and fully coupled solution experimental results for the hydrodynamic pressure and structural response of elastic body impacting water the complete response can be decomposed into two parts the displacement and fluid force due to rigid body motion and the remainders from the flexure of the body maki et al 2011 any degree of freedom of the body x can be expressed using this decomposition as 1 x x r x f where the subscripts r and f denote rigid and flexure respectively similarly fluid force on the structure p can be decomposed into two parts one is caused by rigid body displacement and the other depends on flexural displacement 2 p x r x f p r x r p f x f this decomposition divides the hydroelastic effects on pressure and structural deformation into the parts x f and p f as for the parts x r and p r are the results from rigid body which can be obtained by an uncoupled method the pressure p r is firstly obtained through solving the water entry problem of rigid body by cfd solver and then the structural deformation x r is calculated by structural analysis in the fem solver it can be seen that the hydroelastic characterization x f and p f can be quantified by comparing the experimental results representing the complete parts x and p with the uncoupled solutions representing the parts x r and p r in addition the uncertainties including experimental noise and the oscillations of the model shelf can influence the agreement of numerical and experimental results so these factors must be removed before comparison it is worth noting that it is not reasonable to correct the experimental results by filter because the hydroelastic effects may be filtrated therefore we adopt an improved data analysis technology wavelet transform to solve this dilemma see section 3 3 in order to show the complete structure of methodology the technological process is shown in fig 5 there are two individual treatments so as to quantity the hydroelastic effects one is to correct the experimental results by identifying the hydroelastic effects and the other is to provide the uncoupled solution for the impact of elastic body 3 1 hydrodynamic impact the cfd computational fluid dynamic method is adopted to simulate the water entry problem through the commercial code fluent where the fluid was solved based on the vof method and the body motion is treated by a dynamic model numerical accuracy has been verified through comparing the published results in the studies of yang et al 2007 and xie et al 2018b we suppose the two fluids air and water are incompatible and inviscid the continuity and momentum can be simplified as 3 ρ t ρ u 0 4 t ρ u ρ u u p ρ g where u is the velocity vector ρ is the fluid density g is the gravitational acceleration in order to further consider the fluid compressibility we adopt the ideal gas law in the following form 5 ρ p 0 p m w r t where p 0 is the operating pressure atmospheric pressure p is the local static pressure relative to the operating pressure r is the universal gas constant and m w is the molecular weight the temperature t will be computed from the energy equation written as 6 t ρ e u ρ e p 0 where e is the energy the velocity and pressure fields can be obtained through solving the control equations based on the finite volume method if a 2 d flow is modeled the length in the neglectful dimensional direction is assumed as 1 m to satisfy the finite volume the discretization of time term adopts a first order implicit format the convective term is linearized through assuming one velocity at the current time step and the other velocity at the predicted time step primary discretization schemes are written as 7 u t d v d t u p r u p n v p 8 u u d v d t u n u r f s f δ t f f n u f r δ t where the superscripts n and r represent the current time step the value is known and the predicted time step the value is unknown respectively the subscript f denotes the value on the grid surface v p is the grid volume δt is the time step s is the area f is the flux however it is quite difficult to solve the control equations directly because the free surface changes with time therefore a vof model is used to trace the interface of water and air according to the volume fraction in each grid the phase equation is established to obtain the volume fraction of air α through the continuous equation eq 3 9 t ρ α α ρ u 0 where α 0 represents the grid is filled with water whereas with air 0 α 1 means the grid is the mixture of water and air free surface whose shape is represented by the geometric reconstruction piecewise linear scheme described in youngs 1982 the scalars ρ and e should be updated because the fluid is treated as a variable density single flow in vof method and they are treated as mass averaged variables 10 ρ α ρ a 1 α ρ w 11 e α ρ a e a 1 α ρ w e w ρ where the ρ a and ρ w are the density of air and water e a and e w are the energy of air and water respectively in the numerical simulation the gradient terms use a green gauss node based method with a second order accuracy based on the description of rausch et al 1991 the phase equation is firstly solved and the free surface is tracked according to the work of youngs 1982 then the control equations are solved through the finite volume method a piso pressure implicit with splitting of operators scheme presented by issa 1986 is utilized to decouple the velocity and pressure fields in the next time step the acceleration was predicted by the newton s second law based on the impact force in the previous time step then the motion of the dynamic boundary body outline was predicted and the mesh was updated atomically based on the dynamic mesh updating technology 3 2 structural analysis the structural analysis is carried out in the fem finite element method solver which is widely used to complex structures in section 3 1 the pressure distribution on the body surface can be obtained considering the meshes of fluid and structural domain are independent an association should be set to transform the load by the interpolating treatment the treating process has three steps firstly the element center on the body surface fluid domain is mapped to the body surface in the solid domain secondly the spline interpolation for pressure is done thirdly the surface pressure is converted to nodal forces on the finite element model which can be achieved through the equivalent nodal force method the approach of maman and farhat 1995 describes the use of gaussian quadrature to integrate a fluid stress over a structural element and determine the nodal force 12 f i e ω n i p n d s where n is the normal to the structural element ω and n i is the shape function the approximation to the integral can be expressed as the sum of pressure components at the gauss points 13 f i e i 1 i m w i n i x i p x i n where w i is the weight of the gauss point x i and m is the total number of gauss points once the fluid force is transformed the structural responses can be calculated by integrating the equations of motions in the time domain in the structural domain the general equations of motion of a system can be written as 14 m x c x k x f 1 where m c and k are the structural mass damping and stiffness matrix f 1 is the force vector obtained from eq 13 the transient analysis is achieved in a commercial code ansys apdl 3 3 wavelet transform as discussed in introduction identifying the hydroelastic characterization of the measured signals faces great challenges the general way is to analyze the high frequency oscillations by frequency spectral analysis like fourier transform however it is quite difficult to confirm these oscillations coming from the hydroelastic effects or the experimental noise in some situations for example if the drop rig and test model have similar modal frequency which both contributes the oscillations in the acceleration it is hard to confirm the sources of oscillations are the vibration of drop rig experimental disturbance or test model hydroelastic effect through the frequency spectral it suggests that identifying the hydroelastic characterization that experimental signals include not only needs to analyze the frequency information but also understands the time information in order to further discuss the oscillation characters however the traditional fast fourier transform is not applicable because the frequency characteristic in local time quantum is deleted this paper provides a more effective data analysis technology wavelet transform to solve the dilemma through presenting the frequency components in frequency bands over specific time duration the detailed theory of wavelets which is beyond the scope of this work can be found in daubechies 1992 jorgensen and song 2007 and amin et al 2013 a brief mathematical description is recalled as follows the wavelet transform changes an original signal f t into a time frequency function wt s τ by applying an inner product for the analyzed signal f t and daughter waveletψ s τ 15 w t s τ f t ψ s τ d t where ψ s τ t is the conjugation of ψ s τ t the different daughter wavelets can be obtained from a mother wavelet ψ t by stretching and shifting the time axis with defined parameters their relationship can be written as 16 ψ s τ t 1 s ψ t τ s s τ r where s is the scale parameter and τ is the translation parameter the selection of mother wavelet will directly affect the meaningful results for the purpose of this work is to analyze the characteristic of slamming signal the mother wavelet can be chosen as morlet function according to the recent studies of yang and tse 2005 and amin et al 2013 the signal analysis is carried out in the matlab wavelet toolbox misiti et al 2002 and the morlet function is expressed as 17 ψ t 1 π f b e i 2 π f c t e t 2 f b where f b is the bandwidth parameter and f c is the central frequency of wavelet fig 6 shows the mother function in time and frequency domains with parameters f b 2 and f c 1 it can be seen that the bandwidth frequency f b represents the time range and the central frequency f c determines the basic frequency of mother function which means the bandwidth frequency directly influences the shape of mother function and hence its role is to detect frequency change in a time quantum smaller bandwidth will increase the time resolution and reduce the frequency resolution and vice versa amin et al 2013 as for slamming signal f b can be selected as 1 hz the selection of wavelet central frequency f c should be determined according to the specific situation for example when the analysis purpose is to define temporal occurrence of signal the lower frequency of f c less than 1 hz can be chosen otherwise if the purpose is to perform a frequency analysis the higher frequency f c more than 1 hz can be selected once the parameters of motion function are provided the wavelet transform can be presented graphically through a two dimensional nephogram whose value denotes the wavelet coefficient as a function of two parameters the translation parameter time and scale parameter frequency see eq 15 it shows that different wavelet transform coefficients can be presented by selecting multiple scale and translation parameters based on the different purposes in addition actual time t and frequencies f r in the signal can be obtained through the following two equations 18 t t τ 19 f r n 0 f c s where t is the time obtained through wavelet transform and n 0 is the sampling frequency 4 presentation and discussion of results 4 1 experimental and numerical verifications the experimental and numerical results should be verified before the quantitative analysis the experimental verification is carried out by the repeatable tests and symmetrical analysis the numerical ones are verified by comparing the previously published results 4 1 1 experimental verification some drop tests were repeated as three times so as to analyze the experimental uncertainties fig 7 shows the pressure time history at p1 and the stress response at s2 in the three same drop test conditions l1h2 the results have altitudinal consistency in the initial impact stage t 0 12s while the error reaches up to 3 in the subsequent vibrating stage t 0 12s the ventilation occurs at t 0 193s because the measured pressure is negative so the air cavity is the main reason causing the pressure uncertainty as for the structural deflection as shown in fig 7 b the situation is similar to the pressure case the difference becomes obvious 4 after t 0 12s the pressure uncertainty directly leads to the stress uncertainty although the pitch or roll motion is limited in our experiment the effectiveness should be clarified therefore we discuss the experimental symmetry fig 8 a illustrates the comparative pressure results at three symmetrical measured locations p1 p3 and p6 the p1 and p6 show the good agreement while there is larger error about 5 between p1 the p3 it reflects the tiny pitch motion exists x direction and the roll motion is not obvious y direction in fact it is hard to ensure the levelness of model shelf is zero especially for large scale model as for stress presented in fig 8 b the difference 3 also appears at s3 and s7 x direction but is not so important compared to the pressure case although there are some errors in the experiment air cavity and initial levelness make the primary contributions on the other hand the larger differences appear at the subsequent vibrating stage t 0 12s while the uncertainties at the peak values are almost same generally the measured pressure and stress results are reasonable because the error can be limited to 5 4 1 2 numerical verification the numerical verification of the cfd fem code is presented in this part the water entry problem of an elastic wedge with the deadrise β 300 and the constant velocities v 6 15 m s is studied here the length of this wedge is l 0 4 m three mesh sizes for the wedge are chosen with the values of 5 mm 2 5 mm and 1 25 mm denoted as mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 firstly the convergence study of rigid body for the cfd solver is carried out the predicted pressure distribution of the rigid wedge is presented in fig 9 a with the published results where the results of lu et al 2000 and the present study are based on the rigid body while one of wang and guedes soares 2013 is the results of an elastic body with the panel thickness 5 mm the non dimensional coefficients cp and cl are defined as 20 cp p 0 5 ρ w v 2 21 cl c c 0 where the p is pressure ρ w is the water density v is the impact velocity c is the wetted half length defined as 0 5v t c 0 is the half length of wedge defined as 0 5l sin β the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are quite close which means the numerical result is convergence if the mesh is enough small but they are 7 7 larger than the ones of lu et al 2000 for the model of mesh 1 the result is close to the ones of lu with an error 1 5 the main reason is that the mesh size is 4 mm in lu s method in fact the model of mesh1 cannot capture the peak values well in addition the result of wang and guedes soares 2013 is 6 larger than the mesh 2 it means the elastic effect can influence the hydrodynamic impact pressure for the total impact force fig 9 b the results of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are almost same and 10 larger than the experimental data from zhao et al 1996 the error source mainly comes from the three dimensional effect the results of mesh 1 is 12 smaller than the experimental ones due to the peak value is not captured the result of an elastic body is 19 larger than the experimental data which means elastic effect can greatly affect the total impact force according to the discussion the models of mesh 2 and mesh 3 can predict the slamming loads well for the rigid body but have about 15 difference for the elastic body impact then the effect of mesh size on the structural response is studied in the fem solver the wedge is made up of steel with the elasticity modulus 2e11pa two thicker plates are considered with the values of 5 mm and 8 mm the mesh sizes in the fluid domain are same to the structural domain fig 10 shows the comparative result of the structural deflection of the elastic wedge where the lu et al 2000 uses a coupled bem fem method wang and guedes soares 2013 is the coupled ale method and the present study is the uncoupled method we can see the trend of the deflection is in good agreement between the mesh2 and lu et al 2000 before flow separation the calculation is stopped in lu et al 2000 when the flow separation happens the water submerges the body completely as we know the impact force will drop fast after flow separation and thus the deflection decreases such the consequence accords with the present results in addition obvious oscillations are observed in the lu et al 2000 while our results are none the oscillations mainly come from the structural elastic effects the main reason is a full coupled solution is adopted in the lu et al 2000 and the present study uses an uncoupled method ignoring the elasticity the results of mesh 2 is 15 smaller than the one of wang and guedes soares 2013 due to the higher impact pressure showed in fig 9 a generally models of mesh 2 and mesh3 have the reasonable results for the structural response considering the larger computation efforts the mesh2 is used to the following simulation 4 2 experimental data analysis before quantifying the hydroelastic characterization we should identify the high frequency oscillations of the measured data whether or not are resulted from the hydroelastic effects fig 11 a shows a typical acceleration signal in l1h2 condition it can be seen that there are some high frequency oscillations fig 11 b presents the frequency distribution using fft analysis there are four main frequencies 19 5 hz 43 9 hz 61 0 hz and 109 9 hz considering the accelerometer is placed on the top surface of the test model the vibrations of the top structure defined as m1 and the model shelf defined as m2 can be captured by accelerometer in addition the added mass and damping of water is not important because the model shelf and the top structure of the test model are always dry during the impact therefore the dry modal analysis is applied to discuss the sources of oscillations some constraint conditions should be applied due to the structural contacts where the top and bottom surfaces of m2 are fixed while the m1 is fixed in the ends the first six order modal frequencies are listed in table 2 we can see frequencies 107 5 hz in m2 and 115 9 hz in m1 are close to the frequency in the acceleration 109 9 hz which means these modal frequencies contribute to the oscillation of acceleration however we cannot clarify which of them plays a major role due to the similar frequencies in m1 and m2 through the frequency spectrum in order to further clarify the sources of oscillations the wavelet transform analysis for this signal is performed the parameters of motion function are f b 2 and f c 5 2π the scale parameter s ranges from 40 to 1024 with an interval of 0 5 and the translation parameter τ is 0 the wavelet coefficients is shown in fig 12 where the actual time and frequency are adopted to replace the time and frequency scales there are four principal frequency compositions with the values of 21 6 hz 43 9 hz 62 6 hz and 110 5 hz which are consistent with the frequency distribution obtained by fourier transformer see fig 11 b the difference is the former includes the time information while the latter does not the time history of wavelet coefficient for specific frequency reflects the importance of this frequency in the oscillation we define a relative importance of each frequency as 22 r a fre a pri where a fre and a pri represent the amplitudes of the evaluative frequency and the primary frequency the first frequency respectively we still take the high frequency composition 109 9 hz as an example in fig 11 b the r of the frequency 109 9 hz is 0 12 which means the importance is 12 in fig 12 b there is a periodic oscillation with the frequency 110 5 hz caused by the vibrations of m1 and m2 the model shelf starts to vibrate once it is released in the drop test while the test model begins to vibrate when it touches the water which suggests the time information of these two kinds of vibrations is different such a consequence makes it possible to separate the vibrations even though their frequencies are very approximate we can suppose the oscillation is only from m1 before 0 05s free drop stage and the r of the frequency is 0 017 after the body touching the water the oscillation comes from the common effect of m1 and m2 and the r is 0 12 t 0 11s according with the value in fft analysis therefore we can clarify this frequency composition is resulted by the vibrations of the model shelf accounting for 16 7 and the top structure of the test model accounting for 83 3 which is not clear in the fft analysis as for the sources of other high frequency oscillations such as 43 4 hz and 62 4 hz we can discuss them through the above analysis way and they are confirmed to be from the vibration of bottom of the test model some uncertainties of the measured data such as experimental noise and vibration of the model shelf should be excluded in order to provide a more reasonable data set for numerical verification the complete signal can be decomposed into the sum of each frequency composition using wavelet packet in the present work we use the wavelet toolbox in matlab to realize the decomposition we still take the acceleration as an example fig 13 shows the decomposition of the measured acceleration where s is the original signal and a7 d1 to d7 are the sub components it can be seen that the a7 is the major frequency composition while d1 to d7 are the time history of different high frequency compositions the compositions a7 d7 d6 and d5 are the most primary with the sample numbers in a time period are 487 191 105 and 55 respectively considering the sample frequency is 10 khz in our experiment so the frequencies of these four compositions can be estimated by the sample frequency dividing the sample number in a time period and they are 20 5 hz 52 3 hz 95 2 hz and 181 8 hz respectively it means these four compositions belong to the frequency range 0 21 hz 21 52 3 hz 53 3 95 2 hz and 95 2 181 8 hz it is noteworthy that the compositions d7 comes from the vibration of test model hydroelastic effects because it starts to appear at the beginning of impact t 0 1s while the d5 should owe to the vibration of model shelf because it starts from the release t 0s and vibrates with the same amplitude the composition d6 is complex which comes from two sources model shelf t 0 1s and the test model t 0 1s and the importance of them has been discussed above considering the d5 is very the small compared to the ones in d7 and d6 so the high frequency oscillations in acceleration is mainly attributed to the vibration of the test model so called hydroelastic effects in addition the time history of each frequency composition is shown clearly which means we can correct the original measured data through excluding the experimental uncertainties the correction can be carried out based on the following formula 23 s cor s ori s vir where the s cor is the corrected result s ori is the original result svir is the experimental uncertainties mainly including noise and the vibrations of model shelf for the acceleration decomposition the experimental uncertainties include the partial composition of d4 and the total compositions d5 d4 d3 d2 and d1 the formula applied to the acceleration can be further written as 24 s cor a 7 d7 d 6 r where r is the importance of hydroelastic in the composition d6 which can be obtained according to the eq 22 the experimental results pressure and stress response provided in the following part are corrected through this dealing way on the other hand the amplitude of d7 is not always same but firstly increases and then decreases such an appearance suggests that the characterization of hydroelastic effects may derive from the different structural parts which will be discussed in section 4 5 4 3 quantization of impact pressure the water entry of test model is simulated in a commercial code fluent where a rigid body model is adopted the fluid domain shown in fig 14 a has a size of 20 m 20 m 15 m with the initial water depth of 10 m according to the study of facci et al 2016 the four sides and bottom of the fluid domain are set to free slip boundaries and the top is the pressure outlet the body motion is treated as the rigid motion and dynamic mesh model is used to improve the grid quality the computational domain is discretized through the mesh pre processor icem cfd and hexa dominant unstructured mesh type is adopted see fig 14 b maximum cell dimension is 0 34 m and the minimum one is 0 03 m with the total number of mesh is 3 1e6 in the simulation the initial velocity is obtained from the experimental data when the body is 0 1 m above the clam water surface and then it falls freely the initial velocities in different test conditions are listed in table 3 in order to further clarify the numerical procedure the friction f e should be considered given as 25 f e m g g e where m is the model mass g is the gravity acceleration with the value of 9 8 g e is the experimental acceleration in the free drop stage with the value of 9 2 the friction is evaluated as 196 5n the total time is 0 15s with a time interval 0 0001s the cpu time is about 2 h in a pc with intel core i5 4750 3 2 ghz processor and 8 gigabytes of memory for the drop test the symmetry can be guaranteed according to the discussion in section 4 1 2 therefore we only present the results at asymmetrical locations i e p1 p2 and p4 fig 15 shows the comparative pressure time history in the experiment solid line and numerical simulation dotted line in l1 condition considering the impact happens simultaneously the time axis of p2 keeps invariant while the ones of p1 and p4 move forward and backward 0 02s respectively the pressure peaks in the l1h1 condition fig 15 a are 15 larger than the experimental data and the difference enlargers to 40 in the l1h4 condition there are obvious oscillations in the experimental results while there is none in the numerical method in fact the oscillations are resulted from the structural vibration and have been verified from the hydroelastic effects see section 4 2 however hydroelastic effects are not included in our simulation due to the assumption of rigid body the comparative analysis shows hydroelastic effect can decrease the slamming pressure and the influence is more obvious with the impact velocity which is similar to the description in stenius et al 2013 that the hydroelastic effects increase with the impact velocity on the other hand the differences between numerical and experimental results at p1 and p2 are more obvious than the ones shown in p4 which reflects the hydroelastic effect on the hydrodynamic pressure is relative to the space location similarly fig 16 shows the situation of l2 condition rigid results are 25 larger than the elastic results but the oscillations is a little smaller than that in l1condition it reflects the structural mass can also influence the hydroelastic effects a pressure factorγrepresenting the error of numerical and experimental results on pressure is defined in order to quantify hydroelastic effects as 26 γ p m r p m e p m r where p m r and p m e are the pressure peaks in the numerical and experimental results respectively fig 17 illustrates the values of γin the different test conditions this factor increases about 150 from the drop height of 0 25 m 0 7 m which means the impact velocity greatly affect the hydroelastic effect in addition theγ has different values at different locations with the law of p2 p1 p4 the model mass also influences this factor with a 5 increment from l1 condition fig 17 a to l2 condition fig 17 b these characteristics above discussing reflect the γ depends on three main variables impact velocity space location and model mass hence a curve fitting is applied for the expression of this factor in order to correct numerical results in terms of impact pressure in order to better describe this relationship these three variables adopt the dimensionless parameters written as 27 v v ρ w l 3 e i 28 d d d 0 29 m m ρ w l 3 where v d and m are the dimensionless variables of impact velocity location parameter and model mass l is the space of longitudinal stiffeners e is the flexural rigidity i is the second moment of the longitudinal stiffener d is the distance from target location to the center point the intersection point of c l 1 and c l 2 see fig 3 d 0 is the half length of diagonal m is the model mass l is the wetted length which denotes the length of model in this paper the quantized pressure factor can be treated as a function of these variables 30 γ f v d m suppose the variables are mutual independence eq 29 can be expressed as the product of these functions of each variable 31 γ k v v k d d k m m where k v v k d d and k m m are the functions of the dimensionless impact velocity v distance d and model mass m respectively the study on the distribution of slamming pressure on flat bottom structure in chen and xiao 2005 shows that the center position of the slamming surface gets the biggest pressure while the edge gets small which is similar to the result of the present work the regression function of the pressure distribution given in his study is adopted here as 32 k d 1 0 0 14 d 1 04 d 2 0 64 d 3 the k d trends to 1 if the d is close to 0 whereas the k d is smaller than 1 which meets the pressure is biggest in the center position the k d represents the pressure ratio in the target location and the center point chen and xiao 2006 studies the effect of structural mass on the pressure peak founding that there is a linear relation between 1 k m and 1 m in this paper this linear relation is adopted and the formula is given as 33 k m m m 4 195 the k m is closed to 1 when m trends to which means the effect of mass is neglectful it can be seen that the k m increases with the m which accords with the fact shown in fig 17 once the measured location and model mass is specified the γ is only the relative to k v the regression analysis of γ and k v is carried out through using a cubic polynomial where includes three measured locations p1 p2 and p4 and two models mass l1 and l2 mean multinomial coefficients are treated as the final coefficients of the fitted curve as 34 k v 2 15 6 99 v 1 77 v 2 substitute eq 31 33 into eq 30 the expression of γ can be obtained for specified test condition these three variables are known so the γ can be further obtained in order to verify the capacity of this quantized pressure factor fig 18 shows the comparative results of γ between the regression analysis and original data from the experiment reasonable agreement with them can be observed in view of the fundamental purpose in this paper is to calibrate the impact pressure from the simple uncoupled solution so as to accord with the experimental results coupled solution the quantized pressure factor based on the pressure peak is applied to correct the numerical results because the pressure peak is the most important concern in the structural design the pressure time history can be corrected through the following equation 35 p c o r t 1 γ p r i g t where p r i g t is the pressure time history from uncoupled solution p c o r t is the corrected pressure time history examples of the comparison of corrected pressure and experimental data are presented in fig 19 good agreement between them can be found when we ignore the subsequent vibration 4 4 quantization of elastic response the ship hull structure is modeled to analyze the structural responses in ansys where only the bottom stiffened panel is used to save cpu time the shell63 element which is the elastic element type with four nodes is chosen considering the local stiffening of the structure introduced by the pressure sensors the fem model should be considered this influence in the experiment the copper cap was embedded into the bottom panel so as to place the pressure sensors through the screw thread the diameter is about 20 mm the other structures of the test model are made up of aluminum the whole finite element model is shown in fig 20 a and the total number of elements is about 2 1e4 there are nine local strengthen locations and their locations accord with the arrangement of pressure sensors shown in fig 3 and the local grid treatment is showed in fig 20 b the model is supported by the neglectful structures including four side panels and top panel hence fixed boundary conditions on the connections of these structures are applied the dynamic structural response is solved using full solution method with the total time 0 15s and 100 load steps obtained by the corrected pressure in section 4 3 where the hydroelastic effects on the pressure are included through the pressure factor the cpu time is about 1 h in the same pc configuration introduced in section 4 3 similar to the impact pressure we also present the stress response at asymmetrical locations like s1 s2 s4 and s5 fig 21 and fig 22 show the comparison of stress responses between experiments and numerical results for the four drop heights and two model weights the results show there are larger differences at different space locations with a general law of s5 s4 s2 s1 considering the distance between the measured position and the center point see fig 3 has the same law showed in stress response the law can be re summarized that the stress gradually decreases from the center to the border two main reasons may cause such a consequence one is the same law of pressure appeared at the different measured locations and the other is the fixed boundary conditions are applied to the ends of the stiffened panel as shown in fig 19 the pressure at different locations is almost same which means the pressure difference is not so important on the other hand if the uniform pressure is forced to the panel with fixed boundaries applying to the ends structural deflection will decrease from the center to the border therefore the reason causing the difference of stress response in different space locations should owe to the fixed supports on the ends of the stiffened panel the obvious evidence is that the stress responses of s2 and s4 are almost consistent because the distance between s4 position and the center point is same to the s2 position for the numerical results there are some oscillations but they differ to the appearance of the experimental data for example the oscillations in the numerical results are very sharp while it is smoothed in the experiment in fact the former is caused by the structural dynamic effects while the latter is from the oscillations of impact pressure due to hydroelastic effects as shown in figs 21 and 22 the stress responses obtained by the numerical method still have some errors comparing to the experimental data even though the pressure has been calibrated in section 4 3 in order to further analyze the sources of error a quantized stress factor ε is defined as 36 ε s m r s m e s m e where s m e and s m r are the stress peak from experiment and simulation separately the values of ε in the different drop heights and mass model are presented in fig 23 the ε increases about 80 from drop height 0 25 m 0 7 m and the increment is more obvious in the larger drop height generally the stress response is proportional to pressure related to the square of impact velocity the nonlinear trend of ε and drop height suggests there are some other factors to affect the structural response considering the structural deflection happens from the dry condition to wet condition because the water submerges the body gradually so the natural period of the structure is the main reason causing the nonlinear structural response in fact the added mass and damping can greatly affect the natural period of the structure so called rate that structure can response as for the numerical results they are 5 15 larger than the experiments referencing the structural analysis presented in section 3 2 the added mass and damping matrix is not included which is the reason causing the error between the numerical and experimental results as the distribution of stenius et al 2011 the hydroelastic effects can be divided into two different categories kinematic effects and inertial effects the former is the deformation of the structure in response to the hydrodynamic loading affecting the pressure distribution which affects the impact pressure i e quantized pressure factor in our discussion in section 4 3 the latter is the relationship between the loading rate and the rate at which the structure can respond affecting the structural response i e quantized stress factor similar to the quantization of impact pressure the quantized stress factor ε is given to discuss the hydroelastic inertial effects referring the fig 23 the ε is close to zero when the impact velocity is small while it greatly increases with the impact velocity such an appearance shows the ε mainly depends on the impact velocity further considering the nonlinear relationship of ε and impact velocity a second order polynomial is adopted to fit the expression in addition the ε has no better applicability compared to the quantized pressure factor γ due to flexible boundary conditions hence individual regression analysis in each measured point is carried out and the regression function is listed in table 4 fig 24 shows the comparison of corrected and original stress factors where good agreement is achieved 4 5 discussion of hydroelastic effects although the experimental hydroelastic effects on the impact pressure and stress response are quantized through the pressure and stress factors in section 4 3 and section 4 4 it is still not clear the mechanics of structural vibrations on the high frequency oscillations e g which of vibration frequency plays a major role and which of structural components results this frequency in order to further make them clear the importance of each high frequency is firstly discussed through wavelet transform then the hydroelastic effects are discussed with the various impact velocities finally the dry modal analysis of different structures is carried out to analyze the sources of oscillations firstly the frequencies appeared in the measured pressure are recognized through the wavelet analysis fig 25 a shows the time frequency characters of the pressure in l1h1condition four main frequencies 20 hz 50 hz 78 hz and 113 hz can be observed the wavelet coefficients in the first frequency denote the pressure time history during the impact which likes the results of a rigid body the other three compositions represent the high frequency oscillations which are close to the frequencies showed in the acceleration see fig 12 further referring the discussion in section 4 2 these frequencies cannot come from the vibrations of model shelf m1 and the top structure of test model m2 because they cannot transfer to the pressure signal which means these high frequencies are caused by the vibrations of bottom structure in addition the frequency 50 hz plays the primary role due to the larger wavelet coefficient for the case of higher impact velocity shown in fig 25 b on the one hand the frequencies are a little bigger than the ones showed in fig 25 a in fact the air is caught during the impact which leads to the structure vibrate in the mixture of air and water more air is trapped due to the higher impact velocity causing the higher natural frequency on the other hand the maximum value in the frequency 50 hz increases e g the value is 464 in l1h4 condition which is 87 larger than that in the l1h1 condition similarly fig 26 b presents the frequency distribution of stress response in l1h1 condition the main frequencies are almost same to those showed in the pressure signal such a situation suggests that the main sources of these oscillations are not the dynamic effects but the vibrations of the structures otherwise the frequencies cannot completely accord with the results of pressure because the dynamic effect does not influence the pressure in addition the frequency 54 hz makes a major contribution to the oscillations next we discuss the hydroelastic characters in terms of increasing velocity drop height it is cannot confirm the relative importance of hydroelasticity through the wavelet coefficient z value showed in the figs 25 and 26 because the impact velocity can influence the value even if the hydroelastic importance is same in order to exclude the influence of velocity on the wavelet coefficient a relative factor δ is defined as 37 δ c h i g h c l o w where c h i g h and c l o w are the maximum of wavelet coefficients in high and primary frequencies respectively fig 27 shows the values of δ in different drop heights the δ for the frequency 47 hz is much larger than the other high frequencies which reflects this natural frequency plays a major role in the hydroelastic effects for the case of impact pressure fig 27 a it can be observed that the δ increases from 0 55 to 0 82 when the drop height changes from 250 mm h1 to 700 mm h4 which means the hydroelasticity is more important when the impact velocity is larger for the case of stress response fig 27 b the δ almost keeps invariable about 0 7 from h1 to h4 which suggests the hydroelastic effects on the stress response are not so important with the increasing velocity referencing the discussion in section 4 3 and section 4 4 the hydroelectric effects are divided into two categories kinematic effects and inertial effects the former affects the pressure relative to the impact velocity while the latter influences the structural response which is not relevant to the velocity but depended on the natural period of the structure in order to analyze the mechanics causing high frequency oscillations in the structural response a dry modal analysis was carried out in commercial code ansys workbench the different structural components may cause the hydroelastic effects in the discussion of section 4 2 so three structures related to the measured area longitudinal stiffeners are modeled to discuss the mechanics of oscillations one is the stiffened panel with transverse frames model 1 the second is the stiffened panel model 2 and the third one is the longitudinal stiffeners model 3 fixed supports are applied based on the contact relationship e g the ends of model 3 are fixed according to the contact between longitudinal stiffener and four side panels the typical modal shapes of these three models are shown in fig 28 fig 29 and fig 30 the first six order modal frequencies of these three models are shown in fig 31 where two auxiliary lines dotted line are plotted with the frequencies 54 hz and 82 hz representing the main frequency in the stress signal it can be seen that the first order frequencies of model 3 and model 2 agree with the frequency 50 hz and the second order frequency of model 2 is close to 84 hz it implies model 2 and model 3 may affect the stress responses in addition model 1has no obvious influence on the stress due to the larger frequency difference in the elastic response and modal analysis it is worth noting that the frequencies 54 hz and 82 hz are wet frequencies which are smaller than the dry modal frequencies showed in fig 31 the second order frequency of model 3 is a little bigger than 82 hz so this mode frequency may also influence the stress responses 5 conclusions a methodology for quantifying the hydroelastic characterization is put forward based on the simplified numerical method uncoupled solutions and the experimental method fully coupled solutions for the former a cfd solver was adopted to predict the impact pressure and the structural response was obtained by a fem solver the convergence study shows the mesh size greatly influences the hydrodynamic pressure and structural deflection when the mesh size is less than 2 5 mm the numerical accuracy can be guaranteed for the experimental method one segment of hull structure was designed to study the dynamic response of elastic structure impacting calm water this hull structure was made up of a bottom panel with 3 longitudinal stiffeners and 2 transverse frames four side panels with ribbed plate and a top panel an effective drop test system was applied to carry out a series of free drop tests with four drop heights h1 250 mm h2 400 mm h3 550 mm and h4 700 mm and two model weights l1 327 5 kg and l2 447 5 kg the time histories of pressure on the bottom panel and stress on the longitudinal stiffeners were recorded experimental stability is verified through repeatable drop tests and symmetrical analysis and its uncertainties can be limited to 5 the data analysis technology wavelet transform is firstly applied to recognize the oscillations in the measured signal which remains the time information compared to the fourier transform the wavelet analysis of the acceleration is carried out to identify the high frequency oscillations showing there are four main oscillation components with frequencies 19 5 hz 43 9 hz 61 0 hz and 109 9 hz in order to present the time character in each frequency composition the whole signal is decomposed into four different frequency ranges 0 21 hz 21 52 3 hz 53 3 95 2 hz and 95 2 181 8 hz through the wavelet packet the results show the frequency 109 9 hz is caused by the vibrations of the model shelf accounting for 16 7 and top panel of test model accounting for 83 3 while the frequencies 43 9 hz and 61 0 hz are from the vibrations of bottom structures experimental hydroelastic effects have been divided into two different categories kinematic effects influencing the pressure and inertial effects affecting the structural deflection according to the study of stenius et al 2011 the kinematic effects on the pressure were firstly discussed through comparing the uncoupled solutions numerical results and fully coupled solutions experimental data the predicted pressure is about 15 25 larger than the measured data due to the hydroelastic effects related to three factors model mass space location and impact velocity in order to further clarify the hydroelastic effects and calibrate predicted pressure a pressure factor is defined as a function of these three factors and the expression is obtained through the regression analysis good agreements are achieved between the calibrated pressure and experimental ones then the inertial effects on the stress response were discussed the predicted stress responses are obtained through the corrected pressure so as to exclude the kinematic effects of hydroelasticity and they are 5 10 larger than experimental data the quantized stress factor was also defined and expressed through a second order polynomial summarily the hydroelastic effects caused by the added mass and added damping not only reduces hydrodynamic impact pressure about 25 but also alleviates the structural deflection about 10 more details of experiment hydroelastic characterization are discussed through using wavelet analysis the results show the frequency component 50 hz plays a major role on the hydroelastic effects the importance of hydroelasticity δ was defined through the ratio of wavelet coefficient showing the δ increases from 0 59 to 0 81 for impact pressure while it rises from 0 7 for stress response when the drop height changes from h1 to h4 which suggests the hydroelastic effects on the pressure are more significant while the effects on the stress response are almost invariable with impact velocity in order to study the mechanics that causes the high frequency oscillations of the stress responses the dry modal analysis of three structures related to the measured location stiffened panel with transverse frames model 1 stiffened panel model 2 and longitudinal stiffeners model 3 are carried out it suggests that the first order modal frequencies of model 3 and the first order model frequency of model 2 are the major contributors to these oscillations summarily we firstly applied the data analysis technology wavelets transform to discuss the high oscillations in the hydroelastic impact signal and achieve satisfactory results further research is motivated by extending its application such as the analysis of global ship hull vibrations in addition the simplified approach of elastic body impact is suitable to complex geometrical shapes and has less computational efforts so further works should focus on the application in the design of
