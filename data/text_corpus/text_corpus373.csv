potential mapping gpm provides the valuable information on groundwater volume that can be withdrawn from the aquifer without affecting the environmental conditions in this study gpm was innovatively explored by including three typical climate factors precipitation pre evaporation eva and ground surface temperature gst and by taking into consideration a total of 23 conditional groundwater factors during the model construction three ensemble learning models are used for the modeling process random forest rf xgboost and lightgbm the study was conducted in the southern regions of yinchuan plain which is known for its temperate continental climate with low precipitation and high evaporation it was found that all six adopted models i e rf c xgboost c lightgbm c rf xgboost lightgbm made reasonable predictions of groundwater potential with areas with high and very high potential concentrated in the southwest region where the yellow river enters the study area the lightgbm c model performs the best oa 0 769 f1 score 0 667 auc 0 921 while the rf model performs the worst oa 0 654 f1 score 0 4 auc 0 757 according to the lightgbm c model there are more productive wells in areas with high groundwater potential 22 wells 0 0152 per km2 while fewer non productive wells are found 3 wells 0 0021 per km2 the performance of lightgbm c and rf c models has been notably enhanced by climate factors auc 0 073 oa 0 025 f1 score 0 052 for lightgbm and auc 0 073 oa 0 051 f1 score 0 149 for rf the further cumulative importance results indicate that the three ensemble models which

economic demands urban expansion agricultural enterprise and industrial activities in recent years pham et al 2019 serele et al 2020 zahedi et al 2017 meanwhile as the widespread droughts and seawater intrusion caused by climate change have become more severe or intense water scarcity has exacerbated and attracted global attention xiong et al 2022 under this condition groundwater exploitation overcomes the basic water shortage and improves the levels of water service particularly in arid and semi arid areas cavalcante et al 2019 madramootoo 2012 seeboonruang 2016 due to its high quality large quantity and more extensive availability in comparison to surface water ouedraogo et al 2019 however the extensive and unsustainable groundwater exploitation may lead to a series of water crises and environmental issues including land subsidence rajabi 2018 ground fissures wang and fei 2014 water imbalance taheri et al 2016 groundwater level decline wang et al 2018 groundwater salinity mancuso et al 2020 and ecological degradation mencio and mas pla 2010 therefore the view of sustainable groundwater exploitation and use has reached a global consensus to reduce the effects of over exploitation abrishamchi et al 2020 afshar et al 2020 liu et al 2022 saqr et al 2021 groundwater potential mapping gpm is one of the most effective ways to eliminate the effects of intensive groundwater exploitation based on different groundwater conditional parameters involving the aspects of geology topography hydrology climate land cover and aquifer characteristics phong et al 2021 termeh et al 2019 thanh et al 2022 it is also the initial and important stage for further investigation leading to sustainable groundwater exploitation and effective groundwater management pathak et al 2021 during recent years remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis have become faster easier and more powerful tools for gpm which overcame the difficulties e g costly time consuming uneconomic and unproductive of traditional methods such as hydrological tests drillings and ground surveys amade et al 2018 ganapuram et al 2009 termeh et al 2019 model technologies for gpm can be classified into 1 knowledge based models such as analytical hierarchy process ahp kaur et al 2020 2 common statistical models including weight of evidence woe lee et al 2012 frequency ratio fr abd manap et al 2014 influencing factor if das 2019 evidential belief function ebf nampak et al 2014 and entropy based analysis rahmati et al 2016 and 3 machine learning models such as logistic regression lr zandi et al 2016 random forest rf zabihi et al 2016b support vector regression svr fadhillah et al 2021 artificial neural network ann linear discriminant analysis lda chen et al 2019c and decision tree dt duan et al 2016 etc in most cases the statistical and machine learning models perform well in gpm because they enable to overcome the biases caused by expert knowledge naghibi et al 2017b pham et al 2019 however some drawbacks of these models cannot be ignored on the one hand some machine learning models such as ann and lr models show the issues of opacity in network analysis and sensitivity of outlier values in regression analysis rahmati et al 2016 on the other hand some biases may occur because of compulsory statistical assumptions in some bivariate e g fr and multivariate models e g lr tehrany et al 2013 termeh et al 2019 therefore a vast of literature pointed out that ensemble machine learning models should be increasingly used in gwp studies phong et al 2021 thanh et al 2022 the ensemble learning model e g bagging boosting and stacking is a technique that enable to combine multiple learning algorithms for the improvement of model performance which effectively overcomes the issues of sensitivity of outliers errors caused by insufficient data and compulsory statistical assumptions in the learning process dietterich 2000a opitz and maclin 1999 also this group of methods can address the black box limitations of some network analyses by assessing the relative importance of gpm parameters rahmati et al 2016 currently some researchers have made great contributions to the application of ensemble models in gpm and continuously optimizing the basic ensemble models for example sachdeva and kumar 2021 found that the gradient boosted decision tree gbdt model outperformed the conventional rf model in drought prone areas in india arabameri et al 2021 applied three algorithms nbtree cart and mlp to the random subspace method and found the significant improvement in model performance than benchmark methods likewise avand et al 2020 applied different ensemble algorithms including bagging adaboost and multi boosting into best first tree bftree models and reported higher model performance than benchmark methods as well in yasuj dena area iran rasool et al 2022 reported that extreme gradient boosting xgboost is the best model among 6 different machine learning models ann rf xgboost support vector machine naïve bayes k nearest neighbor these pioneering studies compared different ensemble learning models and demonstrated the effectiveness of these models for gpm however the use of boosting algorithms e g xgboost and lightgbm has not been fully explored in the field of gpm in fact xgboost and lightgbm are presently newer methods in gpm they have been flourished in various fields such as landslide susceptibility ye et al 2022 flood susceptibility saber et al 2021 groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2021 prediction of rock geological conditions yin et al 2022 and groundwater dynamics jing et al 2022 however for the field of gpm the use of these models is very limited and it is a fact that there is still great potential for research on the boosting algorithms for higher model performance in gpm groundwater plays a significant role in overcoming water shortages and improving regional water services particularly in the arid and semi arid regions cavalcante et al 2019 madramootoo 2012 it should be noted that these areas are normally characterized by rare precipitation high evaporation as well as sufficient solar radiation and large daily temperature difference however these climate conditions except for precipitation have not been widely applied in gpm models naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 and gomez escalonilla et al 2022 pointed out the study area characteristics may significantly influence the variable importance which means that the climate factors should be considered under the arid or semi arid conditions recently wang et al 2022 applied evaporation as a parameter to conduct the research of gpm and they found that evaporation is very important parameter for gpm in arid areas although this parameter was not used in the previous research based on site characteristics benjmel et al 2022 considered land surface temperature as a parameter in the arid areas for gpm and obtained a reasonable prediction result in spite of this the two studies did not primarily focus on the effects of climate factors and they each considered a specific climate factor currently limited studies considered the groundwater conditional factors related to climate such as precipitation evaporation and surface temperature in the arid or semi arid regions which may significantly affect the accuracy of gpm the southern regions of yinchuan plain have been selected as the study area for this research this area is characterized by a typical temperate continental climate with infrequent precipitation and high evaporation as previously reported in the literature li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b in this area the water shortage is a severe issue because of the large quantity of irrigation and the reduction of water transfer from the yellow river and groundwater has gradually become an important supply of water resources in this area wei and hui 2011 at present the research on groundwater in yinchuan plain are primarily focused on hydro chemical characteristics qian and li 2011 pollution distribution han et al 2013 he et al 2022 liu et al 2019 vulnerability qian et al 2012 groundwater level forecasting yin and zhang 2021 as well as contamination risk assessment li et al 2020 however there is a lack of research from the gpm perspective in yinchuan plain under the increasing water pressure the accurate gpm in yinchuan plain is not only important for the subsequent regional sustainable groundwater extraction groundwater management the mitigation of water crisis and the improvement of water service but also provides valuable information on gpm in arid or semi arid regions at the global scale the purpose of this study is to conduct gpm in the southern regions of yinchuan plain by three ensemble learning methods taking three main climate factors i e precipitation evaporation and ground surface temperature into account a total of 23 factors from aspects of hydrology climate land use topography and geology were used to design six different models namely rf c xgboost c lightgbm c rf xgboost and lightgbm in this study the first three models considered the climate factors while the last three models removed the climate factors three specific objectives are included in this study including 1 find out the optimal model among six different ensemble learning models and combinations of climate factors for gpm in the study area 2 discuss the importance of the three climate factors in the study area during gpm and further provide the insights of factor selection for gpm in the arid or semi arid regions 3 propose the suggestions and future research of gpm in the arid or semi arid regions 2 study area the yinchuan plain situated in the northern ningxia hui autonomous region of china was chosen as the study area with a specific focus on its southern region due to the availability of well data its longitude ranges from 37 45 40 n to 38 49 10 n and its latitude is from 105 51 47 to 106 35 46 e fig 1 covering approximately 4434 34 km2 the study area is characterized by temperate continental arid climate with rare precipitation and high evaporation as well as sufficient solar radiation and large daily temperature range qian et al 2012 the yinchuan meteorological station serves as a typical representative for projecting recent climate changes in the study area fig 2 from 2012 to 2020 the average annual precipitation amounted to approximately 229 6 mm exhibiting significant seasonal variability notably the majority of precipitation in study area occurs during june to september accounting for 72 71 of the total annual precipitation meanwhile the average annual evaporation reached 1322 8 mm the yellow river is the trunk river in the study area flows from qingtongxia city to northeast of yinchuan city across the study area which provided the majority of irrigation water resources for development fan et al 2022 the general terrain characteristic of study area is flat and slightly slopes from west to northeast the landform presents the composition of piedmont alluvium plain alluvial plain and lacustrine plain with the broad distribution of quaternary deposits alluvial deposits mainly distribute in the south of the study area where the yellow river flows into from the upstream to downstream the lithology gradually transferred from medium fine and silt fine sand to clay soil overall in spite of the low level of groundwater development and utilization in the study area groundwater remains a vital component of agricultural and domestic water supply systems 3 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is shown in fig 3 the procedures of the methodology include gwp database construction well classification ensemble learning model construction hyperparameter optimization model verification as well as results and discussion 3 1 dataset 3 1 1 groundwater well inventory all the 389 wells in this study are unconfined wells and the water yield data were obtained from historical records comprised of pumping wells and domestic wells survey data conducted by the gbn up to 2020 specifically the water yield data were extracted from single well of pumping out test in steady flow records of these 389 wells the yields of groundwater wells ranged from 0 m3 h to 1104 m3 h with the average yield of 40 m3 h in this study the well inventory was divided into two groups namely productive wells yield 10 m3 h and unproductive wells yield 10 m3 h the two groups of wells were assigned the values of 1 and 0 as the target classification in the ensemble models additionally 80 311 wells were applied for the training data set and the remaining 20 78 wells were used for model verification 3 1 2 groundwater conditional factors the groundwater potential was assessed by 23 factors divided into five groups these factors include hydrological climate land use topographical and geological factors from figs 4 to 7 classifications and distributions of these factors are shown the selection rationales for these factors are mainly based on the research of thanh et al 2022 and they have detailed statistics on the factors used in gpm at global scale twenty one commonly used factors including precipitation were selected for gpm in this study additionally two climate factors namely evaporation and ground surface temperature were supplemented for model construction in consideration of the arid site characteristics table 1 shows the information of 23 factors and corresponding source data type and scale resolution 3 1 2 1 hydrological factors the hydrological factors that used in this study include groundwater depth gwd topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi and drainage density dd fig 4 the gwd data 2020 7 associated with the aforementioned 389 observation wells were obtained from the nwc and were further interpolated with ordinary kriging method in gis environment to match the entire study area boundary generally the deeper groundwater depth indicates the less groundwater potential guru et al 2017 eq 1 was used for the creation of twi layer and it indicates the amount of flow accumulating in a point which may further influence the groundwater storage termeh et al 2019 spi measured the erosive power of streams and its calculation can be found in eq 2 generally a negative value of spi is more susceptible for the storage of groundwater ahmad et al 2020a additionally low dd areas are more suitable for the storage of groundwater in one hand there is a negative correlation between drainage density and infiltration rate and on the other hand the groundwater potential is often poor in the areas with high drainage density as the majority of groundwater may be lost by the form of runoff hussein et al 2017 1 twi l n a s tan β 2 spi a s tan β where a s is the catchment area β is the slope angle in degrees 3 1 2 2 climate factors three climate factors are included in this study namely ground surface temperature gst precipitation pre and evaporation eva fig 5 the cooling effects of shallow groundwater on gst has been identified by much research alkhaier et al 2012 wang et al 2021a that is the lower gst in an area tends to represent higher groundwater potential mallick et al 2015 pre is the major source of recharge which significantly affects the amount of groundwater in the water system it contributes to a large amount of water to aquifer by the infiltration process and increase the groundwater levels chotpantarat et al 2014 eva is a rare gpm factor but it cannot be ignored in arid areas because evaporation in these areas is several times or even dozens of times that of rainfall which significantly affects the storage of groundwater wang et al 2022 3 1 2 3 land use factors ndvi and lulc were selected as the land use factors for gpm in this study fig 6 lulc described the human effects e g groundwater usage and abstraction on groundwater potential bagyaraj et al 2019 waikar and nilawar 2014 specifically the urbanization of and agricultural activities may increase the abstraction of groundwater while the groundwater in some natural landscapes e g forests and water bodies may slightly influenced by human activities lamichhane and shakya 2019 odeh et al 2019 ndvi is also a parameter in groundwater potential prediction because higher ndvi value normally indicates the higher possibility of groundwater nampak et al 2014 in this study the data of ndvi and lulc were obtained from resdc and from glc chen et al 2019a respectively 3 1 2 4 topographical factors this study selected 9 topographical factors for gpm namely elevation ev slope s aspect asp profile curvature pfc plan curvature plc sediment transport index sti terrain ruggedness index tri topographic position index tpi and slope length sl fig 7 these factors were all derived from the spatial transformations of dem data a gentle slope allows more time for rainwater infiltration magesh et al 2012 and the aspect is a function of rainfall direction air moisture wind direction plant growth and snow melting naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 which significantly impacts the groundwater potential the curvature of topography can be concave or convex which determines the flow acceleration or deceleration pfc and convergence or divergence plc ahmad et al 2020b chen et al 2018 sti presents the erosive processes caused by runoff with the consideration of transport capacity which further affects the infiltration and recharge conforti et al 2011 nguyen et al 2020 in this study sti was calculated by eq 3 tri enables to assess the landscape heterogeneity by summing the mean difference between the center and surrounding of cells see eq 4 the lower tri value normally represents higher groundwater potential panahi et al 2020 the values of tpi indicate higher or lower elevations compared to surroundings see eq 5 and lower tpi means the flatter ground surface which is beneficial for water infiltration arulbalaji et al 2019 sl is the combination of slope steepness and slope length which is to indicate the soil loss possibility from the perspective of slope properties das et al 2022 zabihi et al 2016a 3 sti a s 22 13 0 6 s i n β 0 0896 1 3 where a s is the specific catchment area β is the slope angle in degrees 4 tri i 1 8 e e i 8 5 tpi e i 1 8 e i 8 where e is the elevation value of the center point e i is the surrounding elevation value 3 1 2 5 geological factors five geological factors including soil geomorphology gm lineament density ld aquifer media am and vadose zone media vz are included in this study fig 8 soil plays a very significant role in gpm because it influences the amount of recharge by infiltration chen et al 2018 gm is a widely used groundwater potential indicator that provides information on landform characteristics with changes in temperature water movement freezing and chemical reactions arulbalaji et al 2019 higher ld indicates more groundwater potential because lineaments are often the representations of secondary porosity and permeability yeh et al 2016 am and vz describe the lithology of the aquifer and vadose zone which determines the groundwater storage and infiltration capacity in the water cycle guo et al 2023 thus influencing the potential of groundwater in an area 3 2 modelling process 3 2 1 random forest rf model is a non parametric ensemble learning model that combined many decision trees breiman 2001 it has been preferred for a wide range of regression classification and feature selection tasks because of rapid processing high model performance and easy parameter optimization procedures sahin et al 2020 during the modelling a variety of trees are developed by different data subsets and each decision tree in trained by use of bootstrap strategy specifically the training dataset is initially split into two parts as training samples in bag 2 3 data and validation samples out of bag 1 3 data the bootstrap strategy enables effectively assess the predictive ability of generated model by decreasing the prediction variance for a smaller model error baker et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 kavzoglu and teke 2022 the detailed descriptions of rf and its application in gpm can be found in the vast literature choubin and rahmati 2021 naghibi et al 2017a rahmati et al 2016 3 2 2 xgboost xgboost is a scalable supervised gradient boosting algorithm which has been widely used to achieve state of the art results on many learning challenges it combined a set of weak tree learner in parallel to a stronger learner for the increase of computational efficiency over the conventional boosting algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 a second order taylor expansion is introduced in xgboost which increases the accuracy and enables loss functions to be customized via gradient descent it adds the complexity of the tree model to the regularization term in order to prevent overfitting and as a result performs better in generalization jing et al 2022 specifically shrinkage is used to decrease the influence of individual trees for bias elimination and the column introduces the randomization into the model to reduce the variance compared to traditional boosting methods li et al 2022 the core design of xgboost is to minimize the following objective function eq 6 6 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 f t x i ω f t where l is the loss function for the minimization of errors t is the number of iterations ω f t is the additional regularization term for the control of model complexity and over fitting y i is the observed value y i is the predicted value that was calculated by eq 7 7 f k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where γ and λ are the parameters of regularization ω represents the scores of every leaf t is the leaves number of the tree more detailed descriptions and explanations of xgboost can be found in chen and guestrin 2016 3 2 3 lightgbm lightgbm was introduced by ke et al 2017a and was a novel gradient boosting decision tree gbdt for addressing the issue in case of large data size and high feature dimension zhang et al 2022 it involved the process of gradient based one side sampling goss and exclusive feature bunding efb to help training without losing model accuracy and performance ma et al 2018 with goss algorithm a large proportion of data cases with small gradients are excluded and the remaining data instances are used only to estimate the information gain specifically the top a 100 instances with the larger gradients are firstly assigned to a subset a then for the remaining set a c consisting 1 a 100 instances with smaller gradients a new subset b is built by random sampling with size b a c finally the variance gain v j d can be applied to split data instances as is expressed as eq 8 8 v j d 1 n x i a l g i 1 a b x i b i g i 2 n l j d x i a r g i 1 a b x i b r g i 2 n r j d where n l j d and n r j d are the number of nodes for left and right respectively 1 a b is the coefficient for gradient normalization a l and a r are subsets of subset a b i and b r are subsets of subset b efb enables to reduce the number of features by bunding mutually exclusive features in a sparse feature space thereby improving the model performance and computing efficiency li et al 2022 additionally a leafwise tree growth strategy is used for the improvement of model performance and avoidance of overfitting more detailed descriptions and explanations of lightgbm can be found in ke et al 2017a 3 2 4 tree structured parzen estimator approach tpe despite the advantages and superiority of the ensemble models over other learning algorithms the hyperparameters are supposed to be accurately adjusted for the optimal results for the three models tpe algorithm is used to find the optimization quantization hyperparameters that is able to achieve the expected accuracy by an iterative process bergstra et al 2011 hyperparameter optimization including grid random and bayesian research plays a significant role in machine learning models for the improvement of model performance and optimization efficiency which overcome the time consuming issue of conventional trial and error optimization sameen et al 2019 bayesian optimization is a function to find the minimization of the objective function and hyperopt is a python library for bayesian optimization that implements sequential model based optimization smbo by using tpe rong et al 2021 in this study the 1 auc score was defined as the loss for the objective function with iteration times uniformly set at 1000 the optimal parameters were selected when the minimum value of the loss was obtained during 1000 iterations table 2 presents the hyperparameters and parameter space chosen for the three models further details and explanations of tpe can be found in bergstra et al 2011 3 2 5 model verification model verification is a substantial step for model comparison and optimal prediction analysis arabameri et al 2021 in this study overall accuracy oa f1 score and receiver operating characteristic roc curve were used for model verification a confusion matrix enables to define four judgments namely true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn oa and f1 scores are calculated by eq 9 and eq 10 and the roc curve is created by plotting tpr sensitivity and fpr 1 specificity into the coordinate system respectively the calculations of tpr and fpr are shown in eq 11 and eq 12 9 oa tp t n tp t n f p f n 10 f 1 s c o r e 2 t p 2 t p f p f n 11 tpr tp tp f n 12 fpr fp tn f p the area under the roc curve auc is able to measure the quality of the prediction models and a higher auc value indicates a better model rahmati et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater potential maps for six ensemble learning models the optimal values of hyperparameters are different table 3 displays the results of hyperparameters optimized by tpe under these conditions six groundwater potential maps can be obtained with a predicted probability value fig 9 a to 8f show the groundwater potential maps of the rf c model xgboost c model lightgbm c model rf model xgboost model and lightgbm model respectively the results are presented in the form of theoretical probability ranging from 0 to 1 the verification wells including both productive red points and non productive wells black points were added on the maps for the future sustainable groundwater abstraction and management the study area was classified into five sub regions by natural breakpoint method namely very low low moderate high and very high groundwater potential areas it was found that the six models regardless of the selection of models and climate factors or not can generally make reasonable predictions for groundwater potential in the study area this is because most productive wells are located in very high and high potential areas while non productive wells are mostly in low and very low potential areas the high and very high groundwater potential areas are basically concentrated in the southwest area especially where the yellow river enters the study area these areas can further carry out groundwater pumping also the groundwater potential of the western mountainous area of the study area is generally greater than that of the eastern basin and the low and very low groundwater potential areas are mainly distributed in the central and northern parts of the study area the areas of low and very low groundwater potential are not suitable for the exploitation of groundwater and it is more for the demand side of water allocation in water management by comparing the spatial distributions of six groundwater potential maps in the southern parts of the study area the groundwater potentials predicted by the rf c model xgboost c model and lightgbm c model are higher than the benchmark models this result can be well explained by the climate factors according to fig 5 the southern parts of the study area have the characteristics of higher pre lower eva and higher gst as illustrated in 3 1 2 2 high pre and low eva normally mean higher groundwater potentials also although high gst should theoretically represent lower groundwater potential it is contrary to the predicted results which shows that pre and eva are relatively more important climate conditional factors than gst the results of the rf based model indicate that the groundwater potential along the yellow river is higher than that predicted by other models especially when climate factors are absent as a result it is consistent with the am distribution medium fine sand medium coarse sand which indicates that am is of greater importance in rf based models than in other models 4 2 evaluation of three ensemble models table 4 shows the area well number and well density of each sub region in different models which indicates the statistical distributions of these maps according to table 4 lightgbm c is the best model because it predicted more productive wells 12 wells 0 0408 density and fewer non productive wells 1 well 0 0034 density in very high groundwater potential sub regions meanwhile in the very low groundwater sub regions lightgbm c also predicted more non productive wells 22 wells 0 0152 density and less productive wells 3 well 0 0021 density likewise rf model shows the lowest model performance because five productive wells and fifteen non productive wells were in very low groundwater potential sub regions respectively also there were two non productive wells in the very high groundwater potential sub regions with the density of 0 0087 per km2 for other four models the performances are similar in terms of spatial and statistical distributions therefore some quantitative metrics for measuring the model performances are further necessary fig 10 shows the roc curves and the metric values of auc oa and f1 score of six models lightgbm c model is found to be the best model achieving the highest model performance based on four different metrics oa 0 770 f1 score 0 667 auc 0 921 the auc value of this model is even greater than 0 9 excellent model which significantly outperformed most studies of groundwater potential prediction thanh et al 2022 in contrast the rf model shows the lowest performance in this study oa 0 654 f1 score 0 4 auc 0 757 while also performing better than many previous works thanh et al 2022 the results have also been supported by spatial distribution and statistical distribution table 4 in addition the performances of the xgboost c model oa 0 692 f1 score 0 52 auc 0 890 and the xgboost model oa 0 679 f1 score 0 468 auc 0 886 are also relatively high this result supports that of sachdeva and kumar 2021 avand et al 2020 and naghibi et al 2016 who demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble boosting in boosting gpm models xgboost and lightgbm are presently newer methods in gpm although they have been flourished in various fields recently rasool et al 2022 compared the model performance of xgboost ann rf svm knn and nb methods in gpm and reported that xgboost is the best model among them with an auc of 0 983 our study further demonstrated that lightgbm model can be more effective and efficient than xgboost model in gpm additionally the climate factors contribute significantly to improved model performance for lightgbm auc increase 0 073 oa increase 0 025 f1 score increase 0 052 and rf auc increase 0 073 oa increase 0 051 f1 score increase 0 149 in contrast the climate factors tend to have little effect on the performance of the xgboost model and xgboost c model that is the three ensemble learning models displayed varying sensitivity to climate factors consequently when accurate climate data are available the lightgbm model may be the most appropriate method for assessing groundwater potential 4 3 importance identification of groundwater conditional factors ensemble models are able to provide the information regarding factor importance which quantify the contributions of each feature for a better classification during the model process fig 11 illustrates the importance of individual groundwater conditional factors in each of the six separate models furthermore the boxplots depict the distribution of the top 5 important conditional factors for groundwater potential classification derived from the classification of 4 972 295 pixels in the study area ranging from very low to very high groundwater potential it is found that all the climate factors including pre eva and gst play a significant role in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models which represents the significant importance of climate factors in gmp in arid and semi arid areas among a total of 23 factors eva is the most important conditional factor in both rf c and xgboost c models and ranks fifth in lightgbm model meanwhile according to fig 12 areas with low evaporation tend to have higher groundwater potential and with the increase of evaporation the groundwater potential will gradually decrease this view was also pointed out by the recent research of wang et al 2022 they selected a typical arid region qaidam basin china as study area and conducted the assessment of groundwater potential by rf dnn and cnn similar as this study eva is also an important factor and ranked second based on factor importance analysis it is not surprising because compared to other study areas the arid regions often have the site properties of rare precipitation high evaporation and sufficient solar radiation these properties are supposed to consider in the model construction pre is also a very important conditional factor in gpm ranking 3rd 4th and 1st in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models respectively pre is a significant water source in arid and semi arid areas because it is a significant source for groundwater which contributes to a large amount of groundwater by infiltration process pre especially the average annual rainfall has been widely used for gpm in arid and semi arid areas arabameri et al 2020 namous et al 2021 wang et al 2022 some studies however such as arabameri et al 2021 nhu et al 2020 naghibi et al 2017a golkarian et al 2018 and rahmati et al 2016 about gpm in arid and semiarid areas do not consider pre as a conditional factor thus incorporating pre into the modeling process could potentially enhance prediction accuracy the importance of gst is relatively high in three models ranking 2nd 5th and 6th in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models respectively it is opposite for the relationships between the groundwater potentials and gst see fig 12 as shown in section 3 1 2 2 the lower gst in an area tends to represent higher groundwater potential because of the cooling effects of shallow groundwater however in this study high gst often occurs in the areas with high groundwater potentials this is mainly because the ensemble learning models or other machine learning models only consider the higher model performance but ignore the objective impacts of factors in this study the difference in gst is mainly due to the latitude and it is very common that the gst in the southern regions is higher than that in the northern regions not considering the western mountains for rf xgboost and lightgbm models the most important conditional factors assessed by these models are am ev and dd respectively fig 11 to perform a comprehensive analysis of the importance of groundwater conditional factors the feature importance value of each model was converted into a percentage and a cumulative factor importance figure was generated the top five important factors in two model groups were highlighted fig 13 when climate factors were considered the top five cumulative important factors were eva 28 14 pre 27 78 ndvi 25 43 gwd 23 40 and gst 23 34 if the climate factors were not involved in modelling process the cumulative important factors changed into ev 35 22 dd 35 17 ndvi 28 06 gwd 25 77 and plc 24 19 these factors should be fully considered in the study of groundwater potential prediction fig 12 shows that the relationship between all conditional factors and groundwater potential is consistent with the mechanistic description in section 3 1 2 except for gst and ndvi the reason why gst is opposite to the mechanism has been explained above for ndvi many studies have demonstrated that the higher ndvi suggests an association with shallow groundwater depth chen et al 2019b luo et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 however it may change in arid and semi arid regions aguilar et al 2012 pointed out there is a strong linear relationship between mean ndvi and groundwater levels in dry periods but the relations are much weaker in wet periods 4 4 limitation and future research this paper demonstrates the innovative use of the lightgbm model for predicting groundwater potential which exhibits impressive performance in gpm however the use of boosting ensemble algorithms in gpm is not yet fully explored therefore it is suggested to further explore ensemble learning methods especially boosting algorithms to enhance the model s performance in groundwater potential prediction the prediction of groundwater potential in this study was achieved through six customized models derived from three tree based ensemble algorithms during the training process decision trees were constructed by resampling groundwater condition features at varying degrees allowing the prediction process to consider the sensitivity of these features and ultimately improve prediction accuracy haddouchi and berrado 2022 in detail the lightgbm based and xgboost based models utilize hyperparameters such as feature fraction and colsample bytree to control the proportion of sampling features ke et al 2017b li et al 2022 the tpe algorithm was then used to optimize these hyperparameters undergoing a 1000 round search in the parameter space and selecting the set of hyperparameters resulting in the minimum loss for groundwater potential prediction the ensemble tree based algorithm also improves interpretability by identifying the importance of groundwater conditional features during the gpm in summary this approach offers a reliable and accurate method of predicting groundwater potential while also providing valuable insights into the underlying data dietterich 2000b lopez et al 2013 as a result the cumulative importance results fig 13 support that the three ensemble models which took climate factors into consideration displayed a notable sensitivity to pre 27 78 eva 28 14 and gst 23 34 however during the learning process all the three models were found to have attributed high groundwater potential to high gst which contradicts the actual relationship between groundwater potential and gst based on the results gst is not a suitable climate factor but pre and eva are highly recommended climate factors for gpm in arid and semi arid areas when climate parameters are not considered dd 35 17 ev 35 22 ndvi 28 06 and gwd 25 77 are important groundwater conditional factors for gpm in arid region fig 13 to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the ensemble algorithm it is recommended to conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis for large sample sizes local sensitivity analysis methods that employ sampling techniques are preferred in contrast when dealing with smaller sample sizes global sensitivity analysis using gradients may be more appropriate by quantifying the degree of influence of each parameter on the output results these methods can help researchers gain valuable insights into the model s behavior cortez and embrechts 2013 incorporating these advanced techniques can help improve the accuracy and reliability of the model making it more suitable for a range of applications overall the information provided by these ensemble algorithms fully demonstrates the importance of climate factors on the prediction of gpm in arid and semi arid areas however there is not sufficient attention to the climate factors in the assessment of groundwater potential currently thanh et al 2022 recorded the parameter frequency of 91 articles in gpm and they found that the selection of eva and gst are very limited based on the findings of this study it is strongly recommended that climate factors be carefully considered in future gpm studies especially in arid regions in arid basins the hydrologic equilibrium equation typically includes precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration and surface runoff terms evapotranspiration which encompasses both evaporation and transpiration is a critical climate parameter that significantly impacts regional hydrological characteristics and the formation of water resources obiefuna and eslamian 2019 accurate measurement of evapotranspiration data is therefore essential for reliable estimates of groundwater potential due to limited data availability this study utilized 1 km 1 km precision raster data for climate factors such as pre and eva that cover the entire china for the year 2020 these data were obtained through interpolation by the resdc using daily data collected from a network of 2400 meteorological stations across the country as a result the preliminary estimates of groundwater potential obtained from this study are applicable to large scale arid basins but the study is limited by the lack of more accuracy data moreover climate factors are not limited to these but also

such as precipitation evaporation etc usually exhibit distinct interannual variability e g fig 2 it is meaningful to compare the results of gpm based on different climate parameter inputs in the study area by setting a time interval the selection of climate factors in this study comes from the site properties in the arid regions as this study rare precipitation high evaporation and sufficient solar radiation are significant site characteristics and this is why naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 and gomez escalonilla et al 2022 highlighted the site properties influence on model performance for many times based on the findings of this study it is recommended that greater emphasis should be placed on considering local actual properties when selecting factors for predicting groundwater potential instead of solely relying on commonly used factors from existing literature 5 conclusion in this study the yinchuan plain was selected as the study area for the assessment of groundwater potential notably the study applied three ensemble models rf xgboost and lightgbm and three climate factors pre eva and gst in the modelling process resulting in several interesting findings lightgbm c model is the best model and obtained the highest model performance the auc value of this model is even greater than 0 9 excellent model which significantly outperformed most studies of groundwater potential prediction the three ensemble learning models presented different sensitivity for climate factors the sensitivity of the rf model and lightgbm to climate factors is high while xgboost is relatively low therefore lightgbm model may be the most appropriate method for groundwater potential prediction when the accurate climate data are available however if the climate data are unavailable or inaccurate the performances of xgboost model and lightgbm are all acceptable based on factor importance analysis the climate factors particularly in eva and pre are very important in three models for gpm gst also ranks fairly high in the parameter importance analysis it fully and clearly reflects the importance of climate factors in groundwater potential prediction in arid regions however gst it is not a recommended climate factor because ensemble learning models or other machine learning models only consider the higher model performance but ignore the objective impacts of factors on performance in this study high gst exists in the areas with high groundwater potentials which is inconsistent with the facts additionally the importance of gwd dd and ndvi are also very high in three models therefore the factors of pre eva gwd ndvi and dd should be fully considered in the study of groundwater potential prediction in the arid or semi arid regions for the future research this study suggests on the one hand further exploring the ensemble learning methods especially for the application of boosting algorithm in groundwater potential prediction to improve the performance of models on the other hand more climate related factors should be effectively integrated into the models for better prediction results last but not least it is recommended to select factors for predicting groundwater potential based on local actual properties rather than by selecting common factors from existing literature credit authorship contribution statement xu guo conceptualization methodology

potential mapping gpm provides the valuable information on groundwater volume that can be withdrawn from the aquifer without affecting the environmental conditions in this study gpm was innovatively explored by including three typical climate factors precipitation pre evaporation eva and ground surface temperature gst and by taking into consideration a total of 23 conditional groundwater factors during the model construction three ensemble learning models are used for the modeling process random forest rf xgboost and lightgbm the study was conducted in the southern regions of yinchuan plain which is known for its temperate continental climate with low precipitation and high evaporation it was found that all six adopted models i e rf c xgboost c lightgbm c rf xgboost lightgbm made

with high groundwater potential 22 wells 0 0152 per km2 while fewer non productive wells are found 3 wells 0 0021 per km2 the performance of lightgbm c and rf c models has been notably enhanced by climate factors auc 0 073 oa 0 025 f1 score 0 052 for lightgbm and auc 0 073 oa 0 051 f1 score 0 149 for rf the further cumulative importance results indicate that the three ensemble models which considered climate factors demonstrated a substantial sensitivity to pre 27 78 eva 28 14 and gst 23 34 in arid and semi arid regions pre and eva are highly recommended factors for gpm while dd 35 17 ev 35 22 ndvi 28 06 and gwd 25 77 are also confirmed to be important when climate factors are not taken into account keywords groundwater potential climate factors lightgbm ensemble learning yinchuan plain arid region hydroinformatics data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water consumption has significantly increased owing to population growth socio economic demands urban expansion agricultural enterprise and industrial activities in recent years pham et al 2019 serele et al 2020 zahedi et al 2017 meanwhile as the widespread droughts and seawater intrusion caused by climate change have become more severe or intense water scarcity has exacerbated and attracted global attention xiong et al 2022 under this condition groundwater exploitation overcomes the basic water shortage and improves the levels of water service particularly in arid and semi arid areas cavalcante et al 2019 madramootoo 2012 seeboonruang 2016 due to its high quality large quantity and more extensive availability in comparison to surface water ouedraogo et al 2019 however the extensive and unsustainable groundwater exploitation may lead to a series of water crises and environmental issues including land subsidence rajabi 2018 ground fissures wang and fei 2014 water imbalance taheri et al 2016 groundwater level decline wang et al 2018 groundwater salinity mancuso et al 2020 and ecological degradation mencio and mas pla 2010 therefore the view of sustainable groundwater exploitation and use has reached a global consensus to reduce the effects of over exploitation abrishamchi et al 2020 afshar et al 2020 liu et al 2022 saqr et al 2021 groundwater potential mapping gpm is one of the most effective ways to eliminate the effects of intensive groundwater exploitation based on different groundwater conditional parameters involving the aspects of geology topography hydrology climate land cover and aquifer characteristics phong et al 2021 termeh et al 2019 thanh et al 2022 it is also the initial and important stage for further investigation leading to sustainable groundwater exploitation and effective groundwater management pathak et al 2021 during recent years remote sensing rs and geographic information system gis have become faster easier and more powerful tools for gpm which overcame the difficulties e g costly time consuming uneconomic and unproductive of traditional methods such as hydrological tests drillings and ground surveys amade et al 2018 ganapuram et al 2009 termeh et al 2019 model technologies for gpm can be classified into 1 knowledge based models such as analytical hierarchy process ahp kaur et al 2020 2 common statistical models including weight of evidence woe lee et al 2012 frequency ratio fr abd manap et al 2014 influencing factor if das 2019 evidential belief function ebf nampak et al 2014 and entropy based analysis rahmati et al 2016 and 3 machine learning models such as logistic regression lr zandi et al 2016 random forest rf zabihi et al 2016b support vector regression svr fadhillah et al 2021 artificial neural network ann linear discriminant analysis lda chen et al 2019c and decision tree dt duan et al 2016 etc in most cases the statistical and machine learning models perform well in gpm because they enable to overcome the biases caused by expert knowledge naghibi et al 2017b pham et al 2019 however some drawbacks of these models cannot be ignored on the one hand some machine learning models such as ann and lr models show the issues of opacity in network analysis and sensitivity of outlier values in regression analysis rahmati et al 2016 on the other hand some biases may occur because of compulsory statistical assumptions in some bivariate e g fr and multivariate models e g lr tehrany et al 2013 termeh et al 2019 therefore a vast of literature pointed out that ensemble machine learning models should be increasingly used in gwp studies phong et al 2021 thanh et al 2022 the ensemble learning model e g bagging boosting and stacking is a technique that enable to combine multiple learning algorithms for the improvement of model performance which effectively overcomes the issues of sensitivity of outliers errors caused by insufficient data and compulsory statistical assumptions in the learning process dietterich 2000a opitz and maclin 1999 also this group of methods can address the black box limitations of some network analyses by assessing the relative importance of gpm parameters rahmati et al 2016 currently some researchers have made great contributions to the application of ensemble models in gpm and continuously optimizing the basic ensemble models for example sachdeva and kumar 2021 found that the gradient boosted decision tree gbdt model outperformed the conventional rf model in drought prone areas in india arabameri et al 2021 applied three algorithms nbtree cart and mlp to the random subspace method and found the significant improvement in model performance than benchmark methods likewise avand et al 2020 applied different ensemble algorithms including bagging adaboost and multi boosting into best first tree bftree models and reported higher model performance than benchmark methods as well in yasuj dena area iran rasool et al 2022 reported that extreme gradient boosting xgboost is the best model among 6 different machine learning models ann rf xgboost support vector machine naïve bayes k nearest neighbor these pioneering studies compared different ensemble learning models and demonstrated the effectiveness of these models for gpm however the use of boosting algorithms e g xgboost and lightgbm has not been fully explored in the field of gpm in fact xgboost and lightgbm are presently newer methods in gpm they have been flourished in various fields such as landslide susceptibility ye et al 2022 flood susceptibility saber et al 2021 groundwater vulnerability barzegar et al 2021 prediction of rock geological conditions yin et al 2022 and groundwater dynamics jing et al 2022 however for the field of gpm the use of these models is very limited and it is a fact that there is still great potential for research on the boosting algorithms for higher model performance in gpm groundwater plays a significant role in overcoming water shortages and improving regional water services particularly in the arid and semi arid regions cavalcante et al 2019 madramootoo 2012 it should be noted that these areas are normally characterized by rare precipitation high evaporation as well as sufficient solar radiation and large daily temperature difference however these climate conditions except for precipitation have not been widely applied in gpm models naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 and gomez escalonilla et al 2022 pointed out the study area characteristics may significantly influence the variable importance which means that the climate factors should be considered under the arid or semi arid conditions recently wang et al 2022 applied evaporation as a parameter to conduct the research of gpm and they found that evaporation is very important parameter for gpm in arid areas although this parameter was not used in the previous research based on site characteristics benjmel et al 2022 considered land surface temperature as a parameter in the arid areas for gpm and obtained a reasonable prediction result in spite of this the two studies did not primarily focus on the effects of climate factors and they each considered a specific climate factor currently limited studies considered the groundwater conditional factors related to climate such as precipitation evaporation and surface temperature in the arid or semi arid regions which may significantly affect the accuracy of gpm the southern regions of yinchuan plain have been selected as the study area for this research this area is characterized by a typical temperate continental climate with infrequent precipitation and high evaporation as previously reported in the literature li et al 2021 wang et al 2021b in this area the water shortage is a severe issue because of the large quantity of irrigation and the reduction of water transfer from the yellow river and groundwater has gradually become an important supply of water resources in this area wei and hui 2011 at present the research on groundwater in yinchuan plain are primarily focused on hydro chemical characteristics qian and li 2011 pollution distribution han et al 2013 he et al 2022 liu et al 2019 vulnerability qian et al 2012 groundwater level forecasting yin and zhang 2021 as well as contamination risk assessment li et al 2020 however there is a lack of research from the gpm perspective in yinchuan plain under the increasing water pressure the accurate gpm in yinchuan plain is not only important for the subsequent regional sustainable groundwater extraction groundwater management the mitigation of water crisis and the improvement of water service but also provides valuable information on gpm in arid or semi arid regions at the global scale the purpose of this study is to conduct gpm in the southern regions of yinchuan plain by three ensemble learning methods taking three main climate factors i e precipitation evaporation and ground surface temperature into account a total of 23 factors from aspects of hydrology climate land use topography and geology were used to design six different models namely rf c xgboost c lightgbm c rf xgboost and lightgbm in this study the first three models considered the climate factors while the last three models removed the climate factors three specific objectives are included in this study including 1 find out the optimal model among six different ensemble learning models and combinations of climate factors for gpm in the study area 2 discuss the importance of the three climate factors in the study area during gpm and further provide the insights of factor selection for gpm in the arid or semi arid regions 3 propose the suggestions and future research of gpm in the arid or semi arid regions 2 study area the yinchuan plain situated in the northern ningxia hui autonomous region of china was chosen as the study area with a specific focus on its southern region due to the availability of well data its longitude ranges from 37 45 40 n to 38 49 10 n and its latitude is from 105 51 47 to 106 35 46 e fig 1 covering approximately 4434 34 km2 the study area is characterized by temperate continental arid climate with rare precipitation and high evaporation as well as sufficient solar radiation and large daily temperature range qian et al 2012 the yinchuan meteorological station serves as a typical representative for projecting recent climate changes in the study area fig 2 from 2012 to 2020 the average annual precipitation amounted to approximately 229 6 mm exhibiting significant seasonal variability notably the majority of precipitation in study area occurs during june to september accounting for 72 71 of the total annual precipitation meanwhile the average annual evaporation reached 1322 8 mm the yellow river is the trunk river in the study area flows from qingtongxia city to northeast of yinchuan city across the study area which provided the majority of irrigation water resources for development fan et al 2022 the general terrain characteristic of study area is flat and slightly slopes from west to northeast the landform presents the composition of piedmont alluvium plain alluvial plain and lacustrine plain with the broad distribution of quaternary deposits alluvial deposits mainly distribute in the south of the study area where the yellow river flows into from the upstream to downstream the lithology gradually transferred from medium fine and silt fine sand to clay soil overall in spite of the low level of groundwater development and utilization in the study area groundwater remains a vital component of agricultural and domestic water supply systems 3 methodology the methodology adopted in this study is shown in fig 3 the procedures of the methodology include gwp database construction well classification ensemble learning model construction hyperparameter optimization model verification as well as results and discussion 3 1 dataset 3 1 1 groundwater well inventory all the 389 wells in this study are unconfined wells and the water yield data were obtained from historical records comprised of pumping wells and domestic wells survey data conducted by the gbn up to 2020 specifically the water yield data were extracted from single well of pumping out test in steady flow records of these 389 wells the yields of groundwater wells ranged from 0 m3 h to 1104 m3 h with the average yield of 40 m3 h in this study the well inventory was divided into two groups namely productive wells yield 10 m3 h and unproductive wells yield 10 m3 h the two groups of wells were assigned the values of 1 and 0 as the target classification in the ensemble models additionally 80 311 wells were applied for the training data set and the remaining 20 78 wells were used for model verification 3 1 2 groundwater conditional factors the groundwater potential was assessed by 23 factors divided into five groups these factors include hydrological climate land use topographical and geological factors from figs 4 to 7 classifications and distributions of these factors are shown the selection rationales for these factors are mainly based on the research of thanh et al 2022 and they have detailed statistics on the factors used in gpm at global scale twenty one commonly used factors including precipitation were selected for gpm in this study additionally two climate factors namely evaporation and ground surface temperature were supplemented for model construction in consideration of the arid site characteristics table 1 shows the information of 23 factors and corresponding source data type and scale resolution 3 1 2 1 hydrological factors the hydrological factors that used in this study include groundwater depth gwd topographic wetness index twi stream power index spi and drainage density dd fig 4 the gwd data 2020 7 associated with the aforementioned 389 observation wells were obtained from the nwc and were further interpolated with ordinary kriging method in gis environment to match the entire study area boundary generally the deeper groundwater depth indicates the less groundwater potential guru et al 2017 eq 1 was used for the creation of twi layer and it indicates the amount of flow accumulating in a point which may further influence the groundwater storage termeh et al 2019 spi measured the erosive power of streams and its calculation can be found in eq 2 generally a negative value of spi is more susceptible for the storage of groundwater ahmad et al 2020a additionally low dd areas are more suitable for the storage of groundwater in one hand there is a negative correlation between drainage density and infiltration rate and on the other hand the groundwater potential is often poor in the areas with high drainage density as the majority of groundwater may be lost by the form of runoff hussein et al 2017 1 twi l n a s tan β 2 spi a s tan β where a s is the catchment area β is the slope angle in degrees 3 1 2 2 climate factors three climate factors are included in this study namely ground surface temperature gst precipitation pre and evaporation eva fig 5 the cooling effects of shallow groundwater on gst has been identified by much research alkhaier et al 2012 wang et al 2021a that is the lower gst in an area tends to represent higher groundwater potential mallick et al 2015 pre is the major source of recharge which significantly affects the amount of groundwater in the water system it contributes to a large amount of water to aquifer by the infiltration process and increase the groundwater levels chotpantarat et al 2014 eva is a rare gpm factor but it cannot be ignored in arid areas because evaporation in these areas is several times or even dozens of times that of rainfall which significantly affects the storage of groundwater wang et al 2022 3 1 2 3 land use factors ndvi and lulc were selected as the land use factors for gpm in this study fig 6 lulc described the human effects e g groundwater usage and abstraction on groundwater potential bagyaraj et al 2019 waikar and nilawar 2014 specifically the urbanization of and agricultural activities may increase the abstraction of groundwater while the groundwater in some natural landscapes e g forests and water bodies may slightly influenced by human activities lamichhane and shakya 2019 odeh et al 2019 ndvi is also a parameter in groundwater potential prediction because higher ndvi value normally indicates the higher possibility of groundwater nampak et al 2014 in this study the data of ndvi and lulc were obtained from resdc and from glc chen et al 2019a respectively 3 1 2 4 topographical factors this study selected 9 topographical factors for gpm namely elevation ev slope s aspect asp profile curvature pfc plan curvature plc sediment transport index sti terrain ruggedness index tri topographic position index tpi and slope length sl fig 7 these factors were all derived from the spatial transformations of dem data a gentle slope allows more time for rainwater infiltration magesh et al 2012 and the aspect is a function of rainfall direction air moisture wind direction plant growth and snow melting naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 which significantly impacts the groundwater potential the curvature of topography can be concave or convex which determines the flow acceleration or deceleration pfc and convergence or divergence plc ahmad et al 2020b chen et al 2018 sti presents the erosive processes caused by runoff with the consideration of transport capacity which further affects the infiltration and recharge conforti et al 2011 nguyen et al 2020 in this study sti was calculated by eq 3 tri enables to assess the landscape heterogeneity by summing the mean difference between the center and surrounding of cells see eq 4 the lower tri value normally represents higher groundwater potential panahi et al 2020 the values of tpi indicate higher or lower elevations compared to surroundings see eq 5 and lower tpi means the flatter ground surface which is beneficial for water infiltration arulbalaji et al 2019 sl is the combination of slope steepness and slope length which is to indicate the soil loss possibility from the perspective of slope properties das et al 2022 zabihi et al 2016a 3 sti a s 22 13 0 6 s i n β 0 0896 1 3 where a s is the specific catchment area β is the slope angle in degrees 4 tri i 1 8 e e i 8 5 tpi e i 1 8 e i 8 where e is the elevation value of the center point e i is the surrounding elevation value 3 1 2 5 geological factors five geological factors including soil geomorphology gm lineament density ld aquifer media am and vadose zone media vz are included in this study fig 8 soil plays a very significant role in gpm because it influences the amount of recharge by infiltration chen et al 2018 gm is a widely used groundwater potential indicator that provides information on landform characteristics with changes in temperature water movement freezing and chemical reactions arulbalaji et al 2019 higher ld indicates more groundwater potential because lineaments are often the representations of secondary porosity and permeability yeh et al 2016 am and vz describe the lithology of the aquifer and vadose zone which determines the groundwater storage and infiltration capacity in the water cycle guo et al 2023 thus influencing the potential of groundwater in an area 3 2 modelling process 3 2 1 random forest rf model is a non parametric ensemble learning model that combined many decision trees breiman 2001 it has been preferred for a wide range of regression classification and feature selection tasks because of rapid processing high model performance and easy parameter optimization procedures sahin et al 2020 during the modelling a variety of trees are developed by different data subsets and each decision tree in trained by use of bootstrap strategy specifically the training dataset is initially split into two parts as training samples in bag 2 3 data and validation samples out of bag 1 3 data the bootstrap strategy enables effectively assess the predictive ability of generated model by decreasing the prediction variance for a smaller model error baker et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 kavzoglu and teke 2022 the detailed descriptions of rf and its application in gpm can be found in the vast literature choubin and rahmati 2021 naghibi et al 2017a rahmati et al 2016 3 2 2 xgboost xgboost is a scalable supervised gradient boosting algorithm which has been widely used to achieve state of the art results on many learning challenges it combined a set of weak tree learner in parallel to a stronger learner for the increase of computational efficiency over the conventional boosting algorithm chen and guestrin 2016 a second order taylor expansion is introduced in xgboost which increases the accuracy and enables loss functions to be customized via gradient descent it adds the complexity of the tree model to the regularization term in order to prevent overfitting and as a result performs better in generalization jing et al 2022 specifically shrinkage is used to decrease the influence of individual trees for bias elimination and the column introduces the randomization into the model to reduce the variance compared to traditional boosting methods li et al 2022 the core design of xgboost is to minimize the following objective function eq 6 6 l t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 f t x i ω f t where l is the loss function for the minimization of errors t is the number of iterations ω f t is the additional regularization term for the control of model complexity and over fitting y i is the observed value y i is the predicted value that was calculated by eq 7 7 f k γ t 1 2 λ ω 2 where γ and λ are the parameters of regularization ω represents the scores of every leaf t is the leaves number of the tree more detailed descriptions and explanations of xgboost can be found in chen and guestrin 2016 3 2 3 lightgbm lightgbm was introduced by ke et al 2017a and was a novel gradient boosting decision tree gbdt for addressing the issue in case of large data size and high feature dimension zhang et al 2022 it involved the process of gradient based one side sampling goss and exclusive feature bunding efb to help training without losing model accuracy and performance ma et al 2018 with goss algorithm a large proportion of data cases with small gradients are excluded and the remaining data instances are used only to estimate the information gain specifically the top a 100 instances with the larger gradients are firstly assigned to a subset a then for the remaining set a c consisting 1 a 100 instances with smaller gradients a new subset b is built by random sampling with size b a c finally the variance gain v j d can be applied to split data instances as is expressed as eq 8 8 v j d 1 n x i a l g i 1 a b x i b i g i 2 n l j d x i a r g i 1 a b x i b r g i 2 n r j d where n l j d and n r j d are the number of nodes for left and right respectively 1 a b is the coefficient for gradient normalization a l and a r are subsets of subset a b i and b r are subsets of subset b efb enables to reduce the number of features by bunding mutually exclusive features in a sparse feature space thereby improving the model performance and computing efficiency li et al 2022 additionally a leafwise tree growth strategy is used for the improvement of model performance and avoidance of overfitting more detailed descriptions and explanations of lightgbm can be found in ke et al 2017a 3 2 4 tree structured parzen estimator approach tpe despite the advantages and superiority of the ensemble models over other learning algorithms the hyperparameters are supposed to be accurately adjusted for the optimal results for the three models tpe algorithm is used to find the optimization quantization hyperparameters that is able to achieve the expected accuracy by an iterative process bergstra et al 2011 hyperparameter optimization including grid random and bayesian research plays a significant role in machine learning models for the improvement of model performance and optimization efficiency which overcome the time consuming issue of conventional trial and error optimization sameen et al 2019 bayesian optimization is a function to find the minimization of the objective function and hyperopt is a python library for bayesian optimization that implements sequential model based optimization smbo by using tpe rong et al 2021 in this study the 1 auc score was defined as the loss for the objective function with iteration times uniformly set at 1000 the optimal parameters were selected when the minimum value of the loss was obtained during 1000 iterations table 2 presents the hyperparameters and parameter space chosen for the three models further details and explanations of tpe can be found in bergstra et al 2011 3 2 5 model verification model verification is a substantial step for model comparison and optimal prediction analysis arabameri et al 2021 in this study overall accuracy oa f1 score and receiver operating characteristic roc curve were used for model verification a confusion matrix enables to define four judgments namely true positive tp false positive fp true negative tn and false negative fn oa and f1 scores are calculated by eq 9 and eq 10 and the roc curve is created by plotting tpr sensitivity and fpr 1 specificity into the coordinate system respectively the calculations of tpr and fpr are shown in eq 11 and eq 12 9 oa tp t n tp t n f p f n 10 f 1 s c o r e 2 t p 2 t p f p f n 11 tpr tp tp f n 12 fpr fp tn f p the area under the roc curve auc is able to measure the quality of the prediction models and a higher auc value indicates a better model rahmati et al 2016 4 results and discussion 4 1 groundwater potential maps for six ensemble learning models the optimal values of hyperparameters are different table 3 displays the results of hyperparameters optimized by tpe under these conditions six groundwater potential maps can be obtained with a predicted probability value fig 9 a to 8f show the groundwater potential maps of the rf c model xgboost c model lightgbm c model rf model xgboost model and lightgbm model respectively the results are presented in the form of theoretical probability ranging from 0 to 1 the verification wells including both productive red points and non productive wells black points were added on the maps for the future sustainable groundwater abstraction and management the study area was classified into five sub regions by natural breakpoint method namely very low low moderate high and very high groundwater potential areas it was found that the six models regardless of the selection of models and climate factors or not can generally make reasonable predictions for groundwater potential in the study area this is because most productive wells are located in very high and high potential areas while non productive wells are mostly in low and very low potential areas the high and very high groundwater potential areas are basically concentrated in the southwest area especially where the yellow river enters the study area these areas can further carry out groundwater pumping also the groundwater potential of the western mountainous area of the study area is generally greater than that of the eastern basin and the low and very low groundwater potential areas are mainly distributed in the central and northern parts of the study area the areas of low and very low groundwater potential are not suitable for the exploitation of groundwater and it is more for the demand side of water allocation in water management by comparing the spatial distributions of six groundwater potential maps in the southern parts of the study area the groundwater potentials predicted by the rf c model xgboost c model and lightgbm c model are higher than the benchmark models this result can be well explained by the climate factors according to fig 5 the southern parts of the study area have the characteristics of higher pre lower eva and higher gst as illustrated in 3 1 2 2 high pre and low eva normally mean higher groundwater potentials also although high gst should theoretically represent lower groundwater potential it is contrary to the predicted results which shows that pre and eva are relatively more important climate conditional factors than gst the results of the rf based model indicate that the groundwater potential along the yellow river is higher than that predicted by other models especially when climate factors are absent as a result it is consistent with the am distribution medium fine sand medium coarse sand which indicates that am is of greater importance in rf based models than in other models 4 2 evaluation of three ensemble models table 4 shows the area well number and well density of each sub region in different models which indicates the statistical distributions of these maps according to table 4 lightgbm c is the best model because it predicted more productive wells 12 wells 0 0408 density and fewer non productive wells 1 well 0 0034 density in very high groundwater potential sub regions meanwhile in the very low groundwater sub regions lightgbm c also predicted more non productive wells 22 wells 0 0152 density and less productive wells 3 well 0 0021 density likewise rf model shows the lowest model performance because five productive wells and fifteen non productive wells were in very low groundwater potential sub regions respectively also there were two non productive wells in the very high groundwater potential sub regions with the density of 0 0087 per km2 for other four models the performances are similar in terms of spatial and statistical distributions therefore some quantitative metrics for measuring the model performances are further necessary fig 10 shows the roc curves and the metric values of auc oa and f1 score of six models lightgbm c model is found to be the best model achieving the highest model performance based on four different metrics oa 0 770 f1 score 0 667 auc 0 921 the auc value of this model is even greater than 0 9 excellent model which significantly outperformed most studies of groundwater potential prediction thanh et al 2022 in contrast the rf model shows the lowest performance in this study oa 0 654 f1 score 0 4 auc 0 757 while also performing better than many previous works thanh et al 2022 the results have also been supported by spatial distribution and statistical distribution table 4 in addition the performances of the xgboost c model oa 0 692 f1 score 0 52 auc 0 890 and the xgboost model oa 0 679 f1 score 0 468 auc 0 886 are also relatively high this result supports that of sachdeva and kumar 2021 avand et al 2020 and naghibi et al 2016 who demonstrated the effectiveness of ensemble boosting in boosting gpm models xgboost and lightgbm are presently newer methods in gpm although they have been flourished in various fields recently rasool et al 2022 compared the model performance of xgboost ann rf svm knn and nb methods in gpm and reported that xgboost is the best model among them with an auc of 0 983 our study further demonstrated that lightgbm model can be more effective and efficient than xgboost model in gpm additionally the climate factors contribute significantly to improved model performance for lightgbm auc increase 0 073 oa increase 0 025 f1 score increase 0 052 and rf auc increase 0 073 oa increase 0 051 f1 score increase 0 149 in contrast the climate factors tend to have little effect on the performance of the xgboost model and xgboost c model that is the three ensemble learning models displayed varying sensitivity to climate factors consequently when accurate climate data are available the lightgbm model may be the most appropriate method for assessing groundwater potential 4 3 importance identification of groundwater conditional factors ensemble models are able to provide the information regarding factor importance which quantify the contributions of each feature for a better classification during the model process fig 11 illustrates the importance of individual groundwater conditional factors in each of the six separate models furthermore the boxplots depict the distribution of the top 5 important conditional factors for groundwater potential classification derived from the classification of 4 972 295 pixels in the study area ranging from very low to very high groundwater potential it is found that all the climate factors including pre eva and gst play a significant role in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models which represents the significant importance of climate factors in gmp in arid and semi arid areas among a total of 23 factors eva is the most important conditional factor in both rf c and xgboost c models and ranks fifth in lightgbm model meanwhile according to fig 12 areas with low evaporation tend to have higher groundwater potential and with the increase of evaporation the groundwater potential will gradually decrease this view was also pointed out by the recent research of wang et al 2022 they selected a typical arid region qaidam basin china as study area and conducted the assessment of groundwater potential by rf dnn and cnn similar as this study eva is also an important factor and ranked second based on factor importance analysis it is not surprising because compared to other study areas the arid regions often have the site properties of rare precipitation high evaporation and sufficient solar radiation these properties are supposed to consider in the model construction pre is also a very important conditional factor in gpm ranking 3rd 4th and 1st in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models respectively pre is a significant water source in arid and semi arid areas because it is a significant source for groundwater which contributes to a large amount of groundwater by infiltration process pre especially the average annual rainfall has been widely used for gpm in arid and semi arid areas arabameri et al 2020 namous et al 2021 wang et al 2022 some studies however such as arabameri et al 2021 nhu et al 2020 naghibi et al 2017a golkarian et al 2018 and rahmati et al 2016 about gpm in arid and semiarid areas do not consider pre as a conditional factor thus incorporating pre into the modeling process could potentially enhance prediction accuracy the importance of gst is relatively high in three models ranking 2nd 5th and 6th in rf c xgboost c and lightgbm c models respectively it is opposite for the relationships between the groundwater potentials and gst see fig 12 as shown in section 3 1 2 2 the lower gst in an area tends to represent higher groundwater potential because of the cooling effects of shallow groundwater however in this study high gst often occurs in the areas with high groundwater potentials this is mainly because the ensemble learning models or other machine learning models only consider the higher model performance but ignore the objective impacts of factors in this study the difference in gst is mainly due to the latitude and it is very common that the gst in the southern regions is higher than that in the northern regions not considering the western mountains for rf xgboost and lightgbm models the most important conditional factors assessed by these models are am ev and dd respectively fig 11 to perform a comprehensive analysis of the importance of groundwater conditional factors the feature importance value of each model was converted into a percentage and a cumulative factor importance figure was generated the top five important factors in two model groups were highlighted fig 13 when climate factors were considered the top five cumulative important factors were eva 28 14 pre 27 78 ndvi 25 43 gwd 23 40 and gst 23 34 if the climate factors were not involved in modelling process the cumulative important factors changed into ev 35 22 dd 35 17 ndvi 28 06 gwd 25 77 and plc 24 19 these factors should be fully considered in the study of groundwater potential prediction fig 12 shows that the relationship between all conditional factors and groundwater potential is consistent with the mechanistic description in section 3 1 2 except for gst and ndvi the reason why gst is opposite to the mechanism has been explained above for ndvi many studies have demonstrated that the higher ndvi suggests an association with shallow groundwater depth chen et al 2019b luo et al 2020 mandal et al 2021 however it may change in arid and semi arid regions aguilar et al 2012 pointed out there is a strong linear relationship between mean ndvi and groundwater levels in dry periods but the relations are much weaker in wet periods 4 4 limitation and future research this paper demonstrates the innovative use of the lightgbm model for predicting groundwater potential which exhibits impressive performance in gpm however the use of boosting ensemble algorithms in gpm is not yet fully explored therefore it is suggested to further explore ensemble learning methods especially boosting algorithms to enhance the model s performance in groundwater potential prediction the prediction of groundwater potential in this study was achieved through six customized models derived from three tree based ensemble algorithms during the training process decision trees were constructed by resampling groundwater condition features at varying degrees allowing the prediction process to consider the sensitivity of these features and ultimately improve prediction accuracy haddouchi and berrado 2022 in detail the lightgbm based and xgboost based models utilize hyperparameters such as feature fraction and colsample bytree to control the proportion of sampling features ke et al 2017b li et al 2022 the tpe algorithm was then used to optimize these hyperparameters undergoing a 1000 round search in the parameter space and selecting the set of hyperparameters resulting in the minimum loss for groundwater potential prediction the ensemble tree based algorithm also improves interpretability by identifying the importance of groundwater conditional features during the gpm in summary this approach offers a reliable and accurate method of predicting groundwater potential while also providing valuable insights into the underlying data dietterich 2000b lopez et al 2013 as a result the cumulative importance results fig 13 support that the three ensemble models which took climate factors into consideration displayed a notable sensitivity to pre 27 78 eva 28 14 and gst 23 34 however during the learning process all the three models were found to have attributed high groundwater potential to high gst which contradicts the actual relationship between groundwater potential and gst based on the results gst is not a suitable climate factor but pre and eva are highly recommended climate factors for gpm in arid and semi arid areas when climate parameters are not considered dd 35 17 ev 35 22 ndvi 28 06 and gwd 25 77 are important groundwater conditional factors for gpm in arid region fig 13 to gain a deeper understanding of the behavior of the ensemble algorithm it is recommended to conduct a thorough sensitivity analysis for large sample sizes local sensitivity analysis methods that employ sampling techniques are preferred in contrast when dealing with smaller sample sizes global sensitivity analysis using gradients may be more appropriate by quantifying the degree of influence of each parameter on the output results these methods can help researchers gain valuable insights into the model s behavior cortez and embrechts 2013 incorporating these advanced techniques can help improve the accuracy and reliability of the model making it more suitable for a range of applications overall the information provided by these ensemble algorithms fully demonstrates the importance of climate factors on the prediction of gpm in arid and semi arid areas however there is not sufficient attention to the climate factors in the assessment of groundwater potential currently thanh et al 2022 recorded the parameter frequency of 91 articles in gpm and they found that the selection of eva and gst are very limited based on the findings of this study it is strongly recommended that climate factors be carefully considered in future gpm studies especially in arid regions in arid basins the hydrologic equilibrium equation typically includes precipitation evapotranspiration infiltration and surface runoff terms evapotranspiration which encompasses both evaporation and transpiration is a critical climate parameter that significantly impacts regional hydrological characteristics and the formation of water resources obiefuna and eslamian 2019 accurate measurement of evapotranspiration data is therefore essential for reliable estimates of groundwater potential due to limited data availability this study utilized 1 km 1 km precision raster data for climate factors such as pre and eva that cover the entire china for the year 2020 these data were obtained through interpolation by the resdc using daily data collected from a network of 2400 meteorological stations across the country as a result the preliminary estimates of groundwater potential obtained from this study are applicable to large scale arid basins but the study is limited by the lack of more accuracy data moreover climate factors are not limited to these but also include for example palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 bhalme and mooley drought index bmdi bhalme and mooley 1980 soil moisture deficit index smdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 effective drought index edi byun and wilhite 1999 reconnaissance drought index rdi tsakiris et al 2007 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 in the context of climate change climate parameters such as precipitation evaporation etc usually exhibit distinct interannual variability e g fig 2 it is meaningful to compare the results of gpm based on different climate parameter inputs in the study area by setting a time interval the selection of climate factors in this study comes from the site properties in the arid regions as this study rare precipitation high evaporation and sufficient solar radiation are significant site characteristics and this is why naghibi and pourghasemi 2015 and gomez escalonilla et al 2022 highlighted the site properties influence on model performance for many times based on the findings of this study it is recommended that greater emphasis should be placed on considering local actual properties when selecting factors for predicting groundwater potential instead of solely relying on commonly used factors from existing literature 5 conclusion in this study the yinchuan plain was selected as the study area for the assessment of groundwater potential notably the study applied three ensemble models rf xgboost and lightgbm and three climate factors pre eva and gst in the modelling process resulting in several interesting findings lightgbm c model is the best model and obtained the highest model performance the auc value of this model is even greater than 0 9 excellent model which significantly outperformed most studies of groundwater potential prediction the three ensemble learning models presented different sensitivity for climate factors the sensitivity of the rf model and lightgbm to climate factors is high while xgboost is relatively low therefore lightgbm model may be the most appropriate method for groundwater potential prediction when the accurate climate data are available however if the climate data are unavailable or inaccurate the performances of xgboost model and lightgbm are all acceptable based on factor importance analysis the climate factors particularly in eva and pre are very important in three models for gpm gst also ranks fairly high in the parameter importance analysis it fully and clearly reflects the importance of climate factors in groundwater potential prediction in arid regions however gst it is not a recommended climate factor because ensemble learning models or other machine learning models only consider the higher model performance but ignore the objective impacts of factors on performance in this study high gst exists in the areas with high groundwater potentials which is inconsistent with the facts additionally the importance of gwd dd and ndvi are also very high in three models therefore the factors of pre eva gwd ndvi and dd should be fully considered in the study of groundwater potential prediction in the arid or semi arid regions for the future research this study suggests on the one hand further exploring the ensemble learning methods especially for the application of boosting algorithm in groundwater potential prediction to improve the performance of models on the other hand more climate related factors should be effectively integrated into the models for better prediction results last but not least it is recommended to select factors for predicting groundwater potential based on local actual properties rather than by selecting common factors from existing literature credit authorship contribution statement xu guo conceptualization methodology

1866,optimizing urban green space landscape patterns is a key goal for improving river water quality however little is known about the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of urban green spatial patterns on river water environments this study investigated the influence of urban green space patterns on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal through exploratory regression analysis and a combination of geographically weighted regression analysis gwr and spatial interpolation the results show that 1 total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n are the leading indicators of river pollution in the study area 2 green space configuration is more crucial for improving water quality than composition and 3 gwr can effectively explain the impact of urban green space on river water quality for example landscape shape and edge indices have a great impact on ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp the more complex the shape and edge of the green space the more beneficial it is for water purification the interpretation of no3 n is complex and mainly influenced by the largest patch index lpi and landscape composition given the limited land availability in urban area the spatial configuration of urban green space should be optimized without additional land use to minimize the non point source nps pollution with the smallest possible green space area the proposed approach provides a new understanding of the interaction between spatial patterns of green space and the urban water environment and valuable information for developing green space planning policies for local sites keywords landscape metrics river water quality urban green space geographically weighted regression gwr model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization is accelerating worldwide and by 2030 urban areas are expected to increase by 1 2 million km2 which is almost three times the size of global cities in 2000 ren et al 2022 although urbanization significantly improves the socioeconomic well being of urban dwellers it can also affect a range of ecosystem services and biodiversity characteristics pickard et al 2016 river water pollution caused by accelerated urbanization is a common problem chen et al 2016 with the increase in industrialization urbanization and the continuous increase in population the water cycle has been altered oswald et al 2023 and water quality is deteriorating issakhov et al 2021 and the management of river water quality has become a global problem xu et al 2019 changes in landscape patterns based on land use cover are widely recognized as essential driving forces affecting changes in river water quality wang et al 2015 yao et al 2016 the primary forms of landscape pattern change are changes in landscape composition type and proportion and configuration patch shape and spatial layout in recent years research on the effects of landscape patterns on water quality has gained attention and landscape metrics have become essential indicators for analysis shen et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 related studies have confirmed that changes in landscape patterns affect almost all water cycle processes such as rainfall retention evaporation and infiltration hasani sangani et al 2014 and directly or indirectly affect the hydrological chemical and biological processes of river ecosystems xiao et al 2016 however there is no consistency in contemporary research regarding the relative degree of importance of landscape composition and configuration uuemaa et al 2013 li et al 2018 this is due to differences in urban planning local seasons and climates in the study areas it is imperative to provide a scientific explanation of the relationship between urban landscape patterns and river water quality to take adequate measures to prevent river water quality pollution the urban green space system is a subsystem of urban ecosystems and a stable and lasting green environment system composed of various green spaces of different types natures and scales in the city wei et al 2020 urban green spaces play a vital regulatory role in reducing water pollution mexia et al 2018 reasonable green space composition and configuration can play a positive role in alleviating river water pollution li et al 2021a b for example clément et al showed that an increase in forest space could improve water quality clément et al 2017 and previous research also confirmed that woodlands and grasslands are considered to be sink landscapes with pollutant retention functions that can reduce the negative impact of surface pollution on water quality ouyang et al 2010 however the regulation of landscape patterns of urban green spaces to reduce water pollution remains a key issue in improving river water quality the beijing hangzhou grand canal also known as the jing hang canal has a history of 2 400 years it was not only one of the most significant projects in ancient china but also the longest and largest artificial waterway in the world in recent years the hangzhou section of the canal has been seriously polluted due to increasing urbanization although significant progress has been achieved in controlling the point source pollution of industrial and domestic sewage discharged into the canal nps pollution caused by urbanization and high density population has increased rapidly lu et al 2011 peng et al 2019 furthermore urban green space considered to be one of the most critical factors in mitigating water pollution in this study the area flowing through the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and its connected river network was taken as the study area a combination of the geographically weighted regression gwr model and kriging interpolation based on spatial non smoothness conditions was used to explore the local spatial differences of green space landscape patterns on water quality the gwr is a newly developed local model used to explain local variations by incorporating spatial coordinates into traditional regression models fotheringham et al 2002 gwr captures local variations by assigning greater weights to closer observations than to farther observations based on the law of geography that is items close to each other are more likely to be related than items far apart tu 2011 pratt and chang 2012 this method can provide more detailed local information help implement more targeted and effective green space allocation strategies and provide theoretical and technical references for the optimal adjustment of green space allocation to alleviate water pollution in these areas few studies have addressed the effects of green space landscape patterns on river water quality and there is insufficient evidence to answer this question therefore it is vital to conduct further research to fill this gap the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of river nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and the spatial distribution characteristics of green space landscape patterns in the watershed 2 to determine whether green space composition or configuration is more important for water quality and 3 to determine the key green space landscape metrics and their impacts at specific locations within the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hangzhou 118 21 120 30 e 29 11 30 33 n is located on the southeastern coast of china fig 1 it is a central city in the yangtze river delta and the capital city of zhejiang province hangzhou is the southern starting point of the beijing hangzhou grand canal which runs through the urban area of hangzhou from south to north and is the river with the lowest surface water level in the main urban area of hangzhou with an average depth of 2 31 m to 4 77 m it is the central receiving water body for all types of rivers surface runoff and many tributaries in the urban area and is also the primary water body of the hangzhou region the amount of water entering the canal reaches 4 5 108 m3 per year based on local rainfall and river hydrological characteristics may july and september were considered the flood season and november january and march were considered the non flood season the total area of the hangzhou section of the canal is about 1494 km2 fig 3a the western and northern parts of the study area are suburban agricultural areas the middle part of the study area is highly urbanized and the southern part includes the famous west lake lingyin temple and xixi wetland scenic area which are characterized by low intensity of human activities and high proportion of forests the hangzhou section of the canal flows through the forest urban rural ecotone with complex landscape types human activities and discharge of regional pollutants and the canal water was once seriously polluted in recent years the canal s water quality has been greatly improved through various pollution control measures but some river sections still have difficulty meeting water quality requirements therefore managing and protecting the water environment is the key to the comprehensive management of the grand canal 2 2 water sampling and analysis in this study based on the river characteristics impact of tributaries intensity of agriculture and level of urbanization 74 monitoring sites were selected from the river network in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and rivers with clear boundaries were selected for monitoring fig 1 the monitoring points were evenly distributed in the study area and were set before reaching the downstream rivers to avoid the influence of the downstream rivers on the tributaries during sample collection they covered the total extent of the river network which represented the full spectrum of stream orders we selected the middle of the river with high flow velocity to ensure the representativeness of the samples samples were collected in the middle of the month on continuously sunny days without precipitation for three days before sampling to exclude the influence of precipitation on the actual data the samples were collected transported and stored according to the technical specifications for surface water and wastewater monitoring samples were collected from january 2021 to november 2021 for a total of six time periods at 2 month intervals to obtain water quality data we referred to the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 combined with the pollution sources of surface water of the study area and selected ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp as key water quality indicators to characterize the eutrophication of water bodies in urban area the continuous flow analyzer cfa analyzer skalar analysis b v breda netherlands was used to measure the four water quality parameters in the laboratory 2 3 classification of green space types and selection of green space metrics the object oriented classification method was applied to interpret the gf 2 images in 2021 with reference to china s current urban green space planning standards gb t51346 2019 the green spaces in the study area were divided into four categories garden green space protective green space attached green space and regional green space table 1s ecognition 9 0 was used to interpret the remote sensing image and manual visual corrections were made concerning real time google maps based on field surveys in the study area to ensure that the image matched the current stage of green space conditions in this study 18 landscape metrics were selected including 1 composition metric at the class level percentages of landscape pland and 17 configuration metrics at the class level and or landscape level number of patches np patch density pd mean patch area area mn largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi mean shape index shape mn edge density ed perimeter area fractal dimension index pafrac total edge index te area weighted mean patch fractal dimension index frac am interspersion and juxtaposition index iji contagion index contag landscape division index division aggregation index ai mean related circumscribing circle distribution circle mn mean gyration radius index gyrate mn and shannon s diversity index shdi each landscape metric was calculated using fragstats 4 2 software and their definitions and calculated equations can be found in the software user manual mcgarigal et al 2012 2 4 selection of buffer zone scales based on redundancy analysis combining the actual situation of the study area of the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou grand canal with the densely interwoven water network complex hydrological conditions and unclear basin boundaries it is challenging to determine river class and watershed boundaries landscape patterns at the buffer scale can better explain the water quality changes in the study area than at the watershed scale uriarte et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2014 we considered 74 monitoring points in the study area as the center and established circular buffer zones with different radii which were divided into 500 m 1000 m 1500 m 2000 m and 3000 m redundancy analysis of the green space landscape metrics and water quality parameters at different spatial scales was conducted to explore the scale differences in the impact of green space landscape patterns in different buffer zones on water quality the explanatory ability of green space landscape metrics to different water quality indicators were calculated to obtain the buffer zone with the best explanatory rate for subsequent analysis table 2s the overall explanation rate of river water quality by landscape pattern was low within the 500 m buffer zone and the number of landscape metrics that explained river water quality was negligible as the buffer range increased the total explanation rate gradually increased and the landscape pattern explanation rate reached a maximum of 36 at the 3 km buffer scale therefore the 3 km buffer zone was identified as the area with the most significant impact of the landscape pattern on water quality within the different buffer zones thus the 3 km circular buffer zone was selected as the spatial scale to explain the water quality in the study area 2 5 selection of optimal combinations of landscape metrics based on exploratory regression analysis exploratory regression was used to evaluate all possible combinations of candidate input explanatory variables to be further introduced into the geographically weighted regression gwr model that best explains the dependent variable based on the selected variables the optimal combinations of landscape metrics affecting river water quality were selected from 18 landscape metrics related to water quality according to the variance inflation factor vif values table 3s all the vif values of the selected metrics were 7 5 indicating no covariance problems among the selected metrics 2 6 geographically weighted regression gwr the spatial correlations between landscape metrics of urban green space and water quality indicators were analyzed using gwr the gwr is a local regression technique in the geographic location change process local regression can be performed by weighting all neighboring observations using a distance decay function which better reflects the spatial correlation and differences between the variables pratt and chang 2012 it can test complex relationships of local spatial heterogeneity which is significantly improved over commonly used global regression analysis e g ordinary least squares ols models thus gwr provides an intuitive tool for exploring spatially varying relationships and studying the strength and direction of these relationships in space cupido et al 2020 and can be expressed as y j β 0 u j v j i 1 n β i u j v j x ij ε j where j represents the location u j v j are the coordinates for each location j β 0 u j v j is the intercept for location j β i u j v j is the local regression coefficient for the independent variable x i at location j ε j is the random error term and n is the number of independent variables the gaussian function was used to determine the weight whereas the minimized corrected akaike information criterion aicc was used to determine the optimal bandwidth bandwidth is a non negative attenuation parameter describing the functional relationship between weights and distances fotheringham et al 2002 the more extensive the bandwidth the slower the weights decay with increasing distances the smaller the bandwidth the faster the weights decay with increasing distance subsequently the adjusted r2 values local coefficients local r2 values and local residuals for each regression sampling site were generated to provide a clear visualization of the spatial variations in the relationships between green space landscape patterns and water quality as well as model performance 2 7 geostatistical methods the spatial distribution maps of local coefficients and local r2 calculated by gwr were generated by kriging interpolation with the support of arcgis geostatistical analyst the step lengths were divided by 2 4 km interval 2 4 4 8 7 2 9 6 24 0 km with ten intervals since 24 0 km is less than half the maximum distance of 49 1 km between the sampling points which meets the requirements of geostatistical analysis a comparison of different models shows that the actual function change values of green space landscape metrics that impact water quality parameters fit best with the gaussian model the comprehensive flowchart of the key steps in quantifying the spatial relationship between urban green space pattern and river water quality was presented in fig 2 3 results 3 1 the characteristic of landscape pattern the landscape pattern of green space in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal is shown in fig 3 b the total area of green space was approximately 469 28 km2 accounting for 31 3 of the total area of the study area the urban green space in the study area is highly fragmented with a high pd 316 13 patches 100 ha table 4s regional green areas such as country parks wetland parks and forest parks have been an essential part of landscaping construction in the past ten years with an area of about 257 5 km2 accounting for 54 9 of the total green area in the study area the regional green space was less fragmented with a low patch density 33 03 patches 100 ha and a large mean patch area 1 66 ha table 4s the attached green space was about 137 6 km2 of various fragmented areas accounting for about 29 3 of the total green area with a high patch density 218 55 patches 100 ha and a small mean patch area 0 13 ha table 4s highly fragmented attached green space is mainly concentrated in the central city of hangzhou due to the large area of construction land and severe fragmentation of the landscape protected green space and garden green space with about 63 5 km2 and 10 7 km2 account for 13 5 and 2 3 of the total green space respectively the garden green space was small and scattered throughout the study area protective green space is evenly distributed along roads and rivers and throughout the study area in a grid pattern fig 4 shows the proportion of green space composition in different radius buffers the proportion of green space composition in different buffers varied significantly as the radius of the buffer zone increases the proportion of regional green area increased reaching 32 at the 3000 m buffer scale indicating that the proportion of extensive suburban scenic woodlands gradually increased attached green space area accounts for about 45 of the total green space area at the 3000 m buffer scale indicating that a considerable part of all types of urban land area is used for construction greening on the overall scale of the study area attached and regional green spaces were the main types of green space landscape 3 2 the spatio temporal dynamics of river water quality the descriptive statistics of the water quality parameters at the 74 monitoring sites are shown in table 1 we referred to the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 the river water quality in the study area was evaluated by the mean value the mean nh4 n concentrations in different months ranged from 0 93 mg l in september to 1 98 mg l in may and most monitoring points are in class ⅳ standard the mean tn content is very high and varied from 3 18 mg l in july to 5 45 mg l in january and 91 of the monitoring points highly exceeded the class v water quality standard 2 mg l the mean tp concentrations are relatively stable 0 14 0 23 mg l throughout the year within the class iv standard the spatial variations in the water quality parameters in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal are shown in fig 5 the tp concentrations at most of the monitoring sites were below 0 5 mg l overall the tn concentration in the study area was at a high level during the non flood season the tn concentrations in the central and western villages and towns of the study area exceeded 4 mg l most of the tn concentrations in january were higher than 6 mg l the application of high nitrogen fertilizer in the western and northern agricultural area was the main reason the nh4 n was below 2 0 mg l at most monitoring points during the flood season nh4 n concentrations were relatively high during the non flood period reaching as high as 3 0 mg l discharging domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in the main urban area is an important reason for the high nh4 n peng et al 2019 the seasonal differences in no3 n concentrations were significant and no3 n concentrations were significantly lower during the flood season than during the non flood season a f g i m r and s x shows the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n tn and tp in january march may july september and november in 2021 respectively 3 3 effects of urban green space pattern on river water quality 3 3 1 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and nh4 n the spatial changes of the local coefficients of variables for nh4 n in the gwr model are shown in fig 6 nh4 n was mainly influenced by the configuration metrics pd gyrate mn shape mn and iji during the flood season and was influenced by both the configuration iji and frac am and composition reg during the non flood period in the non flood month of march the spatial variability of the local coefficient of the landscape metrics affecting nh4 n was large with the negative correlation coefficient of iji reaching 1 44 which had an extremely significant effect on nh4 n for november there were no landscape metrics affecting the nh4 n almost all the main influencing variables of nh4 n in different months were configuration metrics except for reg in march as a composition metric fig 6 indicating that nh4 n was mainly affected by the green space configuration the spatial variations in the local r2 values for nh4 n fig 1s were similar to the spatial variations in the regression coefficients fig 6 the explanation rate for nh4 n by the landscape metrics in september was equally distributed throughout the study area local r2 spatial variations were evident in other months because no landscape metrics affecting nh4 n were present in november there was no local r2 plot 3 3 2 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and no3 n fig 7 shows the spatial changes in the local coefficients of the variables affecting the concentrations of no3 n in the gwr model the spatial heterogeneity of the impacts of the landscape metrics on no3 n was more notable during the non flood season than during the flood season the no3 n concentration was mainly influenced by lpi shdi att and gar throughout the year with local coefficients 0 5 and no obvious spatial differentiation during the flood season the effects of landscape metrics on no3 n were evenly distributed in the study area with variations of local coefficients 0 25 fig 7c e during the non flood period lpi is the primary negative influence factor and the spatial variation in january and november is considerable with local coefficients varying from 0 to 1 fig 7a f the main influencing variables for no3 n in january july and november were all configuration metrics whereas in march may and july they were combinations of composition and configuration metrics the local r2 values of no3 n spatial variation are shown in fig 2s the percentage of variation in no3 n as explained by the landscape pattern was highest in the study area in may with the local r2 reaching 0 45 other months had lower interpretation rates local r2 0 3 than may and spatial heterogeneity of local r2 was in approximate agreement with the distribution of the local coefficients the explanatory rates of no3 n were relatively stable in march may july and september with little spatial heterogeneity 3 3 3 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and tn fig 8 shows the spatial changes in the local coefficients of the variables affecting the concentrations of tn in the gwr model among the explanatory variables for tn the effect of the configuration metrics was significantly greater than that of the composition metrics which proves the importance of green space configuration for river water quality in the region the number of landscape metrics affecting tn was greater during the non flood period than during the flood period and the spatial variation of the regression coefficients was more significant during the non flood period tn was mainly influenced by gar pafrac and frac am during the flood season and by iji lsi shdi and gyrate mn during the non flood season the negative correlation effects of gyrate mn on tn decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area iji contributed in different months during the non flood period and the spatial distribution of the influence coefficient on tn was approximately consistent with the highest coefficient reaching 1 1 in january the main influencing variables for tn during most of the monitoring periods january july september and november were the configuration metrics the local r2 spatial variation characteristics of the tn model are shown in fig 3s the explanation of tn by landscape metrics was the highest in november with the local r2 reaching 0 7 local r2 also reached 0 45 0 60 in the other months except for september which had a low interpretation rate with local r2 0 15 and no significant spatial variation 3 3 4 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and tp fig 9 shows the spatial patterns of the local coefficients of the landscape variables for the tp in the gwr model the local coefficient of the landscape metrics for tp was higher during the flood season and the number of metrics used to explain tp was higher than that during the non flood season this indicates that more factors influenced the tp entering the river during the flood season than during the non flood season and the migration process was more complex during the flood season tp was mainly influenced by green space composition such as att and pro and green space configuration such as pafrac iji lsi and pd among them pafrac appeared most frequently as a water quality influencing factor in different months and the spatial heterogeneity of its influence on water quality was greater only in january and was not significant in other months configuration metrics were the main influencing variables of the tp during the non flood season and combinations of composition and configuration metrics were the main influencing variables of the tp during the flood season the spatial variation of the local r2 for tp in different months is shown in fig 4s the explanation rates of the landscape metrics did not vary significantly over time and space temporally the highest percentage of explanations 60 for tp was found in january whereas september had the lowest percentage 15 spatially the local r2 values in march september and november were equally distributed in the study area which is an indication of the low tp content in the study area and its weak relationship with the landscape metrics 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in water quality nitrogen and phosphorus are the leading indicators affecting river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and the concentrations of tn and tp were as high as 7 57 and 0 39 mg l respectively li et al 2021a b previous studies have confirmed that the leading causes of river pollution in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal are related to urban and rural domestic sewage discharge and agricultural nps pollution these are driven by rainfall sewage discharge and other related factors causing nitrogen and phosphorus to sink into the river and aggravating river water pollution peng et al 2019 therefore non point source pollution remains the leading cause of water quality pollution in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal han et al 2019 wu and lu 2019 this study shows that the western and northern parts of the study area have more severe water pollution due to the high percentage of agricultural land accounting for 40 6 of these areas which is significantly higher than the 10 9 in other parts of the study area fig 3a areas with high levels of urbanization in the central part of the study area also had significant negative impacts on water quality the gentle topography of the study area increases the river s accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus the tn concentration in areas with larger farmland was often higher than that in other areas the average fertilizer application rate of farmland in this area reached 475 kg ha whereas the utilization rate of dominant crops such as paddy rice was only 46 4 liang et al 2019 consequently the loss of nitrogen fertilizer from farmland is the primary source of river tn pollution shu et al 2022 areas with high tp and nh4 n concentrations mainly occur in urbanized areas and township centers and the rise in impervious surfaces and population density will increase the ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus loads zhang et al 2021 related studies have shown that the impact of rainfall is significantly related to water quality and the increase in surface runoff during the flood season dilutes the concentration of pollutants in river water resulting in better water quality than during the non flood season yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this study showed that there are large seasonal differences in river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and river pollution is generally higher in the non flood season than in the flood season which is consistent with the previous findings li et al 2021a b at the same time the seasonal variation in river water quality also shows considerable temporal heterogeneity because 70 of precipitation in the study area was concentrated between april and september the flood season a substantial amount of precipitation diluted the n and p effluents nutrients and other pollutants from large areas of agricultural land in the western and northern parts of the study area were washed into the water bodies causing the tn concentration in this part of the river to severely exceed the class v standard shu et al 2022 in comparison the south central part of the study area includes the west lake scenic area which has a relatively large share of green space the variation of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations was more evident in this region and was lower during the flood season than during the non flood season studies have confirmed that urban forest can reduce soil erosion and retain some of the pollutants absorbed in runoff thereby diluting water quality concentrations anderson et al 2012 kimura et al 2018 therefore the impact of rainfall on surface water quality cannot be ignored on a seasonal scale the seasonal variation of water quality in the study area with high urban greenery coverage was more significant and responsive 4 2 impact of green space landscape pattern on river water quality the influence of landscape patterns on river water quality is typically expressed as changes in the output and migration of pollutants across various landscape patches meneses et al 2015 sajikumar and remya 2015 urban green space composition and configuration are integral parts of the green space landscape pattern which can effectively predict changes in river water quality xiao et al 2016 in this study we found that iji lsi gyrate mn lpi and pafrac were important green space configuration metrics affecting river water quality whereas att and gar are significant green space composition metrics to water quality we found that the negative correlation effect of green space configuration metrics on water quality was more evident than that of composition and this relationship was not consistent in time and space which is consistent with the results of other researchers margriter et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the results of the gwr model showed that the effects of green space landscape metrics on tp nh4 n and no3 n were more robust during the flood period than during the non flood period whereas the effects of green space landscape metrics on tn were higher during the non flood season than during the flood season the iji is a crucial configuration metric related to water quality in january march july and november the spatial heterogeneity of the negative effect of iji on tn and nh4 n was almost consistent significantly impacting the western and northern agricultural regions this indicates that during the season of low precipitation improving the percentage of various types of green space in urban and rural areas can enhance forest retention and soil infiltration capacity making it more conducive to improving river water quality guo et al 2021 the negative effect of gyrate mn on tn during the non flood period was mainly concentrated in the western and southeastern parts of the study area suggesting that sizeable green space patches such as the west lake scenic area and west creek wetland significantly improved river water quality in the western and northern parts of the study area which are less urbanized enhancing the influence of dominant patches or building large forest patches can play an essential role in regulating regional water quality we found that the positive correlation effect of gyrate mn on nh4 n was mainly distributed in the urban area in the southeast so the fragmented green space patches in the urban area were not conducive to purifying nh4 n the effect of pafrac on tn and tp was pronounced with significant spatial heterogeneity of the effect on tp in january and approximately consistent with changes in the effect on tn in july mainly concentrated in the areas of extensive forest patches such as xixi wetland 11 5 km2 mid levels forest park 10 0 km2 and liangzhu village 7 5 km2 whose forest patches are large and complex our study proves that large green space patches play an essential role in mitigating river pollution thus strengthening the conservation and cultivation of woodlands and ensuring the dominant patch status of forests are crucial for improving water quality the landscape composition metrics att and gar were the main factors influencing the tn in march and may the influence intensity of att showed a significant increasing trend from north to south which was consistent with the spatial pattern of urbanization degree in the study area the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of gar on water quality was apparent with both positive and negative effects some garden green space with high pedestrian density and management intensity harms river water quality as confirmed by previous study li chi et al 2018 therefore the planning of attached urban and rural green spaces and garden green spaces should be further improved based on the effects of green spaces landscape pattern on river water quality unlike traditional global statistical methods that reflect the average of existing stationary and homogeneous relationships across space which may neglect some significant spatial characteristics and hide local variations tu 2011 gwr spatial analysis can provide more detailed local information and the region specific information can help implement more targeted and effective green space planting strategies to reduce water pollution we found that green space composition was not the most significant factor affecting water quality whereas green space configuration had a much greater impact than green space composition exploring the spatial and temporal variations of green space landscape patterns affecting river water quality and implementing effective green space configuration planning and management can significantly help mitigate river water pollution we can focus on optimizing the configuration of green space in specific areas to further mitigate water pollution rather than simply seeking sufficiently large urban areas to plant new green spaces therefore optimizing the landscape configuration of green space will help provide specific water pollution mitigation strategies for practical implementation 5 conclusion this study explored the effect of urban green space landscape patterns on the water quality of the river network in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal the results showed that tn concentration reached the inferior class v level and the tp and nh4 n concentrations were within the class ⅳ water quality standard the spatial and temporal differences in river nitrogen and phosphorus pollution were high spatially water pollution is more heavy in developed agricultural and urbanized areas temporally it is more serious during the non flood season than during the flood season the gwr can effectively explain the impact of urban green space on river water quality and the results illustrate that green space configuration is the main influencing factor compared to green space composition the configuration metrics exhibited varied relationships with different pollutants across spatial scales in different seasons the variations in nh4 n tn and tp can be well explained by configuration metrics such as iji lsi gyrate mn and pafrac the interpretation of no3 n is complex and mainly influenced by combinations of landscape configurations and compositions the results suggest that urban river water quality can be improved by optimizing the spatial configuration of green spaces without planting new green spaces this study provides key insights into the local relationship between urban green space and river water quality the results are expected to contribute to the planning and management of urban green spaces for targeted river pollution mitigation strategies in urban areas credit authorship contribution statement ziyu liu methodology investigation writing

1866,optimizing urban green space landscape patterns is a key goal for improving river water quality however little is known about the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of urban green spatial patterns on river water environments this study investigated the influence of urban green space patterns on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal through exploratory regression analysis and a combination of geographically weighted regression analysis gwr and spatial interpolation the results show that 1 total nitrogen tn and nitrate nitrogen no3 n are the leading indicators of river pollution in the study area 2 green space configuration is more crucial for improving water quality than composition and 3 gwr can effectively explain the impact of urban green space on river water quality for example landscape shape and edge indices have a great impact on ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp the more complex the shape and edge of the green space the more beneficial it is for water purification the interpretation of no3 n is complex and mainly influenced by the largest patch index lpi and landscape composition given the limited land availability in urban area the spatial configuration of urban green space should be optimized without additional land use to minimize the non point source nps pollution with the smallest possible green space area the proposed approach provides a new understanding of the interaction between spatial patterns of green space and the urban water environment and valuable information for developing green space planning policies for local sites keywords landscape metrics river water quality urban green space geographically weighted regression gwr model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction urbanization is accelerating worldwide and by 2030 urban areas are expected to increase by 1 2 million km2 which is almost three times the size of global cities in 2000 ren et al 2022 although urbanization significantly improves the socioeconomic well being of urban dwellers it can also affect a range of ecosystem services and biodiversity characteristics pickard et al 2016 river water pollution caused by accelerated urbanization is a common problem chen et al 2016 with the increase in industrialization urbanization and the continuous increase in population the water cycle has been altered oswald et al 2023 and water quality is deteriorating issakhov et al 2021 and the management of river water quality has become a global problem xu et al 2019 changes in landscape patterns based on land use cover are widely recognized as essential driving forces affecting changes in river water quality wang et al 2015 yao et al 2016 the primary forms of landscape pattern change are changes in landscape composition type and proportion and configuration patch shape and spatial layout in recent years research on the effects of landscape patterns on water quality has gained attention and landscape metrics have become essential indicators for analysis shen et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 related studies have confirmed that changes in landscape patterns affect almost all water cycle processes such as rainfall retention evaporation and infiltration hasani sangani et al 2014 and directly or indirectly affect the hydrological chemical and biological processes of river ecosystems xiao et al 2016 however there is no consistency in contemporary research regarding the relative degree of importance of landscape composition and configuration uuemaa et al 2013 li et al 2018 this is due to differences in urban planning local seasons and climates in the study areas it is imperative to provide a scientific explanation of the relationship between urban landscape patterns and river water quality to take adequate measures to prevent river water quality pollution the urban green space system is a subsystem of urban ecosystems and a stable and lasting green environment system composed of various green spaces of different types natures and scales in the city wei et al 2020 urban green spaces play a vital regulatory role in reducing water pollution mexia et al 2018 reasonable green space composition and configuration can play a positive role in alleviating river water pollution li et al 2021a b for example clément et al showed that an increase in forest space could improve water quality clément et al 2017 and previous research also confirmed that woodlands and grasslands are considered to be sink landscapes with pollutant retention functions that can reduce the negative impact of surface pollution on water quality ouyang et al 2010 however the regulation of landscape patterns of urban green spaces to reduce water pollution remains a key issue in improving river water quality the beijing hangzhou grand canal also known as the jing hang canal has a history of 2 400 years it was not only one of the most significant projects in ancient china but also the longest and largest artificial waterway in the world in recent years the hangzhou section of the canal has been seriously polluted due to increasing urbanization although significant progress has been achieved in controlling the point source pollution of industrial and domestic sewage discharged into the canal nps pollution caused by urbanization and high density population has increased rapidly lu et al 2011 peng et al 2019 furthermore urban green space considered to be one of the most critical factors in mitigating water pollution in this study the area flowing through the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and its connected river network was taken as the study area a combination of the geographically weighted regression gwr model and kriging interpolation based on spatial non smoothness conditions was used to explore the local spatial differences of green space landscape patterns on water quality the gwr is a newly developed local model used to explain local variations by incorporating spatial coordinates into traditional regression models fotheringham et al 2002 gwr captures local variations by assigning greater weights to closer observations than to farther observations based on the law of geography that is items close to each other are more likely to be related than items far apart tu 2011 pratt and chang 2012 this method can provide more detailed local information help implement more targeted and effective green space allocation strategies and provide theoretical and technical references for the optimal adjustment of green space allocation to alleviate water pollution in these areas few studies have addressed the effects of green space landscape patterns on river water quality and there is insufficient evidence to answer this question therefore it is vital to conduct further research to fill this gap the main objectives of this study are as follows 1 to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of river nitrogen and phosphorus pollution and the spatial distribution characteristics of green space landscape patterns in the watershed 2 to determine whether green space composition or configuration is more important for water quality and 3 to determine the key green space landscape metrics and their impacts at specific locations within the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hangzhou 118 21 120 30 e 29 11 30 33 n is located on the southeastern coast of china fig 1 it is a central city in the yangtze river delta and the capital city of zhejiang province hangzhou is the southern starting point of the beijing hangzhou grand canal which runs through the urban area of hangzhou from south to north and is the river with the lowest surface water level in the main urban area of hangzhou with an average depth of 2 31 m to 4 77 m it is the central receiving water body for all types of rivers surface runoff and many tributaries in the urban area and is also the primary water body of the hangzhou region the amount of water entering the canal reaches 4 5 108 m3 per year based on local rainfall and river hydrological characteristics may july and september were considered the flood season and november january and march were considered the non flood season the total area of the hangzhou section of the canal is about 1494 km2 fig 3a the western and northern parts of the study area are suburban agricultural areas the middle part of the study area is highly urbanized and the southern part includes the famous west lake lingyin temple and xixi wetland scenic area which are characterized by low intensity of human activities and high proportion of forests the hangzhou section of the canal flows through the forest urban rural ecotone with complex landscape types human activities and discharge of regional pollutants and the canal water was once seriously polluted in recent years the canal s water quality has been greatly improved through various pollution control measures but some river sections still have difficulty meeting water quality requirements therefore managing and protecting the water environment is the key to the comprehensive management of the grand canal 2 2 water sampling and analysis in this study based on the river characteristics impact of tributaries intensity of agriculture and level of urbanization 74 monitoring sites were selected from the river network in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and rivers with clear boundaries were selected for monitoring fig 1 the monitoring points were evenly distributed in the study area and were set before reaching the downstream rivers to avoid the influence of the downstream rivers on the tributaries during sample collection they covered the total extent of the river network which represented the full spectrum of stream orders we selected the middle of the river with high flow velocity to ensure the representativeness of the samples samples were collected in the middle of the month on continuously sunny days without precipitation for three days before sampling to exclude the influence of precipitation on the actual data the samples were collected transported and stored according to the technical specifications for surface water and wastewater monitoring samples were collected from january 2021 to november 2021 for a total of six time periods at 2 month intervals to obtain water quality data we referred to the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 combined with the pollution sources of surface water of the study area and selected ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp as key water quality indicators to characterize the eutrophication of water bodies in urban area the continuous flow analyzer cfa analyzer skalar analysis b v breda netherlands was used to measure the four water quality parameters in the laboratory 2 3 classification of green space types and selection of green space metrics the object oriented classification method was applied to interpret the gf 2 images in 2021 with reference to china s current urban green space planning standards gb t51346 2019 the green spaces in the study area were divided into four categories garden green space protective green space attached green space and regional green space table 1s ecognition 9 0 was used to interpret the remote sensing image and manual visual corrections were made concerning real time google maps based on field surveys in the study area to ensure that the image matched the current stage of green space conditions in this study 18 landscape metrics were selected including 1 composition metric at the class level percentages of landscape pland and 17 configuration metrics at the class level and or landscape level number of patches np patch density pd mean patch area area mn largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi mean shape index shape mn edge density ed perimeter area fractal dimension index pafrac total edge index te area weighted mean patch fractal dimension index frac am interspersion and juxtaposition index iji contagion index contag landscape division index division aggregation index ai mean related circumscribing circle distribution circle mn mean gyration radius index gyrate mn and shannon s diversity index shdi each landscape metric was calculated using fragstats 4 2 software and their definitions and calculated equations can be found in the software user manual mcgarigal et al 2012 2 4 selection of buffer zone scales based on redundancy analysis combining the actual situation of the study area of the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou grand canal with the densely interwoven water network complex hydrological conditions and unclear basin boundaries it is challenging to determine river class and watershed boundaries landscape patterns at the buffer scale can better explain the water quality changes in the study area than at the watershed scale uriarte et al 2011 mcmillan et al 2014 we considered 74 monitoring points in the study area as the center and established circular buffer zones with different radii which were divided into 500 m 1000 m 1500 m 2000 m and 3000 m redundancy analysis of the green space landscape metrics and water quality parameters at different spatial scales was conducted to explore the scale differences in the impact of green space landscape patterns in different buffer zones on water quality the explanatory ability of green space landscape metrics to different water quality indicators were calculated to obtain the buffer zone with the best explanatory rate for subsequent analysis table 2s the overall explanation rate of river water quality by landscape pattern was low within the 500 m buffer zone and the number of landscape metrics that explained river water quality was negligible as the buffer range increased the total explanation rate gradually increased and the landscape pattern explanation rate reached a maximum of 36 at the 3 km buffer scale therefore the 3 km buffer zone was identified as the area with the most significant impact of the landscape pattern on water quality within the different buffer zones thus the 3 km circular buffer zone was selected as the spatial scale to explain the water quality in the study area 2 5 selection of optimal combinations of landscape metrics based on exploratory regression analysis exploratory regression was used to evaluate all possible combinations of candidate input explanatory variables to be further introduced into the geographically weighted regression gwr model that best explains the dependent variable based on the selected variables the optimal combinations of landscape metrics affecting river water quality were selected from 18 landscape metrics related to water quality according to the variance inflation factor vif values table 3s all the vif values of the selected metrics were 7 5 indicating no covariance problems among the selected metrics 2 6 geographically weighted regression gwr the spatial correlations between landscape metrics of urban green space and water quality indicators were analyzed using gwr the gwr is a local regression technique in the geographic location change process local regression can be performed by weighting all neighboring observations using a distance decay function which better reflects the spatial correlation and differences between the variables pratt and chang 2012 it can test complex relationships of local spatial heterogeneity which is significantly improved over commonly used global regression analysis e g ordinary least squares ols models thus gwr provides an intuitive tool for exploring spatially varying relationships and studying the strength and direction of these relationships in space cupido et al 2020 and can be expressed as y j β 0 u j v j i 1 n β i u j v j x ij ε j where j represents the location u j v j are the coordinates for each location j β 0 u j v j is the intercept for location j β i u j v j is the local regression coefficient for the independent variable x i at location j ε j is the random error term and n is the number of independent variables the gaussian function was used to determine the weight whereas the minimized corrected akaike information criterion aicc was used to determine the optimal bandwidth bandwidth is a non negative attenuation parameter describing the functional relationship between weights and distances fotheringham et al 2002 the more extensive the bandwidth the slower the weights decay with increasing distances the smaller the bandwidth the faster the weights decay with increasing distance subsequently the adjusted r2 values local coefficients local r2 values and local residuals for each regression sampling site were generated to provide a clear visualization of the spatial variations in the relationships between green space landscape patterns and water quality as well as model performance 2 7 geostatistical methods the spatial distribution maps of local coefficients and local r2 calculated by gwr were generated by kriging interpolation with the support of arcgis geostatistical analyst the step lengths were divided by 2 4 km interval 2 4 4 8 7 2 9 6 24 0 km with ten intervals since 24 0 km is less than half the maximum distance of 49 1 km between the sampling points which meets the requirements of geostatistical analysis a comparison of different models shows that the actual function change values of green space landscape metrics that impact water quality parameters fit best with the gaussian model the comprehensive flowchart of the key steps in quantifying the spatial relationship between urban green space pattern and river water quality was presented in fig 2 3 results 3 1 the characteristic of landscape pattern the landscape pattern of green space in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal is shown in fig 3 b the total area of green space was approximately 469 28 km2 accounting for 31 3 of the total area of the study area the urban green space in the study area is highly fragmented with a high pd 316 13 patches 100 ha table 4s regional green areas such as country parks wetland parks and forest parks have been an essential part of landscaping construction in the past ten years with an area of about 257 5 km2 accounting for 54 9 of the total green area in the study area the regional green space was less fragmented with a low patch density 33 03 patches 100 ha and a large mean patch area 1 66 ha table 4s the attached green space was about 137 6 km2 of various fragmented areas accounting for about 29 3 of the total green area with a high patch density 218 55 patches 100 ha and a small mean patch area 0 13 ha table 4s highly fragmented attached green space is mainly concentrated in the central city of hangzhou due to the large area of construction land and severe fragmentation of the landscape protected green space and garden green space with about 63 5 km2 and 10 7 km2 account for 13 5 and 2 3 of the total green space respectively the garden green space was small and scattered throughout the study area protective green space is evenly distributed along roads and rivers and throughout the study area in a grid pattern fig 4 shows the proportion of green space composition in different radius buffers the proportion of green space composition in different buffers varied significantly as the radius of the buffer zone increases the proportion of regional green area increased reaching 32 at the 3000 m buffer scale indicating that the proportion of extensive suburban scenic woodlands gradually increased attached green space area accounts for about 45 of the total green space area at the 3000 m buffer scale indicating that a considerable part of all types of urban land area is used for construction greening on the overall scale of the study area attached and regional green spaces were the main types of green space landscape 3 2 the spatio temporal dynamics of river water quality the descriptive statistics of the water quality parameters at the 74 monitoring sites are shown in table 1 we referred to the environmental quality standard for surface water gb 3838 2002 the river water quality in the study area was evaluated by the mean value the mean nh4 n concentrations in different months ranged from 0 93 mg l in september to 1 98 mg l in may and most monitoring points are in class ⅳ standard the mean tn content is very high and varied from 3 18 mg l in july to 5 45 mg l in january and 91 of the monitoring points highly exceeded the class v water quality standard 2 mg l the mean tp concentrations are relatively stable 0 14 0 23 mg l throughout the year within the class iv standard the spatial variations in the water quality parameters in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal are shown in fig 5 the tp concentrations at most of the monitoring sites were below 0 5 mg l overall the tn concentration in the study area was at a high level during the non flood season the tn concentrations in the central and western villages and towns of the study area exceeded 4 mg l most of the tn concentrations in january were higher than 6 mg l the application of high nitrogen fertilizer in the western and northern agricultural area was the main reason the nh4 n was below 2 0 mg l at most monitoring points during the flood season nh4 n concentrations were relatively high during the non flood period reaching as high as 3 0 mg l discharging domestic sewage and industrial wastewater in the main urban area is an important reason for the high nh4 n peng et al 2019 the seasonal differences in no3 n concentrations were significant and no3 n concentrations were significantly lower during the flood season than during the non flood season a f g i m r and s x shows the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n tn and tp in january march may july september and november in 2021 respectively 3 3 effects of urban green space pattern on river water quality 3 3 1 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and nh4 n the spatial changes of the local coefficients of variables for nh4 n in the gwr model are shown in fig 6 nh4 n was mainly influenced by the configuration metrics pd gyrate mn shape mn and iji during the flood season and was influenced by both the configuration iji and frac am and composition reg during the non flood period in the non flood month of march the spatial variability of the local coefficient of the landscape metrics affecting nh4 n was large with the negative correlation coefficient of iji reaching 1 44 which had an extremely significant effect on nh4 n for november there were no landscape metrics affecting the nh4 n almost all the main influencing variables of nh4 n in different months were configuration metrics except for reg in march as a composition metric fig 6 indicating that nh4 n was mainly affected by the green space configuration the spatial variations in the local r2 values for nh4 n fig 1s were similar to the spatial variations in the regression coefficients fig 6 the explanation rate for nh4 n by the landscape metrics in september was equally distributed throughout the study area local r2 spatial variations were evident in other months because no landscape metrics affecting nh4 n were present in november there was no local r2 plot 3 3 2 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and no3 n fig 7 shows the spatial changes in the local coefficients of the variables affecting the concentrations of no3 n in the gwr model the spatial heterogeneity of the impacts of the landscape metrics on no3 n was more notable during the non flood season than during the flood season the no3 n concentration was mainly influenced by lpi shdi att and gar throughout the year with local coefficients 0 5 and no obvious spatial differentiation during the flood season the effects of landscape metrics on no3 n were evenly distributed in the study area with variations of local coefficients 0 25 fig 7c e during the non flood period lpi is the primary negative influence factor and the spatial variation in january and november is considerable with local coefficients varying from 0 to 1 fig 7a f the main influencing variables for no3 n in january july and november were all configuration metrics whereas in march may and july they were combinations of composition and configuration metrics the local r2 values of no3 n spatial variation are shown in fig 2s the percentage of variation in no3 n as explained by the landscape pattern was highest in the study area in may with the local r2 reaching 0 45 other months had lower interpretation rates local r2 0 3 than may and spatial heterogeneity of local r2 was in approximate agreement with the distribution of the local coefficients the explanatory rates of no3 n were relatively stable in march may july and september with little spatial heterogeneity 3 3 3 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and tn fig 8 shows the spatial changes in the local coefficients of the variables affecting the concentrations of tn in the gwr model among the explanatory variables for tn the effect of the configuration metrics was significantly greater than that of the composition metrics which proves the importance of green space configuration for river water quality in the region the number of landscape metrics affecting tn was greater during the non flood period than during the flood period and the spatial variation of the regression coefficients was more significant during the non flood period tn was mainly influenced by gar pafrac and frac am during the flood season and by iji lsi shdi and gyrate mn during the non flood season the negative correlation effects of gyrate mn on tn decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area iji contributed in different months during the non flood period and the spatial distribution of the influence coefficient on tn was approximately consistent with the highest coefficient reaching 1 1 in january the main influencing variables for tn during most of the monitoring periods january july september and november were the configuration metrics the local r2 spatial variation characteristics of the tn model are shown in fig 3s the explanation of tn by landscape metrics was the highest in november with the local r2 reaching 0 7 local r2 also reached 0 45 0 60 in the other months except for september which had a low interpretation rate with local r2 0 15 and no significant spatial variation 3 3 4 spatial relationships between landscape metrics and tp fig 9 shows the spatial patterns of the local coefficients of the landscape variables for the tp in the gwr model the local coefficient of the landscape metrics for tp was higher during the flood season and the number of metrics used to explain tp was higher than that during the non flood season this indicates that more factors influenced the tp entering the river during the flood season than during the non flood season and the migration process was more complex during the flood season tp was mainly influenced by green space composition such as att and pro and green space configuration such as pafrac iji lsi and pd among them pafrac appeared most frequently as a water quality influencing factor in different months and the spatial heterogeneity of its influence on water quality was greater only in january and was not significant in other months configuration metrics were the main influencing variables of the tp during the non flood season and combinations of composition and configuration metrics were the main influencing variables of the tp during the flood season the spatial variation of the local r2 for tp in different months is shown in fig 4s the explanation rates of the landscape metrics did not vary significantly over time and space temporally the highest percentage of explanations 60 for tp was found in january whereas september had the lowest percentage 15 spatially the local r2 values in march september and november were equally distributed in the study area which is an indication of the low tp content in the study area and its weak relationship with the landscape metrics 4 discussion 4 1 spatial and temporal variations in water quality nitrogen and phosphorus are the leading indicators affecting river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and the concentrations of tn and tp were as high as 7 57 and 0 39 mg l respectively li et al 2021a b previous studies have confirmed that the leading causes of river pollution in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal are related to urban and rural domestic sewage discharge and agricultural nps pollution these are driven by rainfall sewage discharge and other related factors causing nitrogen and phosphorus to sink into the river and aggravating river water pollution peng et al 2019 therefore non point source pollution remains the leading cause of water quality pollution in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal han et al 2019 wu and lu 2019 this study shows that the western and northern parts of the study area have more severe water pollution due to the high percentage of agricultural land accounting for 40 6 of these areas which is significantly higher than the 10 9 in other parts of the study area fig 3a areas with high levels of urbanization in the central part of the study area also had significant negative impacts on water quality the gentle topography of the study area increases the river s accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus the tn concentration in areas with larger farmland was often higher than that in other areas the average fertilizer application rate of farmland in this area reached 475 kg ha whereas the utilization rate of dominant crops such as paddy rice was only 46 4 liang et al 2019 consequently the loss of nitrogen fertilizer from farmland is the primary source of river tn pollution shu et al 2022 areas with high tp and nh4 n concentrations mainly occur in urbanized areas and township centers and the rise in impervious surfaces and population density will increase the ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus loads zhang et al 2021 related studies have shown that the impact of rainfall is significantly related to water quality and the increase in surface runoff during the flood season dilutes the concentration of pollutants in river water resulting in better water quality than during the non flood season yi et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 this study showed that there are large seasonal differences in river water quality in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal and river pollution is generally higher in the non flood season than in the flood season which is consistent with the previous findings li et al 2021a b at the same time the seasonal variation in river water quality also shows considerable temporal heterogeneity because 70 of precipitation in the study area was concentrated between april and september the flood season a substantial amount of precipitation diluted the n and p effluents nutrients and other pollutants from large areas of agricultural land in the western and northern parts of the study area were washed into the water bodies causing the tn concentration in this part of the river to severely exceed the class v standard shu et al 2022 in comparison the south central part of the study area includes the west lake scenic area which has a relatively large share of green space the variation of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations was more evident in this region and was lower during the flood season than during the non flood season studies have confirmed that urban forest can reduce soil erosion and retain some of the pollutants absorbed in runoff thereby diluting water quality concentrations anderson et al 2012 kimura et al 2018 therefore the impact of rainfall on surface water quality cannot be ignored on a seasonal scale the seasonal variation of water quality in the study area with high urban greenery coverage was more significant and responsive 4 2 impact of green space landscape pattern on river water quality the influence of landscape patterns on river water quality is typically expressed as changes in the output and migration of pollutants across various landscape patches meneses et al 2015 sajikumar and remya 2015 urban green space composition and configuration are integral parts of the green space landscape pattern which can effectively predict changes in river water quality xiao et al 2016 in this study we found that iji lsi gyrate mn lpi and pafrac were important green space configuration metrics affecting river water quality whereas att and gar are significant green space composition metrics to water quality we found that the negative correlation effect of green space configuration metrics on water quality was more evident than that of composition and this relationship was not consistent in time and space which is consistent with the results of other researchers margriter et al 2014 chen et al 2016 the results of the gwr model showed that the effects of green space landscape metrics on tp nh4 n and no3 n were more robust during the flood period than during the non flood period whereas the effects of green space landscape metrics on tn were higher during the non flood season than during the flood season the iji is a crucial configuration metric related to water quality in january march july and november the spatial heterogeneity of the negative effect of iji on tn and nh4 n was almost consistent significantly impacting the western and northern agricultural regions this indicates that during the season of low precipitation improving the percentage of various types of green space in urban and rural areas can enhance forest retention and soil infiltration capacity making it more conducive to improving river water quality guo et al 2021 the negative effect of gyrate mn on tn during the non flood period was mainly concentrated in the western and southeastern parts of the study area suggesting that sizeable green space patches such as the west lake scenic area and west creek wetland significantly improved river water quality in the western and northern parts of the study area which are less urbanized enhancing the influence of dominant patches or building large forest patches can play an essential role in regulating regional water quality we found that the positive correlation effect of gyrate mn on nh4 n was mainly distributed in the urban area in the southeast so the fragmented green space patches in the urban area were not conducive to purifying nh4 n the effect of pafrac on tn and tp was pronounced with significant spatial heterogeneity of the effect on tp in january and approximately consistent with changes in the effect on tn in july mainly concentrated in the areas of extensive forest patches such as xixi wetland 11 5 km2 mid levels forest park 10 0 km2 and liangzhu village 7 5 km2 whose forest patches are large and complex our study proves that large green space patches play an essential role in mitigating river pollution thus strengthening the conservation and cultivation of woodlands and ensuring the dominant patch status of forests are crucial for improving water quality the landscape composition metrics att and gar were the main factors influencing the tn in march and may the influence intensity of att showed a significant increasing trend from north to south which was consistent with the spatial pattern of urbanization degree in the study area the spatial heterogeneity of the impact of gar on water quality was apparent with both positive and negative effects some garden green space with high pedestrian density and management intensity harms river water quality as confirmed by previous study li chi et al 2018 therefore the planning of attached urban and rural green spaces and garden green spaces should be further improved based on the effects of green spaces landscape pattern on river water quality unlike traditional global statistical methods that reflect the average of existing stationary and homogeneous relationships across space which may neglect some significant spatial characteristics and hide local variations tu 2011 gwr spatial analysis can provide more detailed local information and the region specific information can help implement more targeted and effective green space planting strategies to reduce water pollution we found that green space composition was not the most significant factor affecting water quality whereas green space configuration had a much greater impact than green space composition exploring the spatial and temporal variations of green space landscape patterns affecting river water quality and implementing effective green space configuration planning and management can significantly help mitigate river water pollution we can focus on optimizing the configuration of green space in specific areas to further mitigate water pollution rather than simply seeking sufficiently large urban areas to plant new green spaces therefore optimizing the landscape configuration of green space will help provide specific water pollution mitigation strategies for practical implementation 5 conclusion this study explored the effect of urban green space landscape patterns on the water quality of the river network in the hangzhou section of the beijing hangzhou canal the results showed that tn concentration reached the inferior class v level and the tp and nh4 n concentrations were within the class ⅳ water quality standard the spatial and temporal differences in river nitrogen and phosphorus pollution were high spatially water pollution is more heavy in developed agricultural and urbanized areas temporally it is more serious during the non flood season than during the flood season the gwr can effectively explain the impact of urban green space on river water quality and the results illustrate that green space configuration is the main influencing factor compared to green space composition the configuration metrics exhibited varied relationships with different pollutants across spatial scales in different seasons the variations in nh4 n tn and tp can be well explained by configuration metrics such as iji lsi gyrate mn and pafrac the interpretation of no3 n is complex and mainly influenced by combinations of landscape configurations and compositions the results suggest that urban river water quality can be improved by optimizing the spatial configuration of green spaces without planting new green spaces this study provides key insights into the local relationship between urban green space and river water quality the results are expected to contribute to the planning and management of urban green spaces for targeted river pollution mitigation strategies in urban areas credit authorship contribution statement ziyu liu methodology investigation writing

1867,compound dry hot events cdhes have received ample attention recently due to their profound impacts on water resources crop yields and ecosystems the occurrence of cdhes in large regions across the globe can be driven by teleconnection patterns such as el niño southern oscillation enso previous studies have revealed the linkage between enso and cdhes across the globe however assessments of potential changes in the response of cdhes to enso are still lacking in this study we explore changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes for the period 1901 2010 over global land areas we find the enso cdhes relationship strengthens in western south america wsa southern africa saf and southern asia sas and weakens in eastern australia eau the changed enso cdhes relationship induces variations in the likelihood of cdhes occurring during el niño and la niña events from 1901 1955 to the recent period 1956 2010 the probability of the occurrence of cdhes during el niño increases from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas and decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in eau in addition the prediction skills of cdhes based on enso also differ for different periods in these regions owing to the changed enso cdhes relationship the findings of this study provide valuable insights for understanding the risks of cdhes and early warning of their occurrences keywords drought dry and hot prediction compound event data availability i have shared the link to the data 1 introduction the variability of regional temperature and precipitation and associated extremes is linked to large scale atmospheric circulations and sea surface temperature anomalies arblaster and alexander 2012 lemus canovas 2022 mishra and singh 2011 sun et al 2017 the el niño southern oscillation enso is among the most influential drivers of weather and climate extremes e g droughts and hot extremes at larger scales across the globe chen and zhou 2018 dong et al 2018 gore et al 2020 gupta and jain 2021 mo and schemm 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 for example vicente serrano et al 2011 analyzed the impacts of enso on drought severity worldwide and highlighted the regions with strong responses of droughts to el niño or la niña phases luo and lau 2020 investigated the linkage between enso and summer heat events in northern continents and found a higher frequency of heatwaves during la niña developing phases in regions such as north america and parts of asia understanding the responses of droughts and hot extremes to enso is of critical importance for modeling these extremes and establishing early warning systems to reduce their impacts in addition to individual droughts or hot extremes the co occurrence of droughts and hot extremes which are often termed compound dry hot events or extremes cdhes hao et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 has recently received considerable public attention cdhes are among the most disastrous natural hazards and can take a heavy toll on many sectors beyond those caused by their univariate counterparts zscheischler et al 2018 enso has been shown to be a key driver of the occurrence of cdhes on interseasonal and interannual timescales in many regions across global land areas ionita et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a for example the occurrences of cdhes over many regions of the southern hemisphere are associated with the warm phase of enso el niño during summer and fall mukherjee et al 2020 moreover an increased frequency of cdhes has been detected in historical observations and future projections at the global scale posing risks to water security food security ecosystem biodiversity and human health ipcc 2022 vogel et al 2021 it calls for an improved understanding of the relationship between enso and cdhes to develop adaptation measures in the future under a changing climate the effects of enso on climate variability have possibly changed sterl et al 2007 wang and an 2001 a variety of studies have evaluated the changed relationships between enso and precipitation or temperature in different regions monerie et al 2019 pavia 2017 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2010 wu and zhu 2021 zhang et al 2021a for example pavia 2017 found that the relationship between enso and rainfall weakened in the mediterranean california border region sun et al 2016 showed a strengthening relationship between enso and summer surface temperature in western russia and attributed it to changes in tropical thermal forcing related to enso besides future teleconnections between enso and precipitation temperature and related extreme events will possibly change compared with historical patterns although large uncertainties exist in projected changes due to internal variability fasullo et al 2018 goswami et al 2022 perry et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yun et al 2021 the changed relationship between enso and precipitation temperature can affect the risk estimation and prediction skill of certain extremes for example enso has been widely used as a predictor for seasonal climate prediction however the nonstationary teleconnection between enso and local precipitation or temperature can partially influence the prediction skill monerie et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the changing impact of enso on individual droughts or hot extremes or changing enso precipitation temperature relationship implies that the response of cdhes to enso may change accordingly however previous studies have generally neglected the potential changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes in historical periods therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes over global land areas and their impacts the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and methods used in this study section 3 presents the main results of the changed enso cdhes relationship and its impact on the likelihood of enso related cdhes and prediction performance based on the enso index the implications and limitations of this study are discussed in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 data global monthly temperature and precipitation data from 1901 to 2010 are obtained from the climatic research unit cru at the university of east anglia https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 another precipitation dataset from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc https www dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html is also employed in this study to assess the reliability of the results shown in the supplementary material desert areas i e mean precipitation lower than 0 5 mm day and greenland are masked out sheffield et al 2012 enso phenomenon is represented by nino 3 4 index based on averaged sea surface temperature sst over the region 170 w 120 w 5 s 5 n other enso indices including nino 3 index 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n and nino 4 index 160 e 150 w 5 s 5 n are also used these datasets are taken from the global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp https www psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries the linear trends of climate variables and the enso indices are all removed over the full record to ensure that the relationships are not disturbed by the long term trends cai et al 2012 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2022 van rensch et al 2015 the standardized anomalies of the detrended variables are then obtained via z score transformations by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation christian et al 2020 li et al 2022 in this study a 55 year subperiod is drawn from the whole period to explore the changes in the enso cdhes relationship 2 2 methods 2 2 1 event definition we focus on cdhes during warm seasons when the impacts from cdhes are generally more pronounced bevacqua et al 2022 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the warm season refers to june july august jja in the northern hemisphere and december january february djf in the southern hemisphere feng and hao 2021 gevaert et al 2018 wang et al 2015 cdhes are defined as the co occurrence of 3 month total precipitation below the 50th percentile and 3 month average temperature above the 50th percentile during the warm season for the whole period the motivation for using the moderate threshold pairs is to obtain relatively larger sample sizes of occurrences to reduce uncertainties for the statistical analysis el niño la niña events are defined when 3 month average nino 3 4 index is above 0 5 below 0 5 standard deviation sung et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 different types of el niño events such as eastern pacific ep or central pacific cp events describe the location of the sst anomaly center nino 3 and nino 4 indices are commonly used to identify the ep and cp events respectively li et al 2015 following previous studies wang and li 2022 ep el niño events are defined when the standardized nino 3 index is above 0 5 and greater than the standardized nino 4 index cp el niño events are defined when the standardized nino 4 index is above 0 5 and greater than the standardized nino 3 index the nino 3 and nino 4 indices are also averaged for the 3 month of warm seasons 2 2 2 logistic regression the logistic regression model is employed to measure the associations between enso and the occurrence of cdhes hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2022 wu et al 2021 a binary variable y is defined to represent the occurrence y 1 and non occurrence y 0 of cdhes given the nino 3 4 index as the independent variable x the logistic regression model can be expressed as agresti 2007 1 l o g i t y l n p 1 p α β x where p represents the probability of the occurrence of cdhes given the value of the nino 3 4 index i e p y 1 x x p 1 p is termed odds which is derived from the ratio of the probability of occurrence and probability of non occurrence of the event α is the intercept and β is the regression coefficients these parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method the odds ratio means the ratio of odds for a one unit increase in x expressed as exp β the odds ratio is a key parameter to quantify the influence of enso on the occurrence of cdhes an odds ratio greater than one or β greater than zero indicates that the likelihood of the occurrence of cdhes increases as the nino 3 4 index increases and vice versa the chi square test is employed to test the statistical significance of regression coefficients i e β if the p value of the statistical test is less than 0 05 the regression relationship can be considered significant at the 0 05 significance level 2 2 3 copula based conditional probability the probability of cdhes conditioned on the el niño la niña phase is calculated via the multivariate distributions based on the copula model taking cdhes during el niño periods as an example the associated probability can be expressed as follows 2 p x x y y z z u c u v c u w c u v w 1 w where x y and z represent the precipitation temperature and nino 3 4 index respectively x y and z are the thresholds for x y and z to define dry conditions hot conditions and el niño events u f x x v f y y and w f z z are the marginal distributions for x y and z and c is the copula function here the marginal distribution function is fitted by nonparametric kernel density estimation in this study the copula is empirically estimated or empirical copula brunner et al 2021 genest and favre 2007 wong et al 2010 3 c u v w 1 n i 1 n i r i n 1 u s i n 1 v t i n 1 w where n is the sample size i is the indicator function if the condition is true i 1 otherwise i 0 ri si and ti represent the order statistics of different variables the nonparametric approach is easy to understand and calculate without making underlying assumptions about the marginal and joint distribution the potential limitation is that it cannot estimate the extremes that lie outside the range of the available data compared to parametric distribution fitting 2 2 4 prediction performance by applying the nino 3 4 index as the predictor the logistic regression model can also be used to predict the probability of occurrence of cdhes we focus on the 0 month and 3 month lead time in this study leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 is used to evaluate the prediction performance in each subperiod specifically for n groups of cdhes and the nino 3 4 index the logistic regression model is fitted n times with n 1 samples leaving one sample out each time then the omitted sample is predicted using the regression relationship obtained from the remaining n 1 samples and the corresponding predictor in this study the brier skill score bss is employed to measure the prediction performance the equation of bss is expressed as follows hao et al 2019 wilks 2011 4 bss 1 i 1 n pp i o i 2 i 1 n r p o i 2 where n is the number of years in each subperiod n 55 ppi is the predicted probability of occurrence of cdhes based on the prediction model oi is the observed occurrence oi 1 or non occurrence oi 0 of cdhes rp is the reference prediction which is computed by the climatological frequency of the occurrence of cdhes during the calculation period bss ranges from to 1 and the positive value of bss indicates a skillful prediction or better performance than reference prediction 3 results in this study two equal periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 are chosen to investigate whether the enso cdhes relationship has changed and the time varying relationship is assessed by a 55 year moving window section 3 1 the nonstationary relationship between enso and individual variables i e precipitation and temperature is then discussed to explain the changed enso cdhes relationships the changed relationship can influence the likelihood assessment and prediction skill of cdhes based on enso which are analyzed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 respectively 3 1 nonstationary enso cdhes relationships the relationships between enso and cdhes based on logistic regression in two periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 are shown in fig 1 regions with an odds ratio higher than one indicate that the probability of occurrence of cdhes increases as nino 3 4 index increases or that cdhes tend to occur during el niño events as shown in fig 1 a b many low latitude regions such as northern south america southern africa southern asia and parts of australia have odds ratios higher than one in both periods these results indicate the significant influence of el niño on the occurrence of cdhes in these regions in contrast the regions with an odds ratio lower than one indicate that the probability of occurrence of cdhes increases as nino 3 4 index decreases or that cdhes tend to occur during la niña events in this case cdhes show a significant response to la niña events for only a few areas such as parts of northeastern china in the recent period overall these findings are consistent with previous studies of enso influences on cdhes feng and hao 2021 hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2020 despite the overall consistent pattern of the enso influence on cdhes in fig 1 a and b changes in the enso cdhes relationship measured by the odds ratio are observed in several regions between the two periods here we focus on the key regions where enso has a significant influence on cdhes for either period accordingly four hotspots are identified and selected including western south america wsa southern africa saf southern asia sas and eastern australia eau as marked in fig 1 we find the positive relationships between enso and cdhes occurrence become stronger in wsa saf and sas for instance the median value of the odds ratio increases from 1 5 to 2 5 in wsa for two periods as shown in fig 1 c meanwhile the relationships become weaker with the median odds ratio changing from 2 4 to 1 3 and not significant in eau based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test the distribution of the odds ratio between the two periods is statistically different in these four regions at the 0 05 significance level we further use the 55 year moving window i e 1901 1955 1902 1956 and 1956 2010 to assess the temporal changes in enso cdhes relationships in the four regions fig 2 in each period the regional average odds ratio is greater than one indicating that the el niño phenomenon remains positively associated with the occurrence of with cdhes since the 1900s mann kendall m k test and sen s slope estimator are used to analyze the trend in the moving odds ratio series we find the moving odds ratio presents increasing trends in wsa saf and sas and decreasing trends in eau the trends of the four cases are all statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level this corroborates the changed enso cdhes relationships in these four regions the enso cdhes relationship is closely associated with enso precipitation and enso temperature relationships generally regions with a negative enso precipitation relationship and positive enso temperature relationship favor the occurrence of cdhes during the warm phase of enso or el niño events the nonstationary relationship between enso and cdhes can be attributed to the variation of teleconnection between enso and precipitation temperature under a changing climate the 55 year moving correlation coefficients between enso and precipitation and those between enso and temperature for the four regions are shown in fig 3 there is an apparent strengthening of both the enso precipitation relationship and enso temperature relationship since the 1900s i e the moving correlations tend to be stronger in wsa and saf in sas the enso precipitation relationship and enso temperature relationship both show a rough pattern of first strengthening and then weakening slightly the variation of the correlation between enso and individual variables i e precipitation and temperature in these three regions can partially explain the strengthening relationship between enso and cdhes in eau the enso precipitation relationship tends to first strengthen and then weaken while the enso temperature relationship changes irregularly eventually resulting in a weakened relationship between enso and cdhes considering the data related uncertainties sun et al 2018 the process is repeated using the precipitation data from the gpcc and a very similar pattern is observed see figs s1 s3 indicating that the results are robust with respect to the choice of the dataset in summary these results suggest the changed enso cdhes relationship in the past century 3 2 changes in the likelihood of el niño related cdhes the changing relationships between enso and cdhes can lead to variations in the likelihood of cdhes during different enso phases the probabilities of cdhes occurring during el niño events in the two periods of 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 and the corresponding differences i e probabilities during 1956 2010 minus those during 1901 1955 are shown in fig 4 results during la niña are shown in fig s4 the probability of occurrence of cdhes during el niño and that during la niña both have apparent differences between the two periods fig 4 d shows that the likelihood of cdhes during el niño increases between the two periods in southern north america wsa saf and sas and decreases in central north america europe and eau as a result under el niño conditions the medians of the occurrence probability of cdhes shift from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas between the two periods which indicates that these regions face a higher risk of cdhes during el niño in recent decades in addition the occurrence probability of cdhes during el niño decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in the eau in these four regions the distribution of occurrence probability of cdhes associated with el niño between the two periods shows significant differences according to the k s test at the 0 05 significance level we further investigate the variation in multivariate behavior of precipitation and temperature for warm seasons during el niño events in the four representative regions where cdhes tend to occur during el niño as shown in fig 5 the joint changes in precipitation and temperature during el niño may account for the changes in the likelihood of el niño related cdhes from 1901 1955 to the recent period of 1956 2010 the dependence between precipitation and temperature during el niño significantly increases in saf and sas from 0 36 to 0 61 and from 0 32 to 0 68 respectively and slightly decreases in eau from 0 56 to 0 44 for the wsa region the precipitation temperature clusters during el niño tend to shift to the dry warm phase i e lower right panel implying increased occurrences of el niño induced cdhes for the recent period these results indicate that the likelihood of enso related cdhes may change due to the nonstationary relationship between enso and cdhes or the multivariate behavior of precipitation and temperature 3 3 influence on the seasonal prediction evaluation of cdhes the nonstationarity of the enso cdhes relationship may influence the prediction skill of cdhes using enso as the predictor in different periods the prediction performance bss for the 3 month lead prediction of the occurrence of cdhes is shown in fig 6 results for 0 month lead prediction have similar patterns as shown in fig s5 the prediction at a 3 month lead time demonstrates that enso can provide prediction skills i e bss 0 several months in advance in regions with significant enso cdhes relationships including wsa saf sas and eau for example the useful prediction skill in southern africa based on enso is consistent with previous studies hao et al 2019 meanwhile there are some changes in the 3 month lead prediction skill of cdhes during the two periods the medians of the bss increase in wsa saf and sas and decrease in eau between the two periods fig 6 d and the distribution of the bss between the two periods in these regions all show significant differences based on the k s test for instance for the past period from 1901 to 1955 the prediction model based on enso is not skillful for most grids in wsa the median of the bss is 0 05 while for the recent period from 1956 to 2010 a useful prediction based on enso is achieved across large regions in wsa the median of the bss is 0 10 the opposite pattern is observed in eau where the bss decreases from 0 08 to 0 05 these results highlight that the prediction skill provided by enso may change with time due to the changing response of cdhes to enso shown in section 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 implications the finding of changes in the probability of cdhes under enso conditions can improve the understanding of the risk driven by el niño la niña climate models have projected increased extreme enso events under warming in the future cai et al 2014 singh et al 2022 our findings imply that assessments of the likelihood of enso related cdhes in the future need to consider the changes in enso cdhes relationship notably the occurrence or magnitude of precipitation and temperature extremes is related to the type of enso events e g ep and cp types changes in the proportion of these types have been observed in recent decades freund et al 2019 which may influence the occurrence probability of cdhes associated with enso events in certain regions in this study we consider the ep and cp types of enso events by using different sst indices i e nino 3 and nino 4 we find that the changing relationships between cdhes and enso are overall consistent based on nino 3 4 nino 3 and nino 4 indices fig s6 suggesting that the results are not highly sensitive to the selection of enso indices however a notable discrepancy exists between changes in the likelihood of cdhes during ep el niño events and that during cp el niño events in certain regions fig s7 for example in eau the probability of occurrence of cdhes decreases from 0 82 to 0 29 during ep el niño events and increases from 0 50 to 0 53 during cp el niño events suggesting that decreasing likelihood of el niño related cdhes is probably associated more with ep el niño events rather than cp el niño events however it should be noted that the number of different types of enso events in the record is limited which may lead to considerable uncertainty in this pattern in addition predicting cdhes in advance is crucial for releasing early warning information there are many regions where the enso index can provide prediction skills for droughts hot extremes and also cdhes as shown in previous studies hao et al 2019 white et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 high predictive performance is shown in regions where the forcing signal of enso to the local climate is robust results from this study imply that the predictability of cdhes may change due to the nonstationary enso cdhes relationship which can affect the effectiveness of the early warning systems of cdhes more importantly prediction skills may decline for regions with weakening teleconnection between enso and cdhes thereby reducing the effectiveness of prediction efforts based on enso in this case the incorporation of other predictors or harnessing new prediction schemes e g using dynamic forecast models is needed to improve prediction performance 4 2 limitations the limitations of this study include the data record predictor selection and impact pathway due to the short record covering only the past 110 years 55 years for each window the observed occurrences of cdhes are limited as such the confidence in the changed relationships between enso and cdhes may be subject to large uncertainties moderate thresholds i e 50th percentile are used to capture a larger effective sample size i e the number of cdhes for statistical inference however such a threshold cannot represent extreme events higher thresholds such as the 10th and 90th percentiles for precipitation and temperature are needed for further analysis to provide a robust conclusion if a larger sample size is available in this case longer observations or simulations from large model ensembles can be used in further studies to address this challenge bevacqua et al 2022 except for enso other factors such as volcanic aerosol and oceanic atmospheric modes may disturb the results banholzer and donner 2014 the impacts of other modes of variabilities such as the north atlantic oscillation nao indian ocean dipole iod and madden julian oscillation mjo on the occurrence of cdhes have been explored in several studies anderson et al 2020 lemus canovas 2022 mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2022 wu et al 2021 for example iod is an important climate driver of the simultaneous drought and heatwaves in australia reddy et al 2022 in addition enso teleconnection may be modulated by the variability of other large scale climate modes at a longer time scale such as atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo mo et al 2009 monerie et al 2019 soulard et al 2019 tang et al 2022 wu and zhu 2021 which can reinforce or offset the influence of enso on cdhes in a similar vein for the prediction of cdhes we select only the enso index as the predictor in this study we acknowledge that additional predictors such as initial land conditions and the other large scale teleconnection indices mentioned above are needed to achieve better performance hao et al 2021 li et al 2020 overall other contributing factors that may affect the occurrence of cdhes should be considered in future studies last but not least we focus on the statistical relationship between enso and cdhes based on the empirical analysis and logistic regression model the fundamental physical mechanisms of the atmospheric and oceanic circulations leading to the changed enso cdhes relationships are beyond the scope of this study and omitted from the analysis to improve our understanding of the changed response of cdhes to enso different thermodynamic and dynamic processes contributing to the occurrence of cdhes such as atmospheric circulations pfleiderer et al 2019 and land atmosphere feedback li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b need to be further explored note that the occurrence of cdhes can be induced by both large scale circulation patterns and anthropogenic warming chiang et al 2022a chiang et al 2022b mukherjee et al 2022 rajeev et al 2022 sarhadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 this study mainly investigates the influence of enso without quantification of the relative contribution of anthropogenic warming 5 conclusion this study explored the changing relationship between enso and the occurrence of compound dry and hot events cdhes using the 110 year observational record 1901 2010 across global land areas the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 changes in the relationships between enso and occurrence of cdhes measured by odds ratio from the logistic regression model are observed between two periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 in large regions across the globe the enso cdhes relationships become stronger in western south america wsa southern africa saf and southern asia sas and weaker in eastern australia eau 2 due to the changes in the enso cdhes relationship the likelihood of cdhes during enso events experiences noticeable changes between the two periods in many regions under el niño conditions the occurrence probability of cdhes increases from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas and decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in eau 3 the prediction skill of cdhes occurrence based on the enso index changes over time for the period 1956 2010 relative to 1901 1955 the prediction skill of cdhes increases in wsa saf and sas associated with strengthened enso cdhes relationship and reduces in eau associated with weakened enso cdhes relationship under global warming the changed frequency of enso has been projected in the future results from this study highlight that the response of cdhes or other extremes to enso should be viewed from a nonstationary perspective despite potential limitations of this study such as short data lengths and reliance on statistical analysis without diagnosing physical mechanisms the results of this study can be helpful for risk assessments and early warning of cdhes to reduce their impacts credit authorship contribution

1867,compound dry hot events cdhes have received ample attention recently due to their profound impacts on water resources crop yields and ecosystems the occurrence of cdhes in large regions across the globe can be driven by teleconnection patterns such as el niño southern oscillation enso previous studies have revealed the linkage between enso and cdhes across the globe however assessments of potential changes in the response of cdhes to enso are still lacking in this study we explore changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes for the period 1901 2010 over global land areas we find the enso cdhes relationship strengthens in western south america wsa southern africa saf and southern asia sas and weakens in eastern australia eau the changed enso cdhes relationship induces variations in the likelihood of cdhes occurring during el niño and la niña events from 1901 1955 to the recent period 1956 2010 the probability of the occurrence of cdhes during el niño increases from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas and decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in eau in addition the prediction skills of cdhes based on enso also differ for different periods in these regions owing to the changed enso cdhes relationship the findings of this study provide valuable insights for understanding the risks of cdhes and early warning of their occurrences keywords drought dry and hot prediction compound event data availability i have shared the link to the data 1 introduction the variability of regional temperature and precipitation and associated extremes is linked to large scale atmospheric circulations and sea surface temperature anomalies arblaster and alexander 2012 lemus canovas 2022 mishra and singh 2011 sun et al 2017 the el niño southern oscillation enso is among the most influential drivers of weather and climate extremes e g droughts and hot extremes at larger scales across the globe chen and zhou 2018 dong et al 2018 gore et al 2020 gupta and jain 2021 mo and schemm 2008 vicente serrano et al 2011 for example vicente serrano et al 2011 analyzed the impacts of enso on drought severity worldwide and highlighted the regions with strong responses of droughts to el niño or la niña phases luo and lau 2020 investigated the linkage between enso and summer heat events in northern continents and found a higher frequency of heatwaves during la niña developing phases in regions such as north america and parts of asia understanding the responses of droughts and hot extremes to enso is of critical importance for modeling these extremes and establishing early warning systems to reduce their impacts in addition to individual droughts or hot extremes the co occurrence of droughts and hot extremes which are often termed compound dry hot events or extremes cdhes hao et al 2018 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 has recently received considerable public attention cdhes are among the most disastrous natural hazards and can take a heavy toll on many sectors beyond those caused by their univariate counterparts zscheischler et al 2018 enso has been shown to be a key driver of the occurrence of cdhes on interseasonal and interannual timescales in many regions across global land areas ionita et al 2021 mukherjee et al 2022 zhang et al 2020a for example the occurrences of cdhes over many regions of the southern hemisphere are associated with the warm phase of enso el niño during summer and fall mukherjee et al 2020 moreover an increased frequency of cdhes has been detected in historical observations and future projections at the global scale posing risks to water security food security ecosystem biodiversity and human health ipcc 2022 vogel et al 2021 it calls for an improved understanding of the relationship between enso and cdhes to develop adaptation measures in the future under a changing climate the effects of enso on climate variability have possibly changed sterl et al 2007 wang and an 2001 a variety of studies have evaluated the changed relationships between enso and precipitation or temperature in different regions monerie et al 2019 pavia 2017 sun et al 2021 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2010 wu and zhu 2021 zhang et al 2021a for example pavia 2017 found that the relationship between enso and rainfall weakened in the mediterranean california border region sun et al 2016 showed a strengthening relationship between enso and summer surface temperature in western russia and attributed it to changes in tropical thermal forcing related to enso besides future teleconnections between enso and precipitation temperature and related extreme events will possibly change compared with historical patterns although large uncertainties exist in projected changes due to internal variability fasullo et al 2018 goswami et al 2022 perry et al 2020 sun et al 2020 yun et al 2021 the changed relationship between enso and precipitation temperature can affect the risk estimation and prediction skill of certain extremes for example enso has been widely used as a predictor for seasonal climate prediction however the nonstationary teleconnection between enso and local precipitation or temperature can partially influence the prediction skill monerie et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the changing impact of enso on individual droughts or hot extremes or changing enso precipitation temperature relationship implies that the response of cdhes to enso may change accordingly however previous studies have generally neglected the potential changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes in historical periods therefore the objective of this study is to evaluate changes in the relationship between enso and cdhes over global land areas and their impacts the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the datasets and methods used in this study section 3 presents the main results of the changed enso cdhes relationship and its impact on the likelihood of enso related cdhes and prediction performance based on the enso index the implications and limitations of this study are discussed in section 4 followed by conclusions in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 data global monthly temperature and precipitation data from 1901 to 2010 are obtained from the climatic research unit cru at the university of east anglia https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 another precipitation dataset from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc https www dwd de en ourservices gpcc gpcc html is also employed in this study to assess the reliability of the results shown in the supplementary material desert areas i e mean precipitation lower than 0 5 mm day and greenland are masked out sheffield et al 2012 enso phenomenon is represented by nino 3 4 index based on averaged sea surface temperature sst over the region 170 w 120 w 5 s 5 n other enso indices including nino 3 index 150 w 90 w 5 s 5 n and nino 4 index 160 e 150 w 5 s 5 n are also used these datasets are taken from the global climate observing system gcos working group on surface pressure wg sp https www psl noaa gov gcos wgsp timeseries the linear trends of climate variables and the enso indices are all removed over the full record to ensure that the relationships are not disturbed by the long term trends cai et al 2012 sun et al 2016 tang et al 2022 van rensch et al 2015 the standardized anomalies of the detrended variables are then obtained via z score transformations by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation christian et al 2020 li et al 2022 in this study a 55 year subperiod is drawn from the whole period to explore the changes in the enso cdhes relationship 2 2 methods 2 2 1 event definition we focus on cdhes during warm seasons when the impacts from cdhes are generally more pronounced bevacqua et al 2022 zscheischler and seneviratne 2017 the warm season refers to june july august jja in the northern hemisphere and december january february djf in the southern hemisphere feng and hao 2021 gevaert et al 2018 wang et al 2015 cdhes are defined as the co occurrence of 3 month total precipitation below the 50th percentile and 3 month average temperature above the 50th percentile during the warm season for the whole period the motivation for using the moderate threshold pairs is to obtain relatively larger sample sizes of occurrences to reduce uncertainties for the statistical analysis el niño la niña events are defined when 3 month average nino 3 4 index is above 0 5 below 0 5 standard deviation sung et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 different types of el niño events such as eastern pacific ep or central pacific cp events describe the location of the sst anomaly center nino 3 and nino 4 indices are commonly used to identify the ep and cp events respectively li et al 2015 following previous studies wang and li 2022 ep el niño events are defined when the standardized nino 3 index is above 0 5 and greater than the standardized nino 4 index cp el niño events are defined when the standardized nino 4 index is above 0 5 and greater than the standardized nino 3 index the nino 3 and nino 4 indices are also averaged for the 3 month of warm seasons 2 2 2 logistic regression the logistic regression model is employed to measure the associations between enso and the occurrence of cdhes hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2022 wu et al 2021 a binary variable y is defined to represent the occurrence y 1 and non occurrence y 0 of cdhes given the nino 3 4 index as the independent variable x the logistic regression model can be expressed as agresti 2007 1 l o g i t y l n p 1 p α β x where p represents the probability of the occurrence of cdhes given the value of the nino 3 4 index i e p y 1 x x p 1 p is termed odds which is derived from the ratio of the probability of occurrence and probability of non occurrence of the event α is the intercept and β is the regression coefficients these parameters are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation method the odds ratio means the ratio of odds for a one unit increase in x expressed as exp β the odds ratio is a key parameter to quantify the influence of enso on the occurrence of cdhes an odds ratio greater than one or β greater than zero indicates that the likelihood of the occurrence of cdhes increases as the nino 3 4 index increases and vice versa the chi square test is employed to test the statistical significance of regression coefficients i e β if the p value of the statistical test is less than 0 05 the regression relationship can be considered significant at the 0 05 significance level 2 2 3 copula based conditional probability the probability of cdhes conditioned on the el niño la niña phase is calculated via the multivariate distributions based on the copula model taking cdhes during el niño periods as an example the associated probability can be expressed as follows 2 p x x y y z z u c u v c u w c u v w 1 w where x y and z represent the precipitation temperature and nino 3 4 index respectively x y and z are the thresholds for x y and z to define dry conditions hot conditions and el niño events u f x x v f y y and w f z z are the marginal distributions for x y and z and c is the copula function here the marginal distribution function is fitted by nonparametric kernel density estimation in this study the copula is empirically estimated or empirical copula brunner et al 2021 genest and favre 2007 wong et al 2010 3 c u v w 1 n i 1 n i r i n 1 u s i n 1 v t i n 1 w where n is the sample size i is the indicator function if the condition is true i 1 otherwise i 0 ri si and ti represent the order statistics of different variables the nonparametric approach is easy to understand and calculate without making underlying assumptions about the marginal and joint distribution the potential limitation is that it cannot estimate the extremes that lie outside the range of the available data compared to parametric distribution fitting 2 2 4 prediction performance by applying the nino 3 4 index as the predictor the logistic regression model can also be used to predict the probability of occurrence of cdhes we focus on the 0 month and 3 month lead time in this study leave one out cross validation loocv wilks 2011 is used to evaluate the prediction performance in each subperiod specifically for n groups of cdhes and the nino 3 4 index the logistic regression model is fitted n times with n 1 samples leaving one sample out each time then the omitted sample is predicted using the regression relationship obtained from the remaining n 1 samples and the corresponding predictor in this study the brier skill score bss is employed to measure the prediction performance the equation of bss is expressed as follows hao et al 2019 wilks 2011 4 bss 1 i 1 n pp i o i 2 i 1 n r p o i 2 where n is the number of years in each subperiod n 55 ppi is the predicted probability of occurrence of cdhes based on the prediction model oi is the observed occurrence oi 1 or non occurrence oi 0 of cdhes rp is the reference prediction which is computed by the climatological frequency of the occurrence of cdhes during the calculation period bss ranges from to 1 and the positive value of bss indicates a skillful prediction or better performance than reference prediction 3 results in this study two equal periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 are chosen to investigate whether the enso cdhes relationship has changed and the time varying relationship is assessed by a 55 year moving window section 3 1 the nonstationary relationship between enso and individual variables i e precipitation and temperature is then discussed to explain the changed enso cdhes relationships the changed relationship can influence the likelihood assessment and prediction skill of cdhes based on enso which are analyzed in section 3 2 and section 3 3 respectively 3 1 nonstationary enso cdhes relationships the relationships between enso and cdhes based on logistic regression in two periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 are shown in fig 1 regions with an odds ratio higher than one indicate that the probability of occurrence of cdhes increases as nino 3 4 index increases or that cdhes tend to occur during el niño events as shown in fig 1 a b many low latitude regions such as northern south america southern africa southern asia and parts of australia have odds ratios higher than one in both periods these results indicate the significant influence of el niño on the occurrence of cdhes in these regions in contrast the regions with an odds ratio lower than one indicate that the probability of occurrence of cdhes increases as nino 3 4 index decreases or that cdhes tend to occur during la niña events in this case cdhes show a significant response to la niña events for only a few areas such as parts of northeastern china in the recent period overall these findings are consistent with previous studies of enso influences on cdhes feng and hao 2021 hao et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2020 despite the overall consistent pattern of the enso influence on cdhes in fig 1 a and b changes in the enso cdhes relationship measured by the odds ratio are observed in several regions between the two periods here we focus on the key regions where enso has a significant influence on cdhes for either period accordingly four hotspots are identified and selected including western south america wsa southern africa saf southern asia sas and eastern australia eau as marked in fig 1 we find the positive relationships between enso and cdhes occurrence become stronger in wsa saf and sas for instance the median value of the odds ratio increases from 1 5 to 2 5 in wsa for two periods as shown in fig 1 c meanwhile the relationships become weaker with the median odds ratio changing from 2 4 to 1 3 and not significant in eau based on the kolmogorov smirnov k s test the distribution of the odds ratio between the two periods is statistically different in these four regions at the 0 05 significance level we further use the 55 year moving window i e 1901 1955 1902 1956 and 1956 2010 to assess the temporal changes in enso cdhes relationships in the four regions fig 2 in each period the regional average odds ratio is greater than one indicating that the el niño phenomenon remains positively associated with the occurrence of with cdhes since the 1900s mann kendall m k test and sen s slope estimator are used to analyze the trend in the moving odds ratio series we find the moving odds ratio presents increasing trends in wsa saf and sas and decreasing trends in eau the trends of the four cases are all statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level this corroborates the changed enso cdhes relationships in these four regions the enso cdhes relationship is closely associated with enso precipitation and enso temperature relationships generally regions with a negative enso precipitation relationship and positive enso temperature relationship favor the occurrence of cdhes during the warm phase of enso or el niño events the nonstationary relationship between enso and cdhes can be attributed to the variation of teleconnection between enso and precipitation temperature under a changing climate the 55 year moving correlation coefficients between enso and precipitation and those between enso and temperature for the four regions are shown in fig 3 there is an apparent strengthening of both the enso precipitation relationship and enso temperature relationship since the 1900s i e the moving correlations tend to be stronger in wsa and saf in sas the enso precipitation relationship and enso temperature relationship both show a rough pattern of first strengthening and then weakening slightly the variation of the correlation between enso and individual variables i e precipitation and temperature in these three regions can partially explain the strengthening relationship between enso and cdhes in eau the enso precipitation relationship tends to first strengthen and then weaken while the enso temperature relationship changes irregularly eventually resulting in a weakened relationship between enso and cdhes considering the data related uncertainties sun et al 2018 the process is repeated using the precipitation data from the gpcc and a very similar pattern is observed see figs s1 s3 indicating that the results are robust with respect to the choice of the dataset in summary these results suggest the changed enso cdhes relationship in the past century 3 2 changes in the likelihood of el niño related cdhes the changing relationships between enso and cdhes can lead to variations in the likelihood of cdhes during different enso phases the probabilities of cdhes occurring during el niño events in the two periods of 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 and the corresponding differences i e probabilities during 1956 2010 minus those during 1901 1955 are shown in fig 4 results during la niña are shown in fig s4 the probability of occurrence of cdhes during el niño and that during la niña both have apparent differences between the two periods fig 4 d shows that the likelihood of cdhes during el niño increases between the two periods in southern north america wsa saf and sas and decreases in central north america europe and eau as a result under el niño conditions the medians of the occurrence probability of cdhes shift from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas between the two periods which indicates that these regions face a higher risk of cdhes during el niño in recent decades in addition the occurrence probability of cdhes during el niño decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in the eau in these four regions the distribution of occurrence probability of cdhes associated with el niño between the two periods shows significant differences according to the k s test at the 0 05 significance level we further investigate the variation in multivariate behavior of precipitation and temperature for warm seasons during el niño events in the four representative regions where cdhes tend to occur during el niño as shown in fig 5 the joint changes in precipitation and temperature during el niño may account for the changes in the likelihood of el niño related cdhes from 1901 1955 to the recent period of 1956 2010 the dependence between precipitation and temperature during el niño significantly increases in saf and sas from 0 36 to 0 61 and from 0 32 to 0 68 respectively and slightly decreases in eau from 0 56 to 0 44 for the wsa region the precipitation temperature clusters during el niño tend to shift to the dry warm phase i e lower right panel implying increased occurrences of el niño induced cdhes for the recent period these results indicate that the likelihood of enso related cdhes may change due to the nonstationary relationship between enso and cdhes or the multivariate behavior of precipitation and temperature 3 3 influence on the seasonal prediction evaluation of cdhes the nonstationarity of the enso cdhes relationship may influence the prediction skill of cdhes using enso as the predictor in different periods the prediction performance bss for the 3 month lead prediction of the occurrence of cdhes is shown in fig 6 results for 0 month lead prediction have similar patterns as shown in fig s5 the prediction at a 3 month lead time demonstrates that enso can provide prediction skills i e bss 0 several months in advance in regions with significant enso cdhes relationships including wsa saf sas and eau for example the useful prediction skill in southern africa based on enso is consistent with previous studies hao et al 2019 meanwhile there are some changes in the 3 month lead prediction skill of cdhes during the two periods the medians of the bss increase in wsa saf and sas and decrease in eau between the two periods fig 6 d and the distribution of the bss between the two periods in these regions all show significant differences based on the k s test for instance for the past period from 1901 to 1955 the prediction model based on enso is not skillful for most grids in wsa the median of the bss is 0 05 while for the recent period from 1956 to 2010 a useful prediction based on enso is achieved across large regions in wsa the median of the bss is 0 10 the opposite pattern is observed in eau where the bss decreases from 0 08 to 0 05 these results highlight that the prediction skill provided by enso may change with time due to the changing response of cdhes to enso shown in section 3 1 4 discussion 4 1 implications the finding of changes in the probability of cdhes under enso conditions can improve the understanding of the risk driven by el niño la niña climate models have projected increased extreme enso events under warming in the future cai et al 2014 singh et al 2022 our findings imply that assessments of the likelihood of enso related cdhes in the future need to consider the changes in enso cdhes relationship notably the occurrence or magnitude of precipitation and temperature extremes is related to the type of enso events e g ep and cp types changes in the proportion of these types have been observed in recent decades freund et al 2019 which may influence the occurrence probability of cdhes associated with enso events in certain regions in this study we consider the ep and cp types of enso events by using different sst indices i e nino 3 and nino 4 we find that the changing relationships between cdhes and enso are overall consistent based on nino 3 4 nino 3 and nino 4 indices fig s6 suggesting that the results are not highly sensitive to the selection of enso indices however a notable discrepancy exists between changes in the likelihood of cdhes during ep el niño events and that during cp el niño events in certain regions fig s7 for example in eau the probability of occurrence of cdhes decreases from 0 82 to 0 29 during ep el niño events and increases from 0 50 to 0 53 during cp el niño events suggesting that decreasing likelihood of el niño related cdhes is probably associated more with ep el niño events rather than cp el niño events however it should be noted that the number of different types of enso events in the record is limited which may lead to considerable uncertainty in this pattern in addition predicting cdhes in advance is crucial for releasing early warning information there are many regions where the enso index can provide prediction skills for droughts hot extremes and also cdhes as shown in previous studies hao et al 2019 white et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b zhou et al 2020 high predictive performance is shown in regions where the forcing signal of enso to the local climate is robust results from this study imply that the predictability of cdhes may change due to the nonstationary enso cdhes relationship which can affect the effectiveness of the early warning systems of cdhes more importantly prediction skills may decline for regions with weakening teleconnection between enso and cdhes thereby reducing the effectiveness of prediction efforts based on enso in this case the incorporation of other predictors or harnessing new prediction schemes e g using dynamic forecast models is needed to improve prediction performance 4 2 limitations the limitations of this study include the data record predictor selection and impact pathway due to the short record covering only the past 110 years 55 years for each window the observed occurrences of cdhes are limited as such the confidence in the changed relationships between enso and cdhes may be subject to large uncertainties moderate thresholds i e 50th percentile are used to capture a larger effective sample size i e the number of cdhes for statistical inference however such a threshold cannot represent extreme events higher thresholds such as the 10th and 90th percentiles for precipitation and temperature are needed for further analysis to provide a robust conclusion if a larger sample size is available in this case longer observations or simulations from large model ensembles can be used in further studies to address this challenge bevacqua et al 2022 except for enso other factors such as volcanic aerosol and oceanic atmospheric modes may disturb the results banholzer and donner 2014 the impacts of other modes of variabilities such as the north atlantic oscillation nao indian ocean dipole iod and madden julian oscillation mjo on the occurrence of cdhes have been explored in several studies anderson et al 2020 lemus canovas 2022 mukherjee et al 2020 mukherjee et al 2022 wu et al 2021 for example iod is an important climate driver of the simultaneous drought and heatwaves in australia reddy et al 2022 in addition enso teleconnection may be modulated by the variability of other large scale climate modes at a longer time scale such as atlantic multidecadal oscillation amo and pacific decadal oscillation pdo mo et al 2009 monerie et al 2019 soulard et al 2019 tang et al 2022 wu and zhu 2021 which can reinforce or offset the influence of enso on cdhes in a similar vein for the prediction of cdhes we select only the enso index as the predictor in this study we acknowledge that additional predictors such as initial land conditions and the other large scale teleconnection indices mentioned above are needed to achieve better performance hao et al 2021 li et al 2020 overall other contributing factors that may affect the occurrence of cdhes should be considered in future studies last but not least we focus on the statistical relationship between enso and cdhes based on the empirical analysis and logistic regression model the fundamental physical mechanisms of the atmospheric and oceanic circulations leading to the changed enso cdhes relationships are beyond the scope of this study and omitted from the analysis to improve our understanding of the changed response of cdhes to enso different thermodynamic and dynamic processes contributing to the occurrence of cdhes such as atmospheric circulations pfleiderer et al 2019 and land atmosphere feedback li et al 2018 zhang et al 2020b need to be further explored note that the occurrence of cdhes can be induced by both large scale circulation patterns and anthropogenic warming chiang et al 2022a chiang et al 2022b mukherjee et al 2022 rajeev et al 2022 sarhadi et al 2018 zhang et al 2022 this study mainly investigates the influence of enso without quantification of the relative contribution of anthropogenic warming 5 conclusion this study explored the changing relationship between enso and the occurrence of compound dry and hot events cdhes using the 110 year observational record 1901 2010 across global land areas the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 changes in the relationships between enso and occurrence of cdhes measured by odds ratio from the logistic regression model are observed between two periods 1901 1955 and 1956 2010 in large regions across the globe the enso cdhes relationships become stronger in western south america wsa southern africa saf and southern asia sas and weaker in eastern australia eau 2 due to the changes in the enso cdhes relationship the likelihood of cdhes during enso events experiences noticeable changes between the two periods in many regions under el niño conditions the occurrence probability of cdhes increases from 0 27 0 47 0 40 to 0 58 0 53 0 50 in wsa saf sas and decreases from 0 60 to 0 47 in eau 3 the prediction skill of cdhes occurrence based on the enso index changes over time for the period 1956 2010 relative to 1901 1955 the prediction skill of cdhes increases in wsa saf and sas associated with strengthened enso cdhes relationship and reduces in eau associated with weakened enso cdhes relationship under global warming the changed frequency of enso has been projected in the future results from this study highlight that the response of cdhes or other extremes to enso should be viewed from a nonstationary perspective despite potential limitations of this study such as short data lengths and reliance on statistical analysis without diagnosing physical mechanisms the results of this study can be helpful for risk assessments and early warning of cdhes to reduce their impacts credit authorship contribution

1868,biogeochemical reactions are the key processes that control the cycle and transformation of subsurface materials however biogeochemical reaction rates vary with observation scales such scaling effect are usually addressed with effective parameters but it remains unclear how to estimate these effective parameters in this work we summarized those main factors that may affect the estimation of effective parameters and discussed the variation of effective parameters under different combinations of factors in numerical simulations the results indicate that the substrate sources strongly affect the estimation of the effective parameters in scenarios with identical substrate sources the effective parameters differ little from the intrinsic parameters and thus the macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rate can be directly estimated from the volume averaged concentrations of reactants however in scenarios with different substrate sources the mean field rates usually overestimate the macroscopic effective rates and the extent of such overestimation diminishes with increasing flow velocity or with decreasing da the above results provide meaningful insights into the estimation of macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rates in a variety of natural or artificial scenarios we also decomposed the effective parameters to explain the above results it is suggested that the homogeneous distribution of electron donors electron acceptors and microorganisms as well as their positive spatial correlation with each other are the main reasons for the diminished scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions keywords scale transition classification discussion macroscopic effective rate substrate sources biomass distribution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction biogeochemical reactions are the key processes that control the cycle and transformation of subsurface materials and play a critical role in a variety of scenarios such as in situ bioremediation in aquifers mcmahon 2001 wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands hunt et al 1997 and observation of carbon and nitrogen cycling in hyporheic zones boano et al 2014 liu et al 2017 it is often necessary to estimate the time required for the removal of contaminants or nutrients in these scenarios and therefore accurate prediction of biogeochemical reaction rates at field scale becomes a critical issue ding and benson 2015 wammer and peters 2005 however the biogeochemical reaction rates vary with observation scales extensive numerical simulations ding and benson 2015 jung and meile 2019 yan et al 2017 and site studies chapelle and lovley 1990 harms and bosma 1997 have shown that biogeochemical reaction rates at field scale are generally lower than those at laboratory scale with differences greater than two orders of magnitude the deviation between field scale and lab scale biogeochemical reaction rates also known as scaling effect strongly restricts the extrapolation of biogeochemical models and parameters from lab scale to field scale and becomes a major problem for the field scale application of existing biogeochemical theories the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates have been extensively studied chakrawal et al 2020 jung and meile 2019 liu et al 2014 meile and tuncay 2006 schwarz et al 2022 and generally the spatial heterogeneity and time variability of reactants reaction properties and reaction products are regarded as the most important reasons for the scaling effect bao et al 2014 liu et al 2015 white and brantley 2003 specifically field scale biogeochemical reaction rates are usually estimated based on the volume averaged concentrations of reactants over the entire domain this method of volume averaging ignores the microscopic distribution of biogeochemical reaction rates in heterogeneous systems which depends on the coupling of flow solute transport biogeochemical reactions and microbial growth and decay at microscopic scale li et al 2020 raje and kapoor 2000 zachara et al 2016 extensive studies have also shown that such volume averaging based estimation of reaction rates also known as mean field reaction rates would be effective only in systems with well mixed reactants where the microscopic distribution of the reaction rate is uniform dentz et al 2011 ding and benson 2015 li et al 2006 massoudieh and dentz 2020 wood et al 2007 the above studies imply that it is not feasible to estimate macroscopic reaction rates based on volume averaged concentrations of reactants and existing lab scale biogeochemical kinetic parameters therefore in heterogeneous systems the scale dependent effective kinetic parameters instead of intrinsic kinetic parameters often obtained from lab scale measurement were applied to fit the macroscopic reaction rates using the volume averaged concentrations and the macroscopic rates obtained from the effective kinetic parameters are also known as macroscopic effective reaction rates battiato and tartakovsky 2011 liu et al 2013 however the effective parameter approaches would also be problematic because the estimation of effective parameters requires microscopic information of reactants which are extremely challenging at field scale battiato et al 2009 liu et al 2015 in some recent studies numerical simulations have been performed to estimate the effective parameters for biogeochemical reaction rates chakrawal et al 2020 jung and meile 2019 these studies indicated that effective parameters of the biogeochemical reactions showed strong dependence on the microscopic distributions of reactant and biomass in the reactive transport domain in addition the effects of flow heterogeneity on the effective reactivity parameters were also quantified due to the dominant effect of flow condition on the solute transport jung and navarre sitchler 2018a jung and navarre sitchler 2018b wen and li 2017 on the other hand the reactants for biogeochemical reactions can either be delivered into the domain from the upstream via advection or be released locally so the source of reactants may also significantly influence their microscopic distributions and thus the effective reactivity parameters nevertheless the quantitative impact of reactant source on the effective reactivity parameters of biogeochemical reactions in presence of heterogeneity has not been quantified comprehensively additionally these existing studies usually assumed some specific distributions of biomass e g uniform or random distribution which may also introduce additional biases into the prediction of effective parameters of biogeochemical reactions at field scale to quantify the contribution of different reactant sources on the effective reactivity parameters more specifically the effective rate constant in monod type biogeochemical rate laws see details in section 2 2 this study applies the idea of classification discussion to numerical simulations for further investigation a dual monod expression with a biomass inhibition term was used as an example to describe the rates of biogeochemical reactions and then the effective kinetic parameters macroscopic scale were related to the intrinsic kinetic parameters usually obtained at lab scale experiments using the effective parameter approach next the main factors that may affect the estimation of effective parameters were summarized and a series of numerical simulations were performed in a model that couples flow solute transport biogeochemical reactions and the growth and decay of microorganisms the simulation results were used to evaluate the effects of those main factors including substrate sources flow velocity physicochemical heterogeneity of porous media substrate concentration ratio and substrate retardation effect on the effective parameters revealing the variation patterns of effective kinetic parameters under some typical heterogeneous subsurface scenarios 2 methods 2 1 effective parameter and macroscopic effective reaction rate as in previous study ke et al 2021 aerobic respiration with acetate as electron donors and nitrate as nitrogen source was considered as a simple example to demonstrate the estimation of effective biogeochemical kinetics the overall reaction for biogeochemical reactions and biomass represented using c5h7o2n growth can be expressed using a thermodynamic approach rittmann and mccarty 2001 1 1 8 ch 3 coo 1 f s 4 o 2 f s 28 no 3 f s 28 h f s 28 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 7

macquarrie and sudicky 2001 for each microscopic grid cell i in the simulation domain the macroscopic effective reaction rate can be obtained by averaging eq 2 over the simulation domain 3 r eff v ins

j i k j j c j i c j i k j where v eff t 1 is the effective specific reaction rate it can be seen that r eff r 1 represents an overestimation of the macroscopic effective rate by the mean field rate while r eff r 1 represents an underestimation of the macroscopic effective rate by the mean field rate 2 2 model setup 2 2 1 basic model setup in this study a model coupling water flow eq 10 solute transport eq 9 biogeochemical reactions eqs 2 and 6 microbial growth eq 7 and decay eq 8 was developed to explore the estimation of effective parameters of biogeochemical reaction rates in heterogeneous porous media a two dimensional rectangular heterogeneous media with an initial porosity of 0 35 was used as the simulation domain the rectangular simulation domain had a dimension of 1 5 m 0 5 m and was discretized to 300 100 grid blocks a constant hydraulic head was imposed at the right side boundary while constant flux conditions ranging from 5 10 7 m s to 1 10 4 m s were imposed at the left side boundary no flow boundary conditions were implemented on the top and bottom of the model three groups each with five different distributions of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distributions were generated using sequential gaussian simulation all these heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities follow a log normal distribution with a geometric mean of 1 10 4 m s the first group of distributions share the same standard deviation 0 5 and correlation length 0 5 m but different random seeds and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are noted as k1 k5 respectively fig s1 the second group shares the same standard deviation 0 5 and random seeds but different correlation lengths 0 1 m 0 25 m 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are represented by k6 k10 respectively fig s2 the third group shares the same correlation length 0 5 m and random seeds but different standard deviations 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 1 5 and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are represented by k11 k15 respectively fig s3 biogeochemical reactions shown in eq 1 are assumed to occur in the simulated domain the reaction rate of the electron donors is shown in eq 2 and the reaction rates of other chemicals including biomass can be calculated from the stoichiometric relationship eq 1 6 r ea 2 1 f s

gravity and p m l 1 t 2 is water pressure 2 2 2 simulation scenarios in natural or artificial systems substrates can usually enter the reaction domain by external entry or endogenous release therefore with reference to the most common substrate source scenarios in natural or artificial systems two sets of simulation scenarios were set up in this study according to different substrate sources in scenario a the electron donors were from the same source as electron acceptors both enter the model domain by convection and diffusion from the left boundary of the model domain at a constant concentration however in scenario b the electron donors and electron acceptors come from different sources the electron acceptors still enter the model domain externally while the electron donors doc in this study were slowly released from soil associated organic carbon soc eq 11 and the initial soc distribution was negatively eq 12 e g fig s4a or positively eq 13 e g fig s4b correlated with the

mass of carbon per mole of electron donors μ is the arithmetic mean of lg k and μ is always 4 in this study δ is the standard deviation of lg k in scenario b including b1 b4 it was assumed that the soc was attached to the surface of soil particles and was proportional to the solid mass fraction in the mixed volumes with an initial average soc content of 0 02 g g franzluebbers 1999 yan et al 2016 to keep the soc content consistent for different hydraulic conductivity distributions the values of csoc max vary slightly table s1 during the transport processes of reactive substrates in groundwater mechanisms such as rate limiting adsorption microporous diffusion heterogeneity of nonlinear isotherms or linear equilibrium adsorption coefficients will lead to the retardation of the effective substrates transport velocity dai et al 2009 soltanian et al 2014 which may cause the deformation of substrate plumes thus affecting the estimation of macroscopic effective parameters or effective rates the retardation of transport including convection and diffusion of reactive substrates is usually quantified by retardation factor in this case the transport of substrates in porous media can be expressed by 14 r f ε c i t d i c i u c i r f r i s i where rf is the retardation factor of reactive substrates here we evaluated the influence of retardation on effective parameters estimation by comparing the difference of r eff r equal to v eff v ins under different retardation factors as shown in table 1 we ignore the retardation of electron acceptors for all scenarios chen et al 1992 molz et al 1986 meanwhile the retardation factors of electron donors were assumed to be 1 ignoring retardation 1 25 2 common value of rf for hydrocarbon in literature and 5 extreme value of rf for hydrocarbon in literature respectively chen et al 1992 hubbard et al 1994 schaper et al 2019 waddill and widdowson 1998 in addition to the above differences in substrate sources as well as retardation factors we also set up various scenarios based on the differences in the physicochemical heterogeneity of the porous medium and the concentration ratio of electron donors to electron acceptors respectively as shown in table 1 the variation of r eff r equal to v eff v ins with flow velocity was finally calculated for each scenario eqs 1 to 14 were solved in comsol multiphysics and the parameters used for the simulations were provided in table 2 the steady state solutions were solved for each simulation and soc consumption was ignored so that the simulations can reach steady state 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis as shown in table 2 the model parameters used in this study were taken from several literatures and some important biogeochemical kinetic parameters e g v ins bdec kea ked and kbio had been calibrated with experimental data ke et al 2021 nevertheless sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is still necessary to ensure the reliability of the simulation results normalized sensitivity can be used to evaluate the influence of model parameters of different units or orders of magnitude on the model output bu et al 2021 kabala 2001 and is therefore used for sensitivity analysis in this study since only the steady state results of the model are required in this study the normalized sensitivity can be defined as 15 s p n n p n o p n δ p o p n δ p where spn n is the normalized sensitivity of the nth input parameter at different parameter values and represents the ratio of the absolute change in the model output to the relative change in the corresponding parameter o is the model output i e r eff r or v eff v ins pn refers to the value of nth parameter δp is the increment of the parameter and can be approximated as 10 2 pn huang and yeh 2007 zhu et al 2019 as the purpose of this study is to investigate the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates several kinetic parameters v ins kbio ked and bdec which are most closely related to biogeochemical reactions were selected for normalized sensitivity analysis during the process of sensitivity analysis the hydraulic conductivity distribution was assumed to be k1 and other model settings were consistent with scenario a1 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity fig 1 shows the distribution of the normalized sensitivity of the four parameters v ins kbio ked and bdec for different flow velocities and different parameter values the variation of different parameter values is based on the variation of the corresponding parameters in the literature table s2 in general the parameter sensitivity of the model is low and the variation in model output per unit rate of parameter change does not exceed 0 36 this implies that the effect of parameter variation on the model output is relatively small and the conclusions obtained in this study have good generalizability for different kinetic parameters 3 2 scenario a simulations with the same substrate source as mentioned in eq 5 kinetic parameter v ins is used for scaling analysis in this work furthermore we calculate the damköhler number da of the system defined as da tt tr vinsl u zarnetske et al 2012 where tt t is the water residence time tr t is the scale of reaction time l l is the length of the domain u l t is the magnitude of darcy velocity it is worth noting that the value of da obtained from this equation will be overestimated due to the limitation of biomass and substrates concentration on the dual monod reaction rate fig 2 shows the variation of r eff r equal to v eff v ins as a function of flow velocity in scenario a it can be seen that in scenarios a1 and a2 r eff r varies little for different flow velocities and physicochemical heterogeneities and the values are close to 1 while in scenario a3 and scenario a4 although the substrate retardation effect has a certain effect on r eff r this effect is not significant when the retardation factor of the electron donors reaches 2 or 5 respectively the maximum deviations caused to r eff r do not exceed 20 and 50 respectively compared to when the substrate retardation effect is not considered rf 1 the deviation caused by the substrate retardation effect is almost negligible compared to the widely observed deviations of several orders of magnitude between field scale rates and lab scale rates the above results imply that the differences between the macroscopic effective rates and mean field rates are extremely small when the substrate sources are the same even at different flow velocities hydraulic heterogeneities substrate concentration ratios or retardation effects indicating that the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates are not significant in these scenarios we also observed a slight increase in r eff r with increasing da lower flow velocity which may be attributed to the synergistic distribution of substrates and biomass accumulation there was a similar effect observed in the increasing rf due to the similar contribution of retardation and diminishing advective mass transfer driving force despite this the deviation between r eff and r remained significantly lower compared to scenario b see section 3 3 with values ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 for r eff r consequently it is generally considered a minor effect in parameter scaling schemes we then decompose the effective parameters for biogeochemical reaction rates by the method of volume averaging see supporting information and interpret the simulation results with reference to the distributions of substrates and microorganisms fig 3 shows the steady state spatial distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass at low 5 10 7 m s 1 and high 5 10 5 m s 1 flow velocities in scenario a1 it can be seen that the spatial correlations between electron donors electron acceptors and biomass always tend to be positive at different flow velocities according to raje and kapoor 2000 and liu et al 2015 as well as our derivation in the supporting information the positive correlations between the distributions of reactants colocation of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass have been shown to weaken the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions the distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass in scenario a2 are shown in fig 4 in this scenario the substrate concentration ratio is significantly different from the corresponding stoichiometric ratio in eq 1 thus the relative lack of one substrate electron donors will lead to a relative excess of another substrate electron acceptors resulting in the relatively uniform distribution of the relative excess substrate fig 4a and b and this uniform distribution of substrate will weaken the scaling effect of the reaction rate liu et al 2015 wood et al 2007 meanwhile the distribution of microorganisms will be limited by the relatively depleted kind of substrate leading to a positive correlation between microorganisms and the relatively depleted kind of substrate which will also weaken the scaling effect of the reaction rate figure s5 shows the steady state distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass in scenarios a3 and a4 when the retardation factor of electron donors are 5 it can be seen that the substrate retardation effect on the distribution of substrates and microorganisms is similar to the effect of changing the substrate input or flow velocity in general the retardation of the substrate changes the magnitude of the substrate concentration gradient however the direction of the concentration gradient remained almost constant thus maintaining a positive correlation between the spatial distribution of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass which weakened the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates in these scenarios 3 3 scenario b simulations with different substrate sources fig 5 shows the variation of r eff r as a function of flow velocity in scenario b it can be seen that r eff r varies greatly at different flow velocities and generally shows a trend of increasing with the increase of flow velocity in addition r eff r is also influenced by the physicochemical heterogeneity of porous media however the negative or positive correlation between the soc distribution and the hydraulic conductivity distribution does not seem to make much difference for r eff r moreover in the comparison of 3 groups of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distributions generated in this work the variation of standard deviation k11 k15 has a more significant effect on r eff r than the variation of random seed k1 k5 or correlation length k6 k10 in scenario b1 r eff r is mainly affected by flow velocity and generally shows an increasing trend with the increase of flow velocity fig 5a this is to be expected since the electron acceptors are injected from the left boundary and then transported through the porous medium and thus the electron acceptors will be more distributed in high permeability regions fig 6 a whereas in scenario b1 the electron donors fig 6c are released by soc which are more distributed in low permeability regions meanwhile biomass mainly accumulates in the transition zone between high permeability zone and low permeability zone fig 6e this means that when the system is in a transport limited state da 1 the electron donors electron acceptors and biomass are always spatially negatively correlated with each other spatial segregation of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass which will lead to a severe overestimation of the mean field reaction rate to the macroscopic effective reaction rate liu et al 2015 so that the value of r eff r is much less than 1 however with the increase of flow velocity the reactive transport system will gradually transition from transport limited to reaction limited da decreases at this moment the electron acceptors would be in excess which means that their spatial distribution will become relatively uniform fig 6b meanwhile the distribution of microorganisms will be mainly limited by the relatively scarce kind of substrates electron donors so the spatial correlation between these two tends to be positive fig 6d and f under the effect of the above two mechanisms the overestimation of the mean field reaction rate to the macroscopic effective reaction rate will gradually diminish corresponding to the gradual increase of r eff r in fig 5a and even underestimate the macroscopic effective reaction rate r eff r 1 to our surprise in scenario b2 fig 5b the relationship between r eff r and flow velocity is similar to that in scenario b1 fig 5a in this scenario it s assumed that more electron donors will be there in the high permeability region intuitively indicating that the spatial correlation between electron acceptors and electron donors may tend to be positive however contrary results were showed in fig 7 a and c this is because when the flow velocity is low the flux of electron acceptors will be low the electron donors released from the soc near the flow inlet will rapidly mix with electron acceptors and be consumed leaving only the electron donors released far away from the flow inlet fig 7c where the electron acceptors were consumed up fig 7a resulting in a negative spatial correlation between electron acceptors and electron donors with the increase of flow velocity the injected electron acceptors would become excessive and uniformly fill the simulation domain fig 7b and thus leading to a positive correlation between microorganisms and electron donors fig 7d and f as well as an increase in r eff r in addition in scenarios b3 fig 5c and b4 fig 5d when the substrate concentration ratio was changed the value of r eff r was still less than 1 at lower flow velocities and greater than 1 at higher flow velocities with a mechanism similar to that in scenario b1 and b2 which will not be repeated here 4 discussion the ultimate goal of quantification of r eff r equal to v eff v ins is to deduced the macroscopic reaction rate based on these volume averaged concentrations however as shown in eq 5 as well as in several studies on the estimation of effective mineral dissolution rates li et al 2020 liu et al 2015 wen and li 2018 such estimates still require the microscopic variations in substrates and biomass which are not realistic in field scale applications nevertheless it is well known that the distribution of biomass depends mainly on the local availability of substrates while the local scale distribution of substrates depends on the coupling feedback between their intrinsic reactivity and transport behaviors elosegui and pozo 1998 ke et al 2021 magid et al 2006 the results of this study highlighted that even with the same flow conditions and intrinsic reactivity the different substrate source can significantly alter the microscopic distribution of substrate and thus dominates the scaling effect the simulation scenarios listed in this study are based on the most common scenarios in natural or artificial systems for example scenario a can typically correspond to a constructed wetland gupta et al 2021 rajabzadeh et al 2015 or a biofilm reactor abu hasan et al 2020 where the remediation agent or dissolved oxygen typically enters the reaction system along with the contaminant in addition scenario a is also suitable for describing biogeochemical reactions that occur in some specific natural systems such as in some unidirectional flowing riparian zones or hyporheic zones shuai et al 2017 our results show that in these scenarios the macroscopic effective reaction rate can usually be estimated directly using volume averaged concentrations without additional consideration of the effects of porous media heterogeneity flow velocities substrate concentration ratios and substrate retardation effects scenario b is applicable to describe typical subsurface mineral related reactions li et al 2010 wen and li 2018 or contaminated sites with in situ remediation where remediation agents are usually injected into groundwater to remove existing contaminants from the aquifer faybishenko et al 2008 in these scenarios the mean field reaction rates may either overestimate usually at transport limited conditions da 1 or underestimate usually at reaction limited conditions da close to or greater than 1 the macroscopic effective reaction rates depending on a variety of factors such as flow velocity and physicochemical heterogeneity nevertheless the ratio of macroscopic effective rates to mean field rates generally increase with increasing flow velocity 5 conclusions in this work the scaling effect of biogeochemical kinetics was investigated using the effective parameter approach focusing on the variation patterns of the effective parameters or macroscopic effective rates under different scenarios the results showed that the source of the substrate had a strong influence on the estimation of the effective parameters when different substrates derived from the same source factors such as flow velocity porous media heterogeneity substrate concentration ratio and substrate retardation had little effect on the effective parameters of biogeochemical reaction rates at which moment the difference between the mean field rates and the macroscopic effective rates could be ignored the maximum deviation does not exceed 50 and thus it would be feasible to estimate the macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rate based on the volume averaged concentration of reactants however when the sources of substrates were different there might be orders of magnitude difference between the estimated mean field rates and the macroscopic effective rates depending on a variety of factors such as flow velocity and physicochemical heterogeneity in general the estimated mean field rates would overestimate the macroscopic effective rates at low flow transport limited conditions and as the flow velocity gradually increased as da decreased the degree of such overestimation would decrease we had also further decomposed the effective parameters for the dual monod biogeochemical reaction rate to interpret the above conclusions it is suggested that the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions is controlled by the heterogeneity and spatial correlation of the microscopic distribution of substrates including electron donors and electron acceptors and microorganisms specifically the homogeneous distribution of substrates and microorganisms as well as their positive spatial correlation with each other can weaken the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions declaration of competing interest the authors

1868,biogeochemical reactions are the key processes that control the cycle and transformation of subsurface materials however biogeochemical reaction rates vary with observation scales such scaling effect are usually addressed with effective parameters but it remains unclear how to estimate these effective parameters in this work we summarized those main factors that may affect the estimation of effective parameters and discussed the variation of effective parameters under different combinations of factors in numerical simulations the results indicate that the substrate sources strongly affect the estimation of the effective parameters in scenarios with identical substrate sources the effective parameters differ little from the intrinsic parameters and thus the macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rate can be directly estimated from the volume averaged concentrations of reactants however in scenarios with different substrate sources the mean field rates usually overestimate the macroscopic effective rates and the extent of such overestimation diminishes with increasing flow velocity or with decreasing da the above results provide meaningful insights into the estimation of macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rates in a variety of natural or artificial scenarios we also decomposed the effective parameters to explain the above results it is suggested that the homogeneous distribution of electron donors electron acceptors and microorganisms as well as their positive spatial correlation with each other are the main reasons for the diminished scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions keywords scale transition classification discussion macroscopic effective rate substrate sources biomass distribution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction biogeochemical reactions are the key processes that control the cycle and transformation of subsurface materials and play a critical role in a variety of scenarios such as in situ bioremediation in aquifers mcmahon 2001 wastewater treatment in constructed wetlands hunt et al 1997 and observation of carbon and nitrogen cycling in hyporheic zones boano et al 2014 liu et al 2017 it is often necessary to estimate the time required for the removal of contaminants or nutrients in these scenarios and therefore accurate prediction of biogeochemical reaction rates at field scale becomes a critical issue ding and benson 2015 wammer and peters 2005 however the biogeochemical reaction rates vary with observation scales extensive numerical simulations ding and benson 2015 jung and meile 2019 yan et al 2017 and site studies chapelle and lovley 1990 harms and bosma 1997 have shown that biogeochemical reaction rates at field scale are generally lower than those at laboratory scale with differences greater than two orders of magnitude the deviation between field scale and lab scale biogeochemical reaction rates also known as scaling effect strongly restricts the extrapolation of biogeochemical models and parameters from lab scale to field scale and becomes a major problem for the field scale application of existing biogeochemical theories the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates have been extensively studied chakrawal et al 2020 jung and meile 2019 liu et al 2014 meile and tuncay 2006 schwarz et al 2022 and generally the spatial heterogeneity and time variability of reactants reaction properties and reaction products are regarded as the most important reasons for the scaling effect bao et al 2014 liu et al 2015 white and brantley 2003 specifically field scale biogeochemical reaction rates are usually estimated based on the volume averaged concentrations of reactants over the entire domain this method of volume averaging ignores the microscopic distribution of biogeochemical reaction rates in heterogeneous systems which depends on the coupling of flow solute transport biogeochemical reactions and microbial growth and decay at microscopic scale li et al 2020 raje and kapoor 2000 zachara et al 2016 extensive studies have also shown that such volume averaging based estimation of reaction rates also known as mean field reaction rates would be effective only in systems with well mixed reactants where the microscopic distribution of the reaction rate is uniform dentz et al 2011 ding and benson 2015 li et al 2006 massoudieh and dentz 2020 wood et al 2007 the above studies imply that it is not feasible to estimate macroscopic reaction rates based on volume averaged concentrations of reactants and existing lab scale biogeochemical kinetic parameters therefore in heterogeneous systems the scale dependent effective kinetic parameters instead of intrinsic kinetic parameters often obtained from lab scale measurement were applied to fit the macroscopic reaction rates using the volume averaged concentrations and the macroscopic rates obtained from the effective kinetic parameters are also known as macroscopic effective reaction rates battiato and tartakovsky 2011 liu et al 2013 however the effective parameter approaches would also be problematic because the estimation of effective parameters requires microscopic information of reactants which are extremely challenging at field scale battiato et al 2009 liu et al 2015 in some recent studies numerical simulations have been performed to estimate the effective parameters for biogeochemical reaction rates chakrawal et al 2020 jung and meile 2019 these studies indicated that effective parameters of the biogeochemical reactions showed strong dependence on the microscopic distributions of reactant and biomass in the reactive transport domain in addition the effects of flow heterogeneity on the effective reactivity parameters were also quantified due to the dominant effect of flow condition on the solute transport jung and navarre sitchler 2018a jung and navarre sitchler 2018b wen and li 2017 on the other hand the reactants for biogeochemical reactions can either be delivered into the domain from the upstream via advection or be released locally so the source of reactants may also significantly influence their microscopic distributions and thus the effective reactivity parameters nevertheless the quantitative impact of reactant source on the effective reactivity parameters of biogeochemical reactions in presence of heterogeneity has not been quantified comprehensively additionally these existing studies usually assumed some specific distributions of biomass e g uniform or random distribution which may also introduce additional biases into the prediction of effective parameters of biogeochemical reactions at field scale to quantify the contribution of different reactant sources on the effective reactivity parameters more specifically the effective rate constant in monod type biogeochemical rate laws see details in section 2 2 this study applies the idea of classification discussion to numerical simulations for further investigation a dual monod expression with a biomass inhibition term was used as an example to describe the rates of biogeochemical reactions and then the effective kinetic parameters macroscopic scale were related to the intrinsic kinetic parameters usually obtained at lab scale experiments using the effective parameter approach next the main factors that may affect the estimation of effective parameters were summarized and a series of numerical simulations were performed in a model that couples flow solute transport biogeochemical reactions and the growth and decay of microorganisms the simulation results were used to evaluate the effects of those main factors including substrate sources flow velocity physicochemical heterogeneity of porous media substrate concentration ratio and substrate retardation effect on the effective parameters revealing the variation patterns of effective kinetic parameters under some typical heterogeneous subsurface scenarios 2 methods 2 1 effective parameter and macroscopic effective reaction rate as in previous study ke et al 2021 aerobic respiration with acetate as electron donors and nitrate as nitrogen source was considered as a simple example to demonstrate the estimation of effective biogeochemical kinetics the overall reaction for biogeochemical reactions and biomass represented using c5h7o2n growth can be expressed using a thermodynamic approach rittmann and mccarty 2001 1 1 8 ch 3 coo 1 f s 4 o 2 f s 28 no 3 f s 28 h f s 28 c 5 h 7 o 2 n 7

macquarrie and sudicky 2001 for each microscopic grid cell i in the simulation domain the macroscopic effective reaction rate can be obtained by averaging eq 2 over the simulation domain 3 r eff v ins

j i k j j c j i c j i k j where v eff t 1 is the effective specific reaction rate it can be seen that r eff r 1 represents an overestimation of the macroscopic effective rate by the mean field rate while r eff r 1 represents an underestimation of the macroscopic effective rate by the mean field rate 2 2 model setup 2 2 1 basic model setup in this study a model coupling water flow eq 10 solute transport eq 9 biogeochemical reactions eqs 2 and 6 microbial growth eq 7 and decay eq 8 was developed to explore the estimation of effective parameters of biogeochemical reaction rates in heterogeneous porous media a two dimensional rectangular heterogeneous media with an initial porosity of 0 35 was used as the simulation domain the rectangular simulation domain had a dimension of 1 5 m 0 5 m and was discretized to 300 100 grid blocks a constant hydraulic head was imposed at the right side boundary while constant flux conditions ranging from 5 10 7 m s to 1 10 4 m s were imposed at the left side boundary no flow boundary conditions were implemented on the top and bottom of the model three groups each with five different distributions of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distributions were generated using sequential gaussian simulation all these heterogeneous hydraulic conductivities follow a log normal distribution with a geometric mean of 1 10 4 m s the first group of distributions share the same standard deviation 0 5 and correlation length 0 5 m but different random seeds and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are noted as k1 k5 respectively fig s1 the second group shares the same standard deviation 0 5 and random seeds but different correlation lengths 0 1 m 0 25 m 0 5 m 1 m and 1 5 m and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are represented by k6 k10 respectively fig s2 the third group shares the same correlation length 0 5 m and random seeds but different standard deviations 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 1 5 and the generated heterogeneous hydraulic conduction distributions are represented by k11 k15 respectively fig s3 biogeochemical reactions shown in eq 1 are assumed to occur in the simulated domain the reaction rate of the electron donors is shown in eq 2 and the reaction rates of other chemicals including biomass can be calculated from the stoichiometric relationship eq 1 6 r ea 2 1 f s

dt r bio b dec c bio where bdec t 1 is specific biomass decay coefficient the local concentrations of solute substrates depend on the combined effect of advective and diffusive transport in the

gravity and p m l 1 t 2 is water pressure 2 2 2 simulation scenarios in natural or artificial systems substrates can usually enter the reaction domain by external entry or endogenous release therefore with reference to the most common substrate source scenarios in natural or artificial systems two sets of simulation scenarios were set up in this study according to different substrate sources in scenario a the electron donors were from the same source as electron acceptors both enter the model domain by convection and diffusion from the left boundary of the model domain at a constant concentration however in scenario b the electron donors and electron acceptors come from different sources the electron acceptors still enter the model domain externally while the electron donors doc in this study were slowly released from soil associated organic carbon soc eq 11 and the initial soc distribution was negatively eq 12 e g fig s4a or positively eq 13 e g fig s4b correlated with the hydraulic conductivity distribution 11 s ed ρ s 1 ε k sl c soc k d c ed m ed m ed 12 c soc c s o c max lg k μ 4 δ lg k 4 0 lg k 4 13 c soc 0 lg k 4 c s o c max lg k μ 4 δ lg k 4 where csoc is the mass fraction of soc in porous media in terms of elemental carbon sed n l 3 t 1 is the additional source of electron donors ρs m l 3 is the density of sediment solids ksl t 1 is the mass transfer coefficient between soc and doc kd l3 m 1 is the adsorption desorption equilibrium constant of organic carbon in terms of elemental carbon csoc max is the maximum mass fraction of soc med m n 1 is the mass of carbon per mole of electron donors μ is the arithmetic mean of lg k and μ is always 4 in this study δ is the standard deviation of lg k in scenario b including b1 b4 it was assumed that the soc was attached to the surface of soil particles and was proportional to the solid mass fraction in the mixed volumes with an initial average soc content of 0 02 g g franzluebbers 1999 yan et al 2016 to keep the soc content consistent for different hydraulic conductivity distributions the values of csoc max vary slightly table s1 during the transport processes of reactive substrates in groundwater mechanisms such as rate limiting adsorption microporous diffusion heterogeneity of nonlinear isotherms or linear equilibrium adsorption coefficients will lead to the retardation of the effective substrates transport velocity dai et al 2009 soltanian et al 2014 which may cause the deformation of substrate plumes thus affecting the estimation of macroscopic effective parameters or effective rates the retardation of transport including convection and diffusion of reactive substrates is usually quantified by retardation factor in this case the transport of substrates in porous media can be expressed by 14 r f ε c i t d i c i u c i r f r i s i where rf is the retardation factor of reactive substrates here we evaluated the influence of retardation on effective parameters estimation by comparing the difference of r eff r equal to v eff v ins under different retardation factors as shown in table 1 we ignore the retardation of electron acceptors for all scenarios chen et al 1992 molz et al 1986 meanwhile the retardation factors of electron donors were assumed to be 1 ignoring retardation 1 25 2 common value of rf for hydrocarbon in literature and 5 extreme value of rf for hydrocarbon in literature respectively chen et al 1992 hubbard et al 1994 schaper et al 2019 waddill and widdowson 1998 in addition to the above differences in substrate sources as well as retardation factors we also set up various scenarios based on the differences in the physicochemical heterogeneity of the porous medium and the concentration ratio of electron donors to electron acceptors respectively as shown in table 1 the variation of r eff r equal to v eff v ins with flow velocity was finally calculated for each scenario eqs 1 to 14 were solved in comsol multiphysics and the parameters used for the simulations were provided in table 2 the steady state solutions were solved for each simulation and soc consumption was ignored so that the simulations can reach steady state 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis as shown in table 2 the model parameters used in this study were taken from several literatures and some important biogeochemical kinetic parameters e g v ins bdec kea ked and kbio had been calibrated with experimental data ke et al 2021 nevertheless sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is still necessary to ensure the reliability of the simulation results normalized sensitivity can be used to evaluate the influence of model parameters of different units or orders of magnitude on the model output bu et al 2021 kabala 2001 and is therefore used for sensitivity analysis in this study since only the steady state results of the model are required in this study the normalized sensitivity can be defined as 15 s p n n p n o p n δ p o p n δ p where spn n is the normalized sensitivity of the nth input parameter at different parameter values and represents the ratio of the absolute change in the model output to the relative change in the corresponding parameter o is the model output i e r eff r or v eff v ins pn refers to the value of nth parameter δp is the increment of the parameter and can be approximated as 10 2 pn huang and yeh 2007 zhu et al 2019 as the purpose of this study is to investigate the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates several kinetic parameters v ins kbio ked and bdec which are most closely related to biogeochemical reactions were selected for normalized sensitivity analysis during the process of sensitivity analysis the hydraulic conductivity distribution was assumed to be k1 and other model settings were consistent with scenario a1 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity fig 1 shows the distribution of the normalized sensitivity of the four parameters v ins kbio ked and bdec for different flow velocities and different parameter values the variation of different parameter values is based on the variation of the corresponding parameters in the literature table s2 in general the parameter sensitivity of the model is low and the variation in model output per unit rate of parameter change does not exceed 0 36 this implies that the effect of parameter variation on the model output is relatively small and the conclusions obtained in this study have good generalizability for different kinetic parameters 3 2 scenario a simulations with the same substrate source as mentioned in eq 5 kinetic parameter v ins is used for scaling analysis in this work furthermore we calculate the damköhler number da of the system defined as da tt tr vinsl u zarnetske et al 2012 where tt t is the water residence time tr t is the scale of reaction time l l is the length of the domain u l t is the magnitude of darcy velocity it is worth noting that the value of da obtained from this equation will be overestimated due to the limitation of biomass and substrates concentration on the dual monod reaction rate fig 2 shows the variation of r eff r equal to v eff v ins as a function of flow velocity in scenario a it can be seen that in scenarios a1 and a2 r eff r varies little for different flow velocities and physicochemical heterogeneities and the values are close to 1 while in scenario a3 and scenario a4 although the substrate retardation effect has a certain effect on r eff r this effect is not significant when the retardation factor of the electron donors reaches 2 or 5 respectively the maximum deviations caused to r eff r do not exceed 20 and 50 respectively compared to when the substrate retardation effect is not considered rf 1 the deviation caused by the substrate retardation effect is almost negligible compared to the widely observed deviations of several orders of magnitude between field scale rates and lab scale rates the above results imply that the differences between the macroscopic effective rates and mean field rates are extremely small when the substrate sources are the same even at different flow velocities hydraulic heterogeneities substrate concentration ratios or retardation effects indicating that the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates are not significant in these scenarios we also observed a slight increase in r eff r with increasing da lower flow velocity which may be attributed to the synergistic distribution of substrates and biomass accumulation there was a similar effect observed in the increasing rf due to the similar contribution of retardation and diminishing advective mass transfer driving force despite this the deviation between r eff and r remained significantly lower compared to scenario b see section 3 3 with values ranging from 0 7 to 1 5 for r eff r consequently it is generally considered a minor effect in parameter scaling schemes we then decompose the effective parameters for biogeochemical reaction rates by the method of volume averaging see supporting information and interpret the simulation results with reference to the distributions of substrates and microorganisms fig 3 shows the steady state spatial distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass at low 5 10 7 m s 1 and high 5 10 5 m s 1 flow velocities in scenario a1 it can be seen that the spatial correlations between electron donors electron acceptors and biomass always tend to be positive at different flow velocities according to raje and kapoor 2000 and liu et al 2015 as well as our derivation in the supporting information the positive correlations between the distributions of reactants colocation of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass have been shown to weaken the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions the distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass in scenario a2 are shown in fig 4 in this scenario the substrate concentration ratio is significantly different from the corresponding stoichiometric ratio in eq 1 thus the relative lack of one substrate electron donors will lead to a relative excess of another substrate electron acceptors resulting in the relatively uniform distribution of the relative excess substrate fig 4a and b and this uniform distribution of substrate will weaken the scaling effect of the reaction rate liu et al 2015 wood et al 2007 meanwhile the distribution of microorganisms will be limited by the relatively depleted kind of substrate leading to a positive correlation between microorganisms and the relatively depleted kind of substrate which will also weaken the scaling effect of the reaction rate figure s5 shows the steady state distributions of electron acceptors electron donors and biomass in scenarios a3 and a4 when the retardation factor of electron donors are 5 it can be seen that the substrate retardation effect on the distribution of substrates and microorganisms is similar to the effect of changing the substrate input or flow velocity in general the retardation of the substrate changes the magnitude of the substrate concentration gradient however the direction of the concentration gradient remained almost constant thus maintaining a positive correlation between the spatial distribution of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass which weakened the scaling effect of biogeochemical reaction rates in these scenarios 3 3 scenario b simulations with different substrate sources fig 5 shows the variation of r eff r as a function of flow velocity in scenario b it can be seen that r eff r varies greatly at different flow velocities and generally shows a trend of increasing with the increase of flow velocity in addition r eff r is also influenced by the physicochemical heterogeneity of porous media however the negative or positive correlation between the soc distribution and the hydraulic conductivity distribution does not seem to make much difference for r eff r moreover in the comparison of 3 groups of heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity distributions generated in this work the variation of standard deviation k11 k15 has a more significant effect on r eff r than the variation of random seed k1 k5 or correlation length k6 k10 in scenario b1 r eff r is mainly affected by flow velocity and generally shows an increasing trend with the increase of flow velocity fig 5a this is to be expected since the electron acceptors are injected from the left boundary and then transported through the porous medium and thus the electron acceptors will be more distributed in high permeability regions fig 6 a whereas in scenario b1 the electron donors fig 6c are released by soc which are more distributed in low permeability regions meanwhile biomass mainly accumulates in the transition zone between high permeability zone and low permeability zone fig 6e this means that when the system is in a transport limited state da 1 the electron donors electron acceptors and biomass are always spatially negatively correlated with each other spatial segregation of electron donors electron acceptors and biomass which will lead to a severe overestimation of the mean field reaction rate to the macroscopic effective reaction rate liu et al 2015 so that the value of r eff r is much less than 1 however with the increase of flow velocity the reactive transport system will gradually transition from transport limited to reaction limited da decreases at this moment the electron acceptors would be in excess which means that their spatial distribution will become relatively uniform fig 6b meanwhile the distribution of microorganisms will be mainly limited by the relatively scarce kind of substrates electron donors so the spatial correlation between these two tends to be positive fig 6d and f under the effect of the above two mechanisms the overestimation of the mean field reaction rate to the macroscopic effective reaction rate will gradually diminish corresponding to the gradual increase of r eff r in fig 5a and even underestimate the macroscopic effective reaction rate r eff r 1 to our surprise in scenario b2 fig 5b the relationship between r eff r and flow velocity is similar to that in scenario b1 fig 5a in this scenario it s assumed that more electron donors will be there in the high permeability region intuitively indicating that the spatial correlation between electron acceptors and electron donors may tend to be positive however contrary results were showed in fig 7 a and c this is because when the flow velocity is low the flux of electron acceptors will be low the electron donors released from the soc near the flow inlet will rapidly mix with electron acceptors and be consumed leaving only the electron donors released far away from the flow inlet fig 7c where the electron acceptors were consumed up fig 7a resulting in a negative spatial correlation between electron acceptors and electron donors with the increase of flow velocity the injected electron acceptors would become excessive and uniformly fill the simulation domain fig 7b and thus leading to a positive correlation between microorganisms and electron donors fig 7d and f as well as an increase in r eff r in addition in scenarios b3 fig 5c and b4 fig 5d when the substrate concentration ratio was changed the value of r eff r was still less than 1 at lower flow velocities and greater than 1 at higher flow velocities with a mechanism similar to that in scenario b1 and b2 which will not be repeated here 4 discussion the ultimate goal of quantification of r eff r equal to v eff v ins is to deduced the macroscopic reaction rate based on these volume averaged concentrations however as shown in eq 5 as well as in several studies on the estimation of effective mineral dissolution rates li et al 2020 liu et al 2015 wen and li 2018 such estimates still require the microscopic variations in substrates and biomass which are not realistic in field scale applications nevertheless it is well known that the distribution of biomass depends mainly on the local availability of substrates while the local scale distribution of substrates depends on the coupling feedback between their intrinsic reactivity and transport behaviors elosegui and pozo 1998 ke et al 2021 magid et al 2006 the results of this study highlighted that even with the same flow conditions and intrinsic reactivity the different substrate source can significantly alter the microscopic distribution of substrate and thus dominates the scaling effect the simulation scenarios listed in this study are based on the most common scenarios in natural or artificial systems for example scenario a can typically correspond to a constructed wetland gupta et al 2021 rajabzadeh et al 2015 or a biofilm reactor abu hasan et al 2020 where the remediation agent or dissolved oxygen typically enters the reaction system along with the contaminant in addition scenario a is also suitable for describing biogeochemical reactions that occur in some specific natural systems such as in some unidirectional flowing riparian zones or hyporheic zones shuai et al 2017 our results show that in these scenarios the macroscopic effective reaction rate can usually be estimated directly using volume averaged concentrations without additional consideration of the effects of porous media heterogeneity flow velocities substrate concentration ratios and substrate retardation effects scenario b is applicable to describe typical subsurface mineral related reactions li et al 2010 wen and li 2018 or contaminated sites with in situ remediation where remediation agents are usually injected into groundwater to remove existing contaminants from the aquifer faybishenko et al 2008 in these scenarios the mean field reaction rates may either overestimate usually at transport limited conditions da 1 or underestimate usually at reaction limited conditions da close to or greater than 1 the macroscopic effective reaction rates depending on a variety of factors such as flow velocity and physicochemical heterogeneity nevertheless the ratio of macroscopic effective rates to mean field rates generally increase with increasing flow velocity 5 conclusions in this work the scaling effect of biogeochemical kinetics was investigated using the effective parameter approach focusing on the variation patterns of the effective parameters or macroscopic effective rates under different scenarios the results showed that the source of the substrate had a strong influence on the estimation of the effective parameters when different substrates derived from the same source factors such as flow velocity porous media heterogeneity substrate concentration ratio and substrate retardation had little effect on the effective parameters of biogeochemical reaction rates at which moment the difference between the mean field rates and the macroscopic effective rates could be ignored the maximum deviation does not exceed 50 and thus it would be feasible to estimate the macroscopic effective biogeochemical reaction rate based on the volume averaged concentration of reactants however when the sources of substrates were different there might be orders of magnitude difference between the estimated mean field rates and the macroscopic effective rates depending on a variety of factors such as flow velocity and physicochemical heterogeneity in general the estimated mean field rates would overestimate the macroscopic effective rates at low flow transport limited conditions and as the flow velocity gradually increased as da decreased the degree of such overestimation would decrease we had also further decomposed the effective parameters for the dual monod biogeochemical reaction rate to interpret the above conclusions it is suggested that the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions is controlled by the heterogeneity and spatial correlation of the microscopic distribution of substrates including electron donors and electron acceptors and microorganisms specifically the homogeneous distribution of substrates and microorganisms as well as their positive spatial correlation with each other can weaken the scaling effect of biogeochemical reactions declaration of competing interest the authors

1869,this comprehensive risk assessment done for a mar facility in tarnów southern poland covers two mar techniques infiltration ditches and induced bank filtration during the operation and planned potential expansion phases two methods were applied the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix and the probabilistic risk assessment fault tree analysis pra fta and their advantages and limitations analysed both methods examine a range of technical and non technical risks that may pose a threat to the efficient functioning of the mar facility in tarnów which supplies about 25 of the city s population with drinking water it was found that 34 of the 65 risks analysed could pose a low to high risk for the świerczków well field the predominant risks potentially reducing mar efficiency or leading to mar failure are technical ones according to the pra fta method if no preventive measures are taken there is a 99 5 and 99 3 probability of the mar system failing during the operational and expansion phases respectively the results indicate that the most serious risk is associated with the insufficient initial removal from the recharge river water of suspended solids which clog infiltration ditches the risks scored as medium relate to the threat of groundwater inflow from an extensive industrial zone lying to the east of the well field and to climate change negatively affecting the quantity of groundwater resources this is the first example in poland of a risk assessment for an existing mar facility and its expansion based on a broad spectrum of technical and non technical risks present at the świerczków well field using two methods the risk assessment matrix and pra fta this case study is a practical example of how to perform a risk analysis for a mar site it can make an important contribution to existing knowledge in this field and enrich the subject literature a particularly relevant aspect given the widespread use of mar techniques in central europe for the supply of drinking water to the public keywords risk assessment managed aquifer recharge risk assessment matrix probabilistic risk assessment fault tree analysis data availability the data

recharge of water originating from various sources to a suitable aquifer under controlled conditions for later needs sources of water for recharge may include natural seasonal or intermittent excess watercourse runoff treated wastewater and stormwater or desalinated water nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 alam et al 2021 mar comprises a variety of techniques i a surface spreading methods levintal et al 2022 aquifer storage and recovery asr page et al 2017 induced bank filtration ibf matusiak et al 2021 soil aquifer treatment regnery et al 2016 or underground dams raju et al 2013 which are being increasingly used in order to maintain enhance and secure groundwater systems under different stressors at the local or basin scale dillon 2005 dillon et al 2019 deepwater ce 2020 alam et al 2021 mar has applications in sustaining and enhancing groundwater quality and quantity but also in environmental management dillon et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 one of the main advantages of mar is that it can play an important role in improving groundwater quality moeck et al 2017 li et al 2019 or managing environmental changes and extreme weather events such as droughts dillon et al 2019 tran et al 2020 or floods standen et al 2020 the quality of recharge water including its microbiological aspects can be improved by natural attenuation during infiltration through an unsaturated zone betancourt et al 2014 kvitsand et al 2017 górski et al 2018 which subsequently can significantly reduce the concentrations of some chemical components in groundwater by dilution alam et al 2021 garcía menéndez et al 2021 as a specific kind of hydrodynamic barrier infiltrated water can also prevent seawater intrusions rodríguez escales et al 2018 or reduce the inflow of polluted groundwater from industrial zones as is the case in the study area since mar techniques are relatively inexpensive solutions utilised to counter water shortage and declining groundwater quality they are being applied worldwide dillon et al 2019 escalante et al 2019 alam et al 2021 patenaude et al 2020 levintal et al 2022 globally since the 1960s implementation of mar projects has been accelerating at a rate of 5 per year dillon et al 2019 however the potential environmental and other benefits of mar may not be fully achievable if mar facilities are not properly operated and managed rodríguez escales et al 2018 ajjur and baalousha 2021 each mar scheme is exposed to multiple risks that should be properly identified assessed prevented and treated comprehensive risk management can and should be applied at facilities using mar to enhance the efficiency safety and sustainability of their operations holistic risk assessment for mar should focus on all the crucial aspects of its functioning at the design construction and operation stages taking into account both technical and non technical groups of risks a general review of the risk assessment methods used in the context of mar was given by imig et al 2022 the australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks phase 1 nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 define risk as the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in exposed populations or receiving environments in a specified timeframe including the severity of the consequence risk likelihood impact on the other hand the iso 31000 2018 risk management guidelines standard defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives iso 31000 2018 an effect is a deviation from the expected it can be positive negative or both and can address create or result in opportunities and threats the iso standard like the definition presented in the australian guidelines expresses risk as a combination of the consequences of an event and the associated likelihood this approach to risk was applied in this study in relation to the risk matrix method in our opinion the most interesting proposal for defining risk in direct relation to mar was proposed by rodríguez escales et al 2018 who defined risk as the probability of an undesired outcome happening evaluated as a percentage of occurrence that causes damage directly e g breakage of pipes or indirectly e g perception of effectiveness to the recharge system therefore leading to a failure during the operation or design phase of the mar facility maliva and missimer 2012 emphasise that risk assessment is a critical element of any mar system and undertaking it during the design phase should determine whether the project is technically and economically feasible and meets the regulatory requirements the objectives of this study were 1 to carry out risk assessments for a mar site at two stages of viability the operational phase of the existing site op and the design and construction phase of a potential mar site expansion ep and 2 to assess the suitability advantages and limitations of the method used for performing the mar risk assessment and a comparative analysis of the utility of the two methods for this purpose the study was conducted using two methods the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 blackmore et al 2008 jabari et al 2020 abolli et al 2021 and probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 the methods chosen had to cover a wide range of technical t op t ep and non technical nt op nt ep risks with respect to the same two mar techniques i e induced bank filtration ibf and infiltration ditches the applicability of these two risk assessment methods was tested at the mar facility located on the świerczków well field in tarnów southern poland this well field one of the three main ones belonging to the tarnów waterworks supplies drinking water to the city and municipality of tarnów in southern poland evaluation of the most significant risks will allow a detailed countermeasure plan to be developed to secure the well field s operation previously published

treichel et al 2015 recent research has been carried out within the framework of the deepwater ce project in which among other things the feasibility of expanding the mar site based on an assessment of environmental and economic considerations was evaluated the results of the latter were obtained with the aid of a cost benefit analysis halytsia et al 2022 which showed that the total economic value of mar expansion in the study area including both use and non use benefits exceeded the cost of introducing and maintaining the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 mar site the świerczków well

thickness at the well field is about 8 12 m wojtal et al 2009 deepwater ce 2021 the top of the shallow quaternary aquifer is overlain by approx 1 3 m of semipermeable deposits consisting of loams silts and organic silts the unconfined aquifer is composed of sands and gravels with a substantial fraction of pebbles in the bottom part it lies on an impermeable clayey miocene bed wojtal et al 2009 treichel et al 2015 the depth of the water table at the well field depends on the water level in the dunajec the groundwater abstraction rate and the intensity of natural and managed aquifer recharge the water table varies from 180 to 183 m a s l the dynamic water level in the wells to 186 187 m a s l in the south western part of the study area the general groundwater flow direction in the region is from the east and south east towards the draining river dunajec but existing infiltration ditches and operating wells significantly modify it locally at the well field fig 1 the natural groundwater inflow from the east and south east is characterised by elevated concentrations of ammonium up to 14 11 mg l and nitrate up to 27 mg l and also in the northern part where the expansion is planned of sodium up to 288 mg l chloride up to 368 mg l and sulphate up to 180 mg l which are the consequences of the long term negative impact of the nearby chemical plant and chp tab 1 in order to limit the inflow of contaminated groundwater from the industrial zone and increase groundwater resources mar techniques i e infiltration ditches and ibf were applied because the appropriate high water table in the ditches is maintained artificially inflow of groundwater from the industrial zone is limited infiltration of surface water supplied from the dunajec through the ditch beds improves groundwater quality and increases groundwater resources this was demonstrated by water quality and quantity monitoring during the deepwater ce project 2019 2022 deepwater ce 2022 before recharging the ditches river water is pre treated in settling tanks deposition ponds located about 1 km south of the well field in order to reduce the volume of suspended solids fig 1 even so approx every 3 5 years the ditch beds have to be cleaned scraped after being drained to mitigate clogging the average daily volume of surface water pumped into the ditches is about 4250 m3 d the mar methods used improve the quality of the water from the dunajec because of their high capacity to remove pathogens microbiological contamination in the dunajec by coliforms can exceed ten thousand cfu 100 ml and by clostridium perfringens ranges from a few dozen to a few hundred cfu 100 ml in raw water from a collector caisson the number of coliforms decreases to 1 9 a cfu 100 ml and clostridium perfringens is completely eliminated analyses of organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and microplastics in the dunajec and groundwater samples did not reveal any contamination in contrast residues of some pharmaceutical and personal care products were present in surface water samples as were trace concentrations of them in groundwater even so these concentrations were noticeably lower in the study area than in other regions of poland ślósarczyk et al 2021 deepwater ce 2022 a complementary mar technique employed at the świerczków well field is induced bank filtration ibf because the groundwater table is lowered as a result of the operation of two pumping wells located near the dunajec fig 1 and the resulting change in the hydraulic groundwater gradient river water infiltrates into the aquifer the intensity of the process depends greatly on the well pumping rate and the river s water level the average rate of groundwater abstraction for drinking purposes at the well field in 2020 was 6500 m3 d while the maximum rate specified in the water permit is 8500 m3 d since 1910 the świerczków well field has been expanded several times and currently consists of 17 wells and four infiltration ditches with a total length of approx 450 m fig 1 the wells are connected to two siphon pipelines both supply groundwater to the collector caisson which has no connection with the aquifer and is located behind the floodbank fig 1 before entering the municipal network mixed groundwater from all the wells is post treated only with chlorine dioxide 2 2 risk assessment methods based on the available data on the świerczków well field mar site specifics and the applicability of the methods during both the op and the ep we decided to select two methods for the risk assessment the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 and the probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 the choice of the methodology used in the risk assessment for this study was dictated by the fact that both approaches are reliable and credible tested in practice can be used to assess a diverse group of risks can provide a broad view during the initial stages of an investigation and also yield results that are readily comprehensible to project stakeholders in the first method the risk assessment process involves the estimation of two parameters the likelihood here the frequency with which identified hazards may pose a risk to the mar system and the severity of the consequences associated with the occurrence of a given hazard risk matrices usually distinguish five degrees of the likelihood graves 2000 of a specific hazard rare unlikely possible likely almost certain and five degrees of the consequences of a given hazard insignificant minor moderate major catastrophic nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 however these five point scales should be treated as general guidelines and always be adapted to the specific case study for which the risk assessment is being performed after matching every hazard to the matrix by ascribing to it a score for the likelihood of occurrence e g rating 1 2 3 4 5 and foreseen consequences e g rating 1 2 3 4 5 the values in the rows and columns of the matrix are multiplied the higher the values obtained the higher the risk such numerical rankings provide a relative indication of the likelihood and consequence s of an event so it is important not to assume their accuracy in absolute terms this method is a subjective one so its accuracy depends greatly on the knowledge and experience of the persons conducting it the second method is probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta which can be applied directly to mar schemes the methodology evaluates the probability of mar failure if no preventive measures are taken existing mitigation measures at the świerczków well field were excluded for the needs of this study taking various risks into account at two mar viability stages the op and the ep the core idea of this method is to take a complicated system to be assessed as one unit the entire mar system and to split it into a set of quasi independent and less complex hazardous basic events that are individually more manageable once the probabilities of occurrence of the basic events have been calculated they are recombined in a systematic manner to present a holistic risk assessment of the mar facility as a whole rodríguez escales et al 2018 the probabilities of occurrence of basic events were matched to the specific conditions in the świerczków well field area a special working group of experts working within the framework of the deepwater ce project was set up to determine them the group included well field employees hydrogeologist and technologist who have been working at the site for many years and are thoroughly familiar with its operation and everyday reality as well as experienced hydrogeologists from the university of silesia in katowice the values established were based on personal subjective opinions however their basis was a wealth of previous experience and knowledge of the study area cooperation with the tarnów waterworks staff was therefore a sine qua non their practical experience allowed us to ultimately assign an appropriate probability to each basic risk column g in the supplementary materials tables a 1 a 4 the methodology applied in our study was the scheme defined by bedford and cooke 2003 and further modified by rodríguez escales et al 2018 the first step in implementing this approach is to define the concept of a potential mar system failure and to identify the set of negative events risks that may affect the proper continuous operation of a mar facility in this case the świerczków well field the second step is to create an accurate fault tree so as to avoid situations where events affecting the mar facility are dependent on each other in this method all events should be as independent as possible from each other the third step is a mathematical fault tree expression based on boolean algebra and the final step is to determine the probability of occurrence of the individual events that may affect the system based on the fault tree results assignment of the probabilities of mar system failure a full description of which can be found in rodríguez escales et al 2018 involves the determination of the specific probability for each basic event risk at the bottom of the fault tree based on expert knowledge but also using boolean algebra rules until the top of the fault tree complete system failure is reached the boolean operators indicate a set of key events risks that may lead to total or partial mar system failure based on these operations a hierarchy of importance was set up from the least important to the most significant risk the risks were treated in such a way that the occurrence of at least one risk from a given risk sub group caused a threat to mar leading to the cessation of facility operation operator or on the other hand when all of the events from a subgroup needed to be present for mar failure the operator and should be used however in our case only the or operator was applicable the basic principles of boolean algebra are as follows taking the main event c as the sum of events a and b the function of these events is calculated as follows equation 1 1 p c p a b p a p b p a b where p c is the probability of an issue risk that depends on the probability of two other events in this case issue a p a and issue b p b p a and p b are previously defined criteria expert or previously calculated in the fault tree if they are not in the lowest part of the fault tree p a b is the intersection the risk assessment for the mar facility that we analysed was done using a microsoft excel macro called assessment tool for risk evaluation and potential mitigation activities the mar riskapp mar riskapp this tool was developed and successfully applied during the eu fp7 marsol project for the risk assessment carried out for six different mar facilities situated in the mediterranean basin marsol 2016 the macro can be used to evaluate the risk of mar facility failure during both the op and the ep it is important to notice that mar failure is defined by rodríguez escales et al 2018 as the need to bring the facility s operation to a halt which can be either complete or partial partial failure means that the problem can be mitigated or fixed within a short period of time and the mar s operation restored complete failure means that the facility must undergo significant revisions and repairs to be able to operate again and a catastrophic event may render a mar non operational in our study partial failures are the most probable the logic behind this approach is that the tarnów waterworks staff is familiar with the long running mar system which has been in operation since the 1960s 2 3 national legislation and policies on mar risk assessment in poland and the eu there are no regulations relating directly to risk assessment and management in the context of mar escalante et al 2020 imig et al 2022 furthermore there are no guidelines as in australia nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 and no work is in progress to draw up such guidelines as e g in chile page et al 2020 despite the fact that mar is widely used neither are there are any standards whatsoever regarding the injected recharge water but there are regulations journal of laws 2021 item 2233 which oblige the owner s of a drinking water well field to perform risk analyses in order to assess health hazards taking into account factors adversely affecting water quality risk analysis assessment and management related to water supply has to be carried out in order to determine whether an intermediate protection zone needs to be established for drinking water supply sites journal of laws of 2021 item 2233 the second regulatory document relating to the undertaking of risk assessments also in the context of drinking water safety is the regulation of the minister of health of 07 12 2017 on the quality of water intended for human consumption journal of laws of 2017 item 2294 in article 2 8 this regulation defines risk assessment as a process consisting of hazard identification and risk analysis conducted on the basis of the pn en 15975 2 standard pn en 15975 2 2013 security of drinking water supply guidelines for risk and crisis management part 2 risk management this standard is based on the fundamental elements of the approach described in the water safety plan manual bartram et al 2009 who 2017 the risk management approach described in the standard focuses on the links in the drinking water supply chain including protection of sources water abstraction transport treatment storage and distribution the risk assessment discussed in this paper applies specifically to a particular mar facility therefore it covers the analysis of potential risks from the moment that water is discharged from the river dunajec for infiltration ditch purposes to the moment when water is abstracted from the collector caisson at the eu legislation level directives such as the water framework directive the groundwater directive and the environmental impact assessment directive contain individual provisions referring to artificial groundwater recharge but no direct recommendations regarding procedures for performing risk analyses for systems operating mar the aim of the directives is to improve and achieve the good status of waters including groundwater and mar methods can undoubtedly contribute to this however the risk of potentially adverse changes in water quality during mar operations as a result of interactions between the native groundwater and the aquifer containing recharged surface water should always be assessed with caution page et al 2008 nandha et al 2015 3 results 3 1 update of the mar riskapp tool the starting point for the risk assessment in our study was a set of 65 individual risks identified for the needs of the original mar riskapp macro marsol 2016 divided into two major groups technical and non technical the original set of risks was prepared for mar facilities in the mediterranean basin so some risks such as desalination plant failure were rejected no risk value in mar riskapp immediately after the preliminary analysis because they are inapplicable to central european conditions or pilot area specificity the świerczków well field is located in a cooler continental climate with an average annual temperature of 8 9 c and precipitation of 725 mm values for 1966 2019 deepwater ce 2021 some other risks were adapted to the specificity of the site where two types of mar are in operation ibf and infiltration ditches also one new risk elevated geochemical background was added boolean operators and formulas for calculating the individual risks were adapted to take into account the characteristics of the study area the set of all risks is given in the supplementary material tables a 1 a 4 where a short description is provided in column b for a better understanding of the context of a given risk eventually for the op further detailed analysis was carried out for non technical risks nt op 10 of which were analysed and 11 not taken into further consideration as the probability of their occurrence in the study area was assessed as zero twenty four technical risks t op were analysed in detail while 20 were rejected for the ep 15 non technical risks nt ep were subjected to further analysis while six were rejected sixteen technical risks t ep were further analysed risk score greater than 0 while five were rejected a total of 34 basic risks for the op and 31 basic risks for the ep were classified into four main non technical risk groups for both phases as well as four and three technical risk groups for the op and ep respectively table 2 3 2 semi quantitative risk assessment matrix following consultations with the working group consisting of the tarnów waterworks staff and the university of silesia in katowice staff it was decided to set up a five point scale of likelihood in the semi quantitative matrix created for the świerczków well field risk assessment once a year or more 1 to 5 years 5 to 10 years 10 to 20 years not more often than once every 20 years three categories regarding the severity of the consequences of these hazardous events were distinguished minor insignificant or minimal medium moderate and high impact major or catastrophic table 3 the risk score is the product of the severity of consequences impact and the likelihood values of a given hazard after matching every risk to the matrix by allocating to it a score for the likelihood of an occurrence rating 1 2 3 4 5 and its predicted consequences rating 1 3 5 the values in the rows and columns of the matrix were multiplied the results obtained could range from 1 to 25 where a higher value indicated a greater risk final risk scores of less than 6 points were considered as low risks 6 12 points as medium risks and greater than 12 points as high risks the rating for the likelihood and severity of an individual risk as well as the risk score and risk rating are presented in the supplementary material tables a 1 a 4 3 2 1 mar in the operational phase the risks identified for the existing mar system showed that the highest likelihood of occurrence among the non technical risks was associated with the high maintenance costs of the mar system likelihood rating 4 while the highest severity of consequences was associated with the low cost of water the non viability of mar operation severity rating 3 for both of these risks as for the other non technical risks the risk score varied between 2 and 4 table a 2 according to the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix table 2 the risk rating indicated a low risk of all non technical hazards however it should be remembered that even risks assessed as low should be documented and regularly reviewed of the 24 technical risks that were analysed in detail the highest likelihood of occurrence rating 5 was associated with two turbidity particles in the water entering the mar system and the negative impacts of the industrial zone on groundwater quality however only the first risk was ultimately classified as high in the risk rating eight risks were classified as medium with the highest risk score of 12 for drought and high rainfall events associated with water scarcity and the risk related to too short a residence time of water abstracted from the dunajec in the settling tanks before entering the mar facility the risk rating indicates a low risk for 15 individual hazards in the technical risk group fig 2 table a 4 the prioritised risks for the operation of the mar site at the świerczków well field indicate that the risks requiring specific attention are technical ones fig 2 3 2 2 mar in the expansion phase the nt ep with the highest likelihood of occurrence were the high installation cost high maintenance cost and health risk perception by the public likelihood rating 4 the greatest severity of consequences was associated with the lack of coordination non technical knowledge macroeconomic constraints low price of water and lack of private public funding severity rating 3 the final risk score for the 15 non technical risks varied between 2 and 9 table a 1 twelve of them were classified as low and three as medium according to the risk rating fig 3 the three non technical risks classified as medium related to a strategic group of risks that could have an impact on the investment costs of the mar site development and its profitability there were two t ep risks with a likelihood of occurrence rated at 5 sanitary biological restrictions and turbidity of the water entering the mar system the likelihoods of drought and rainfall events the risk of clogging and regional hydrogeology and hydrochemistry constraints were also rated high 4 the risk score for 16 technical risks ranged from 1 to 15 table a 3 the highest value was obtained for the turbidity of the water entering the mar system although this group of risks was dominated by low scores seven had values of 6 or more which classified them in the risk rating as medium and high note that technical risks have a greater impact on mar during the ep than non technical risks fig 3 3 3 probabilistic risk assessment fault tree analysis pra ft the second risk assessment method used for the świerczków mar site assumed a probabilistic approach where each basic risk the risk at the lowest part of the fault tree was assigned a probability value in order to calculate the total probability of multiple risks the probabilities on a scale of 0 1 implicitly 0 to 100 were assigned in the mar riskapp to every basic risk in question supplementary materials tables a 1 a 4 based on the knowledge and experience of the staffs of the tarnów waterworks and the university of silesia in katowice partially helpful in assigning the risk value to selected risks with the pra fta method were the values used to assign the likelihood of occurrence of a risk and the assessment of the consequences of its severity in the risk matrix however it should be emphasised that the purpose of the pra fta method is to determine the magnitude of the probability of occurrence of a given risk or groups of risks that leads to partial or total failure resulting in cessation of operation of the mar facility within the assumed time period if no preventive measures are taken for the site in question this period was five years all the results obtained by this method are shown in fig a 1 in the supplementary material in the form of two fault trees representing the operational phase op and expansion phase ep design construction of the mar system in tarnów 3 3 1 mar in the operational phase the results of the probability of mar facility failure based on calculations performed in the mar riskapp tool for the op can be presented in two ways as basic individual risks which are elementary components of the higher branches of the fault tree and as cumulative risks which combine the basic risks using boolean algebra cumulative risks intermediate events are always characterised by a higher probability of mar system failure than basic risks basic events with regard to the basic events the following risks seem to be the most harmful for the mar system in question the respective probability of mar failure is given as a percentage in brackets for the nt op it is the high maintenance cost of the mar facility 0 20 and for the t op 1 failure of a pipe and or filter water diverted from the settling tanks 0 25 2 breakdown of the pipe supplying water to the infiltration ditch or collective well 0 25 3 residence time water diverted from the settling tanks 0 25 4 periodicity of drought and rainfall events 0 25 5 sanitary biological restrictions e g due to pathogens 0 25 6 elevated geochemical background due to the close proximity of the industrial zone 0 30 and 7 high turbidity of the water entering the mar system 0 75 the most dangerous of the cumulative risks as regards the existing mar system s viability are as follows for the nt op 0 59 1 legislation risks 0 34 and 2 economic risks 0 32 and for the t op 0 99 1 not enough water recharged into the aquifer 0 95 fig 4 as a result of low input water quality 0 85 mainly because of the water s physical parameters e g high turbidity water scarcity due to extreme climate events 0 25 and physical clogging 0 75 2 unacceptable quality of groundwater at sensitive locations on the mar site 0 43 mostly because of the insufficient natural attenuation of groundwater 0 37 and 3 structural damage to the mar facility as a result of environmental events or human activity 0 45 it is also worth noting that even if some basic risks are represented by low risk values the higher branch of the fault tree can still have a relatively high resultant value and ultimately matter in terms of further risk management 3 3 2 mar in the expansion phase the most severe basic risks in the ep are related to the technical risks these are 1 the periodicity of drought and rainfall events 0 25 2 sanitary biological problems recharge water entering the mar system is contaminated e g by pathogens 0 50 3 clogging at least one type of clogging physical chemical or biological 0 50 and 4 the high turbidity of the recharge water entering the mar system 0 75 although no basic non technical events pose a major risk of mar failure during the ep three new basic risks arise in contrast to the operational phase these are the health risk high installation maintenance costs and the perception of effectiveness by the public the cumulative non technical risks indicate a probability of mar failure of 0 68 as in the operational phase of mar the most significant risks during the ep are associated with legislation 0 34 and economic risks 0 34 the most crucial technical risks 0 98 are those related to the access and availability of recharge water for mar 0 93 in terms of quality 0 90 and quantity 0 25 fig 5 as well as the risks related to hydraulic and hydrogeological assessment 0 61 mainly in terms of the aquifer s hydraulic properties 0 55 4 discussion the choice of two methods the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix and the probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis enables risks to be assessed from a broader perspective for the studied mar site however the results are comparable for the basic lowest level risks since the intermediate and top event risks mar failure are shown up only by the pra fta method to compare the methods tested the pra fta basic individual risks with a risk value of 0 0 25 were rated as low those with a value of 0 25 0 75 as medium and those with a value of 0 75 1 0 as high analysis of the outcomes of the individual risk assessments for these two methods shows that there are clear similarities in the assessment of their significance 80 of the basic risks were evaluated in a similar way in both methods for the operational and expansion phases the greatest similarity in the results 92 was obtained for the operational phase but a lower value 68 for the expansion phase where discrepancies among the technical risks are the greatest the greater similarity in the results obtained for the operational phase of the well field is due to the fact that the świerczków site has been operating for many years and has been subjected to various pressures and hazards over time e g floods drought events etc hence the risks for the operational phase can be estimated more precisely with less uncertainty than in the case of the site expansion phase additionally discrepancies are to some extent due to the different contexts of risk definition in the two methods nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 if we divide the risks into four main categories technical and non technical risks for the operational phase t op nt op and technical and non technical risks for the expansion phase t ep nt ep we see that non technical events generally pose a lower risk to the mar facility in tarnów than technical ones in both methods all the risks estimated as low only occurred for the nt op for the nt ep only in the first method were three risks assessed as medium fig 3 among the 24 technical risks occurring in the operational phase at świerczków eight were assessed as medium for the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix along with six baseline risks for the pra fta in the expansion phase six of the 21 technical risks were assessed as medium in the first method and three in the second one only one basic risk was rated as high in the risk matrix and with the highest probability in the pra fta namely the one related to the high turbidity number of particles in the recharge water entering the mar system during both the op and the ep before reaching the infiltration ditches the river water is pre treated in the settling tanks but when water levels in the dunajec are high the water is insufficiently cleared of suspended solids over time the particles deposited at the bottom of the ditches clog these up so they have to be periodically drained and the sediment removed a costly process for this most important risk mitigation measures should be developed as a priority at the świerczków site clogging is a common problem at many mar facilities and besides reducing infiltration rates can also cause chemical and microbiological water quality deterioration martin 2013 przybyłek et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 ma et al 2021 xia et al 2022 infiltration ditch clogging associated with in situ processes at świerczków can occur too medium risk but is less of a challenge and a threat than those associated with the physical delivery of suspended solids to the ditches with the recharge river water there is a risk associated with climate change drought and high rainfall events for now it is rated as medium in both methods but it may increase in the coming years climatic data for the tarnów region indicate that although the amount of precipitation during the year is relatively constant its distribution characteristics have been changing the number of days with short lived intensive rainfall and the number of days without rain are increasing deepwater ce 2021 this more and more irregular distribution of precipitation is causing an ever greater variability of the physicochemical parameters of dunajec water continuation or intensification of this trend in the future may periodically jeopardise attempts to obtain water of suitable quality as a result of which the rising costs of its potential treatment will have to be taken into account another noteworthy risk elevated geochemical background is related to the specificity of the study area the świerczków well field is directly adjacent to an extensive industrial zone fig 1 beneath which elevated concentrations of certain chemical compounds table 1 have been found in groundwater which in turn pose a threat to the quality of the groundwater pumped to the świerczków well field however so long as the mar system is working properly this risk is relatively low by maintaining the water table at the required height in the easternmost infiltration ditch and a sufficient volume of water supplying the ditch there is no need to treat the water pumped into the wells however any disturbance to the mar system e g by reduced infiltration of water due to clogging may lead to a change in groundwater hydrodynamics a change in the volume of groundwater mixing with surface water and an elevated inflow of polluted water from the industrial area to better understand this risk a flow and mass transport model will be developed in the next stage of research the lack of direct legislative guidelines at the polish and european union levels or of standards dedicated to risk assessment for facilities using mar has resulted in a high degree of autonomy in the selection of risk assessment methods for mar sites and also in the selection of risk groups under investigation dillon et al 2020 escalante et al 2020 imig et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the methodologies frequently used in mar risk assessment described in the literature include those based on the australian risk based guidelines for mar nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 on their basis an integrated approach to managing risks was adopted i a by page et al 2015 which included an assessment of the astr aquifer storage transfer and recovery treatment barrier and risks in the end use the objective of that research was to evaluate the human health risks of pathogens for harvesting treating and supplying urban stormwater for drinking purposes the mar risk assessment framework set out in the australian guidelines was likewise applied to the astr project in the study by page et al 2010 where the authors evaluated whether treated urban stormwater could meet standards for potable quality alternative risk assessment methods commonly used in mar related studies include the methodology adapted for drinking water supply sites from the food industry hazard and critical control points haccp havelaar 1994 or the methodology based on haccp described in the water safety plan wsp manual recommended by the who bartram et al 2009 who 2017 qualitative and semi quantitative risk assessment matrices are applied in these methodologies and also in the standard pn en 15975 2 2013 security of drinking water supply guidelines for risk and crisis management part 2 risk management the risk matrix used for the risk assessment of the świerczków mar site allows risks to be relatively quickly prioritised in relation to their significance by means of a risk score the risk score is derived from an estimation of the likelihood and severity associated with the risk of a given hazard occurring this technique has already been applied to the risk assessment of some mar sites nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 ji and lee 2022 assessing a risk or an element of risk as low medium or high has the potential to simplify the risk assessment input data requirements used for the risk analysis for the mar facility especially for the extension phase in świerczków on the other hand the categorisation of risk severity can be subjective especially if the consequences are uncertain cox 2008 subjective interpretation may lead to over or underestimation of the risks because applying the risk matrix relies to a significant extent on expert opinion ball and watt 2013 hence the selection of the team responsible for carrying out the risk assessment is extremely important as the quality of the analysis carried out will depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of the persons conducting it who 2017 it was crucial for our team to involve staff from the tarnów waterworks who have the relevant experience and expertise to properly understand the risks that can affect the effectiveness of the mar system at the świerczków well field the fact that risk assessment methods based on risk matrices are widely used does not necessarily mean that they are highly accurate or superior to other methods semi quantitative and qualitative risk assessment methods do have their limitations as pointed out by cox et al 2005 and cox 2008 so they should be applied with caution especially if two components of risk are negatively correlated the above limitations led us to test a second method for the risk assessment of the study area for its operation and expansion phases the choice of the pra fta method adapted to mar facilities by rodríguez escales et al 2018 was motivated by its previously successful application at six mar sites in mediterranean countries and the ability to modify and adapt each individual risk or groups of risk in the fault tree and pra calculations to the specificities of the area and the mar methods used at the świerczków site moreover the advantage of the pra fta method is that interactions between basic hazardous events can be modelled lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 for the świerczków site as well as for any other mar site reflecting its distinguishing features pra can facilitate a comprehensive uncertainty quantification of various groups of risks or basic risks and estimate the probability of mar system failure by combining the independent and conditional probabilities of failure of each process the advantage of the pra fta method is that individual probabilities of the basic risks can be estimated in various ways analytically numerically or inferred from expert opinion bolster et al 2009 for mar facilities where a holistic risk assessment should include both the technical and non technical aspects of such processes as pre treatment recharge storage recovery and post treatment nandha et al 2015 this is of great importance and offers the potential that the proposed adaptation of the pra fta method to mar facilities by rodríguez escales et al 2018 will be a good alternative to the qualitative and semi quantitative risk assessment methods based on risk matrices performed for facilities using mar methods the use of fault tree analysis by means of boolean algebra facilitates the visualisation of the main processes fault tree branches which may jeopardise the proper functioning of a mar facility from the fault trees created in our study it is possible to quickly identify the critical elements risks and where the probability of failure of the mar at świerczków is the highest fig a 1 fault trees also allow for the easy division of labour into particular groups of risks among the team working out the future risk assessment in accordance with the level of expertise of the team s members while most of the individual risks for both the operational and expansion phases of this mar site were estimated as low the pra fta method also enables one to indicate how the probability of mar site failure increases when combinations of individual events risks are taken into account intermediate and top events risks the application of the probabilistic representation of the fault tree definitively confirmed the predominance of technical risks in the study area for the top level risk the probability of mar system failure was 0 993 and 0 995 fig a 1 for the expansion and operational phases respectively however attention must also be paid to the non technical risks such as economic and legal constraints especially during the expansion phase for which the top risk probability of mar system failure was 0 68 for the operational phase it was 0 59 it should be emphasised that such high values of mar site failure probability in the context of both technical and non technical risks result from the fact that the risk assessment is carried out assuming that no measures to prevent risks are taken despite the high prevalence of risk matrices included in some regulations and standards because of their apparent simplicity of application and transparency we consider that the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods used summarised above indicate that pra fta is more suitable for risk assessment at mar facilities particularly relevant here is the fact that with pra fta one can assess the impact not only of a single risk but also of entire complex chains of events consisting of a number of adverse events that may lead to partial or total failure of the mar system with pra fta one can identify common cause failures that may not be apparent when individual subsystems are examined mpindou et al 2022 this is crucial in the context of mar facilities exposed to a wide range of technical and non technical risks the most important message a mar facility operator expects from a properly conducted risk assessment is specific information regarding the risks that can most realistically endanger the proper functioning of the system partial or complete system failure the risk assessment sheds a clear light on the set of the most important risks that may negatively affect the świerczków well field in tarnów the greatest challenge for this facility in both the operational and expansion phases is the insufficient pre treatment of the recharge river water to remove suspended solids risk of excessive turbidity it is also necessary to point out that for some of the risks presented in this study the analysis was not very thorough for lack of detailed data in relation to some of the factors investigated however this paper does indicate how a mar site owner might approach the risk problem in the future if new relevant data or better resolution data become available the set of risks analysed might be easily expanded to include new risks or some existing risks could be redefined for performing a new assessment under different circumstances such changes are likely to occur around currently rapidly evolving research questions that will have a significant impact on the current and future operation of mar facilities these include for example determinations in water of newly emerging contaminants and subsequent adjustment of regulations in this regard or new climate change scenarios developed on climate models fed by more and better resolution data this research provides a firm foundation for further more detailed risk assessment together with the development of a risk mitigation plan for the coming years these results will also be useful for redesigning the monitoring plan of the świerczków well field in order to supply more input risk management data moreover the experience gained can be used to assess the risk for another well field site belonging to the tarnów waterworks 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first risk assessment covering such a wide range of technical and non technical risks for a mar site in poland this is particularly important given the prevalence of similar facilities throughout southern poland carpathian mts and carpathian foredeep as well as in large cities that use mar facilities to supply drinking water to residents treichel et al 2015 wcisło et al 2016 kruć et al 2020 matusiak et al 2021 as the use of mar methods increases globally so does the demand for mar facility risk assessments hence the comprehensive approach to mar risk assessment presented here may be an important part of risk management during the construction operation and expansion of a mar facility this paper may also contribute to the existing literature as an example of good practice for performing risk assessments of future mar projects the more often risk assessment for mar is treated holistically as in the case under consideration here the greater the chances of proper risk management and the avoidance or reduction of costs associated with mar failure the application of two risk assessment methods the risk assessment matrix and the adaption of probabilistic risk assessment i e fault tree analysis pra fta to the świerczków mar site in tarnów provided insight into the risks associated with the facility during its operation and its potential expansion in the northern part of the study area moreover the choice of two methods enabled us to determine their suitability for performing risk assessments for mar facilities of these two risk assessment methods pra fta appears to be more suitable for mar facilities exposed to multiple technical and non technical risks the main advantage of the first method is its simplicity of use and the relatively quick prioritisation of risks by means of a risk rating the second method on the other hand once probability values have been allocated to all the basic risks and then using boolean algebra allows one to quantify probabilities within whole groups of risks that could ultimately lead to a partial or complete breakdown of the mar system the pra fta method with its definition of 65 technical and non technical risks for mar facilities has to date been applied in the marsol project only in mediterranean countries however our study shows that because the basic risks and the dependencies between individual risks can be easily modified pra fta can be successfully applied in other areas with a different type of mar or other environmental and on site conditions the two risk assessment methods applied at the basic risk level of yielded approximate results the similarity in results was higher for the operational phase 92 but lower 68 for the expansion phase classifying the risks into two major groups covering technical and non technical risks shows that the former represents a significantly higher risk during both the current operation of the mar and its planned expansion the results provide a comprehensive understanding of the critical risks and enable the correct identification of weaknesses in the operation of the świerczków mar site and the risks associated with its potential expansion they offer a rationale for eliminating or mitigating identified risks to the existing mar facility to an acceptable level and for updating plans concerning the cost effectiveness and risks associated with the mar system s expansion the results of our study may provide a starting point for the development of detailed remedial plans and initiate a review of the existing monitoring system and its expansion in order to guarantee the long term viability of this mar system the most serious risk that must be further analysed and managed at the świerczków site is that of mar failure due to the insufficient reduction of suspended solids and the turbidity of the water recharging the infiltration ditches funding this research took place within the framework of the project developing an

1869,this comprehensive risk assessment done for a mar facility in tarnów southern poland covers two mar techniques infiltration ditches and induced bank filtration during the operation and planned potential expansion phases two methods were applied the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix and the probabilistic risk assessment fault tree analysis pra fta and their advantages and limitations analysed both methods examine a range of technical and non technical risks that may pose a threat to the efficient functioning of the mar facility in tarnów which supplies about 25 of the city s population with drinking water it was found that 34 of the 65 risks analysed could pose a low to high risk for the świerczków well field the predominant risks potentially reducing mar efficiency or leading to mar failure are technical ones according to the pra fta method if no preventive measures are taken there is a 99 5 and 99 3 probability of the mar system failing during the operational and expansion phases respectively the results indicate that the most serious risk is associated with the insufficient initial removal from the recharge river water of suspended solids which clog infiltration ditches the risks scored as medium relate to the threat of groundwater inflow from an extensive industrial zone lying to the east of the well field and to climate change negatively affecting the quantity of groundwater resources this is the first example in poland of a risk assessment for an existing mar facility and its expansion based on a broad spectrum of technical and non technical risks present at the świerczków well field using two methods the risk assessment matrix and pra fta this case study is a practical example of how to perform a risk analysis for a mar site it can make an important contribution to existing knowledge in this field and enrich the subject literature a particularly relevant aspect given the widespread use of mar techniques in central europe for

increasingly used in order to maintain enhance and secure groundwater systems under different stressors at the local or basin scale dillon 2005 dillon et al 2019 deepwater ce 2020 alam et al 2021 mar has applications in sustaining and enhancing groundwater quality and quantity but also in environmental management dillon et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 one of the main advantages of mar is that it can play an important role in improving groundwater quality moeck et al 2017 li et al 2019 or managing environmental changes and extreme weather events such as droughts dillon et al 2019 tran et al 2020 or floods standen et al 2020 the quality of recharge water including its microbiological aspects can be improved by natural attenuation during infiltration through an unsaturated zone betancourt et al 2014 kvitsand et al 2017 górski et al 2018 which subsequently can significantly reduce the concentrations of some chemical components in groundwater by dilution alam et al 2021 garcía menéndez et al 2021 as a specific kind of hydrodynamic barrier infiltrated water can also prevent seawater intrusions rodríguez escales et al 2018 or reduce the inflow of polluted groundwater from industrial zones as is the case in the study area since mar techniques are relatively inexpensive solutions utilised to counter water shortage and declining groundwater quality they are being applied worldwide dillon et al 2019 escalante et al 2019 alam et al 2021 patenaude et al 2020 levintal et al 2022 globally since the 1960s implementation of mar projects has been accelerating at a rate of 5 per year dillon et al 2019 however the potential environmental and other benefits of mar may not be fully achievable if mar facilities are not properly operated and managed rodríguez escales et al 2018 ajjur and baalousha 2021 each mar scheme is exposed to multiple risks that should be properly identified assessed prevented and treated comprehensive risk management can and should be applied at facilities using mar to enhance the efficiency safety and sustainability of their operations holistic risk assessment for mar should focus on all the crucial aspects of its functioning at the design construction and operation stages taking into account both technical and non technical groups of risks a general review of the risk assessment methods used in the context of mar was given by imig et al 2022 the australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks phase 1 nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 define risk as the likelihood of identified hazards causing harm in exposed populations or receiving environments in a specified timeframe including the severity of the consequence risk likelihood impact on the other hand the iso 31000 2018 risk management guidelines standard defines risk as the effect of uncertainty on objectives iso 31000 2018 an effect is a deviation from the expected it can be positive negative or both and can address create or result in opportunities and threats the iso standard like the definition presented in the australian guidelines expresses risk as a combination of the consequences of an event and the associated likelihood this approach to risk was applied in this study in relation to the risk matrix method in our opinion the most interesting proposal for defining risk in direct relation to mar was proposed by rodríguez escales et al 2018 who defined risk as the probability of an undesired outcome happening evaluated as a percentage of occurrence that causes damage directly e g breakage of pipes or indirectly e g perception of effectiveness to the recharge system therefore leading to a failure during the operation or design phase of the mar facility maliva and missimer 2012 emphasise that risk assessment is a critical element of any mar system and undertaking it during the design phase should determine whether the project is technically and economically feasible and meets the regulatory requirements the objectives of this study were 1 to carry out risk assessments for a mar site at two stages of viability the operational phase of the existing site op and the design and construction phase of a potential mar site expansion ep and 2 to assess the suitability advantages and limitations of the method used for performing the mar risk assessment and a comparative analysis of the utility of the two methods for this purpose the study was conducted using two methods the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 blackmore et al 2008 jabari et al 2020 abolli et al 2021 and probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 the methods chosen had to cover a wide range of technical t op t ep and non technical nt op nt ep risks with respect to the same two mar techniques i e induced bank filtration ibf and infiltration ditches the applicability of these two risk assessment methods was tested at the mar facility located on the świerczków well field in tarnów southern poland this well field one of the three main ones belonging to the tarnów waterworks supplies drinking water to the city and municipality of tarnów in southern poland evaluation of the most significant risks will allow a detailed countermeasure plan to be developed to secure the well field s operation previously published studies for the study area focused mainly on the assessment of groundwater quality evaluation wojtal et al 2009 and the results of flow and transport modelling haładus et al 2011 kania et al 2012 treichel et al 2015 recent research has been carried out within the framework of the deepwater ce project in which among other things the feasibility of expanding the mar site based on an assessment of environmental and economic considerations was evaluated the results of the latter were obtained with the aid of a cost benefit analysis halytsia et al 2022 which showed that the total economic value of mar expansion in the study area including both use and non use benefits exceeded the cost of introducing and maintaining the system 2 materials and methods 2 1 mar site the świerczków well field along with the area intended for its expansion is situated between the river dunajec to the west and the floodbank to the east the well field area is covered by grassland but directly behind the floodbank there is an extensive industrial zone belonging to grupa azoty s a ga one of the largest companies in the european fertiliser and chemical market as well as a combined heat and power plant chp with coal storage facilities also belonging to ga fig 1 the well field is situated on a flat river terrace the land surface lies at approx 188 195 m a s l and rises slightly towards the south the deposits in the study area are quaternary and neogene miocene the occurrence form and thickness of the quaternary sediments are related mainly to glacial and fluvial activities the total aquifer thickness at the well field is about 8 12 m wojtal et al 2009 deepwater ce 2021 the top of the shallow quaternary aquifer is overlain by approx 1 3 m of semipermeable deposits consisting of loams silts and organic silts the unconfined aquifer is composed of sands and gravels with a substantial fraction of pebbles in the bottom part it lies on an impermeable clayey miocene bed wojtal et al 2009 treichel et al 2015 the depth of the water table at the well field depends on the water level in the dunajec the groundwater abstraction rate and the intensity of natural and managed aquifer recharge the water table varies from 180 to 183 m a s l the dynamic water level in the wells to 186 187 m a s l in the south western part of the study area the general groundwater flow direction in the region is from the east and south east towards the draining river dunajec but existing infiltration ditches and operating wells significantly modify it locally at the well field fig 1 the natural groundwater inflow from the east and south east is characterised by elevated concentrations of ammonium up to 14 11 mg l and nitrate up to 27 mg l and also in the northern part where the expansion is planned of sodium up to 288 mg l chloride up to 368 mg l and sulphate up to 180 mg l which are the consequences of the long term negative impact of the nearby chemical plant and chp tab 1 in order to limit the inflow of contaminated groundwater from the industrial zone and increase groundwater resources mar techniques i e infiltration ditches and ibf were applied because the appropriate high water table in the ditches is maintained artificially inflow of groundwater from the industrial zone is limited infiltration of surface water supplied from the dunajec through the ditch beds improves groundwater quality and increases groundwater resources this was demonstrated by water quality and quantity monitoring during the deepwater ce project 2019 2022 deepwater ce 2022 before recharging the ditches river water is pre treated in settling tanks deposition ponds located about 1 km south of the well field in order to reduce the volume of suspended solids fig 1 even so approx every 3 5 years the ditch beds have to be cleaned scraped after being drained to mitigate clogging the average daily volume of surface water pumped into the ditches is about 4250 m3 d the mar methods used improve the quality of the water from the dunajec because of their high capacity to remove pathogens microbiological contamination in the dunajec by coliforms can exceed ten thousand cfu 100 ml and by clostridium perfringens ranges from a few dozen to a few hundred cfu 100 ml in raw water from a collector caisson the number of coliforms decreases to 1 9 a cfu 100 ml and clostridium perfringens is completely eliminated analyses of organic pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and microplastics in the dunajec and groundwater samples did not reveal any contamination in contrast residues of some pharmaceutical and personal care products were present in surface water samples as were trace concentrations of them in groundwater even so these concentrations were noticeably lower in the study area than in other regions of poland ślósarczyk et al 2021 deepwater ce 2022 a complementary mar technique employed at the świerczków well field is induced bank filtration ibf because the groundwater table is lowered as a result of the operation of two pumping wells located near the dunajec fig 1 and the resulting change in the hydraulic groundwater gradient river water infiltrates into the aquifer the intensity of the process depends greatly on the well pumping rate and the river s water level the average rate of groundwater abstraction for drinking purposes at the well field in 2020 was 6500 m3 d while the maximum rate specified in the water permit is 8500 m3 d since 1910 the świerczków well field has been expanded several times and currently consists of 17 wells and four infiltration ditches with a total length of approx 450 m fig 1 the wells are connected to two siphon pipelines both supply groundwater to the collector caisson which has no connection with the aquifer and is located behind the floodbank fig 1 before entering the municipal network mixed groundwater from all the wells is post treated only with chlorine dioxide 2 2 risk assessment methods based on the available data on the świerczków well field mar site specifics and the applicability of the methods during both the op and the ep we decided to select two methods for the risk assessment the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 and the probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 the choice of the methodology used in the risk assessment for this study was dictated by the fact that both approaches are reliable and credible tested in practice can be used to assess a diverse group of risks can provide a broad view during the initial stages of an investigation and also yield results that are readily comprehensible to project stakeholders in the first method the risk assessment process involves the estimation of two parameters the likelihood here the frequency with which identified hazards may pose a risk to the mar system and the severity of the consequences associated with the occurrence of a given hazard risk matrices usually distinguish five degrees of the likelihood graves 2000 of a specific hazard rare unlikely possible likely almost certain and five degrees of the consequences of a given hazard insignificant minor moderate major catastrophic nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 however these five point scales should be treated as general guidelines and always be adapted to the specific case study for which the risk assessment is being performed after matching every hazard to the matrix by ascribing to it a score for the likelihood of occurrence e g rating 1 2 3 4 5 and foreseen consequences e g rating 1 2 3 4 5 the values in the rows and columns of the matrix are multiplied the higher the values obtained the higher the risk such numerical rankings provide a relative indication of the likelihood and consequence s of an event so it is important not to assume their accuracy in absolute terms this method is a subjective one so its accuracy depends greatly on the knowledge and experience of the persons conducting it the second method is probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis pra fta which can be applied directly to mar schemes the methodology evaluates the probability of mar failure if no preventive measures are taken existing mitigation measures at the świerczków well field were excluded for the needs of this study taking various risks into account at two mar viability stages the op and the ep the core idea of this method is to take a complicated system to be assessed as one unit the entire mar system and to split it into a set of quasi independent and less complex hazardous basic events that are individually more manageable once the probabilities of occurrence of the basic events have been calculated they are recombined in a systematic manner to present a holistic risk assessment of the mar facility as a whole rodríguez escales et al 2018 the probabilities of occurrence of basic events were matched to the specific conditions in the świerczków well field area a special working group of experts working within the framework of the deepwater ce project was set up to determine them the group included well field employees hydrogeologist and technologist who have been working at the site for many years and are thoroughly familiar with its operation and everyday reality as well as experienced hydrogeologists from the university of silesia in katowice the values established were based on personal subjective opinions however their basis was a wealth of previous experience and knowledge of the study area cooperation with the tarnów waterworks staff was therefore a sine qua non their practical experience allowed us to ultimately assign an appropriate probability to each basic risk column g in the supplementary materials tables a 1 a 4 the methodology applied in our study was the scheme defined by bedford and cooke 2003 and further modified by rodríguez escales et al 2018 the first step in implementing this approach is to define the concept of a potential mar system failure and to identify the set of negative events risks that may affect the proper continuous operation of a mar facility in this case the świerczków well field the second step is to create an accurate fault tree so as to avoid situations where events affecting the mar facility are dependent on each other in this method all events should be as independent as possible from each other the third step is a mathematical fault tree expression based on boolean algebra and the final step is to determine the probability of occurrence of the individual events that may affect the system based on the fault tree results assignment of the probabilities of mar system failure a full description of which can be found in rodríguez escales et al 2018 involves the determination of the specific probability for each basic event risk at the bottom of the fault tree based on expert knowledge but also using boolean algebra rules until the top of the fault tree complete system failure is reached the boolean operators indicate a set of key events risks that may lead to total or partial mar system failure based on these operations a hierarchy of importance was set up from the least important to the most significant risk the risks were treated in such a way that the occurrence of at least one risk from a given risk sub group caused a threat to mar leading to the cessation of facility operation operator or on the other hand when all of the events from a subgroup needed to be present for mar failure the operator and should be used however in our case only the or operator was applicable the basic principles of boolean algebra are as follows taking the main event c as the sum of events a and b the function of these events is calculated as follows equation 1 1 p c p a b p a p b p a b where p c is the probability of an issue risk that depends on the probability of two other events in this case issue a p a and issue b p b p a and p b are previously defined criteria expert or previously calculated in the fault tree if they are not in the lowest part of the fault tree p a b is the intersection the risk assessment for the mar facility that we analysed was done using a microsoft excel macro called assessment tool for risk evaluation and potential mitigation activities the mar riskapp mar riskapp this tool was developed and successfully applied during the eu fp7 marsol project for the risk assessment carried out for six different mar facilities situated in the mediterranean basin marsol 2016 the macro can be used to evaluate the risk of mar facility failure during both the op and the ep it is important to notice that mar failure is defined by rodríguez escales et al 2018 as the need to bring the facility s operation to a halt which can be either complete or partial partial failure means that the problem can be mitigated or fixed within a short period of time and the mar s operation restored complete failure means that the facility must undergo significant revisions and repairs to be able to operate again and a catastrophic event may render a mar non operational in our study partial failures are the most probable the logic behind this approach is that the tarnów waterworks staff is familiar with the long running mar system which has been in operation since the 1960s 2 3 national legislation and policies on mar risk assessment in poland and the eu there are no regulations relating directly to risk assessment and management in the context of mar escalante et al 2020 imig et al 2022 furthermore there are no guidelines as in australia nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 and no work is in progress to draw up such guidelines as e g in chile page et al 2020 despite the fact that mar is widely used neither are there are any standards whatsoever regarding the injected recharge water but there are regulations journal of laws 2021 item 2233 which oblige the owner s of a drinking water well field to perform risk analyses in order to assess health hazards taking into account factors adversely affecting water quality risk analysis assessment and management related to water supply has to be carried out in order to determine whether an intermediate protection zone needs to be established for drinking water supply sites journal of laws of 2021 item 2233 the second regulatory document relating to the undertaking of risk assessments also in the context of drinking water safety is the regulation of the minister of health of 07 12 2017 on the quality of water intended for human consumption journal of laws of 2017 item 2294 in article 2 8 this regulation defines risk assessment as a process consisting of hazard identification and risk analysis conducted on the basis of the pn en 15975 2 standard pn en 15975 2 2013 security of drinking water supply guidelines for risk and crisis management part 2 risk management this standard is based on the fundamental elements of the approach described in the water safety plan manual bartram et al 2009 who 2017 the risk management approach described in the standard focuses on the links in the drinking water supply chain including protection of sources water abstraction transport treatment storage and distribution the risk assessment discussed in this paper applies specifically to a particular mar facility therefore it covers the analysis of potential risks from the moment that water is discharged from the river dunajec for infiltration ditch purposes to the moment when water is abstracted from the collector caisson at the eu legislation level directives such as the water framework directive the groundwater directive and the environmental impact assessment directive contain individual provisions referring to artificial groundwater recharge but no direct recommendations regarding procedures for performing risk analyses for systems operating mar the aim of the directives is to improve and achieve the good status of waters including groundwater and mar methods can undoubtedly contribute to this however the risk of potentially adverse changes in water quality during mar operations as a result of interactions between the native groundwater and the aquifer containing recharged surface water should always be assessed with caution page et al 2008 nandha et al 2015 3 results 3 1 update of the mar riskapp tool the starting point for the risk assessment in our study was a set of 65 individual risks identified for the needs of the original mar riskapp macro marsol 2016 divided into two major groups technical and non technical the original set of risks was prepared for mar facilities in the mediterranean basin so some risks such as desalination plant failure were rejected no risk value in mar riskapp immediately after the preliminary analysis because they are inapplicable to central european conditions or pilot area specificity the świerczków well field is located in a cooler continental climate with an average annual temperature of 8 9 c and precipitation of 725 mm values for 1966 2019 deepwater ce 2021 some other risks were adapted to the specificity of the site where two types of mar are in operation ibf and infiltration ditches also one new risk elevated geochemical background was added boolean operators and formulas for calculating the individual risks were adapted to take into account the characteristics of the study area the set of all risks is given in the supplementary material tables a 1 a 4 where a short description is provided in column b for a better understanding of the context of a given risk eventually for the op further detailed analysis was carried out for non technical risks nt op 10 of which were analysed and 11 not taken into further consideration as the probability of their occurrence in the study area was assessed as zero twenty four technical risks t op were analysed in detail while 20 were rejected for the ep 15 non technical risks nt ep were subjected to further analysis while six were rejected sixteen technical risks t ep were further analysed risk score greater than 0 while five were rejected a total of 34 basic risks for the op and 31 basic risks for the ep were classified into four main non technical risk groups for both phases as well as four and three technical risk groups for the op and ep respectively table 2 3 2 semi quantitative risk assessment matrix following consultations with the working group consisting of the tarnów waterworks staff and the university of silesia in katowice staff it was decided to set up a five point scale of likelihood in the semi quantitative matrix created for the świerczków well field risk assessment once a year or more 1 to 5 years 5 to 10 years 10 to 20 years not more often than once every 20 years three categories regarding the severity of the consequences of these hazardous events were distinguished minor insignificant or minimal medium moderate and high impact major or catastrophic table 3 the risk score is the product of the severity of consequences impact and the likelihood values of a given hazard after matching every risk to the matrix by allocating to it a score for the likelihood of an occurrence rating 1 2 3 4 5 and its predicted consequences rating 1 3 5 the values in the rows and columns of the matrix were multiplied the results obtained could range from 1 to 25 where a higher value indicated a greater risk final risk scores of less than 6 points were considered as low risks 6 12 points as medium risks and greater than 12 points as high risks the rating for the likelihood and severity of an individual risk as well as the risk score and risk rating are presented in the supplementary material tables a 1 a 4 3 2 1 mar in the operational phase the risks identified for the existing mar system showed that the highest likelihood of occurrence among the non technical risks was associated with the high maintenance costs of the mar system likelihood rating 4 while the highest severity of consequences was associated with the low cost of water the non viability of mar operation severity rating 3 for both of these risks as for the other non technical risks the risk score varied between 2 and 4 table a 2 according to the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix table 2 the risk rating indicated a low risk of all non technical hazards however it should be remembered that even risks assessed as low should be documented and regularly reviewed of the 24 technical risks that were analysed in detail the highest likelihood of occurrence rating 5 was associated with two turbidity particles in the water entering the mar system and the negative impacts of the industrial zone on groundwater quality however only the first risk was ultimately classified as high in the risk rating eight risks were classified as medium with the highest risk score of 12 for drought and high rainfall events associated with water scarcity and the risk related to too short a residence time of water abstracted from the dunajec in the settling tanks before entering the mar facility the risk rating indicates a low risk for 15 individual hazards in the technical risk group fig 2 table a 4 the prioritised risks for the operation of the mar site at the świerczków well field indicate that the risks requiring specific attention are technical ones fig 2 3 2 2 mar in the expansion phase the nt ep with the highest likelihood of occurrence were the high installation cost high maintenance cost and health risk perception by the public likelihood rating 4 the greatest severity of consequences was associated with the lack of coordination non technical knowledge macroeconomic constraints low price of water and lack of private public funding severity rating 3 the final risk score for the 15 non technical risks varied between 2 and 9 table a 1 twelve of them were classified as low and three as medium according to the risk rating fig 3 the three non technical risks classified as medium related to a strategic group of risks that could have an impact on the investment costs of the mar site development and its profitability there were two t ep risks with a likelihood of occurrence rated at 5 sanitary biological restrictions and turbidity of the water entering the mar system the likelihoods of drought and rainfall events the risk of clogging and regional hydrogeology and hydrochemistry constraints were also rated high 4 the risk score for 16 technical risks ranged from 1 to 15 table a 3 the highest value was obtained for the turbidity of the water entering the mar system although this group of risks was dominated by low scores seven had values of 6 or more which classified them in the risk rating as medium and high note that technical risks have a greater impact on mar during the ep than non technical risks fig 3 3 3 probabilistic risk assessment fault tree analysis pra ft the second risk assessment method used for the świerczków mar site assumed a probabilistic approach where each basic risk the risk at the lowest part of the fault tree was assigned a probability value in order to calculate the total probability of multiple risks the probabilities on a scale of 0 1 implicitly 0 to 100 were assigned in the mar riskapp to every basic risk in question supplementary materials tables a 1 a 4 based on the knowledge and experience of the staffs of the tarnów waterworks and the university of silesia in katowice partially helpful in assigning the risk value to selected risks with the pra fta method were the values used to assign the likelihood of occurrence of a risk and the assessment of the consequences of its severity in the risk matrix however it should be emphasised that the purpose of the pra fta method is to determine the magnitude of the probability of occurrence of a given risk or groups of risks that leads to partial or total failure resulting in cessation of operation of the mar facility within the assumed time period if no preventive measures are taken for the site in question this period was five years all the results obtained by this method are shown in fig a 1 in the supplementary material in the form of two fault trees representing the operational phase op and expansion phase ep design construction of the mar system in tarnów 3 3 1 mar in the operational phase the results of the probability of mar facility failure based on calculations performed in the mar riskapp tool for the op can be presented in two ways as basic individual risks which are elementary components of the higher branches of the fault tree and as cumulative risks which combine the basic risks using boolean algebra cumulative risks intermediate events are always characterised by a higher probability of mar system failure than basic risks basic events with regard to the basic events the following risks seem to be the most harmful for the mar system in question the respective probability of mar failure is given as a percentage in brackets for the nt op it is the high maintenance cost of the mar facility 0 20 and for the t op 1 failure of a pipe and or filter water diverted from the settling tanks 0 25 2 breakdown of the pipe supplying water to the infiltration ditch or collective well 0 25 3 residence time water diverted from the settling tanks 0 25 4 periodicity of drought and rainfall events 0 25 5 sanitary biological restrictions e g due to pathogens 0 25 6 elevated geochemical background due to the close proximity of the industrial zone 0 30 and 7 high turbidity of the water entering the mar system 0 75 the most dangerous of the cumulative risks as regards the existing mar system s viability are as follows for the nt op 0 59 1 legislation risks 0 34 and 2 economic risks 0 32 and for the t op 0 99 1 not enough water recharged into the aquifer 0 95 fig 4 as a result of low input water quality 0 85 mainly because of the water s physical parameters e g high turbidity water scarcity due to extreme climate events 0 25 and physical clogging 0 75 2 unacceptable quality of groundwater at sensitive locations on the mar site 0 43 mostly because of the insufficient natural attenuation of groundwater 0 37 and 3 structural damage to the mar facility as a result of environmental events or human activity 0 45 it is also worth noting that even if some basic risks are represented by low risk values the higher branch of the fault tree can still have a relatively high resultant value and ultimately matter in terms of further risk management 3 3 2 mar in the expansion phase the most severe basic risks in the ep are related to the technical risks these are 1 the periodicity of drought and rainfall events 0 25 2 sanitary biological problems recharge water entering the mar system is contaminated e g by pathogens 0 50 3 clogging at least one type of clogging physical chemical or biological 0 50 and 4 the high turbidity of the recharge water entering the mar system 0 75 although no basic non technical events pose a major risk of mar failure during the ep three new basic risks arise in contrast to the operational phase these are the health risk high installation maintenance costs and the perception of effectiveness by the public the cumulative non technical risks indicate a probability of mar failure of 0 68 as in the operational phase of mar the most significant risks during the ep are associated with legislation 0 34 and economic risks 0 34 the most crucial technical risks 0 98 are those related to the access and availability of recharge water for mar 0 93 in terms of quality 0 90 and quantity 0 25 fig 5 as well as the risks related to hydraulic and hydrogeological assessment 0 61 mainly in terms of the aquifer s hydraulic properties 0 55 4 discussion the choice of two methods the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix and the probabilistic risk assessment based on fault tree analysis enables risks to be assessed from a broader perspective for the studied mar site however the results are comparable for the basic lowest level risks since the intermediate and top event risks mar failure are shown up only by the pra fta method to compare the methods tested the pra fta basic individual risks with a risk value of 0 0 25 were rated as low those with a value of 0 25 0 75 as medium and those with a value of 0 75 1 0 as high analysis of the outcomes of the individual risk assessments for these two methods shows that there are clear similarities in the assessment of their significance 80 of the basic risks were evaluated in a similar way in both methods for the operational and expansion phases the greatest similarity in the results 92 was obtained for the operational phase but a lower value 68 for the expansion phase where discrepancies among the technical risks are the greatest the greater similarity in the results obtained for the operational phase of the well field is due to the fact that the świerczków site has been operating for many years and has been subjected to various pressures and hazards over time e g floods drought events etc hence the risks for the operational phase can be estimated more precisely with less uncertainty than in the case of the site expansion phase additionally discrepancies are to some extent due to the different contexts of risk definition in the two methods nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 if we divide the risks into four main categories technical and non technical risks for the operational phase t op nt op and technical and non technical risks for the expansion phase t ep nt ep we see that non technical events generally pose a lower risk to the mar facility in tarnów than technical ones in both methods all the risks estimated as low only occurred for the nt op for the nt ep only in the first method were three risks assessed as medium fig 3 among the 24 technical risks occurring in the operational phase at świerczków eight were assessed as medium for the semi quantitative risk assessment matrix along with six baseline risks for the pra fta in the expansion phase six of the 21 technical risks were assessed as medium in the first method and three in the second one only one basic risk was rated as high in the risk matrix and with the highest probability in the pra fta namely the one related to the high turbidity number of particles in the recharge water entering the mar system during both the op and the ep before reaching the infiltration ditches the river water is pre treated in the settling tanks but when water levels in the dunajec are high the water is insufficiently cleared of suspended solids over time the particles deposited at the bottom of the ditches clog these up so they have to be periodically drained and the sediment removed a costly process for this most important risk mitigation measures should be developed as a priority at the świerczków site clogging is a common problem at many mar facilities and besides reducing infiltration rates can also cause chemical and microbiological water quality deterioration martin 2013 przybyłek et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 cui et al 2021 ma et al 2021 xia et al 2022 infiltration ditch clogging associated with in situ processes at świerczków can occur too medium risk but is less of a challenge and a threat than those associated with the physical delivery of suspended solids to the ditches with the recharge river water there is a risk associated with climate change drought and high rainfall events for now it is rated as medium in both methods but it may increase in the coming years climatic data for the tarnów region indicate that although the amount of precipitation during the year is relatively constant its distribution characteristics have been changing the number of days with short lived intensive rainfall and the number of days without rain are increasing deepwater ce 2021 this more and more irregular distribution of precipitation is causing an ever greater variability of the physicochemical parameters of dunajec water continuation or intensification of this trend in the future may periodically jeopardise attempts to obtain water of suitable quality as a result of which the rising costs of its potential treatment will have to be taken into account another noteworthy risk elevated geochemical background is related to the specificity of the study area the świerczków well field is directly adjacent to an extensive industrial zone fig 1 beneath which elevated concentrations of certain chemical compounds table 1 have been found in groundwater which in turn pose a threat to the quality of the groundwater pumped to the świerczków well field however so long as the mar system is working properly this risk is relatively low by maintaining the water table at the required height in the easternmost infiltration ditch and a sufficient volume of water supplying the ditch there is no need to treat the water pumped into the wells however any disturbance to the mar system e g by reduced infiltration of water due to clogging may lead to a change in groundwater hydrodynamics a change in the volume of groundwater mixing with surface water and an elevated inflow of polluted water from the industrial area to better understand this risk a flow and mass transport model will be developed in the next stage of research the lack of direct legislative guidelines at the polish and european union levels or of standards dedicated to risk assessment for facilities using mar has resulted in a high degree of autonomy in the selection of risk assessment methods for mar sites and also in the selection of risk groups under investigation dillon et al 2020 escalante et al 2020 imig et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 the methodologies frequently used in mar risk assessment described in the literature include those based on the australian risk based guidelines for mar nrmmc ephc nhmrc 2009 on their basis an integrated approach to managing risks was adopted i a by page et al 2015 which included an assessment of the astr aquifer storage transfer and recovery treatment barrier and risks in the end use the objective of that research was to evaluate the human health risks of pathogens for harvesting treating and supplying urban stormwater for drinking purposes the mar risk assessment framework set out in the australian guidelines was likewise applied to the astr project in the study by page et al 2010 where the authors evaluated whether treated urban stormwater could meet standards for potable quality alternative risk assessment methods commonly used in mar related studies include the methodology adapted for drinking water supply sites from the food industry hazard and critical control points haccp havelaar 1994 or the methodology based on haccp described in the water safety plan wsp manual recommended by the who bartram et al 2009 who 2017 qualitative and semi quantitative risk assessment matrices are applied in these methodologies and also in the standard pn en 15975 2 2013 security of drinking water supply guidelines for risk and crisis management part 2 risk management the risk matrix used for the risk assessment of the świerczków mar site allows risks to be relatively quickly prioritised in relation to their significance by means of a risk score the risk score is derived from an estimation of the likelihood and severity associated with the risk of a given hazard occurring this technique has already been applied to the risk assessment of some mar sites nadebaum 2004 swierc et al 2005 bartram et al 2009 ji and lee 2022 assessing a risk or an element of risk as low medium or high has the potential to simplify the risk assessment input data requirements used for the risk analysis for the mar facility especially for the extension phase in świerczków on the other hand the categorisation of risk severity can be subjective especially if the consequences are uncertain cox 2008 subjective interpretation may lead to over or underestimation of the risks because applying the risk matrix relies to a significant extent on expert opinion ball and watt 2013 hence the selection of the team responsible for carrying out the risk assessment is extremely important as the quality of the analysis carried out will depend greatly on the knowledge and experience of the persons conducting it who 2017 it was crucial for our team to involve staff from the tarnów waterworks who have the relevant experience and expertise to properly understand the risks that can affect the effectiveness of the mar system at the świerczków well field the fact that risk assessment methods based on risk matrices are widely used does not necessarily mean that they are highly accurate or superior to other methods semi quantitative and qualitative risk assessment methods do have their limitations as pointed out by cox et al 2005 and cox 2008 so they should be applied with caution especially if two components of risk are negatively correlated the above limitations led us to test a second method for the risk assessment of the study area for its operation and expansion phases the choice of the pra fta method adapted to mar facilities by rodríguez escales et al 2018 was motivated by its previously successful application at six mar sites in mediterranean countries and the ability to modify and adapt each individual risk or groups of risk in the fault tree and pra calculations to the specificities of the area and the mar methods used at the świerczków site moreover the advantage of the pra fta method is that interactions between basic hazardous events can be modelled lindhe et al 2009 rodríguez escales et al 2018 for the świerczków site as well as for any other mar site reflecting its distinguishing features pra can facilitate a comprehensive uncertainty quantification of various groups of risks or basic risks and estimate the probability of mar system failure by combining the independent and conditional probabilities of failure of each process the advantage of the pra fta method is that individual probabilities of the basic risks can be estimated in various ways analytically numerically or inferred from expert opinion bolster et al 2009 for mar facilities where a holistic risk assessment should include both the technical and non technical aspects of such processes as pre treatment recharge storage recovery and post treatment nandha et al 2015 this is of great importance and offers the potential that the proposed adaptation of the pra fta method to mar facilities by rodríguez escales et al 2018 will be a good alternative to the qualitative and semi quantitative risk assessment methods based on risk matrices performed for facilities using mar methods the use of fault tree analysis by means of boolean algebra facilitates the visualisation of the main processes fault tree branches which may jeopardise the proper functioning of a mar facility from the fault trees created in our study it is possible to quickly identify the critical elements risks and where the probability of failure of the mar at świerczków is the highest fig a 1 fault trees also allow for the easy division of labour into particular groups of risks among the team working out the future risk assessment in accordance with the level of expertise of the team s members while most of the individual risks for both the operational and expansion phases of this mar site were estimated as low the pra fta method also enables one to indicate how the probability of mar site failure increases when combinations of individual events risks are taken into account intermediate and top events risks the application of the probabilistic representation of the fault tree definitively confirmed the predominance of technical risks in the study area for the top level risk the probability of mar system failure was 0 993 and 0 995 fig a 1 for the expansion and operational phases respectively however attention must also be paid to the non technical risks such as economic and legal constraints especially during the expansion phase for which the top risk probability of mar system failure was 0 68 for the operational phase it was 0 59 it should be emphasised that such high values of mar site failure probability in the context of both technical and non technical risks result from the fact that the risk assessment is carried out assuming that no measures to prevent risks are taken despite the high prevalence of risk matrices included in some regulations and standards because of their apparent simplicity of application and transparency we consider that the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods used summarised above indicate that pra fta is more suitable for risk assessment at mar facilities particularly relevant here is the fact that with pra fta one can assess the impact not only of a single risk but also of entire complex chains of events consisting of a number of adverse events that may lead to partial or total failure of the mar system with pra fta one can identify common cause failures that may not be apparent when individual subsystems are examined mpindou et al 2022 this is crucial in the context of mar facilities exposed to a wide range of technical and non technical risks the most important message a mar facility operator expects from a properly conducted risk assessment is specific information regarding the risks that can most realistically endanger the proper functioning of the system partial or complete system failure the risk assessment sheds a clear light on the set of the most important risks that may negatively affect the świerczków well field in tarnów the greatest challenge for this facility in both the operational and expansion phases is the insufficient pre treatment of the recharge river water to remove suspended solids risk of excessive turbidity it is also necessary to point out that for some of the risks presented in this study the analysis was not very thorough for lack of detailed data in relation to some of the factors investigated however this paper does indicate how a mar site owner might approach the risk problem in the future if new relevant data or better resolution data become available the set of risks analysed might be easily expanded to include new risks or some existing risks could be redefined for performing a new assessment under different circumstances such changes are likely to occur around currently rapidly evolving research questions that will have a significant impact on the current and future operation of mar facilities these include for example determinations in water of newly emerging contaminants and subsequent adjustment of regulations in this regard or new climate change scenarios developed on climate models fed by more and better resolution data this research provides a firm foundation for further more detailed risk assessment together with the development of a risk mitigation plan for the coming years these results will also be useful for redesigning the monitoring plan of the świerczków well field in order to supply more input risk management data moreover the experience gained can be used to assess the risk for another well field site belonging to the tarnów waterworks 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this study is the first risk assessment covering such a wide range of technical and non technical risks for a mar site in poland this is particularly important given the prevalence of similar facilities throughout southern poland carpathian mts and carpathian foredeep as well as in large cities that use mar facilities to supply drinking water to residents treichel et al 2015 wcisło et al 2016 kruć et al 2020 matusiak et al 2021 as the use of mar methods increases globally so does the demand for mar facility risk assessments hence the comprehensive approach to mar risk assessment presented here may be an important part of risk management during the construction operation and expansion of a mar facility this paper may also contribute to the existing literature as an example of good practice for performing risk assessments of future mar projects the more often risk assessment for mar is treated holistically as in the case under consideration here the greater the chances of proper risk management and the avoidance or reduction of costs associated with mar failure the application of two risk assessment methods the risk assessment matrix and the adaption of probabilistic risk assessment i e fault tree analysis pra fta to the świerczków mar site in tarnów provided insight into the risks associated with the facility during its operation and its potential expansion in the northern part of the study area moreover the choice of two methods enabled us to determine their suitability for performing risk assessments for mar facilities of these two risk assessment methods pra fta appears to be more suitable for mar facilities exposed to multiple technical and non technical risks the main advantage of the first method is its simplicity of use and the relatively quick prioritisation of risks by means of a risk rating the second method on the other hand once probability values have been allocated to all the basic risks and then using boolean algebra allows one to quantify probabilities within whole groups of risks that could ultimately lead to a partial or complete breakdown of the mar system the pra fta method with its definition of 65 technical and non technical risks for mar facilities has to date been applied in the marsol project only in mediterranean countries however our study shows that because the basic risks and the dependencies between individual risks can be easily modified pra fta can be successfully applied in other areas with a different type of mar or other environmental and on site conditions the two risk assessment methods applied at the basic risk level of yielded approximate results the similarity in results was higher for the operational phase 92 but lower 68 for the expansion phase classifying the risks into two major groups covering technical and non technical risks shows that the former represents a significantly higher risk during both the current operation of the mar and its planned expansion the results provide a comprehensive understanding of the critical risks and enable the correct identification of weaknesses in the operation of the świerczków mar site and the risks associated with its potential expansion they offer a rationale for eliminating or mitigating identified risks to the existing mar facility to an acceptable level and for updating plans concerning the cost effectiveness and risks associated with the mar system s expansion the results of our study may provide a starting point for the development of detailed remedial plans and initiate a review of the existing monitoring system and its expansion in order to guarantee the long term viability of this mar system the most serious risk that must be further analysed and managed at the świerczków site is that of mar failure due to the insufficient reduction of suspended solids and the turbidity of the water recharging the infiltration ditches funding this research took place within the framework of the project developing an
