20960,in this study the authors proposed a new dynamic integrity test method of piles namely distributed low strain integrity test dlsits the basic idea of dlsits is that a series of accelerated sensors connected by cables are preinstalled on the steel reinforcement cage of cast in place pile or attached on the shaft of precast piles compared with the conventional methods lsits the efficient detection depth of the dlsits can be doubled and its detection accuracy is significantly improved accordingly a coupled 3d analytical model is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts a vibration mode analysis is conducted to clarify the forming mechanism of the high frequency interference during the dlsits and psts the main findings can be drawn as both the dlsits and psts suffer obvious high frequency interference arisen from the 3d effect of piles to reduce this adverse influence the radius angle between the impact force location and the axial line of receiving sensors is advised to set as 90 keywords pipe pile distributed low strain test parallel seismic test dynamic soil pile interaction high frequency interference 1 introduction integrity test is an integral part of quality assurance programs for pile foundations to ensure their satisfactory performance with the popularity of pipe piles using cast in place concrete the quality inspection for those pipe piles has become a necessary step after the pile installation ding et al 2011a b in addition the precast pipe piles installed offshore frequently experience changing working environment caused by the currents winds and developing scours wang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 making the insurance of pile quality very vital low strain integrity tests lsits have been utilized for pile testing for decades including applying a longitudinal half sine harmonic impulse at the pile head and waiting for the reflected strain wave at the same position through the interpretation of the waveform spectrum the pile length or the defects can be calculated or located morgano 1996 liao and roesset 1997 massoudi and teffera 2004 the reliability and accuracy of inversion analysis of lsits rely heavily on the choice of an appropriate soil pile interaction model therefore this research field has attracted numerous attentions in the last decades the kelvin voigt model which simplifies the soil behavior as springs and dashpots together with the one dimensional rod model is widely used for lsit result interpretations randolph and deeks 1992 el naggar and novak 1996 michaelides et al 1998 yesilce and catal 2008 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 wu et al 2020 li et al 2020 a significant disadvantage of this theoretical model is that it cannot reflect the 3d effect of wave propagating in the pile and soil which often leads to obvious misjudge or large errors to solve this problem nogami and novak 1976 rajapakse and shah 1987 wu et al 2013 and liu et al 2014 applied axisymmetric three dimensional models in their studies to simulate the radial and longitudinal propagation of elastic wave inside the soil shahmohamadi et al 2018 proposed a three dimensional model for piles embedded in the inhomogeneous isotropic soil with the green s function for low strain problems the three dimensional continuum model avoids the empirical values selection for the springs and dashpots in kelvin voigt model making the simulation of the dynamic behavior of the soil more truthfully however the above studies can be regarded as axisymmetric 1d pile 3d soil model because the pile is regarded as one dimensional rod in their models the existing studies have proven that the 3d wave effect of the pile having great interferences on the pile soil dynamic responses chai et al 2010 chow et al 2003 lü et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 luan et al 2020a 2020b bib luan et al 2020a bib luan et al 2020b as for ocean and offshore engineering the pipe pile remains the most welcomed foundations for wading structures e g offshore wind turbines vicente et al 2017 li et al 2021 considering the increasing dimensions of the offshore pipe piles the 3d effect becomes non negligible by applying axisymmetric continuum equations instead of the 1d rod models for the pile simulation the dynamic response along the pile radius were given ding et al 2011a b zheng et al 2016 2017 bib zheng et al 2016 bib zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and meng et al 2020 reported that the dynamic stiffness and damping of a solid pile or a pipe pile would vary significantly along the radial direction at the pile head for a pipe pile the influence of the elastic wave propagation in the circumferential direction plays a more dominant role than its radial propagation liu et al analyzed the circumferential wave effect of pipe pile by simplifying the soil medium as distributed springs and dashpots liu et al 2018 2019b bib liu et al 2018 bib liu et al 2019b which is regarded as 3d pile 1d soil model different from the 3d effect of the soil medium the propagation of strain waves in the circumferential or radial directions of piles would give rise to intensive high frequency interferences on the velocity response spectrum which greatly increases the difficulties of result interpretations through the above literature review it can be found that the true three dimensional coupled soil pile dynamic analysis is still unrealized which motives the present study for traditional low strain integrity tests the excitation source and receiver are both set on the pile head therefore it takes a round way for the stress wave to carry the detection information to the receiver when the pile length exceeds a certain value or the defects is relatively small the reflected signals may be completely disappeared before captured by the receiver on the pile head due to the serious damping effect of surrounding soil the rapidly decayed reflected signals become a critical factor to limit the efficient detection length and accuracy of lsits to solve this problem this paper proposes a new lsits method namely distributed low strain integrity tests dlsits a coupled 3d analytical model of the pile soil system is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts a thorough investigation to the 3d effect of pile soil system is conducted to improve the detection accuracy of the proposed dlsits and the existing psts 2 design schematics and theoretical model 2 1 schematics of the distributed low strain integrity test method as depicted in fig 1 the basic idea of dlsits is that a series of accelerated sensors with special protecting covers are preinstalled on the steel reinforcement cage of cast in place pile or attached on the shaft of precast piles the accelerated sensors are connected by cables with the same intervals so that the defect reflected signal can be captured by the nearest sensors compared with the conventional lsits the dlsits has obvious advantages as it transmits the reflected signals through the electrical signals and avoids the attenuation of stress wave when propagating along the pile shaft the efficient detection of the dlsits is doubled and its detection accuracy for small defection is also significantly improved meanwhile as the sensors are arranged with the predefined spacing intervals it enables the dlsits to quantitatively evaluate the defect degree by comparing the distributed velocities and amplitudes of the reflected signal the necking defect or concrete disintegration of cast in place piles and the pile breaking or concrete crushing due to the driving procedure of pipe piles can be easily detected with the help of dlsits 2 2 mathematical model and assumptions the schematics of the proposed mathematical model is depicted in fig 2 as it is illustrated the soil medium including the surrounding soil and inner soil is modelled as three dimensional continuum medium for the pipe pile the strain wave propagations in longitudinal and circumferential directions are considered the outer and inner radii are labeled as r 1 and r 2 while the pile length is denoted as h the general assumptions adopted in present study are listed as 1 the surrounding soil is simulated as an infinite half space while the soil inside the pipe pile is modelled as soil column the soil pile system undergoes small deformations and the pile maintains perfect contact with the soil throughout the vibration 2 the soil inside and outside the pipe pile is layered viscoelastic homogeneous medium the upper surface of the soil layer is a free surface with no normal stress and shear stress the pipe pile is simulated as an end bearing pile with the displacement at the bottom of the pile as zero 3 only the vertical displacements of the pipe pile and surrounding soil are investigated 4 the pile head impulse is simulated as half sine harmonic loads whose waveform is plotted in fig 3 besides different from the rayleigh love studies the impulse is modelled as local excitations whose formula can be expressed by eq 4 3 governing equations and boundary conditions 3 1 governing equations according to the continuum theory the governing

be found that q t is only valid at the given angle θ 0 and equals to zero at other angles so that the local excitation is mathematically realized in this model by applying fourier transform of variable t on both sides of eq 4 one obtains 6 q s p 0 t π 2 t 2 ω 2 1 e i ω t δ θ θ 0 at the moment of t 0 the soil pile system has neither velocity nor acceleration so that the harmonic excitation

the present coupled 3d model the dynamic velocity response at the pile head that computed from the present analytical solution are compared with the results predicted by the well accepted 1d pile 2d soil li et al 2020 and 3d pile 1d soil liu et al 2018 models the parameters picked in this section are listed in table 1 besides special notifications as it is illustrated in fig 4 the dynamic velocity response predicted by the present solution fits well with that of the simplified 3d pile 1d soil solution indicating that the 3d propagation of stress wave in the soil has tiny influence on the dynamic response of the pile compared with the above two 3d pile models the result calculated with the 1d pile 2d soil solution displayed large differences the most significant difference lies that the dynamic velocity response of the 3d pile models can correctly display the intensive high frequency interference phenomenon between the incident and reflected signals during lsits while the curve of the 1d pile 2d soil solution is relative smooth this is because the high frequency interferences are mainly caused by the 3d propagation of the stress wave and the 1d pile model cannot reflect this phenomenon meanwhile for the same incident signal the reflected signal of the 1d pile 2d soil 1d2d solution has much larger amplitudes than the present ones which is mainly due to the fact that the 1d2d model assumes that the stress wave only propagate along the vertical direction of the pile and the energy dissipation is much more smaller than the 3d condition from the comparisons in fig 4 it can be found that the reflected signals derived from the present solution and 3d pile 1d soil solution are ahead of the 1d pile 2d soil solution indicating that the compressive wave velocity for 2d pile model is larger than that for the 1d pile model this phenomenon can be explain from the different computational formulas of compressive wave velocities for 1d and 3d piles as presented in eq 40 a and b it can be seen from eq 40b that the compressive wave velocity is a function of poisson s ratio 40a 1 d v p 1 d e p ρ p 40b 2 d v p 2 d e p 1 υ p ρ p 1 υ p 1 2 υ p 40c pile length calculation h v p t 1 2 where υ p and t 1 denote the poisson s ratio of the pile and the arrival time of the first reflected signal respectively to investigate the influence of poisson s effect on the arrival time of the reflected signal the 3d piles with different poisson s ratios are studied with the 1d pile model as it is depicted in fig 5 the reflected signal of pile end keeps moving ahead with the increase of the poisson s ratio and the arrival time of the present solution will coincide with that of the 1d pile 2d soil solution once the poisson s ratio equals to zero as shown in eq 40c the pile length will be underestimated if applying one dimensional pile model to further investigate the 3d wave effect of soil the velocity responses of the soil derived from the present solution and the 1d pile 2d soil solutions are compared in this section the 3d pile 1d soil solution is not compared in this section because it regards the soil medium as the distributed springs and dashpots whose values are acquired from the plane strain assumption and can t exhibit the wave propagation inside the soil medium the position that chosen for the soil velocity response comparisons is 1 1r 1 away from the center of the pipe pile and the results of the comparisons are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the curves derived from the present coupled soil pile 3d model shows strong interferences at 0 and 45 to the excitation position the results indicate that the high frequency interferences arisen from the 3d effect of piles would also result in similar interferences in the dynamic velocity responses of soil however the 2d soil model fails to reveal this phenomenon besides the high frequency interferences the curves derived from the present solution and 1d2d solution fit well 6 parametric study to investigate the 3d wave effect on the velocity responses of the pile and soil a detailed parametric study is presented here the parameters picked in this section are also listed in table 1 besides special notifications 6 1 influence of the pile head sensor position on the pile head velocity response with a local impulse subjected at a certain area of the pile head it would certainly take more time for a sensor with larger angle to the excitation position to capture the circumferentially propagated wave than the sensor closer to the impulse area fig 7 illustrates this phenomenon very well in summary the larger angles to the excitation position that the sensor the later the impulse signal arrives besides the high frequency interferences at the position of 45 and 135 are opposite which is also found in 0 and 180 the position with 90 to the impulse area is least influenced by the high frequency interferences and could be the best option for signal interpretation 6 2 influence of the young s modulus of pipe pile and the compression wave velocity of soil on the pile head velocity response according to eq 40 the values of the young s modulus would directly influence the wave velocity of the pile material which is verified in fig 8 with the drop of the young s modulus of the pile the shear wave velocity would also decrease resulting more evident signal delay as the angle to the excitation increases moreover it is found that the pile with smaller young s modulus would suffer much more intensive high frequency interferences whose waveforms are also more irregular than the pile with larger young s modulus also a large value of the young s modulus can greatly eliminate the influence of the high frequency interference at 90 to the impulse area the compressive wave velocity is a key parameter which directly reflect the strength young s modulus of the soil the influence of it on the pile head velocity response is plotted in fig 9 generally the increase of the compressive wave velocity of the soil would only influence the velocity response amplitudes including both the high frequency interference and the reflected wave amplitudes and it could greatly increase the difficulties of signal interpretation once the compressive velocity of soil becomes too large considering the reflected signal could be too tiny to identify 6 3 influence of 3d effect on distributed low strain integrity tests the high frequency interferences during lsits may be the most challenges for the engineers to accurately evaluate the pile condition since it is often misjudged as reflected signals from defects or covering the efficient detection signals researchers have long realized that the high frequency interferences are arisen from the 3d effect of the pile nevertheless when coming to the specific components of high frequency interferences the existing studies are still in controversy it s widely accepted that the 3d wave effect decreases with the increase of the propagation distance and the pile can be regarded as a 1d rod when the stress wave propagates a distance of several diameters bellow the pile head however with the increasing propagation distance of the stress wave whether the high frequency interferences along the pile shaft will weaken or disappear is still unknown this is of great importance for pipe piles where the flexural vibration mode bending moment caused by eccentric local load is provoked and added to the dynamic velocity response due to the eccentric loading therefore the influence of 3d effect on distributed low strain integrity tests is investigated in this section fig 10 shows the dynamic velocity responses measured from different radius angles with respect to embedded depths fig 10 a depicts the dynamic velocity response of the pile head for different radius angles it can be seen from fig 10 a that the amplitude of the high frequency interference decreases significantly with the increase of radius angle up to θ 90 after which it increases following a similar path and the radius angle of θ 90 suffers the least high frequency interference this is because the eccentric impact applied on the pile head arouses serious flexural vibration and the angle of 90 is the neutral plane of the flexural vibration it can also be found that the arrival times of incident signals increase continuously with radius angles this is due to the circumferential propagation of stress wave the larger radius angle the longer propagation time fig 10 b c d display the dynamic velocity responses of pile shaft with respect to embedded depths it can be observed that the time lags between different radius angles decrease with the increasing depth when the measured depth exceeding a certain value say z 0 25h in this case the incident signals become to arrive at the same time for the entire cross section of pipe piles regardless of the variation of radius angles this is because the 3d effect of stress wave decreases with the increase of propagation when the stress wave propagating a certain distance the component of the incident wave has changed from the primary waves to the guided waves and at that time the pile can be regarded as a 1d rod an interesting finding from fig 10 is that although the amplitude values of the high frequency interference decrease with the increases of measured depth the ratio of the amplitude value of the high frequency interference of each depth to that of its corresponding incident signal seems to remain unchanged or can be hardly observed virtually decrease since we have proven above that the high frequency interference due to the 3d propagation of the stress wave can be suppressed after a certain propagation distance then the flexural vibration can be determined as the major component of the high frequency interference phenomenon in fig 10 b c and d this means for the dlsits the high frequency interference degree does not decrease with the increasing depth of sensor location and the radius angle is still the key factor to affect the detection accuracy to further substantiate the above findings the velocity fields of the pipe pile cross section for different propagation times and distances are compared in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the velocity field of the pile head upon the moment of the application of impact force where t 0 3 ms is the half width of the half sine harmonic impulse it can be observed that the vibration velocity decreases successively from the impact point to the radius angle 180 point along the circumferential direction fig 11 b presents the velocity field for t 2 ms when the stress wave front just propagates to the depth of z 0 5h compared with fig 11 a the velocity differences along the pile section are very gentle indicating that the stress wave propagating following the 1d rule at this time fig 11 c depicts the velocity fields of pile head for t 2 2 ms when the stress wave front has passed by the pile head about 1 8 ms the velocity field in fig 11 c is anti symmetric distributed along the connecting line between the 90 and 180 points the pile head displays obvious flexural vibration with its minimum vibration velocity lies in the neutral plane of the flexural vibration it can be found that the variation tendency of velocity field of the pile cross section in fig 11 are highly accordance with their corresponding dynamic velocity response curves in fig 10 and the rationality and accuracy of the present theoretical model have been reconfirmed conclusions drawn from figs 10 and 11 can be summarized as the high frequency interference of pipe piles is due to a combination effect of 3d propagation of stress wave and flexural vibration mode and the former factor will attenuate significantly with the propagation depth while contribution of the flexural vibration mode does not vary with depth the flexural vibration mode is the major component of high frequency interference and for the dlsts the impulse is advised to applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 from the axial line of distributed sensors to minimized the adverse influence of high frequency interference 6 4 analysis of the vibration modes of the pipe pile to further clarify the components of high frequency interference during dlsts the vibration mode analysis of pipe piles is conducted with the present model fig 12 displays the decomposed velocity response of piles with respect to modes for θ 0 it can be observed from fig 12 that the velocity curve of mode 0 can receive clearly reflected signal with no high frequency interference emerging between the incident and reflected signals the vibration mode 0 of the 3d pile model has the similar characteristics with that of the 1d rod model while for the higher modes the reflected signal from the pile end cannot be found besides the velocity curves display obvious irregular fluctuations it can be deduced that the mode 0 represents the 1d propagation of the elastic wave along the longitudinal direction of piles and higher modes are responsible for the formation of high frequency interference especially mode 1 is the main contributor of the high frequency interference combing with the findings in section 6 5 the mode 1 may be associated with the flexural vibration mode to prove this assumption the dynamic velocity curves of mode 1 of pipe piles for different receiving angles are compared in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 that the velocity curves of mode 1 is nearly completely flat without any fluctuations for θ 90 when the receiving sensors moving away from θ 90 the amplitude value of the fluctuations increase significantly the variation regularity of the amplitude value of the velocity curves of mode 1 with respect to θ is highly consistent with that of the high frequency interference meanwhile the initial vibration times of dynamic velocity curve of mode 1 do not vary with the receiving angles which is also in accordance with the characteristics of flexural vibration mode hence it can be concluded that the vibration mode 1 represents the flexural vibration mode which contributes the most to the formation of high frequency interference one can also find that in fig 12 the initial vibration times for modes 2 3 and 4 all get altered indicating these higher modes are relevant to the 3d propagation of stress wave in pipe piles which makes up the relatively small components of high frequency interference 6 5 application of 3d coupled model in parallel seismic test the parallel seismic test psts depicted in fig 14 consisting of an impact source on the pile head and distributed receivers in a borehole nearby the pile has advantages to evaluate the conditions of piles bellow a foundation lo et al 2009 sack et al 2003 liao et al 2006 ni et al 2011 and niederleithinger 2012 all contributes to the development and verification of this method wu et al 2019a b proposes a 2d soil 1d pile model to investigate the strain wave propagation inside the soil pile system the results indicate that parallel seismic test performs well for the pile length or defect detection the existing studies about the psts are mainly based on the 1d pile 2d soil model few attentions have been paid to the field of the 3d pile soil effect on the psts as the wave propagates down the pile the wave radiates into the soils and intercepts the adjacent borehole the propagation of stress wave should be three dimension and the proposed 3d coupled model will be a much more precise model for the inversion analysis of psts the influence of 3d effect of the pile on the dlsts has been thoroughly studied in above sections nevertheless how the 3d effect affects psts and whether or not the high frequency interference exists during dlsts are still unknown therefore the influence of 3d effect of the pile soil system on dlsts is investigated in this section fig 15 indicates the distributed dynamic velocity response of psts with respecting to radius angles similar with the propagation regulations of stress wave in the piles the 3d propagation of the stress wave in the soil also has a significant influence on the dynamic velocity response in shallow depth which is manifested in the obvious arrival time lags of the incident waves as the angle to the excitation source increase however this effect gradually decreases with the increase of soil depth which is attributed to the formation of the guided wave inside the pile and at the depth of 0 5h the time lag caused by 3d propagation effect becomes too tiny to be distinguished an important finding is that the dlsts also suffers obvious high frequency interference and this adverse effect will not weaken with depth for dlsts as indicated in fig 15 the amplitude of the high frequency interference in the soil reaches the minimum value at the position with a radius angle of 90 to the excitation source in accordance with the conclusions drawn from pipe piles hence it can be deduced that major component of the high frequency interference in the soil during dlsts is arisen from the flexural vibration of the pile based on above analysis it can be concluded that the dynamic velocity response of psts is strongly affected by the 3d effect of the pipe piles to reduce the adverse influence of high frequency interference due to the flexural vibration of the pile the impact force should be applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 to the borehole nearby the pile during psts also the parallel hole should be drilled nearby the tested pile as close as possible with the increase of the radial distances from the drilled hole to the pile the amplitudes of the signals would decrease meanwhile it takes much longer time for the far field holes to capture the signals 7 conclusions in this study we proposed a new lsits method namely distributed low strain integrity tests dlsits compared with the conventional lsits the efficient detection depth of the dlsits has been doubled and its detection accuracy is also significantly improved a coupled 3d analytical model of the pile soil system is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts as the psts shares a similar testing principle with the dlsits a vibration mode analysis is conducted to clarify the forming mechanism of the high frequency interference during the dlsits and psts the main conclusions can be drawn as 1 the 3d effect of the pipe piles has significantly influence on the propagation of stress wave in the soil while the 3d effect of the soil can hardly affect the vibration of the pipe piles 2 the vibration mode 0 represents the 1d propagation of the elastic wave along the longitudinal direction of piles the vibration mode 1 represents the flexural vibration mode which contributes the most to the formation of high frequency interference and the higher modes are relevant to the 3d propagation of stress wave in pipe piles which makes up the relatively small components of high frequency interference 3 the high frequency interference of pipe piles is due to a combination effect of 3d propagation of stress wave and flexural vibration mode and the former factor will attenuate significantly with the propagation depth while contributions of the flexural vibration mode does not vary with depth 4 for the dlsts the impulse is advised to applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 from the axial line of distributed sensors to minimized the adverse influence of high frequency interference 5 the parallel seismic test psts also suffers obvious high frequency interference arisen from the 3d effect of the piles to reduce this adverse influence similar with the dlsts the radius angle between the impact force and borehole should set to 90 during psts credit authorship contribution statement yunpeng zhang are responsible for

20960,in this study the authors proposed a new dynamic integrity test method of piles namely distributed low strain integrity test dlsits the basic idea of dlsits is that a series of accelerated sensors connected by cables are preinstalled on the steel reinforcement cage of cast in place pile or attached on the shaft of precast piles compared with the conventional methods lsits the efficient detection depth of the dlsits can be doubled and its detection accuracy is significantly improved accordingly a coupled 3d analytical model is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts a vibration mode analysis is conducted to clarify the forming mechanism of the high frequency interference during the dlsits and psts the main findings can be drawn as both the dlsits and psts suffer obvious high frequency interference arisen from the 3d effect of piles to reduce this adverse influence the radius angle between the impact force location and the axial line of receiving sensors is advised to set as 90 keywords pipe pile distributed low strain test parallel seismic test dynamic soil pile interaction high frequency interference 1 introduction integrity test is an integral part of quality assurance programs for pile foundations to ensure their satisfactory performance with the popularity of pipe piles using cast in place concrete the quality inspection for those pipe piles has become a necessary step after the pile installation ding et al 2011a b in addition the precast pipe piles installed offshore frequently experience changing working environment caused by the currents winds and developing scours wang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 making the insurance of pile quality very vital low strain integrity tests lsits have been utilized for pile testing for decades including applying a longitudinal half sine harmonic impulse at the pile head and waiting for the reflected strain wave at the same position through the interpretation of the waveform spectrum the pile length or the defects can be calculated or located morgano 1996 liao and roesset 1997 massoudi and teffera 2004 the reliability and accuracy of inversion analysis of lsits rely heavily on the choice of an appropriate soil pile interaction model therefore this research field has attracted numerous attentions in the last decades the kelvin voigt model which simplifies the soil behavior as springs and dashpots together with the one dimensional rod model is widely used for lsit result interpretations randolph and deeks 1992 el naggar and novak 1996 michaelides et al 1998 yesilce and catal 2008 anoyatis and mylonakis 2012 wu et al 2020 li et al 2020 a significant disadvantage of this theoretical model is that it cannot reflect the 3d effect of wave propagating in the pile and soil which often leads to obvious misjudge or large errors to solve this problem nogami and novak 1976 rajapakse and shah 1987 wu et al 2013 and liu et al 2014 applied axisymmetric three dimensional models in their studies to simulate the radial and longitudinal propagation of elastic wave inside the soil shahmohamadi et al 2018 proposed a three dimensional model for piles embedded in the inhomogeneous isotropic soil with the green s function for low strain problems the three dimensional continuum model avoids the empirical values selection for the springs and dashpots in kelvin voigt model making the simulation of the dynamic behavior of the soil more truthfully however the above studies can be regarded as axisymmetric 1d pile 3d soil model because the pile is regarded as one dimensional rod in their models the existing studies have proven that the 3d wave effect of the pile having great interferences on the pile soil dynamic responses chai et al 2010 chow et al 2003 lü et al 2014 xiao et al 2018 luan et al 2020a 2020b bib luan et al 2020a bib luan et al 2020b as for ocean and offshore engineering the pipe pile remains the most welcomed foundations for wading structures e g offshore wind turbines vicente et al 2017 li et al 2021 considering the increasing dimensions of the offshore pipe piles the 3d effect becomes non negligible by applying axisymmetric continuum equations instead of the 1d rod models for the pile simulation the dynamic response along the pile radius were given ding et al 2011a b zheng et al 2016 2017 bib zheng et al 2016 bib zheng et al 2017 liu et al 2020 and meng et al 2020 reported that the dynamic stiffness and damping of a solid pile or a pipe pile would vary significantly along the radial direction at the pile head for a pipe pile the influence of the elastic wave propagation in the circumferential direction plays a more dominant role than its radial propagation liu et al analyzed the circumferential wave effect of pipe pile by simplifying the soil medium as distributed springs and dashpots liu et al 2018 2019b bib liu et al 2018 bib liu et al 2019b which is regarded as 3d pile 1d soil model different from the 3d effect of the soil medium the propagation of strain waves in the circumferential or radial directions of piles would give rise to intensive high frequency interferences on the velocity response spectrum which greatly increases the difficulties of result interpretations through the above literature review it can be found that the true three dimensional coupled soil pile dynamic analysis is still unrealized which motives the present study for traditional low strain integrity tests the excitation source and receiver are both set on the pile head therefore it takes a round way for the stress wave to carry the detection information to the receiver when the pile length exceeds a certain value or the defects is relatively small the reflected signals may be completely disappeared before captured by the receiver on the pile head due to the serious damping effect of surrounding soil the rapidly decayed reflected signals become a critical factor to limit the efficient detection length and accuracy of lsits to solve this problem this paper proposes a new lsits method namely distributed low strain integrity tests dlsits a coupled 3d analytical model of the pile soil system is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts a thorough investigation to the 3d effect of pile soil system is conducted to improve the detection accuracy of the proposed dlsits and the existing psts 2 design schematics and theoretical model 2 1 schematics of the distributed low strain integrity test method as depicted in fig 1 the basic idea of dlsits is that a series of accelerated sensors with special protecting covers are preinstalled on the steel reinforcement cage of cast in place pile or attached on the shaft of precast piles the accelerated sensors are connected by cables with the same intervals so that the defect reflected signal can be captured by the nearest sensors compared with the conventional lsits the dlsits has obvious advantages as it transmits the reflected signals through the electrical signals and avoids the attenuation of stress wave when propagating along the pile shaft the efficient detection of the dlsits is doubled and its detection accuracy for small defection is also significantly improved meanwhile as the sensors are arranged with the predefined spacing intervals it enables the dlsits to quantitatively evaluate the defect degree by comparing the distributed velocities and amplitudes of the reflected signal the necking defect or concrete disintegration of cast in place piles and the pile breaking or concrete crushing due to the driving procedure of pipe piles can be easily detected with the help of dlsits 2 2 mathematical model and assumptions the schematics of the proposed mathematical model is depicted in fig 2 as it is illustrated the soil medium including the surrounding soil and inner soil is modelled as three dimensional continuum medium for the pipe pile the strain wave propagations in longitudinal and circumferential directions are considered the outer and inner radii are labeled as r 1 and r 2 while the pile length is denoted as h the general assumptions adopted in present study are listed as 1 the surrounding soil is simulated as an infinite half space while the soil inside the pipe pile is modelled as soil column the soil pile system undergoes small deformations and the pile maintains perfect contact with the soil throughout the vibration 2 the soil inside and outside the pipe pile is layered viscoelastic homogeneous medium the upper surface of the soil layer is a free surface with no normal stress and shear stress the pipe pile is simulated as an end bearing pile with the displacement at the bottom of the pile as zero 3 only the vertical displacements of the pipe pile and surrounding soil are investigated 4 the pile head impulse is simulated as half sine harmonic loads whose waveform is plotted in fig 3 besides different from the rayleigh love studies the impulse is modelled as local excitations whose formula can be expressed by eq 4 3 governing equations and boundary conditions 3 1 governing equations according to the continuum theory the governing

surrounding soil and the inner soil respectively λ s 1 λ s 2 denote the lame constant and g s 1 g s 2 represent the shear modulus of the saturated soil where ρ s 1 and ρ s 2 are the densities of the soil considering the propagation of the elastic wave in both longitudinal and circumferential directions inside the pipe pile as fig 2 the dynamic equilibrium equations of the pipe pile segments can be given as 2 t b r b σ z z z t b τ θ z θ f 1 r 1 f 2 r 2 ρ p t b r b 2 u p t 2 where r 1 and r 2 denote the outer and inner radius of the pipe pile respectively f 1 and f 2 represent the soil

be found that q t is only valid at the given angle θ 0 and equals to zero at other angles so that the local excitation is mathematically realized in this model by applying fourier transform of variable t on both sides of eq 4 one obtains 6 q s p 0 t π 2 t 2 ω 2 1 e i ω t δ θ θ 0 at the moment of t 0 the soil pile system has neither velocity nor acceleration so that the harmonic excitation

the present coupled 3d model the dynamic velocity response at the pile head that computed from the present analytical solution are compared with the results predicted by the well accepted 1d pile 2d soil li et al 2020 and 3d pile 1d soil liu et al 2018 models the parameters picked in this section are listed in table 1 besides special notifications as it is illustrated in fig 4 the dynamic velocity response predicted by the present solution fits well with that of the simplified 3d pile 1d soil solution indicating that the 3d propagation of stress wave in the soil has tiny influence on the dynamic response of the pile compared with the above two 3d pile models the result calculated with the 1d pile 2d soil solution displayed large differences the most significant difference lies that the dynamic velocity response of the 3d pile models can correctly display the intensive high frequency interference phenomenon between the incident and reflected signals during lsits while the curve of the 1d pile 2d soil solution is relative smooth this is because the high frequency interferences are mainly caused by the 3d propagation of the stress wave and the 1d pile model cannot reflect this phenomenon meanwhile for the same incident signal the reflected signal of the 1d pile 2d soil 1d2d solution has much larger amplitudes than the present ones which is mainly due to the fact that the 1d2d model assumes that the stress wave only propagate along the vertical direction of the pile and the energy dissipation is much more smaller than the 3d condition from the comparisons in fig 4 it can be found that the reflected signals derived from the present solution and 3d pile 1d soil solution are ahead of the 1d pile 2d soil solution indicating that the compressive wave velocity for 2d pile model is larger than that for the 1d pile model this phenomenon can be explain from the different computational formulas of compressive wave velocities for 1d and 3d piles as presented in eq 40 a and b it can be seen from eq 40b that the compressive wave velocity is a function of poisson s ratio 40a 1 d v p 1 d e p ρ p 40b 2 d v p 2 d e p 1 υ p ρ p 1 υ p 1 2 υ p 40c pile length calculation h v p t 1 2 where υ p and t 1 denote the poisson s ratio of the pile and the arrival time of the first reflected signal respectively to investigate the influence of poisson s effect on the arrival time of the reflected signal the 3d piles with different poisson s ratios are studied with the 1d pile model as it is depicted in fig 5 the reflected signal of pile end keeps moving ahead with the increase of the poisson s ratio and the arrival time of the present solution will coincide with that of the 1d pile 2d soil solution once the poisson s ratio equals to zero as shown in eq 40c the pile length will be underestimated if applying one dimensional pile model to further investigate the 3d wave effect of soil the velocity responses of the soil derived from the present solution and the 1d pile 2d soil solutions are compared in this section the 3d pile 1d soil solution is not compared in this section because it regards the soil medium as the distributed springs and dashpots whose values are acquired from the plane strain assumption and can t exhibit the wave propagation inside the soil medium the position that chosen for the soil velocity response comparisons is 1 1r 1 away from the center of the pipe pile and the results of the comparisons are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the curves derived from the present coupled soil pile 3d model shows strong interferences at 0 and 45 to the excitation position the results indicate that the high frequency interferences arisen from the 3d effect of piles would also result in similar interferences in the dynamic velocity responses of soil however the 2d soil model fails to reveal this phenomenon besides the high frequency interferences the curves derived from the present solution and 1d2d solution fit well 6 parametric study to investigate the 3d wave effect on the velocity responses of the pile and soil a detailed parametric study is presented here the parameters picked in this section are also listed in table 1 besides special notifications 6 1 influence of the pile head sensor position on the pile head velocity response with a local impulse subjected at a certain area of the pile head it would certainly take more time for a sensor with larger angle to the excitation position to capture the circumferentially propagated wave than the sensor closer to the impulse area fig 7 illustrates this phenomenon very well in summary the larger angles to the excitation position that the sensor the later the impulse signal arrives besides the high frequency interferences at the position of 45 and 135 are opposite which is also found in 0 and 180 the position with 90 to the impulse area is least influenced by the high frequency interferences and could be the best option for signal interpretation 6 2 influence of the young s modulus of pipe pile and the compression wave velocity of soil on the pile head velocity response according to eq 40 the values of the young s modulus would directly influence the wave velocity of the pile material which is verified in fig 8 with the drop of the young s modulus of the pile the shear wave velocity would also decrease resulting more evident signal delay as the angle to the excitation increases moreover it is found that the pile with smaller young s modulus would suffer much more intensive high frequency interferences whose waveforms are also more irregular than the pile with larger young s modulus also a large value of the young s modulus can greatly eliminate the influence of the high frequency interference at 90 to the impulse area the compressive wave velocity is a key parameter which directly reflect the strength young s modulus of the soil the influence of it on the pile head velocity response is plotted in fig 9 generally the increase of the compressive wave velocity of the soil would only influence the velocity response amplitudes including both the high frequency interference and the reflected wave amplitudes and it could greatly increase the difficulties of signal interpretation once the compressive velocity of soil becomes too large considering the reflected signal could be too tiny to identify 6 3 influence of 3d effect on distributed low strain integrity tests the high frequency interferences during lsits may be the most challenges for the engineers to accurately evaluate the pile condition since it is often misjudged as reflected signals from defects or covering the efficient detection signals researchers have long realized that the high frequency interferences are arisen from the 3d effect of the pile nevertheless when coming to the specific components of high frequency interferences the existing studies are still in controversy it s widely accepted that the 3d wave effect decreases with the increase of the propagation distance and the pile can be regarded as a 1d rod when the stress wave propagates a distance of several diameters bellow the pile head however with the increasing propagation distance of the stress wave whether the high frequency interferences along the pile shaft will weaken or disappear is still unknown this is of great importance for pipe piles where the flexural vibration mode bending moment caused by eccentric local load is provoked and added to the dynamic velocity response due to the eccentric loading therefore the influence of 3d effect on distributed low strain integrity tests is investigated in this section fig 10 shows the dynamic velocity responses measured from different radius angles with respect to embedded depths fig 10 a depicts the dynamic velocity response of the pile head for different radius angles it can be seen from fig 10 a that the amplitude of the high frequency interference decreases significantly with the increase of radius angle up to θ 90 after which it increases following a similar path and the radius angle of θ 90 suffers the least high frequency interference this is because the eccentric impact applied on the pile head arouses serious flexural vibration and the angle of 90 is the neutral plane of the flexural vibration it can also be found that the arrival times of incident signals increase continuously with radius angles this is due to the circumferential propagation of stress wave the larger radius angle the longer propagation time fig 10 b c d display the dynamic velocity responses of pile shaft with respect to embedded depths it can be observed that the time lags between different radius angles decrease with the increasing depth when the measured depth exceeding a certain value say z 0 25h in this case the incident signals become to arrive at the same time for the entire cross section of pipe piles regardless of the variation of radius angles this is because the 3d effect of stress wave decreases with the increase of propagation when the stress wave propagating a certain distance the component of the incident wave has changed from the primary waves to the guided waves and at that time the pile can be regarded as a 1d rod an interesting finding from fig 10 is that although the amplitude values of the high frequency interference decrease with the increases of measured depth the ratio of the amplitude value of the high frequency interference of each depth to that of its corresponding incident signal seems to remain unchanged or can be hardly observed virtually decrease since we have proven above that the high frequency interference due to the 3d propagation of the stress wave can be suppressed after a certain propagation distance then the flexural vibration can be determined as the major component of the high frequency interference phenomenon in fig 10 b c and d this means for the dlsits the high frequency interference degree does not decrease with the increasing depth of sensor location and the radius angle is still the key factor to affect the detection accuracy to further substantiate the above findings the velocity fields of the pipe pile cross section for different propagation times and distances are compared in fig 11 fig 11 a shows the velocity field of the pile head upon the moment of the application of impact force where t 0 3 ms is the half width of the half sine harmonic impulse it can be observed that the vibration velocity decreases successively from the impact point to the radius angle 180 point along the circumferential direction fig 11 b presents the velocity field for t 2 ms when the stress wave front just propagates to the depth of z 0 5h compared with fig 11 a the velocity differences along the pile section are very gentle indicating that the stress wave propagating following the 1d rule at this time fig 11 c depicts the velocity fields of pile head for t 2 2 ms when the stress wave front has passed by the pile head about 1 8 ms the velocity field in fig 11 c is anti symmetric distributed along the connecting line between the 90 and 180 points the pile head displays obvious flexural vibration with its minimum vibration velocity lies in the neutral plane of the flexural vibration it can be found that the variation tendency of velocity field of the pile cross section in fig 11 are highly accordance with their corresponding dynamic velocity response curves in fig 10 and the rationality and accuracy of the present theoretical model have been reconfirmed conclusions drawn from figs 10 and 11 can be summarized as the high frequency interference of pipe piles is due to a combination effect of 3d propagation of stress wave and flexural vibration mode and the former factor will attenuate significantly with the propagation depth while contribution of the flexural vibration mode does not vary with depth the flexural vibration mode is the major component of high frequency interference and for the dlsts the impulse is advised to applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 from the axial line of distributed sensors to minimized the adverse influence of high frequency interference 6 4 analysis of the vibration modes of the pipe pile to further clarify the components of high frequency interference during dlsts the vibration mode analysis of pipe piles is conducted with the present model fig 12 displays the decomposed velocity response of piles with respect to modes for θ 0 it can be observed from fig 12 that the velocity curve of mode 0 can receive clearly reflected signal with no high frequency interference emerging between the incident and reflected signals the vibration mode 0 of the 3d pile model has the similar characteristics with that of the 1d rod model while for the higher modes the reflected signal from the pile end cannot be found besides the velocity curves display obvious irregular fluctuations it can be deduced that the mode 0 represents the 1d propagation of the elastic wave along the longitudinal direction of piles and higher modes are responsible for the formation of high frequency interference especially mode 1 is the main contributor of the high frequency interference combing with the findings in section 6 5 the mode 1 may be associated with the flexural vibration mode to prove this assumption the dynamic velocity curves of mode 1 of pipe piles for different receiving angles are compared in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 that the velocity curves of mode 1 is nearly completely flat without any fluctuations for θ 90 when the receiving sensors moving away from θ 90 the amplitude value of the fluctuations increase significantly the variation regularity of the amplitude value of the velocity curves of mode 1 with respect to θ is highly consistent with that of the high frequency interference meanwhile the initial vibration times of dynamic velocity curve of mode 1 do not vary with the receiving angles which is also in accordance with the characteristics of flexural vibration mode hence it can be concluded that the vibration mode 1 represents the flexural vibration mode which contributes the most to the formation of high frequency interference one can also find that in fig 12 the initial vibration times for modes 2 3 and 4 all get altered indicating these higher modes are relevant to the 3d propagation of stress wave in pipe piles which makes up the relatively small components of high frequency interference 6 5 application of 3d coupled model in parallel seismic test the parallel seismic test psts depicted in fig 14 consisting of an impact source on the pile head and distributed receivers in a borehole nearby the pile has advantages to evaluate the conditions of piles bellow a foundation lo et al 2009 sack et al 2003 liao et al 2006 ni et al 2011 and niederleithinger 2012 all contributes to the development and verification of this method wu et al 2019a b proposes a 2d soil 1d pile model to investigate the strain wave propagation inside the soil pile system the results indicate that parallel seismic test performs well for the pile length or defect detection the existing studies about the psts are mainly based on the 1d pile 2d soil model few attentions have been paid to the field of the 3d pile soil effect on the psts as the wave propagates down the pile the wave radiates into the soils and intercepts the adjacent borehole the propagation of stress wave should be three dimension and the proposed 3d coupled model will be a much more precise model for the inversion analysis of psts the influence of 3d effect of the pile on the dlsts has been thoroughly studied in above sections nevertheless how the 3d effect affects psts and whether or not the high frequency interference exists during dlsts are still unknown therefore the influence of 3d effect of the pile soil system on dlsts is investigated in this section fig 15 indicates the distributed dynamic velocity response of psts with respecting to radius angles similar with the propagation regulations of stress wave in the piles the 3d propagation of the stress wave in the soil also has a significant influence on the dynamic velocity response in shallow depth which is manifested in the obvious arrival time lags of the incident waves as the angle to the excitation source increase however this effect gradually decreases with the increase of soil depth which is attributed to the formation of the guided wave inside the pile and at the depth of 0 5h the time lag caused by 3d propagation effect becomes too tiny to be distinguished an important finding is that the dlsts also suffers obvious high frequency interference and this adverse effect will not weaken with depth for dlsts as indicated in fig 15 the amplitude of the high frequency interference in the soil reaches the minimum value at the position with a radius angle of 90 to the excitation source in accordance with the conclusions drawn from pipe piles hence it can be deduced that major component of the high frequency interference in the soil during dlsts is arisen from the flexural vibration of the pile based on above analysis it can be concluded that the dynamic velocity response of psts is strongly affected by the 3d effect of the pipe piles to reduce the adverse influence of high frequency interference due to the flexural vibration of the pile the impact force should be applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 to the borehole nearby the pile during psts also the parallel hole should be drilled nearby the tested pile as close as possible with the increase of the radial distances from the drilled hole to the pile the amplitudes of the signals would decrease meanwhile it takes much longer time for the far field holes to capture the signals 7 conclusions in this study we proposed a new lsits method namely distributed low strain integrity tests dlsits compared with the conventional lsits the efficient detection depth of the dlsits has been doubled and its detection accuracy is also significantly improved a coupled 3d analytical model of the pile soil system is established for the theoretical analysis of the dlsits the developed theoretical model is also applied to investigate the 3d effect of the parallel seismic test psts as the psts shares a similar testing principle with the dlsits a vibration mode analysis is conducted to clarify the forming mechanism of the high frequency interference during the dlsits and psts the main conclusions can be drawn as 1 the 3d effect of the pipe piles has significantly influence on the propagation of stress wave in the soil while the 3d effect of the soil can hardly affect the vibration of the pipe piles 2 the vibration mode 0 represents the 1d propagation of the elastic wave along the longitudinal direction of piles the vibration mode 1 represents the flexural vibration mode which contributes the most to the formation of high frequency interference and the higher modes are relevant to the 3d propagation of stress wave in pipe piles which makes up the relatively small components of high frequency interference 3 the high frequency interference of pipe piles is due to a combination effect of 3d propagation of stress wave and flexural vibration mode and the former factor will attenuate significantly with the propagation depth while contributions of the flexural vibration mode does not vary with depth 4 for the dlsts the impulse is advised to applied at a location with a radius angle of 90 from the axial line of distributed sensors to minimized the adverse influence of high frequency interference 5 the parallel seismic test psts also suffers obvious high frequency interference arisen from the 3d effect of the piles to reduce this adverse influence similar with the dlsts the radius angle between the impact force and borehole should set to 90 during psts credit authorship contribution statement yunpeng zhang are responsible for

20961,this study examined how the wake of a scaled turbine was changed by a bypass using three different water depths with the hub at mid depth and one water depth with the hub at 40 50 and 60 of the channel depth the velocity of the flow field was sampled to compare the distributions of the turbulence intensity velocity deficit shear layer structure and wake rotation among the different cases in the experiments the shear layer had an expansion rate of 0 14 0 22 and was transversally elliptical as also shown in other works as a result of the compression of the wake the downstream turbulence intensities changed from a trimodal into a decreasing bimodal distribution until the recovery of flow was detected at 12 times the rotor diameter the rotational velocity of the wake followed a sigmoid function and was larger in the transversal than in the lateral plane by virtue of the mass flow differences within the bypass and pile interference overall an increase in the wake deficit was associated with the blockage ratio and proximity of the turbine to the water surface it could be argued that the benefits of the blockage and greater current speeds in power extraction were offset by the wake prolongation which has implications for multi unit designs graphical abstract image 1 keywords tidal turbine wake velocity deficit boundary proximity blockage effect shear layer nomenclature

considerable but unused renewable resource it is based on the movement of ocean water or differences in salinity or temperature and has a theoretical capacity of 25 880 twh neill et al 2018 the development of marine energy converter devices is expected to grow globally with increases in materials and our understanding of ocean device interaction allowing these electricity costs to compete with those from fossil fuel resources today the technologies may be divided based on the type of exploited ocean energy and include those utilising i thermal differences langer et al 2020 ii salinity gradients brauns 2009 iii waves giassi and göteman 2018 and iv tides zhang et al 2020a in particular in recent years the kinetic energy of the marine currents formed by the tides has triggered a considerable amount of scientific inquiry leading to the development of efficient turbine systems that are akin to wind turbines zhang et al 2020b compared to other renewable resources marine currents have an appreciable electricity generating characteristic geographically the velocity and duration of tidal cycles are very predictable this characteristic means that the production of electricity from tide based devices can be determined beforehand bahaj et al 2012 and it may be used in conjunction with intermittent renewable resources to provide steady power loads in addition the recent progression of offshore wind technology has been particularly useful for studying the turbine response materials support approach and economic impact of tidal units however not all the findings are applicable because tidal turbines operate in a different flow medium the denser working fluid water over air leads to higher structural stresses and susceptibility to cavitation on the turbine blades young et al 2010 hong et al 2020 the authors polagye and malte 2011 garrett and cummins 2007 zheng et al 2020 determined that tidal streams have a large practical power capacity considering the shortcomings and advantages of this new technology this kinetic energy is relevant and exploitable in constrained spaces such as between islands and in coastal lands bays and straits where currents are persistent and swift bahaj et al 2012 as a result the majority of the currently useable tidal energy is found in only 11 countries mejia olivares et al 2020 with canada 23 and australia 30 as the two largest recipients if the technology is used to produce electric power on any substantial scale it must follow a multiple unit approach called farms the flow behind the turbine called the wake establishes the restoration of the current and affects the performance of nearby deployed devices precisely quantifying the wake dynamics behind single and multiple tidal turbines under specific site conditions is a continuing concern among computer designers zhang et al 2020b because it helps to determine the optimal energy based spacing ramírez mendoza et al 2020 and locations of devices within a farm environment kolekar and banerjee 2015 nevertheless the wake of a wind or tidal turbine can be inconsistent first unlike wind turbines tidal turbines operate in regions where the boundary layer occupies most of the operating flow as a result of the low depth of the channel and high speed current prandle 1982 in other words compared to air a tidal current is limited by the bed and water surface which restrict the free wake growth along their direction the channel s transverse to rotor swept area is called the blockage a condition that greatly increases the performance zang et al 2019 compared with wind s 59 other boundary interactions appear at the bed or water surface because the tidal turbine is supported by a fixed or floating structure khan et al 2009 furthermore if the turbine is placed near the water level the complexity of the wake and boundary interaction increases impacting the turbine thrust and power zhang et al 2021 the observed reduction in water height downstream of a functioning tidal turbine can be attributed to the shapeable water surface whelan et al 2009 this change even if the solid blockage is invariable modifies the wake and consequently the turbine performance kolekar and banerjee 2015 in order to identify the performance differences between bounded and unbounded conditions koh and ng 2017 it is fundamental to comprehend the interaction between the environmental factors and the downstream tailings because it is impractical to reproduce open conditions in water tunnel test models it is convenient to transform bounded data to free stream equivalent data and free stream equivalent data to bounded data today both laboratory experiments and numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics have shed light on the influences of the blockage ratio and proximity of the upper and lower boundaries the complexity of the device modelled or tested has evolved from actuator disks to a three bladed turbine zhang et al 2017 alamian et al 2020 amiri et al 2019 and then to multiple turbines or arrays leading to a fuller picture of a farm s performance experimental studies involving perforated discs by bahaj bahaj et al 2012 showed the relationships between the wake growth and top and bottom channel boundaries based on experiments the axial symmetry of the wake disappears from the strong influence of the boundary layer and channel constraints sediment bed ramírez mendoza et al 2020 but could develop with constrained conduct or in a multi unit arrangement nitin kolekar et al 2019 found that the turbine performance and process of wake re energisation could be optimised based on the hub distance from the free surface payam aghsaee and markfort 2018 noted that for a more intense flow the recovery of the mean velocity is earlier whereas that of the turbulence intensity ti is slower because of the lower total mean kinetic energy the water depth to turbine diameter is an operating parameter that plays a considerable role in the recovery of the wake in contrast to single turbines there is much less information about the wake interactions in rows of closely spaced turbines an experimental study by nuernberg and tao 2018 reported that the wake of an array was influenced by the lateral and longitudinal spacing of the turbines the wake length decreased more when using an appropriate lateral rather than longitudinal spacing saurabh chawdhary et al 2017 illustrated the influence of the arrangement of triframe devices in terms of the overall flow perturbation and performance as a result of the venturi effect formed from the first and second downstream turbine wake interactions based on the presented and experimentally validated axiomatic theory pelz pelz et al 2020 generalised the asymptotic validity of the previously mentioned theories to relate the blockage ratio turbine head and froude number despite these promising results uncertainties persist about the wake structure with respect to turbine operation in constricted turbulent currents therefore this study had the goal of determining the effects of the channel blockage on the wake by positioning a model turbine in a current flume tests were conducted where the upper and lower transverse bypass regions had equal proportions using three different bed depths and different proportions using one repeated depth the flow conditions were recorded with and without a turbine and the results for the wake s turbulence intensity velocity deficit shear layer structure and rotation were compared 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental methods all of the experiments in this study were carried out in a circulating flume at shandong jiaotong university the equipment layout and schematic diagram of the flume are shown in fig 1 the flume is 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high the water flow velocity in the test section can be changed using the flow control system and running parameters of the pump three water levels were studied with the hub h at mid depth 0 5h and one water level condition was repeated with the hub at 20 both below and above the mid depth namely h 0 5h for h 0 48 0 72 m and h 0 4h 0 5h and 0 6h for h 0 6 m table 1 lists the underlying environmental parameters of the experiments two nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeters advs were used to measure the velocity in three directions one of which was a four probe overlooking probe and the other was a four probe side looking probe the measurement frequency of the instrument was set at 200 hz and it was used to monitor a cylindrical area with a diameter of 6 mm and height of 7 mm which was 5 cm from the probe the signal to noise ratio snr was maintained above 16 db the collected data had a correlation of more than 80 with an accuracy of 0 5 which was sufficient to capture the laboratory scale velocity transient characteristics zhang et al 2020c the longitudinal dimension was x the lateral dimension was y and the transversal direction was z see figs 1 and 2 the origin of the coordinate system was set at the hub which was located at the mid width and 10 m longitudinally away from the flume inlet to reduce the flow inhomogeneity with different heights used for the different cases see table 1 the layout of the measurement points on the yz profile for the studied cases is shown in fig 2 as seen there were 13 longitudinal profiles with a range of 1 5d 18d downstream of the turbine within each profile 25 measurement points were distributed laterally from y d 1 2 to y d 1 2 using a spacing of 0 03 m 0 1d transversally the points lay from 0 1d beyond the bed to 0 2d below the liquid level with a spacing of 0 1d 2 2 tidal turbine model and performance a metal frame was fixed in the experimental flume to support the device as shown in fig 3 the device mainly consisted of the following parts a torque measuring component nacelle pile and rotor the dc motor and torque meter were contained within a rectangular frame above the water surface to avoid any data error and influence from a long exposure to water the dc motor provided a constant rotor speed in the experiments through a control logic unit the steel shaft and helical gearing formed the transmission system inside the pile the nacelle contained the internal rolling bearings used to protect and stabilise the steel shaft the torque meter device was connected to the drive system through a disc coupling and could collect instantaneous torque and rotational speed data at sampling frequencies of 1200 hz 4800 hz and 19200 hz the torque and rotating speed of the torque shaft were measured using a 0 2 nm t21wn torque meter from the hbm company the transient data were collected and saved using a pmx data acquisition system the blades used a single nrel s822 airfoil the diameter of the rotor was 0 3 m both the xfoil open source software and blade element momentum theory bemt methods zang et al 2019 were used to optimise the rotor design zhu et al 2020 the detailed airfoil parameters of the rotor are listed in table 2 the instantaneous power coefficient of the tidal turbine c p was obtained as a fraction of the power obtained from the current 1 c p q ω 0 5 ρ a u 3 in the power measurements a butterworth low pass filter was used to reduce the data noise and prevent interference from high frequency components fig 4 illustrates this using spectral diagrams with h 0 6 m and tsr 3 clearly the signals were similar regardless of the sampling rate and the four observed harmonic frequencies based on the frequency of rotation f r were retained after the filtering process a comparison of the theoretical power performance and filtered experimental results based on the different sampling rates is shown in fig 5 the bemt simulations accurately matched the mean power experiments to prevent a turbulent wake state in the measurements the turbine was maintained near the optimal tip speed ratio of 3 9 with c p 0 33 2 3 front field the phase space threshold pst technique described by goring and nikora goring vin 2002 was used to filter the adv data the spikes identified using the pst algorithm were replaced with the mean value of the time trace the measured velocity data u x t also u y t and u z t were divided using reynolds decomposition into a time averaged component u x and time dependent transient fluctuating component u t as follows 2 u x t u x u t the non dimensional turbulence intensity in the x direction was computed as the standard deviation sd of the velocity σ u x over its mean u 0 3 t i x u 2 u 0 the integral length scale was obtained using taylor s frozen turbulence 4 l u 0 r x x d τ where r x x is the autocorrelation of the velocity at the rotating centre of the turbine as follows 5 r x x u t u t d τ u t 2 fig 6 depicts the autocorrelations for different cases the decay curve tends to zero signifying the randomness of the flow the highly correlated process is defined by the first crossing of the horizontal axis and it varies between 2 and 5 s the time length of the velocity measurements was verified by an error analysis for u 0 σ u x and l the percentage error relative to the sampling period is defined as follows 6 error x n x m x n 100 where x n is the target parameter value based on the complete time series n is 180 s in the example and x m is the target parameter value based on the m partial time series fig 7 shows the influence of the data length on the percentage of error for case 3 the 3 error threshold was reached after 3 s for u 0 after 50 s for σ u x and after 110 s for l similar results were obtained in the remaining cases in a similar way the convergence of time averaged velocity for a hub position using all cases was verified against sampling period fig 7a shows this demonstrating results become similar after 110 s in addition the measurements were repeated three times to ensure repeatability of results as can be seen from table 3 the averaged velocities of the three sets of data for the five cases at the studied hub position show differences less than 2 1 thus the measurement period was set to 160 s in the absence of a rotor measurements were made to determine the incoming flow characteristics velocity depth profile and ti as shown in fig 8 under the five conditions the velocity in the boundary layer region 0 z 0 3 d showed a log law approximation

friction velocity within the close to bed region the scale of the tests is based on the froude number f r u 0 gh 0 4 9 81 0 6 0 165 as the considered full scale turbine would be dominated by the free

as a result of the depth profile and relative origin coordinates the velocities tended to increase while ti x decreased with the hub to water transverse distance across the rotor area dotted line in fig 8 see the comparison between cases 2 and 4 the power spectrum density which is a measure of the energy content under different cases revealed a moderate to strong autocorrelation among the flows fig 9 between 0 3 and 3 hz the slope followed koch s theory or m 5 3 but approached zero for lower frequencies no significant differences were observed between the cases because eddies are thought to play a key role in turbine performance and wake recovery their size and strength can be calculated from the flow s energy intensity using the kolmogorov theory of turbulence for incompressible flows thiébaut et al 2017 the energy density spectrum of the flow is then a function of dissipation rate ε and wave number k as follows 8 e k ε 2 3 k 5 3 where ε is fitted from the measured spectrum having

flow parameters at the hub height are listed in table 4 the maximum length scale is 0 31 times the bed height 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake velocity deficit in order to trace the dissipation of the turbine wake matlab was used to process the speed data in a time averaged way and the wake velocity deficit contours of different profiles were obtained through formula 11 figs 10 and 11 present the velocity deficit contours in the xz profile y 0 and xy profile z 0 downstream for the respective operating cases wake velocity deficit u x is defined as follows 11 u x u x t u x u x t where u x t is the average value of the measured velocity at that specific location and u x is the area averaged inflow velocity corresponding to the respective operating conditions three important issues were identified in the analysis first the support further decreased the upstream velocity and its wake was complex mason jones et al 2013 tedds et al 2014 and responsive to the tip vortices the mass flow difference obtained between the upper and lower bypass regions tilted the downstream flow in an upward direction and the origin of the studied wakes was z 0 1d second the wake s proximity to the water surface chen et al 2017 disrupted its upper and inner regions and prolonged the recovery distance this was exemplified in the large wake asymmetry and lesser deficit in the core wake region of cases 1 and 4 fig 10 the bed effect was negligible third shallower water led to a higher acceleration of the flow outside the swept area of the rotor and a change in thrust due to the blockage effect an x y plane comparison of the wakes revealed that blockage was present in case 1 which further increased the upstream flow near the wall negative contour values and sharpened or compressed the wake this phenomenon was not obvious when using the same channel height but different installation positions fig 11 right the maximum wake velocity deficit was 0 65 for all of the cases as a result of the blocking effect of the nacelle and rotor and the power extraction an examination of the x y plane shows that the velocity deficit contours transitioned from less elliptical more rounded just beyond the rotor to more elliptical farther downstream fig 11 the influence of a higher water depth and thus greater wake symmetry resulted in more rounded contours downstream and faster wake recoveries beyond 3d with u x 0 1 at x d 13 for h 0 48 m compared with x d 8 5 for h 0 72 m see the lines in fig 11 left a false effect of the faster wake recoveries at the hub plane could be observed with increasing installation height as a result of the wake s upward diffusion fig 12 shows the y z plane maximum velocity deficit values with the downstream location x direction for the five cases the location of the nearest value was downstream of the tip while the remaining values were after the rotor centre the near wake maximum velocity deficits followed a concave downward curve reaching a maximum of 0 6 0 65 at x 2d according to the flow condition they then diminished longitudinally at different rates the trends may be divided into two parts 3d 6d and 8d 14d using an exponential function of base 1 2 pope 2000 with an intercept stallard et al 2015 as follows 12 δ u m a x u 0 a x d 1 2 b as depicted in fig 12 eq 12 coincides with the experimental curves while table 5 lists the coefficients obtained from the fitting curves by comparing the results for same installation at different water levels cases 1 and 5 it can again be observed that the water surface and blockage longitudinally increase the maximum wake velocity deficits a change in the installation position alone had little impact on the wake maximum velocity deficit and velocity recovery rate the parameters of the fitting curve were similar 3 2 shear layer as can be seen from the velocity deficit contour in the xy profile the wakes for the different cases were basically axisymmetric but could be portrayed as shear flows because of the differences in the upstream and downstream speeds and turbulence levels with width δ and centreline radius r δ in this study the width of the shear layer was an expression of the inflow and maximum slope velocity between the separating streamlines brown g 1974 13 δ u 0 d u d r m a x 1 the radial velocity gradient was obtained by the second order fourier fitting of the velocity polynomial with radial increments dr 30 m m based on an interpolation techniques in a cartesian coordinate system taking case 3 as an example schematic diagrams of the annular shear layers in the xy and xz profiles are shown in fig 13 the corresponding longitudinal variations in the radius and shear layer thickness in the y and z directions are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the appendix shows the radius curves fitted with gaussian statistics because of the wake assumption the shear layer s centreline on the xy horizontal profile was symmetrical i e the red dot in fig 13 and expanded longitudinal with a rate ranging from 0 12 for case 1 2 3 compared with 0 145 for case 4 and 5 thereafter x 3d the thickness discrepancies among the curves decrease in agreement with stallard et al 2015 the radius as a measure of the shear layer thickness slightly shrunk grew and became more uniform longitudinally with wake diffusion with a centreline close to the blade tip the inflexion point was at 3d just where the velocity deficit was the maximum after leaving the rotor the wake was largely recovered at 6d where the thickness and radius peak the radius was on average larger for case 5 than for the remaining cases because the pile interfered and obstructed the wake flow the velocity deficit was the maximum at 3d but greater at the upper part than at the lower part thereby causing the wake to drift upward and prolonging the recovery after 6d the upper shear layer could not be obtained using the theory in the x z plane see fig 15b compared to the xy profile the lower shear layer expanded longitudinally with a centreline radius tilting upwards but close to the blade tip position the radii slowly decreased from 0 5 at x 1 5d to 0 35 at x 3d but then decreased at a different rate according to the flow the largest average radius was found in case 5 with the lowest for case 2 followed by case 1 the thickness curves followed an exponential form with expansion rates ranging from 0 145 for cases 1 2 and 3 to 0 22 for cases 4 and 5 the largest thickness discrepancies among the two groups of curves were observed between 2 and 3d clearly these radii and thickness values which were lower than those in the x y plane indicated that the circumferential shear layer was not uniform this was consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that the shear layer in the y z plane was elliptical stallard et al 2015 by virtue of the transverse depth limitation radius reduction and compression of the shear layer because the shear layer is the region where the momentum and energy from high and low velocities harmonise having a larger expansion rate and thickness leads to higher flow mixing and thus wake recovery for this reason the three dimensional flow field of case 5 as a result of larger but equal upper and lower bypass flows leads to a faster wake recovery than the other cases particularly against blocked case 1 figs 14 and 15 3 3 turbulence intensity the turbulence intensity in the x y plane had a bimodal distribution with peaks close to the blade tips z 0 6d and heights decreasing in the streamwise direction fig 16 until the initial conditions approached at x 10d the trends were consistent regardless of the relative water depth and installation position although differences could be observed downstream of the turbine up to 4d overall the ti x curve for case 5 was the greatest up to 10d due to greater flow mixing but also the lowest at 18d as a result of faster wake recovery the influence of blockage reduced the ti x curve being more prominent at the origin between 2 5 and 3 5d and with the lateral constriction condition case 1 in the x z plane the ti x curve transitioned between 2 and 2 5d from a trimodal to bimodal distribution with the peak at the lower tip being wider and higher than the peak at the upper tip and origin its ti x was close to the undisturbed flow and thus only appeared initially as wake recovered an implication of this was the relatively high axial induction factor near the blade tips predicted by bemt combined with the higher velocity reduction due to the pile leading to less flow mixing in the upper channel the ti profiles of the flows near the wake 4d were governed by a gaussian peak function 14 ti x i 1 n a i exp y d b i c i 2 where a i is the amplitude y d is the transverse to diameter distance b i is the centroid distance c i is the width and n is the number of superimposed peaks the fitted coefficients along with the goodness of the model are summarised in the appendix at 5d the interference of the turbine was relatively weak and the distributions were curved vertical lines the initial flow conditions were met beyond 12d as observed the ti x distributions in different environments were basically coincident outside but different inside the turbine swept region due to the relative bypass flow size in general a greater water depth led to a greater overall level for ti x in the wake thus case 5 had the largest ti state while the case 1 antinodes near the blade tips were the smallest giving smaller ti intensities across the rotor plane the higher upper to lower bypass condition impacted the near water surface area resulting in a higher wake length and turbulence intensity fig 17 due to wake drift because the flow was more constrained by the channel bottom than by the water surface oscillation the upper and lower boundary ti x profiles were different this interaction has also been discussed in bahaj et al 2012 kolekar and banerjee 2015 the extension of ti in the y z plane is further analysed in fig 18 at five positions near the water and bottom surface at the top and bottom tip and at the turbine centre as expected a drop in ti could be observed for conditions with high hub to bed depths such as cases 2 and 5 before 6d because of the relatively high turbine height ti was almost constant at the bottom 0 12 regardless of the flow condition the top tip s ti peaked at 3d with the bottom tip s at 2d and thereafter both diminished to the initial conditions with small differences among the environments at the turbine centre ti dropped abruptly at 2d after which it increased and diminished peaking with a value of 0 16 at 3d for all but case 1 ti max 0 15 at 4d 3 4 rotation effect the turbine blades produced an opposite torque on the surrounding water flow in the form of wake rotation tedds tedds et al 2014 identified the excessive wake flow prediction associated with neglecting the effect of a porous disc on the flow torque it has been demonstrated morris et al 2016 that the jet growth entrainment and decay rates can be enhanced by accounting for swirl in simulations thus attention should be given to the rotation of the wake in this study the rotation effect of the wake was represented by the proportion of local rotation velocity defined by eq 15 15 s u r o t a t i o n u x where u r o t a t i o n is the local tangential speed of the wake u r o t a t i o n u z for the x y plane and u r o t a t i o n u y for the x z plane fig 19 shows the distributions of the rotation effect in the respective y and z directions it can be seen that the rotation velocity profile in the y direction is an asymmetrical s shaped curve with the upper branch extending from 0 at 0 6d and reaching a maximum at 0 4d the slope of the middle branch ranges from 0 6 to 4 3 see the appendix for more details the lower branch starts from the peak at 0 2d and reaches 0 at 0 6d in the streamwise direction the upper peak curve y 0 1d is smaller and flattens more than the lower curve y 0 1d as a consequence of the torque direction pile interference and wake drift the rotational effects are prominent up to 4d where pressure is restored zhang et al 2020b but can still be observed at 14d a comparison of cases 1 and 5 fig 20 a and b reveals that the rotation in the near wake increases with the blockage ratio as shown in fig 20c and d a higher hub to bed depth tends to increase the rotation consistent with the observed wake prolongation figs 10 and 11 the z and y direction rotational curves are similar s shaped curves but differ in a number of respects first the transversal rotational velocity in the x axis direction at the upper boundary is limited by the span of the measurements and asymptotes to 0 05 0 1 while at the lower boundary s remains at 0 1 even after the dissipation of the wake fig 20f these values are in agreement with the free flow generated by the test flume given that the distribution of u y in the z direction is not completely equal to 0 second the rotational effect was greater in the z direction than in the y direction as a result of the transversal space limitation and velocity reduction by the pile under different flows the upper peak trends were equivalent suggesting that the pile exerted a large influence in the near wake region in contrast the lower peak of the rotation distribution increased for high blockage case 1 fig 20b and the high upper to lower bypass region fig 20d in accordance with the distribution of rotation in the x y plane 4 conclusion the specific objective of this study was to determine the effects of bypass flow on the formation of wakes experiments under five water conditions were performed using a model turbine and measurements were taken of the flow field wake velocity and turbine performance the wake deficit close to the turbine was largely influenced by the pile leading to an upward wake drift and the maximum trend decreased exponentially with the downstream distance supporting the results of previous studies the shear layer structure in the xy plane was symmetrical whereas in the xz plane the radius and thickness of the wake shear layer were compressed or had an elliptical form mirroring other studies the turbulence intensity was trimodal and bimodal in the xy plane and followed an s function in the xz plane with recovery reached at 12d the peaks in the distributions tended to appear near the blade tips owing to the rapid augmentation of the axial induction factor and initially near the origin by virtue of its affinity with the free stream conditions because of the pile and the proximity of the turbine to the fluctuating surface the functions were asymmetrical in the transverse direction and recovery was attained faster for the lower part than for the upper part the rotational wake velocity followed an asymmetrical s shaped curve because of the pile peaked at the blade tips and was observed up to 4d where pressure recovered to ambient conditions prominent differences were observed among the different environments the research suggested that a higher blockage with symmetrical bypass regions led to less wake recovery and shear thickness expansion and thus could counterbalance the high power efficiencies further work on turbine wake interaction is recommended to develop a fuller picture of tidal farm efficiency a similar but lower effect was obtained with a larger upper region compared to the lower bypass region the bed effects were negligible these results confirmed that a wake length reduction is associated with more uniform exposure to the turbulence intensity particularly around the swept region resulting in less wake rotation improved mixing and a larger expansion rate for the shear layer structure in further research the use of this wake data could be a means for establishing the spacing of turbine arrays to provide the maximum power output credit authorship contribution

20961,this study examined how the wake of a scaled turbine was changed by a bypass using three different water depths with the hub at mid depth and one water depth with the hub at 40 50 and 60 of the channel depth the velocity of the flow field was sampled to compare the distributions of the turbulence intensity velocity deficit shear layer structure and wake rotation among the different cases in the experiments the shear layer had an expansion rate of 0 14 0 22 and was transversally elliptical as also shown in other works as a result of the compression of the wake the downstream turbulence intensities changed from a trimodal into a decreasing bimodal distribution until the recovery of flow was detected at 12 times the rotor diameter the rotational velocity of the wake followed a sigmoid function and was larger in the transversal than in the lateral plane by virtue of the mass flow differences within the bypass and pile interference overall an increase in the wake deficit was associated with the blockage ratio and proximity of the turbine to the water surface it could be argued that the benefits of the blockage and greater current speeds in power extraction were offset by the wake prolongation which has implications for multi unit designs graphical abstract image 1 keywords tidal turbine wake velocity deficit boundary proximity blockage effect shear layer nomenclature

considerable but unused renewable resource it is based on the movement of ocean water or differences in salinity or temperature and has a theoretical capacity of 25 880 twh neill et al 2018 the development of marine energy converter devices is expected to grow globally with increases in materials and our understanding of ocean device interaction allowing these electricity costs to compete with those from fossil fuel resources today the technologies may be divided based on the type of exploited ocean energy and include those utilising i thermal differences langer et al 2020 ii salinity gradients brauns 2009 iii waves giassi and göteman 2018 and iv tides zhang et al 2020a in particular in recent years the kinetic energy of the marine currents formed by the tides has triggered a considerable amount of scientific inquiry leading to the development of efficient turbine systems that are akin to wind turbines zhang et al 2020b compared to other renewable resources marine currents have an appreciable electricity generating characteristic geographically the velocity and duration of tidal cycles are very predictable this characteristic means that the production of electricity from tide based devices can be determined beforehand bahaj et al 2012 and it may be used in conjunction with intermittent renewable resources to provide steady power loads in addition the recent progression of offshore wind technology has been particularly useful for studying the turbine response materials support approach and economic impact of tidal units however not all the findings are applicable because tidal turbines operate in a different flow medium the denser working fluid water over air leads to higher structural stresses and susceptibility to cavitation on the turbine blades young et al 2010 hong et al 2020 the authors polagye and malte 2011 garrett and cummins 2007 zheng et al 2020 determined that tidal streams have a large practical power capacity considering the shortcomings and advantages of this new technology this kinetic energy is relevant and exploitable in constrained spaces such as between islands and in coastal lands bays and straits where currents are persistent and swift bahaj et al 2012 as a result the majority of the currently useable tidal energy is found in only 11 countries mejia olivares et al 2020 with canada 23 and australia 30 as the two largest recipients if the technology is used to produce electric power on any substantial scale it must follow a multiple unit approach called farms the flow behind the turbine called the wake establishes the restoration of the current and affects the performance of nearby deployed devices precisely quantifying the wake dynamics behind single and multiple tidal turbines under specific site conditions is a continuing concern among computer designers zhang et al 2020b because it helps to determine the optimal energy based spacing ramírez mendoza et al 2020 and locations of devices within a farm environment kolekar and banerjee 2015 nevertheless the wake of a wind or tidal turbine can be inconsistent first unlike wind turbines tidal turbines operate in regions where the boundary layer occupies most of the operating flow as a result of the low depth of the channel and high speed current prandle 1982 in other words compared to air a tidal current is limited by the bed and water surface which restrict the free wake growth along their direction the channel s transverse to rotor swept area is called the blockage a condition that greatly increases the performance zang et al 2019 compared with wind s 59 other boundary interactions appear at the bed or water surface because the tidal turbine is supported by a fixed or floating structure khan et al 2009 furthermore if the turbine is placed near the water level the complexity of the wake and boundary interaction increases impacting the turbine thrust and power zhang et al 2021 the observed reduction in water height downstream of a functioning tidal turbine can be attributed to the shapeable water surface whelan et al 2009 this change even if the solid blockage is invariable modifies the wake and consequently the turbine performance kolekar and banerjee 2015 in order to identify the performance differences between bounded and unbounded conditions koh and ng 2017 it is fundamental to comprehend the interaction between the environmental factors and the downstream tailings because it is impractical to reproduce open conditions in water tunnel test models it is convenient to transform bounded data to free stream equivalent data and free stream equivalent data to bounded data today both laboratory experiments and numerical modelling using computational fluid dynamics have shed light on the influences of the blockage ratio and proximity of the upper and lower boundaries the complexity of the device modelled or tested has evolved from actuator disks to a three bladed turbine zhang et al 2017 alamian et al 2020 amiri et al 2019 and then to multiple turbines or arrays leading to a fuller picture of a farm s performance experimental studies involving perforated discs by bahaj bahaj et al 2012 showed the relationships between the wake growth and top and bottom channel boundaries based on experiments the axial symmetry of the wake disappears from the strong influence of the boundary layer and channel constraints sediment bed ramírez mendoza et al 2020 but could develop with constrained conduct or in a multi unit arrangement nitin kolekar et al 2019 found that the turbine performance and process of wake re energisation could be optimised based on the hub distance from the free surface payam aghsaee and markfort 2018 noted that for a more intense flow the recovery of the mean velocity is earlier whereas that of the turbulence intensity ti is slower because of the lower total mean kinetic energy the water depth to turbine diameter is an operating parameter that plays a considerable role in the recovery of the wake in contrast to single turbines there is much less information about the wake interactions in rows of closely spaced turbines an experimental study by nuernberg and tao 2018 reported that the wake of an array was influenced by the lateral and longitudinal spacing of the turbines the wake length decreased more when using an appropriate lateral rather than longitudinal spacing saurabh chawdhary et al 2017 illustrated the influence of the arrangement of triframe devices in terms of the overall flow perturbation and performance as a result of the venturi effect formed from the first and second downstream turbine wake interactions based on the presented and experimentally validated axiomatic theory pelz pelz et al 2020 generalised the asymptotic validity of the previously mentioned theories to relate the blockage ratio turbine head and froude number despite these promising results uncertainties persist about the wake structure with respect to turbine operation in constricted turbulent currents therefore this study had the goal of determining the effects of the channel blockage on the wake by positioning a model turbine in a current flume tests were conducted where the upper and lower transverse bypass regions had equal proportions using three different bed depths and different proportions using one repeated depth the flow conditions were recorded with and without a turbine and the results for the wake s turbulence intensity velocity deficit shear layer structure and rotation were compared 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental methods all of the experiments in this study were carried out in a circulating flume at shandong jiaotong university the equipment layout and schematic diagram of the flume are shown in fig 1 the flume is 50 m long 1 2 m wide and 1 2 m high the water flow velocity in the test section can be changed using the flow control system and running parameters of the pump three water levels were studied with the hub h at mid depth 0 5h and one water level condition was repeated with the hub at 20 both below and above the mid depth namely h 0 5h for h 0 48 0 72 m and h 0 4h 0 5h and 0 6h for h 0 6 m table 1 lists the underlying environmental parameters of the experiments two nortek vectrino acoustic doppler velocimeters advs were used to measure the velocity in three directions one of which was a four probe overlooking probe and the other was a four probe side looking probe the measurement frequency of the instrument was set at 200 hz and it was used to monitor a cylindrical area with a diameter of 6 mm and height of 7 mm which was 5 cm from the probe the signal to noise ratio snr was maintained above 16 db the collected data had a correlation of more than 80 with an accuracy of 0 5 which was sufficient to capture the laboratory scale velocity transient characteristics zhang et al 2020c the longitudinal dimension was x the lateral dimension was y and the transversal direction was z see figs 1 and 2 the origin of the coordinate system was set at the hub which was located at the mid width and 10 m longitudinally away from the flume inlet to reduce the flow inhomogeneity with different heights used for the different cases see table 1 the layout of the measurement points on the yz profile for the studied cases is shown in fig 2 as seen there were 13 longitudinal profiles with a range of 1 5d 18d downstream of the turbine within each profile 25 measurement points were distributed laterally from y d 1 2 to y d 1 2 using a spacing of 0 03 m 0 1d transversally the points lay from 0 1d beyond the bed to 0 2d below the liquid level with a spacing of 0 1d 2 2 tidal turbine model and performance a metal frame was fixed in the experimental flume to support the device as shown in fig 3 the device mainly consisted of the following parts a torque measuring component nacelle pile and rotor the dc motor and torque meter were contained within a rectangular frame above the water surface to avoid any data error and influence from a long exposure to water the dc motor provided a constant rotor speed in the experiments through a control logic unit the steel shaft and helical gearing formed the transmission system inside the pile the nacelle contained the internal rolling bearings used to protect and stabilise the steel shaft the torque meter device was connected to the drive system through a disc coupling and could collect instantaneous torque and rotational speed data at sampling frequencies of 1200 hz 4800 hz and 19200 hz the torque and rotating speed of the torque shaft were measured using a 0 2 nm t21wn torque meter from the hbm company the transient data were collected and saved using a pmx data acquisition system the blades used a single nrel s822 airfoil the diameter of the rotor was 0 3 m both the xfoil open source software and blade element momentum theory bemt methods zang et al 2019 were used to optimise the rotor design zhu et al 2020 the detailed airfoil parameters of the rotor are listed in table 2 the instantaneous power coefficient of the tidal turbine c p was obtained as a fraction of the power obtained from the current 1 c p q ω 0 5 ρ a u 3 in the power measurements a butterworth low pass filter was used to reduce the data noise and prevent interference from high frequency components fig 4 illustrates this using spectral diagrams with h 0 6 m and tsr 3 clearly the signals were similar regardless of the sampling rate and the four observed harmonic frequencies based on the frequency of rotation f r were retained after the filtering process a comparison of the theoretical power performance and filtered experimental results based on the different sampling rates is shown in fig 5 the bemt simulations accurately matched the mean power experiments to prevent a turbulent wake state in the measurements the turbine was maintained near the optimal tip speed ratio of 3 9 with c p 0 33 2 3 front field the phase space threshold pst technique described by goring and nikora goring vin 2002 was used to filter the adv data the spikes identified using the pst algorithm were replaced with the mean value of the time trace the measured velocity data u x t also u y t and u z t were divided using reynolds decomposition into a time averaged component u x and time dependent transient fluctuating component u t as follows 2 u x t u x u t the non dimensional turbulence intensity in the x direction was computed as the standard deviation sd of the velocity σ u x over its mean u 0 3 t i x u 2 u 0 the integral length scale was obtained using taylor s frozen turbulence 4 l u 0 r x x d τ where r x x is the autocorrelation of the velocity at the rotating centre of the turbine as follows 5 r x x u t u t d τ u t 2 fig 6 depicts the autocorrelations for different cases the decay curve tends to zero signifying the randomness of the flow the highly correlated process is defined by the first crossing of the horizontal axis and it varies between 2 and 5 s the time length of the velocity measurements was verified by an error analysis for u 0 σ u x and l the percentage error relative to the sampling period is defined as follows 6 error x n x m x n 100 where x n is the target parameter value based on the complete time series n is 180 s in the example and x m is the target parameter value based on the m partial time series fig 7 shows the influence of the data length on the percentage of error for case 3 the 3 error threshold was reached after 3 s for u 0 after 50 s for σ u x and after 110 s for l similar results were obtained in the remaining cases in a similar way the convergence of time averaged velocity for a hub position using all cases was verified against sampling period fig 7a shows this demonstrating results become similar after 110 s in addition the measurements were repeated three times to ensure repeatability of results as can be seen from table 3 the averaged velocities of the three sets of data for the five cases at the studied hub position show differences less than 2 1 thus the measurement period was set to 160 s in the absence of a rotor measurements were made to determine the incoming flow characteristics velocity depth profile and ti as shown in fig 8 under the five conditions the velocity in the boundary layer region 0 z 0 3 d showed a log law approximation

as a result of the depth profile and relative origin coordinates the velocities tended to increase while ti x decreased with the hub to water transverse distance across the rotor area dotted line in fig 8 see the comparison between cases 2 and 4 the power spectrum density which is a measure of the energy content under different cases revealed a moderate to strong autocorrelation among the flows fig 9 between 0 3 and 3 hz the slope followed koch s theory or m 5 3 but approached zero for lower frequencies no significant differences were observed between the cases because eddies are thought to play a key role in turbine performance and wake recovery their size and strength can be calculated from the flow s energy intensity using the kolmogorov theory of turbulence for incompressible flows thiébaut et al 2017 the energy density spectrum of the flow is then a function of dissipation rate ε and wave number k as follows 8 e k ε 2 3 k 5 3 where ε is fitted from the measured spectrum having

flow parameters at the hub height are listed in table 4 the maximum length scale is 0 31 times the bed height 3 results and discussion 3 1 wake velocity deficit in order to trace the dissipation of the turbine wake matlab was used to process the speed data in a time averaged way and the wake velocity deficit contours of different profiles were obtained through formula 11 figs 10 and 11 present the velocity deficit contours in the xz profile y 0 and xy profile z 0 downstream for the respective operating cases wake velocity deficit u x is defined as follows 11 u x u x t u x u x t where u x t is the average value of the measured velocity at that specific location and u x is the area averaged inflow velocity corresponding to the respective operating conditions three important issues were identified in the analysis first the support further decreased the upstream velocity and its wake was complex mason jones et al 2013 tedds et al 2014 and responsive to the tip vortices the mass flow difference obtained between the upper and lower bypass regions tilted the downstream flow in an upward direction and the origin of the studied wakes was z 0 1d second the wake s proximity to the water surface chen et al 2017 disrupted its upper and inner regions and prolonged the recovery distance this was exemplified in the large wake asymmetry and lesser deficit in the core wake region of cases 1 and 4 fig 10 the bed effect was negligible third shallower water led to a higher acceleration of the flow outside the swept area of the rotor and a change in thrust due to the blockage effect an x y plane comparison of the wakes revealed that blockage was present in case 1 which further increased the upstream flow near the wall negative contour values and sharpened or compressed the wake this phenomenon was not obvious when using the same channel height but different installation positions fig 11 right the maximum wake velocity deficit was 0 65 for all of the cases as a result of the blocking effect of the nacelle and rotor and the power extraction an examination of the x y plane shows that the velocity deficit contours transitioned from less elliptical more rounded just beyond the rotor to more elliptical farther downstream fig 11 the influence of a higher water depth and thus greater wake symmetry resulted in more rounded contours downstream and faster wake recoveries beyond 3d with u x 0 1 at x d 13 for h 0 48 m compared with x d 8 5 for h 0 72 m see the lines in fig 11 left a false effect of the faster wake recoveries at the hub plane could be observed with increasing installation height as a result of the wake s upward diffusion fig 12 shows the y z plane maximum velocity deficit values with the downstream location x direction for the five cases the location of the nearest value was downstream of the tip while the remaining values were after the rotor centre the near wake maximum velocity deficits followed a concave downward curve reaching a maximum of 0 6 0 65 at x 2d according to the flow condition they then diminished longitudinally at different rates the trends may be divided into two parts 3d 6d and 8d 14d using an exponential function of base 1 2 pope 2000 with an intercept stallard et al 2015 as follows 12 δ u m a x u 0 a x d 1 2 b as depicted in fig 12 eq 12 coincides with the experimental curves while table 5 lists the coefficients obtained from the fitting curves by comparing the results for same installation at different water levels cases 1 and 5 it can again be observed that the water surface and blockage longitudinally increase the maximum wake velocity deficits a change in the installation position alone had little impact on the wake maximum velocity deficit and velocity recovery rate the parameters of the fitting curve were similar 3 2 shear layer as can be seen from the velocity deficit contour in the xy profile the wakes for the different cases were basically axisymmetric but could be portrayed as shear flows because of the differences in the upstream and downstream speeds and turbulence levels with width δ and centreline radius r δ in this study the width of the shear layer was an expression of the inflow and maximum slope velocity between the separating streamlines brown g 1974 13 δ u 0 d u d r m a x 1 the radial velocity gradient was obtained by the second order fourier fitting of the velocity polynomial with radial increments dr 30 m m based on an interpolation techniques in a cartesian coordinate system taking case 3 as an example schematic diagrams of the annular shear layers in the xy and xz profiles are shown in fig 13 the corresponding longitudinal variations in the radius and shear layer thickness in the y and z directions are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the appendix shows the radius curves fitted with gaussian statistics because of the wake assumption the shear layer s centreline on the xy horizontal profile was symmetrical i e the red dot in fig 13 and expanded longitudinal with a rate ranging from 0 12 for case 1 2 3 compared with 0 145 for case 4 and 5 thereafter x 3d the thickness discrepancies among the curves decrease in agreement with stallard et al 2015 the radius as a measure of the shear layer thickness slightly shrunk grew and became more uniform longitudinally with wake diffusion with a centreline close to the blade tip the inflexion point was at 3d just where the velocity deficit was the maximum after leaving the rotor the wake was largely recovered at 6d where the thickness and radius peak the radius was on average larger for case 5 than for the remaining cases because the pile interfered and obstructed the wake flow the velocity deficit was the maximum at 3d but greater at the upper part than at the lower part thereby causing the wake to drift upward and prolonging the recovery after 6d the upper shear layer could not be obtained using the theory in the x z plane see fig 15b compared to the xy profile the lower shear layer expanded longitudinally with a centreline radius tilting upwards but close to the blade tip position the radii slowly decreased from 0 5 at x 1 5d to 0 35 at x 3d but then decreased at a different rate according to the flow the largest average radius was found in case 5 with the lowest for case 2 followed by case 1 the thickness curves followed an exponential form with expansion rates ranging from 0 145 for cases 1 2 and 3 to 0 22 for cases 4 and 5 the largest thickness discrepancies among the two groups of curves were observed between 2 and 3d clearly these radii and thickness values which were lower than those in the x y plane indicated that the circumferential shear layer was not uniform this was consistent with the results of recent studies indicating that the shear layer in the y z plane was elliptical stallard et al 2015 by virtue of the transverse depth limitation radius reduction and compression of the shear layer because the shear layer is the region where the momentum and energy from high and low velocities harmonise having a larger expansion rate and thickness leads to higher flow mixing and thus wake recovery for this reason the three dimensional flow field of case 5 as a result of larger but equal upper and lower bypass flows leads to a faster wake recovery than the other cases particularly against blocked case 1 figs 14 and 15 3 3 turbulence intensity the turbulence intensity in the x y plane had a bimodal distribution with peaks close to the blade tips z 0 6d and heights decreasing in the streamwise direction fig 16 until the initial conditions approached at x 10d the trends were consistent regardless of the relative water depth and installation position although differences could be observed downstream of the turbine up to 4d overall the ti x curve for case 5 was the greatest up to 10d due to greater flow mixing but also the lowest at 18d as a result of faster wake recovery the influence of blockage reduced the ti x curve being more prominent at the origin between 2 5 and 3 5d and with the lateral constriction condition case 1 in the x z plane the ti x curve transitioned between 2 and 2 5d from a trimodal to bimodal distribution with the peak at the lower tip being wider and higher than the peak at the upper tip and origin its ti x was close to the undisturbed flow and thus only appeared initially as wake recovered an implication of this was the relatively high axial induction factor near the blade tips predicted by bemt combined with the higher velocity reduction due to the pile leading to less flow mixing in the upper channel the ti profiles of the flows near the wake 4d were governed by a gaussian peak function 14 ti x i 1 n a i exp y d b i c i 2 where a i is the amplitude y d is the transverse to diameter distance b i is the centroid distance c i is the width and n is the number of superimposed peaks the fitted coefficients along with the goodness of the model are summarised in the appendix at 5d the interference of the turbine was relatively weak and the distributions were curved vertical lines the initial flow conditions were met beyond 12d as observed the ti x distributions in different environments were basically coincident outside but different inside the turbine swept region due to the relative bypass flow size in general a greater water depth led to a greater overall level for ti x in the wake thus case 5 had the largest ti state while the case 1 antinodes near the blade tips were the smallest giving smaller ti intensities across the rotor plane the higher upper to lower bypass condition impacted the near water surface area resulting in a higher wake length and turbulence intensity fig 17 due to wake drift because the flow was more constrained by the channel bottom than by the water surface oscillation the upper and lower boundary ti x profiles were different this interaction has also been discussed in bahaj et al 2012 kolekar and banerjee 2015 the extension of ti in the y z plane is further analysed in fig 18 at five positions near the water and bottom surface at the top and bottom tip and at the turbine centre as expected a drop in ti could be observed for conditions with high hub to bed depths such as cases 2 and 5 before 6d because of the relatively high turbine height ti was almost constant at the bottom 0 12 regardless of the flow condition the top tip s ti peaked at 3d with the bottom tip s at 2d and thereafter both diminished to the initial conditions with small differences among the environments at the turbine centre ti dropped abruptly at 2d after which it increased and diminished peaking with a value of 0 16 at 3d for all but case 1 ti max 0 15 at 4d 3 4 rotation effect the turbine blades produced an opposite torque on the surrounding water flow in the form of wake rotation tedds tedds et al 2014 identified the excessive wake flow prediction associated with neglecting the effect of a porous disc on the flow torque it has been demonstrated morris et al 2016 that the jet growth entrainment and decay rates can be enhanced by accounting for swirl in simulations thus attention should be given to the rotation of the wake in this study the rotation effect of the wake was represented by the proportion of local rotation velocity defined by eq 15 15 s u r o t a t i o n u x where u r o t a t i o n is the local tangential speed of the wake u r o t a t i o n u z for the x y plane and u r o t a t i o n u y for the x z plane fig 19 shows the distributions of the rotation effect in the respective y and z directions it can be seen that the rotation velocity profile in the y direction is an asymmetrical s shaped curve with the upper branch extending from 0 at 0 6d and reaching a maximum at 0 4d the slope of the middle branch ranges from 0 6 to 4 3 see the appendix for more details the lower branch starts from the peak at 0 2d and reaches 0 at 0 6d in the streamwise direction the upper peak curve y 0 1d is smaller and flattens more than the lower curve y 0 1d as a consequence of the torque direction pile interference and wake drift the rotational effects are prominent up to 4d where pressure is restored zhang et al 2020b but can still be observed at 14d a comparison of cases 1 and 5 fig 20 a and b reveals that the rotation in the near wake increases with the blockage ratio as shown in fig 20c and d a higher hub to bed depth tends to increase the rotation consistent with the observed wake prolongation figs 10 and 11 the z and y direction rotational curves are similar s shaped curves but differ in a number of respects first the transversal rotational velocity in the x axis direction at the upper boundary is limited by the span of the measurements and asymptotes to 0 05 0 1 while at the lower boundary s remains at 0 1 even after the dissipation of the wake fig 20f these values are in agreement with the free flow generated by the test flume given that the distribution of u y in the z direction is not completely equal to 0 second the rotational effect was greater in the z direction than in the y direction as a result of the transversal space limitation and velocity reduction by the pile under different flows the upper peak trends were equivalent suggesting that the pile exerted a large influence in the near wake region in contrast the lower peak of the rotation distribution increased for high blockage case 1 fig 20b and the high upper to lower bypass region fig 20d in accordance with the distribution of rotation in the x y plane 4 conclusion the specific objective of this study was to determine the effects of bypass flow on the formation of wakes experiments under five water conditions were performed using a model turbine and measurements were taken of the flow field wake velocity and turbine performance the wake deficit close to the turbine was largely influenced by the pile leading to an upward wake drift and the maximum trend decreased exponentially with the downstream distance supporting the results of previous studies the shear layer structure in the xy plane was symmetrical whereas in the xz plane the radius and thickness of the wake shear layer were compressed or had an elliptical form mirroring other studies the turbulence intensity was trimodal and bimodal in the xy plane and followed an s function in the xz plane with recovery reached at 12d the peaks in the distributions tended to appear near the blade tips owing to the rapid augmentation of the axial induction factor and initially near the origin by virtue of its affinity with the free stream conditions because of the pile and the proximity of the turbine to the fluctuating surface the functions were asymmetrical in the transverse direction and recovery was attained faster for the lower part than for the upper part the rotational wake velocity followed an asymmetrical s shaped curve because of the pile peaked at the blade tips and was observed up to 4d where pressure recovered to ambient conditions prominent differences were observed among the different environments the research suggested that a higher blockage with symmetrical bypass regions led to less wake recovery and shear thickness expansion and thus could counterbalance the high power efficiencies further work on turbine wake interaction is recommended to develop a fuller picture of tidal farm efficiency a similar but lower effect was obtained with a larger upper region compared to the lower bypass region the bed effects were negligible these results confirmed that a wake length reduction is associated with more uniform exposure to the turbulence intensity particularly around the swept region resulting in less wake rotation improved mixing and a larger expansion rate for the shear layer structure in further research the use of this wake data could be a means for establishing the spacing of turbine arrays to provide the maximum power output credit authorship contribution

20962,ships navigating in ice inevitably encounter different ice conditions dynamic ice typically presents severe conditions when it is moving perpendicular towards the parallel midship section which can lead to ships getting stuck in ice this can cause delays for ships or even damage to the ship hull however there currently is no model to assess ship operability in this dynamic ice this paper aims to develop a method to assess operability of ships in dynamic ice conditions which can be used for ship routing to avoid ship stuck the method is especially useful for emergency response planning purposes e g for marine pollution preparedness and response planning where an understanding of the operability of response vessels in dynamic ice conditions currently is lacking first a transit model is introduced for both independent navigation and escort operations considering the additional ice resistance by dynamic ice then a ship operability index is proposed based on the modelling of ship s performance case studies of independent navigation and escort operations in realistic dynamic ice conditions are investigated to compare with the simulated results reasonable agreement is obtained indicating that the proposed method can be used for ship operability assessment in dynamic ice keywords ship operability dynamic ice ice navigation independent navigation icebreaker escort operation ais data 1 introduction shipping in ice is a common activity in the northern baltic sea during wintertime more recently shipping in the arctic regions has also received increased attentions as the projected reductions in sea ice cover due to climate change have led to an interest by shipping companies to utilize arctic routes to reduce transit time although associated uncertainties remain high beveridge et al 2016 however the potential of increased activities in ice expose ships to more complex and hazardous situations while the provision of ice services such as ice forecasts is continuously developing more specific knowledge of the ship operability for corresponding ice and environmental conditions can be beneficial for making decisions to reduce relevant risks for ships navigating in ice for instance valdez banda et al 2016 found that further enhanced e navigation support e g through improved ship operability information can reduced the operational risks of winter navigation in a case study for the gulf of finland for some emergency response situations e g in marine pollution preparedness and response planning the operability information of ships is of great importance for decision making concerning the effectiveness of the spill response system this has been identified as a critical factor e g in the oil spill response system in the northern baltic sea whereas uncertainty about this operability currently is relatively high lu et al 2019 2020 in addition operability information in various ice conditions is important for route planning purposes as this is essential to determine efficient and safe routes the current route planning models in ice e g kotovirta et al 2009 choi et al 2015 montewka et al 2019 lehtola et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 however do not include specific features of ships in dynamic ice usually thick level ice ridged ice and dynamic ice moving perpendicular towards the parallel midship section are considered as severe ice conditions for ships compared to level ice ridged ice and dynamic ice have more factors influencing ship performance riska et al 1995 kuuliala et al 2017 e g ridge size and density for ridged ice and ice drift speed for dynamic ice ships sailing in these conditions are subject to a relatively more hazardous situation e g getting stuck in ice due to these additional uncertain factors however ships besetting in thick level ice or ridged ice have the possibility to reverse and then ram into ice multiple times to break their ways which results in a relatively low risk of getting stuck in contrast dynamic ice gives little chance for a ship to continue its movement as the broken channel behind the ship will close and the dynamic ice on the ship side will pose additional resistance this phenomenon not only affects independent navigation but also represents challenges to escort or convoy operations i e ships following the icebreakers at a certain distance rosenblad 2007 when vessels get stuck in dynamic ice this causes delays for the ship voyage or mission and can cause damage to the ship hull hänninen 2004 therefore dynamic ice is generally regarded as the most challenging operational condition it is also referred as compressive ice in other research e g riska et al 1995 kaups 2011 külaots et al 2013 and li et al 2019 as the moving ice will cause compression in the ice field when it hits an obstacle significant research has been dedicated to ship performance in dynamic ice this can be categorized into two main approaches the first category takes a data driven approach kubat et al 2012 2016 analyzed the correlation between occurrences of ship besetting with ice forecast data while montewka et al 2015 focused on establishing a probabilistic model based on ship and environmental data to predict ship performance in dynamic ice similä and lensu 2018 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 used various data to estimate ship speed in varying ice conditions but lack a specific focus on dynamic ice the second category is based on engineering modelling riska et al 1995 proposed a modelling framework for ships in dynamic ice and proposed ice compression index to account the contact between dynamic ice and midship sections kaups 2011 and külaots et al 2013 modelled the ship resistance in dynamic ice notwithstanding the significance of existing work the current approaches still have significant limitations for estimating a ship s operability in dynamic ice the data driven approach requires sufficient and high resolution data in order to obtain an applicable prediction for a specified ship for example the investigation by kubat et al 2012 2016 only targeted one ship therefore there is considerable uncertainty about the performance of another vessel even in the same conditions the probabilistic model by montewka et al 2015 has the advantage of making a high level abstraction of the complex physical processes but the modelling is also limited to a certain ship type due to limitations of the model training data the engineering models can predict the performance of any specified ship but have to tackle the complex dynamic ice ship interaction process so far engineering models mainly focused on calculating ship resistance for a ship the proposed formula based on experiments by riska et al 1995 present a plausible method to model ship performance in dynamic ice but has not yet been validated the resistance calculation scheme for a vessel in compressive ice by kaups 2011 and külaots et al 2013 has the limitation of static status assumptions i e the resistance is calculated only for a steady speed when the ship speed varies with time during a transit the calculation scheme may not applicable therefore a dynamic transit model is needed for estimating a ship s operability in dynamic ice in addition as mentioned earlier dynamic ice also poses challenges to escort operation and there is no specific model yet focusing on estimating ship performance for escort operation in dynamic ice goerlandt et al 2017 made a data analysis of ship escort and convoy operations for different ice conditions but do not focus on the conditions of getting stuck in dynamic ice zhang et al 2018 2019 proposed models for the vessel dynamics in escort and convoy operations but not considering dynamic ice condition therefore there is a need for including escort operation modelling in dynamic ice condition considering the above this paper aims to establish a way to assess ship operability in hazardous dynamic ice conditions so that preparatory operability information for a specified ship can be estimated in terms of forecasted environmental conditions first this paper proposes transit models for both independent navigation and escort operation in dynamic ice then based on the transit models an operability index is proposed for assessing ship operability in dynamic ice this index indicates directly whether the condition is favorable risky or unfavorable for a specified ship this index is intended to be used for visualizing the operability of vessels for ship routing purposes or for maritime emergency response planning in ice conditions such as marine pollution preparedness and response planning in this work dynamic ice here is restricted to a level ice field or a very large level ice floe finally case studies of independent and escort navigation in a realistic dynamic ice conditions are investigated and compared with the simulated results and proposed operability index as a validation of the proposed method the following section 2 introduces the method proposed in this paper section 3 shows details of the case studies as well as corresponding validation and sensitivity analysis results in section 4 a discussion is presented and section 5 concludes 2 proposed method this section is comprised of two parts the first part focuses on the modelling method of ship transit in dynamic ice for independent navigation and escort operations respectively the method starts from independent navigation modelling in dynamic ice based on the simplified framework fig 1 by riska et al 1995 hence ship resistance in dynamic ice is decoupled into level ice breaking induced resistance and additional dynamic ice contact resistance bases on which a dynamic transit model is established further this model for independent navigation is extended to escort operations the second part describes the proposed ship operability index in dynamic ice based on the developed transit models for independent navigation and escort operations which enables a quick assessment of a specified ship s operability in relevant ice conditions the intention of the ship operability index is that it can be used as an information layer in navigational charts for routing purposes or as an information layer in oil spill response information systems 2 1 modelling ship transit in dynamic ice 2 1 1 independent navigation independent navigation in dynamic ice means that a ship sails by itself in level ice or a large ice floe which drifts under the influence of wind and current in the dynamic ice condition turning of the ship may lead to loss of ship speed and lead to a higher risk of getting stuck in this paper ship transit is simplified so that the ship is travelling in a straight course with the maximum power setting similar as the transit model in ridged ice kuuliala et al 2017 the equation of motion for a rigid ship is expressed as in eq 1 m is the ship mass a j is acceleration t n j is the total net thrust concerning the difference between propeller thrust and open water resistance r l j is total resistance from level ice and r a j is the additional dynamic ice resistance at time step j 1 m a j t n j r l j r a j the acceleration can be calculated when obtaining the ship resistance and net thrust and is further used to estimate the ship position and velocity by following newmark s numerical integration method newmark 1959 as in eqs 2 and 3 this approach is also adopted by kuuliala et al 2017 in the transit modelling for ships in ridged ice v j and x j are speed and position at time step j dt is the length of time step 2 v j v j 1 1 2 a j 1 a j d t 3 x j x j 1 v j 1 d t 1 3 a j 1 1 6 a j d t 2 the resistance and net thrust are dependent on the location and speed therefore the acceleration speed and location of a time step are interdependent iterations are conducted with each time step to solve the transit eqs 2 and 3 in the current model implementation minimum ten iterations are set or fewer if the convergence limit of 1e 3 is achieved between two consequent accelerations in the iterations as is done in kuuliala et al 2017 where a transit model for a ship in ridged ice is created to solve eq 1 the level ice resistance additional dynamic ice resistance and net thrust are needed therefore the following focuses on calculating those three components the resistance encountered by a ship sailing in dynamic ice is divided into resistance from breaking through the level ice sheet and additional resistance from ice ship interaction in the parallel midship section as shown in fig 1 therefore the two resistance components need to be modelled separately according to kämäräinen 1993 and li et al 2018 the method for level ice by lindqvist 1989 gives a good estimation of level ice resistance therefore it is applied here for accounting for the level ice resistance the total level ice resistance r l is composed of three parts namely breaking r b crushing r c and submersion r s which are expressed as below 4 r l r b r c 1 1 4 v g h i r s 1 9 4 v g l 5 r b 0 003 σ f b h i 3 2 t a n ψ μ c o s φ s i n α c o s ψ 1 1 c o s ψ 6 r c 0 5 σ f h i 2 t a n φ μ c o s φ c o s ψ 1 μ s i n φ c o s ψ 7 r s ρ δ g h i t b t b 2 t μ 0 7 l t t a n φ b 4 t a n α t c o s φ c o s ψ 1 s i n φ 2 1 t a n α 2 where v is ship speed l b t are ship length breadth and draught α φ ψ are ship open water angle stem angle and flare angle and ψ arctan t a n φ s i n α μ is the friction coefficient between ship and ice h i is ice thickness σ f is ice flexure strength g is gravity acceleration and ρ δ is the density difference between ice and water all variables and parameters are in si units the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice is considered here as additional friction resistance to the ship caused by the horizontal ice forces onto the midship section when the ship maintains its movement in ice the horizontal ice force is dominated by the interaction between the ice and vertical midship hull where crushing happens although bending failure may also occur it is considered as a more marginal phenomenon li et al 2019 kujala and arughadhoss 2012 studied crushing pressures from model scale laboratory and full scale measurements and suggested following pressure area relation 8 p 0 42 a 0 52 where p is the pressure in mpa and a is the contact area in si unit therefore the additional friction resistance to the ship is expressed as 9 r a 2 μ p h i l e where r a is the additional resistance μ is the friction coefficient between ship and ice p represents crushing pressure in equation 8 h i l e together stands for the contact area h i denotes ice thickness and l e means effective contact length all in si units in order to calculate the additional resistance the problem can then be reformulated to identify the effective contact length between the parallel midship section and dynamic ice as shown in fig 1 it is considered that the cusp broken at the bow shoulder determines the distance between the ice edge and ship wang 2001 and su et al 2010 applied the following equations to calculate the breaking radius 10 r c l l c 1 c v v 11 l c e h i 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ w g 4 where r is the breaking radius i e the distance from ice edge to ship as in fig 1 c l and c v is the empirical coefficients v is the ship speed l c is the characteristic length e is the elastic modulus of ice ν is poisson s ratio h i is ice thickness ρ w is the density of water and g is gravity acceleration they are in si units the effective contact length l e is regarded as the contact length between the ice edge and the parallel midship section considering that the ice edge is moving linearly with time as illustrated in fig 1 therefore the contact length can be determined in each time step based on the ship speed and ice drift speed so that the additional dynamic ice resistance can be obtained for the motion equation eq 1 as well the solution of the motion equation of the ship also requires the net thrust the net thrust concerns the difference between propeller thrust and open water resistance and hence represents the thrust available to overcome additional resistance from ice according to riska et al 1997 the net thrust can be estimated by 12 t n t b 1 1 3 v v o w 2 3 v v o w 2 13 t b k e p d d p 2 3 where t n is the net thrust v is the ship speed v o w is designed ship open water speed d p is the propeller diameter they are in si units t b is the bollard pull in kn p d is power in kw k e is a coefficient accounting propeller characteristics the values are listed in table 1 based on the above formulations the transit modelling for independent navigation in dynamic ice is fully specified and the equation of motion eq 1 can be solved each time when the ship updates its location in the modelling procedure the corresponding ice thickness and drift speed information can be derived from the relevant or preset ice dataset furthermore the corresponding ship speed which will be used in the ship operability index see details in section 2 2 can be calculated 2 1 2 escort escort operation means that an icebreaker breaks through the dynamic ice field and that a conventional ship follows the icebreaker at a certain distance rosenblad 2007 the main principle for the numerical transit simulation for this operation is the same as the independent navigation elaborated in section 2 1 1 however this situation involves two ships the leading ship operates the same as in independent navigation the following ship however may encounter different ice situations under the influence of the leading ship the dynamic ice edge is affected by the leading ship as shown in fig 2 and the condition of the ice edge after the leading ship influences the assisted ship generally two situations can be distinguished s1 and s2 as shown in fig 2 s1 is the situation that the assisted ship navigates in channel ice broken by the leading ship and the ice edge reaches the assisted vessel at a position abaft the bow shoulder or that the ice edge does not reach the ship side s2 is the situation that the channel broken by the leading ship is closing and has become narrower than the width of assisted ship so that the assisted ship needs to break ice to go forward in s1 the total resistance is due to two parts channel ice resistance and additional resistance from dynamic ice the estimation of the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice can be calculated using eqs 8 and 9 when the effective contact length is determined for each time step if there is no effective contact the additional dynamic resistance is zero the channel ice resistance estimation uses formulas proposed by riska et al 1997 i e 14 r c h 1

water gravity acceleration and froude number except the ones mentioned the other parameters and variables are in si units more details can be found in riska et al 1997 in s2 the assisted ship needs to break some ice which has drifted in front of the ship and meanwhile overcome some channel ice resistance at the same time the ice breaking at its bow shoulder also creates a new ice edge which may act on its parallel midship section as in the independent navigation therefore the total resistance is also composed of two parts the level channel ice resistance and additional resistance from dynamic ice there is no formula to calculate this level channel ice resistance situation yet therefore this situation is considered as a combination of channel ice and level ice calculated by combining the two resistances based on their proportions in front of the ship 16 r l c r l 2 d l b r c h 1 2 d l b where r l c is the level channel ice resistance for s2 r c h and r l are channel ice resistance eq 14 and level ice resistance eq 4 respectively d l is the distance the ice edge crosses from the ship sideline to the center line of the ship see in fig 2 b is ship breadth they are in si unit if the channel is totally closed it is equivalent to the situation that the ship is navigating in level ice the calculation of additional resistance from dynamic ice for assisted ship in s2 follows the same principle as independent navigation described in section 2 1 1 and applies equations 5 8 the resistances for assisted ship in escort operation can be calculated as mentioned above in addition the modelling of the net thrust and the motion equation for escort operation remains the same as in the independent navigation situation elaborated in section 2 1 1 2 2 ship operability index in dynamic ice the ship transit modelling in dynamic ice enables an estimation of ship performance under given conditions however in order to present the information concerning the risk of getting beset in dynamic sea ice an easier manner comprehensive but simplified information of the ship s navigational capability is required for various conditions for example if information about the limiting ice conditions including ice thickness and ice drift speed is known for an independently navigating oil spill response vessel the decision whether to commence the ship s mission through that ice environment can be made based on the forecasted environment and ice conditions if the vessel cannot safely operate independently information about whether having the vessel assisted by an icebreaker in the prevailing ice conditions can be useful similarly potentially hazardous areas can be avoided in route planning or in a routing algorithm therefore this section focuses on developing this comprehensive and practically useful information for both independent and escort navigations this is achieved by defining and operationalizing a ship operability index which is composed of two parts a base index defining a basic operational category i e favorable risky or unfavorable and a degree index reflecting the operational degree of severity within each category more details are given in the following section 2 2 1 ship operability index for independent navigation for ships navigating independently the relevant variables are ship related parameters and environmental related conditions the ship related parameters are relatively constant if a ship and its navigation status are decided thus the ship operability estimation is primarily based on environmental conditions specifically ice thickness and ice drift speed in general the operability can be categorized as favorable risky and unfavorable here favorable is defined so that ship speed at the end of a defined simulation period is over 2 kn risky is defined here as the condition that the ship speed drops to the interval between 0 and 2 kn whereas unfavorable means that the ship is stopped by the ice i e that it gets stuck in the dynamic ice a base operability index is allocated to each operability category i e 17 o p b 0 v 2 1 0 v 2 2 v 0 where o p b is base operability index and v is ship speed in kn the base operability index makes it possible to digitize the three operability categories however it lacks the ability to show the degree of operability within each category for a more accurate representation of the operability e g reflecting the difference between 1 1 and 1 9 in risky category therefore a degree index is introduced to show how severe it is inside each category based on the degree of speed drop 18 o p d k v k v m i n k v m a x k v m i n where o p d is the degree index k v is the speed drop rate based on the initial and final speed for the defined simulation period t k v v t v 0 t k v m i n and k v m a x are the minimum and maximum speed drop rate in corresponding category o p d is in the range of 0 1 o p b determines the basic category based on the final ship speed and o p d reflects the severity degree within each category by adding degree index o p d to the base index o p b the defined ship operability index op is formulated as expressed in formula 19 more specifically o p b can be regarded as the integer part of op and o p d can be regarded as decimal part of op 19 o p o p b o p d 0 1 f a v o r a b l e 1 2 r i s k y 2 3 u n f a v o r a b l e the op index is derived based on the ship speed at the end of the transit simulation in dynamic ice here the simulation time is set as 10 min i e it is considered that the dynamic ice the ship sails in within 10 min is always complete level ice condition which is a quite strict condition because in practice the ice condition varies a lot there will not be always level ice and the ice will be fractured or deformed when a ship is sailing inside one op index can be obtained for each pair of ice thickness and ice drift speed h i v i where h i influences both level ice resistance and additional added resistance from dynamic ice through its effect in both resistance equations and v i influences the additional added resistance component through its effect in the effective contact length between the parallel midship section and dynamic ice in each time step thus the overall matrix of op index for a ship can be derived by simulating various combinations of h i v i the overall operability for a certain ship in various ice conditions can then be presented as in fig 3 fig 3 as represented in this section is only a schematic diagram not reflecting realistic information for op map in terms of h i v i when the practical ice condition is known a quick assessment of the ship s operability in that condition can be made based on a real obtained operability map like fig 3 2 2 2 ship operability index for escort operations escort is different from independent navigation because it relates to not only the ice condition but also the operations between the two ships therefore in addition to the ice thickness and drift speed the operability is affected by the escort distance between the two ships and the escort speed based on practical understandings and information from the literature zhang et al 2017 2018 2019 it is assumed that the escort operation follows a principle i e the leading ship and assisted ship try to maintain a steady escort distance and a steady escort speed if the leading ship and assisted ship cannot maintain the preset escort speed in a certain ice condition the assisted ship s real speed will be followed as the escort speed detailed implementation features of the proposed algorithm include 1 the leading ship closely follows the assisted ship s speed 2 when the assisted ship s speed is less than two knots the leading ship increases its speed to avoid getting itself stuck 3 when the leading ship cannot maintain its speed the assisted ship will try to slow down as well to avoid collision 4 when the assisted ship cannot fully stop and reaches the leading ship it is considered as a potential collision which is categorized as unfavorable condition based on these the operability of the ships can be simulated over a set of ice condition and operation condition h i v i d v e s c o r t following the same procedure in section 2 2 1 a similar mapping as in fig 3 for both ships can be obtained however over the four variables h i v i d v e s c o r t the operability of the assisted ship is in particular focus to assess the operability of the escort operation 3 method validation case studies comparing the proposed method with observations this section focuses on case studies of independent navigation and escort operation in real dynamic ice providing a validation of the capability of the ships in real dynamic ice conditions with the ship operability as simulated by the method described in section 2 empirical cases of a ship which has gotten stuck in dynamic ice are valuable information sources to study the ship operability due to the complexity of real situations there are various reasons for a ship to stop therefore the only plausible way to confirm a ship getting stuck in a dynamic ice field is to rely on observations in the corresponding context the cases here are determined based on the safewin project cruise report vedenpää 2011 it describes events where the research vessel got stuck in severe dynamic ice scenarios and reported other nearby vessels becoming beset in ice according to the reported time and location the scene is recreated using data from the automatic identification system ais in this region for the reported vessel and other nearby vessels as well as relevant ice information three ships are selected which represent validation scenarios for the proposed model for operability of independent navigation and escort in dynamic ice conditions reconstructing case studies of ships in the dynamic ice requires different detailed information and data sources as the process of a vessel becoming stuck in ice occurs over a relatively short time period as found also e g in montewka et al 2015 hence the resolution of key data sources should be sufficiently high especially the ship speed the general data related to the case study scenarios are described in section 3 1 whereas the validation results and sensitivity analysis are shown in section 3 2 3 1 data and information sources the case study scenarios concern two operation modes and three ships as shown in table 2 in independent navigation the ice breaking research vessel aranda became beset in ice at around 22 00 another icebreaker nordica is selected for comparison with aranda in the same period in escort operation nordica is the leading ship while envik is the assisted vessel the relevant data and information consist of three parts ship data environmental data and operational data in the following sections these are described in turn 3 1 1 ship data ship data refers to the ship related parameters required for estimating the vessel performance according to section 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 such as vessel dimensions power etc aranda is a finish research vessel with ice breaking capability nordica is a finnish icebreaker designed for assisting merchant vessels in winter operations in the northern baltic sea envik is a merchant vessel with ice navigation capability their main parameters are listed in table 3 3 1 2 environmental data environmental data represents the external conditions in which the ship navigates for the current purposes this primarily includes the ice condition data as well as wind data to provide more detailed contextual information hindcast data obtained using the helmi ice model haapala et al 2005 mårtensson et al 2012 are used as a basis for describing the sea ice conditions similarly as in montewka et al 2015 and goerlandt et al 2017 the ice model is discretized in a curvilinear coordinate c grid and the grid has 415 nodes from west to east and 556 nodes from south to north it covers an area from coordinates 56 74 n 16 72 e to coordinates 65 99 n 30 48 e with an increment of 1 30 eastwards and 1 60 northwards i e approximately 1 nm in both directions at 60 n goerlandt et al 2017 the helmi forecasting model takes thermodynamic and dynamic forcing from the weather prediction model hirlam and has been validated against observed ice situations with good agreement lehtiranta et al 2012 the data concerning ice thickness ice type and ice concentration are used for ice information here the general ice thickness map is shown in fig 4 the ice type in the region where the three ships operated is level ice according to helmi data the ice thickness is extracted based on the routes of the ships as identified using data from the automatic identification system in addition the ice drift condition is vital as one main external factor the ice drift speed recorded from time to time in the research cruise vedenpää 2011 is used as the local ice drift speed matters most however it only reflects the situation at each recorded time and hence is not available in a continuous way as is required for the calculation procedures according to uotila 2001 ice drift speed is correlated with wind forcing therefore in order to have a better understanding of the ice drift speed the wind data is used as reference the wind data is in 10 min interval derived from a nearest observation station maalahti strömmingsbådan 62 98 n 20 74 e 3 1 3 operational data operational data means the data related to the ships navigation here it mainly concerns ship speed for independent navigation but also includes the distance between the two ships in escort operation the historical navigational data record from ships is not available therefore ais data is used alternatively for deriving the operational data ais is an information exchange platform between vessels and shore organizations and contains static and dynamic data the dynamic data gives time dependent data about the location speed course and navigational status of vessels etc goerlandt et al 2017 as mentioned in the beginning of section 3 the scenes are recreated by using the ais data in this region to confirm the reported ships stuck then a detail investigation of the shorter period when ships got stuck is conducted in this investigation the resolution of the data is highly important ais data is recorded with a varying interval from seconds to minutes depending on the speed of the vessel and operational status therefore this sets the limit of the ais data the data interval for the scenarios in this paper are roughly in 10 s intervals which is close to best resolution in ais and considered sufficient for a detailed investigation of ship operations in escort operations the distance between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is also important information the distance is calculated based on the coordinates data of the two ships which are interpolated for the same timestamp first in addition the calculated distance is the distance of the locations of the ais transponders in order to obtain the real distance between the two ships the location of ais transponders are assumed in the bridge area the distance to ship bow for assisted ship and the distance to ship stern for leading ship are deduced from the calculated distance from coordinates as in goerlandt et al 2017 furthermore the simulation considers only 2d waterline condition thus the distance in the simulation requires the calculated real distance to add stern length of the leading ship and bow length of the assisted ship 3 2 case study results and sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 case study results comparing the proposed method with observations the method in section 2 is applied to the three ships involved in the case studies in table 2 the same initial ship speed as in the real scenarios is set for the simulation of each ship for the independent navigation the ship operability of aranda scenario 1 simulated according to method described in section 2 1 1 and 2 2 1 is shown in fig 5 left over serials of h i v i conditions the observed scenario of aranda becoming beset is indicated by a rectangle as well in fig 5 left the reported ice drift speed is around 0 3 0 4 kn vedenpää 2011 and the ice thickness is 25 cm as shown by the rectangle in fig 5 left it is seen that the rectangle in fig 5 left extends from the boundary of favorable to the boundary of unfavorable with the largest part situated in the risky operability category therefore the simulated operability estimation corresponds well with the observed ship operability in this case fig 5 right shows the speed drop when aranda begins to get stuck because the recorded ice drift speed is in the range of 0 3 0 4 kn the limit values 0 3 and 0 4 are used in the simulation to compare with the observed ais data the simulation using 0 4 kn ice drift speed is quite close to the trend from ais especially in the end period the change of the speed in the middle period from ais data may reflect slight variation of the ice condition the simulation using 0 3 kn ice drift speed indicates that aranda is still able to navigate if ice drifts at this speed when tracking back to wind records it is found that wind speed reaches the maximum of 15 6 m s at 22 00 i e the time at which aranda became stuck in ice it is the daily maximum wind speed and is 1 m s higher than the speed at 21 50 therefore the ice drift speed is more likely to be close to 0 4 kn thus causing aranda to become stuck it also explains why aranda can still sail before 22 00 therefore ship operability of aranda is overall well estimated by the proposed method another simulation for icebreaker nordica is conducted as it is also in this region while no reports were made of its getting beset in ice therefore the operability simulation of this vessel can contribute to establish validity of the proposed method for a different ship the same ice condition as for aranda is applied to nordica and its operational status i e its initial speed is derived to reconstruct the ship condition at the same time when aranda gets stuck fig 6 left shows that in general nordica operates in favorable ice conditions for its ice going capability so that there are no issues with its operability in the prevalent compressive ice conditions fig 6 right demonstrates the speed trends from simulations and the ais records it is seen that the observed ship speed from ais matches the simulation of the two different ice drift speeds relatively well from the above presented case studies for independent navigation the comparison suggests that the method can adequately estimate the ship operability on a general level and the changes of the ship speed on a detailed level the method furthermore appears to be adequately sensitive to the ice going capability of different ships in the selected escort operation the simulation escort distance at the time for envik getting stuck is calculated as 430 m following steps described in section 3 1 3 the speed of envik is also derived from ais data as escort speed the operability of the assisted vessel is of concern in escort operation in fig 7 the ship operability index of envik is plotted over serials of h i v i conditions which is shown together with the observation of the reported case of the vessel becoming stuck in ice as there is no direct ice drift speed reported in that time period the ice speed is estimated based on the wind speed based on uotila 2001 and montewka et al 2015 it is assumed that the ice speed is linearly affected by the wind hence the ratio of the wind speed reported for scenario 3 and scenario 1 is used as a factor to multiply the ice speed in aranda case this results in an ice drift speed of 0 23 0 29 kn during this period this ice drift speed range is shown by the rectangle in fig 7 left and it covers the risky and unfavorable parts in the simulated operability map in fig 7 left it should be noted that the interval of both ice thickness h i and ice drift speed v i for the ship operability index simulation is 0 05 therefore the operability index result between e g 0 1 m s and 0 15 m s ice drift speed at 0 25 m ice thickness is interpolated if the boundary condition of ice drift speed 0 23 kn and 0 29 kn is used the operability result is unfavorable as can be judged from simulated speeds in fig 7 right this difference is remained here instead of improving the resolution of intervals of parameters for fig 7 left is to highlight the importance of selection of the interval when conducting the ship operability index simulation and mapping fig 7 right shows the speed drop of both simulations and observed ais data the speed trend from the observed case is generally situated between the two bounding simulation scenarios based on the estimated ice speed however it is apparent that envik encountered some varying ice conditions e g some ice floes with open water involved among them in this scenario as it managed to keep the speed at around 4 kn for a period of time before getting stuck nevertheless its speed continued to drop at a similar rate soon and it got stuck this varying ice condition cannot be reflected in the simulation result as the simulation considers the ship encounters level ice continuously in the simulation period 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis effects of operational variables on ship operability index sensitivity analysis is used to ascertain how a given model output depends upon the input parameters and check the robustness and reliability of its analysis which contributes to the validation of a proposed model saltelli et al 2009 the operability assessment of the three ships in various environmental conditions is shown in the operability maps in figs 5 7 as an initial validation of the proposed method these results are based on the operational conditions derived from observed case studies the effects of the operational variables i e ship initial speed v o for independent navigation and escort distance and speed d v e s c o r t for escort operation on the ship operability in dynamic ice are not studied yet therefore this section focuses on the sensitivity analysis of operational variables in the proposed method as a further validation in independent navigation the main operational variable is initial speed fig 8 shows the ship operability index map of aranda for different initial ship speeds 2 5 5 7 5 10 kn in general a higher initial speed does not extend the ship operability to higher maximum ice thicknesses but it does extend the operability to higher ice drift speeds this can be explained by considering that a higher ship speed will enable the ship to avoid contact between its parallel midship and the dynamic ice on the sides in addition a trend can be observed in fig 8 that although the favorable area increases with higher ship speeds there is a more outspoken speed loss i e the color is more diverse for favorable category this is consistent with the fact that a higher initial speed leads to a proportionally larger speed loss compared to lower initial speeds another point is that the change in operability is not always linear for example when the initial ship speed is 5 kn the operability at 0 3 m ice thickness is better than at 0 2 m this can be explained that the ice cusp radius induced by that ship speed and ice thickness is more favorable for the ship to escape the contact from the dynamic ice fig 9 shows a similar sensitivity analysis for the effects of the initial ship speed for nordica the observed effects are relatively smaller than for the aranda cases shown in fig 8 therefore the initial ship speed has a limited effect on ship operability for more powerful icebreakers this can be explained by the fact that powerful icebreakers can already handle more severe ice conditions even at relatively low ship speeds with adequate power for escort operations the operational variables include the escort distance and escort speed the escort distance and speed are taken here as the initial distance between the vessels and initial speed of the assisted ship as described in section 2 2 2 the ships will try to maintain both distance and speed during escort the principles in section 2 2 2 are followed if the ships are not able to continue in the initial states fig 10 shows the sensitivity analysis results for the effects of the escort speed when the escort distance is 200 m a low escort speed 2 5 kn mostly leads to risky and unfavorable operability with increasing escort speeds e g 5 kn the region of favorable ship operability of envik extends to a large ice thickness domain by following nordica however the limiting ice drift speed is quite low i e envik can still relatively easily get stuck in windy conditions at an ice thickness of around 0 35m there is an unfavorable condition this seems an unfavorable ratio between the ship speed and ice cusp radius induced by that ship speed and ice thickness where the assisted ship is caught by the ice edge created by the leading ship with a further increased escort speed 7 5 kn the ship operability extends also to wider ice drift speed limits when the escort speed is high 10 kn the favorable operation condition vanishes in the large ice thickness region 0 8 1 0 m this unfavorable operability is caused by the identified potential collision in the simulation as defined in section 2 2 2 in reality collision is harder to simulate as there are many factors involved including human actions zhang et al 2017 2019 however it is not focus of this paper here the result can be taken to indicate that very thick ice can cause a large speed drop of the leading icebreaker which is equivalent to the situation that the leading ship suddenly stops as described by zhang et al 2018 hence a too high escort speed can more easily lead to a collision and is not a favorable choice under such ice conditions fig 11 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for the effects of escort distance on the ship operability when the escort distance is relatively small 100 m the favorable operability category for envik is quite wide in ice thickness direction this means that thick ice does not represent a significant problem as envik can follow nordica quite well when nordica breaks the way ahead when escort distance increases the favorable operability region decreases because the ice starts to drift into the channel after the leading ship before the assisted ship which causes operability problems for the assisted ship overall both sensitivity analysis on escort speed and distance shown in figs 10 11 indicate reasonable trends as in practice in the escort operation 4 discussion 4 1 ship transit modelling although the case studies in section 3 2 1 show a reasonable agreement between simulation and real cases from both general operability viewpoint and from the more detailed viewpoint of the speed profile it is noted that the proposed model has several simplifying assumptions first this paper conducts ship transit modelling for independent navigation extending the modelling framework by riska et al 1995 by modelling and integrating each resistance component and thrust in the process in the estimation of the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice it is assumed that the additional nominal pressure follows the pressure area relationship of eq 8 as the result of crushing however it is known that not only crushing occurs when the dynamic ice reaches the ship side but that bending failure may also occur li et al 2019 the difference may be expected to be small as bending does not frequently happen in addition without considering the bending phenomenon the method gives a relatively conservative results which allows a safety margin when it is practically used it can be investigated in future work to what extent the bending phenomenon is important in this process as there are few researches on this second the effective ice edge is considered as the edge determined by the cusp radius as in eq 10 and 11 and the effective contact length is detected based on those formulations there are usually small sharp ice edges between cusps see e g su et al 2010 and individual sharp ice pieces can also cause some crushing forces on the ship side before the defined effective ice edge reaches the ship this may lead the additional resistance by the dynamic ice to occur earlier than when one only considers effective ice contact length third cracks are also not considered in the simulation when the ship creates cracks in the surrounding ice field the ice may be more broken than in conditions where only cusps caused by bending failure are considered which leads to less resistance finally the simulation model assumes that the dynamic ice edge moves perpendicular to the ship side linearly with time while the ice movement in realistic conditions may be in oblique direction and much more complicated based on the validation cases and sensitivity analysis of section 3 it is found that the model gives reasonable estimates this suggests that the several above identified simplifying assumptions made in the proposed method compensate one another although the actual complexity of the ice conditions in the dynamic ice are not accurately accounted for the model is further extended to escort operation which is a more complex operation as it involves two ships the ice edge affected by the leading ship will further influence the assisted ship the resistance for a ship breaking through in partial level ice and partial channel ice is simplified by combining a weighted sum of both the resistance for a ship in this mode needs more research as currently there is no study on this situation the ice breaking in partial level ice is still considered the same as in level ice including the formation of cusps in addition escort includes cooperation between two ships the principles in section 2 2 2 are practically reasonable however it should be noted that the assumption that the leading ship will increase its speed to avoid getting itself stuck in ice when the assisted ship s speed is less than two knots may cause some overestimate because the leading ship may still be able to keep the low speed in light ice conditions however the chance for the assisted ship to not able to maintain its speed is also relatively rare in that light ice conditions therefore the influence for this overestimation can be considered minor in addition to this the escort process involves communication and control of powering when ships cannot simply follow the escort speed the way to accelerate and decelerate ships influences the ship behavior and operability 4 2 validity of the ship operability method the new proposed method to assess the ship operability for independent navigation and escort appears to provide reasonable results based on the validation case studies and the presented sensitivity analyses however it is advisable to further validate the model in follow up research e g by investigating more cases through comparing the simulation results with observations good case studies require a combination of various sources of high resolution data so that the scene can be accurately reconstructed ais data can provide the operational data for a forensic case study if there is no access to onboard records of operational ship data however ais data has limitations related to the varying time intervals of data reporting the environmental conditions ais antenna setup and other factors can restrict and affect the reception rate last et al 2015 therefore in many conditions the time interval is in minutes and this kind of time interval is less appropriate for obtaining validation case study this makes post case study a bit more difficult in addition it is also not enough to only have environmental data derived from models real onboard measurement and records for the environmental conditions are vital for further validation studies all these factors imply that identifying and defining validation cases studies is a rather cumbersome process which is one of the reasons why also in this paper there are relatively few validation cases the limited attention to and difficulties of validating models for ship performance in ice even for comparatively easier ice conditions such as continuous operation in level ice has been highlighted as well in the work by li et al 2018 in term of the model application it has already shown good behavior as seen in the sensitivity analysis therefore it can be a useful tool to generate the operability index map for a ship so that the ship route or oil spill response missions can be planned and fulfilled more successfully however it should be noted that there are still uncertainties which need to be kept in mind in real application first there may be still model behavior uncertainties unexposed due to the simplifications and limited validation cases second the uncertainties may also come from the quantification of the environmental conditions there are still limitations to have the real accurate forecast of the environmental variables to give good inputs to the model real ice fields may be comprised of several ice types such as ridged and rafted ice hence further developing the proposed method to account for combinations of dynamic ice with ridged and rafted ice can be a fruitful avenue for future work as well 5 conclusions this paper presents a method to assess the performance of ships in dynamic ice for both independent navigation and escort in dynamic ice in addition a ship operability index is suggested which can be a practically useful tool for ship routing to avoid ship stuck in dynamic ice ship operability index can be used as an overall estimation to visualize the operability of vessels based on ice forecast in different sea areas which is especially useful as an information source for emergency response planning such as marine pollution preparedness and response planning case studies show reasonable agreement between the simulated model results and empirical observations reconstructed from available data sources this together with plausible model behaviors as tested in a series of sensitivity analyses suggests a reasonable model validity nevertheless it is advised to further validate the model with other vessel types and in other ice conditions using various data and information sources

20962,ships navigating in ice inevitably encounter different ice conditions dynamic ice typically presents severe conditions when it is moving perpendicular towards the parallel midship section which can lead to ships getting stuck in ice this can cause delays for ships or even damage to the ship hull however there currently is no model to assess ship operability in this dynamic ice this paper aims to develop a method to assess operability of ships in dynamic ice conditions which can be used for ship routing to avoid ship stuck the method is especially useful for emergency response planning purposes e g for marine pollution preparedness and response planning where an understanding of the operability of response vessels in dynamic ice conditions currently is lacking first a transit model is introduced for both independent navigation and escort operations considering the additional ice resistance by dynamic ice then a ship operability index is proposed based on the modelling of ship s performance case studies of independent navigation and escort operations in realistic dynamic ice conditions are investigated to compare with the simulated results reasonable agreement is obtained indicating that the proposed method can be used for ship operability assessment in dynamic ice keywords ship operability dynamic ice ice navigation independent navigation icebreaker escort operation ais data 1 introduction shipping in ice is a common activity in the northern baltic sea during wintertime more recently shipping in the arctic regions has also received increased attentions as the projected reductions in sea ice cover due to climate change have led to an interest by shipping companies to utilize arctic routes to reduce transit time although associated uncertainties remain high beveridge et al 2016 however the potential of increased activities in ice expose ships to more complex and hazardous situations while the provision of ice services such as ice forecasts is continuously developing more specific knowledge of the ship operability for corresponding ice and environmental conditions can be beneficial for making decisions to reduce relevant risks for ships navigating in ice for instance valdez banda et al 2016 found that further enhanced e navigation support e g through improved ship operability information can reduced the operational risks of winter navigation in a case study for the gulf of finland for some emergency response situations e g in marine pollution preparedness and response planning the operability information of ships is of great importance for decision making concerning the effectiveness of the spill response system this has been identified as a critical factor e g in the oil spill response system in the northern baltic sea whereas uncertainty about this operability currently is relatively high lu et al 2019 2020 in addition operability information in various ice conditions is important for route planning purposes as this is essential to determine efficient and safe routes the current route planning models in ice e g kotovirta et al 2009 choi et al 2015 montewka et al 2019 lehtola et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 however do not include specific features of ships in dynamic ice usually thick level ice ridged ice and dynamic ice moving perpendicular towards the parallel midship section are considered as severe ice conditions for ships compared to level ice ridged ice and dynamic ice have more factors influencing ship performance riska et al 1995 kuuliala et al 2017 e g ridge size and density for ridged ice and ice drift speed for dynamic ice ships sailing in these conditions are subject to a relatively more hazardous situation e g getting stuck in ice due to these additional uncertain factors however ships besetting in thick level ice or ridged ice have the possibility to reverse and then ram into ice multiple times to break their ways which results in a relatively low risk of getting stuck in contrast dynamic ice gives little chance for a ship to continue its movement as the broken channel behind the ship will close and the dynamic ice on the ship side will pose additional resistance this phenomenon not only affects independent navigation but also represents challenges to escort or convoy operations i e ships following the icebreakers at a certain distance rosenblad 2007 when vessels get stuck in dynamic ice this causes delays for the ship voyage or mission and can cause damage to the ship hull hänninen 2004 therefore dynamic ice is generally regarded as the most challenging operational condition it is also referred as compressive ice in other research e g riska et al 1995 kaups 2011 külaots et al 2013 and li et al 2019 as the moving ice will cause compression in the ice field when it hits an obstacle significant research has been dedicated to ship performance in dynamic ice this can be categorized into two main approaches the first category takes a data driven approach kubat et al 2012 2016 analyzed the correlation between occurrences of ship besetting with ice forecast data while montewka et al 2015 focused on establishing a probabilistic model based on ship and environmental data to predict ship performance in dynamic ice similä and lensu 2018 and lensu and goerlandt 2019 used various data to estimate ship speed in varying ice conditions but lack a specific focus on dynamic ice the second category is based on engineering modelling riska et al 1995 proposed a modelling framework for ships in dynamic ice and proposed ice compression index to account the contact between dynamic ice and midship sections kaups 2011 and külaots et al 2013 modelled the ship resistance in dynamic ice notwithstanding the significance of existing work the current approaches still have significant limitations for estimating a ship s operability in dynamic ice the data driven approach requires sufficient and high resolution data in order to obtain an applicable prediction for a specified ship for example the investigation by kubat et al 2012 2016 only targeted one ship therefore there is considerable uncertainty about the performance of another vessel even in the same conditions the probabilistic model by montewka et al 2015 has the advantage of making a high level abstraction of the complex physical processes but the modelling is also limited to a certain ship type due to limitations of the model training data the engineering models can predict the performance of any specified ship but have to tackle the complex dynamic ice ship interaction process so far engineering models mainly focused on calculating ship resistance for a ship the proposed formula based on experiments by riska et al 1995 present a plausible method to model ship performance in dynamic ice but has not yet been validated the resistance calculation scheme for a vessel in compressive ice by kaups 2011 and külaots et al 2013 has the limitation of static status assumptions i e the resistance is calculated only for a steady speed when the ship speed varies with time during a transit the calculation scheme may not applicable therefore a dynamic transit model is needed for estimating a ship s operability in dynamic ice in addition as mentioned earlier dynamic ice also poses challenges to escort operation and there is no specific model yet focusing on estimating ship performance for escort operation in dynamic ice goerlandt et al 2017 made a data analysis of ship escort and convoy operations for different ice conditions but do not focus on the conditions of getting stuck in dynamic ice zhang et al 2018 2019 proposed models for the vessel dynamics in escort and convoy operations but not considering dynamic ice condition therefore there is a need for including escort operation modelling in dynamic ice condition considering the above this paper aims to establish a way to assess ship operability in hazardous dynamic ice conditions so that preparatory operability information for a specified ship can be estimated in terms of forecasted environmental conditions first this paper proposes transit models for both independent navigation and escort operation in dynamic ice then based on the transit models an operability index is proposed for assessing ship operability in dynamic ice this index indicates directly whether the condition is favorable risky or unfavorable for a specified ship this index is intended to be used for visualizing the operability of vessels for ship routing purposes or for maritime emergency response planning in ice conditions such as marine pollution preparedness and response planning in this work dynamic ice here is restricted to a level ice field or a very large level ice floe finally case studies of independent and escort navigation in a realistic dynamic ice conditions are investigated and compared with the simulated results and proposed operability index as a validation of the proposed method the following section 2 introduces the method proposed in this paper section 3 shows details of the case studies as well as corresponding validation and sensitivity analysis results in section 4 a discussion is presented and section 5 concludes 2 proposed method this section is comprised of two parts the first part focuses on the modelling method of ship transit in dynamic ice for independent navigation and escort operations respectively the method starts from independent navigation modelling in dynamic ice based on the simplified framework fig 1 by riska et al 1995 hence ship resistance in dynamic ice is decoupled into level ice breaking induced resistance and additional dynamic ice contact resistance bases on which a dynamic transit model is established further this model for independent navigation is extended to escort operations the second part describes the proposed ship operability index in dynamic ice based on the developed transit models for independent navigation and escort operations which enables a quick assessment of a specified ship s operability in relevant ice conditions the intention of the ship operability index is that it can be used as an information layer in navigational charts for routing purposes or as an information layer in oil spill response information systems 2 1 modelling ship transit in dynamic ice 2 1 1 independent navigation independent navigation in dynamic ice means that a ship sails by itself in level ice or a large ice floe which drifts under the influence of wind and current in the dynamic ice condition turning of the ship may lead to loss of ship speed and lead to a higher risk of getting stuck in this paper ship transit is simplified so that the ship is travelling in a straight course with the maximum power setting similar as the transit model in ridged ice kuuliala et al 2017 the equation of motion for a rigid ship is expressed as in eq 1 m is the ship mass a j is acceleration t n j is the total net thrust concerning the difference between propeller thrust and open water resistance r l j is total resistance from level ice and r a j is the additional dynamic ice resistance at time step j 1 m a j t n j r l j r a j the acceleration can be calculated when obtaining the ship resistance and net thrust and is further used to estimate the ship position and velocity by following newmark s numerical integration method newmark 1959 as in eqs 2 and 3 this approach is also adopted by kuuliala et al 2017 in the transit modelling for ships in ridged ice v j and x j are speed and position at time step j dt is the length of time step 2 v j v j 1 1 2 a j 1 a j d t 3 x j x j 1 v j 1 d t 1 3 a j 1 1 6 a j d t 2 the resistance and net thrust are dependent on the location and speed therefore the acceleration speed and location of a time step are interdependent iterations are conducted with each time step to solve the transit eqs 2 and 3 in the current model implementation minimum ten iterations are set or fewer if the convergence limit of 1e 3 is achieved between two consequent accelerations in the iterations as is done in kuuliala et al 2017 where a transit model for a ship in ridged ice is created to solve eq 1 the level ice resistance additional dynamic ice resistance and net thrust are needed therefore the following focuses on calculating those three components the resistance encountered by a ship sailing in dynamic ice is divided into resistance from breaking through the level ice sheet and additional resistance from ice ship interaction in the parallel midship section as shown in fig 1 therefore the two resistance components need to be modelled separately according to kämäräinen 1993 and li et al 2018 the method for level ice by lindqvist 1989 gives a good estimation of level ice resistance therefore it is applied here for accounting for the level ice resistance the total level ice resistance r l is composed of three parts namely breaking r b crushing r c and submersion r s which are expressed as below 4 r l r b r c 1 1 4 v g h i r s 1 9 4 v g l 5 r b 0 003 σ f b h i 3 2 t a n ψ μ c o s φ s i n α c o s ψ 1 1 c o s ψ 6 r c 0 5 σ f h i 2 t a n φ μ c o

ψ are ship open water angle stem angle and flare angle and ψ arctan t a n φ s i n α μ is the friction coefficient between ship and ice h i is ice thickness σ f is ice flexure strength g is gravity acceleration and ρ δ is the density difference between ice and water all variables and parameters are in si units the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice is considered here as additional friction resistance to the ship caused by the horizontal ice forces onto the midship section when the ship maintains its movement in ice the horizontal ice force is dominated by the interaction between the ice and vertical midship hull where crushing happens although bending failure may also occur it is considered as a more marginal phenomenon li et al 2019 kujala and arughadhoss 2012 studied crushing pressures from model scale laboratory and full scale measurements and suggested following pressure area relation 8 p 0 42 a 0 52 where p is the pressure in mpa and a is the contact area in si unit therefore the additional friction resistance to the ship is expressed as 9 r a 2 μ p h i l e where r a is the additional resistance μ is the friction coefficient between ship and ice p represents crushing pressure in equation 8 h i l e together stands for the contact area h i denotes ice thickness and l e means effective contact length all in si units in order to calculate the additional resistance the problem can then be reformulated to identify the effective contact length between the parallel midship section and dynamic ice as shown in fig 1 it is considered that the cusp broken at the bow shoulder determines the distance between the ice edge and ship wang 2001 and su et al 2010 applied the following equations to calculate the breaking radius 10 r c l l c 1 c v v 11 l c e h i 3 12 1 ν 2 ρ w g 4 where r is the breaking radius i e the distance from ice edge to ship as in fig 1 c l and c v is the empirical coefficients v is the ship speed l c is the characteristic length e is the elastic modulus of ice ν is poisson s ratio h i is ice thickness ρ w is the density of water and g is gravity acceleration they are in si units the effective contact length l e is regarded as the contact length between the ice edge and the parallel midship section considering that the ice edge is moving linearly with time as illustrated in fig 1 therefore the contact length can be determined in each time step based on the ship speed and ice drift speed so that the additional dynamic ice resistance can be obtained for the motion equation eq 1 as well the solution of the motion equation of the ship also requires the net thrust the net thrust concerns the difference between propeller thrust and open water resistance and hence represents the thrust available to overcome additional resistance from ice according to riska et al 1997 the net thrust can be estimated by 12 t n t b 1 1 3 v v o w 2 3 v v o w 2 13 t b k e p d d p 2 3 where t n is the net thrust v is the ship speed v o w is designed ship open water speed d p is the propeller diameter they are in si units t b is the bollard pull in kn p d is power in kw k e is a coefficient accounting propeller characteristics the values are listed in table 1 based on the above formulations the transit modelling for independent navigation in dynamic ice is fully specified and the equation of motion eq 1 can be solved each time when the ship updates its location in the modelling procedure the corresponding ice thickness and drift speed information can be derived from the relevant or preset ice dataset furthermore the corresponding ship speed which will be used in the ship operability index see details in section 2 2 can be calculated 2 1 2 escort escort operation means that an icebreaker breaks through the dynamic ice field and that a conventional ship follows the icebreaker at a certain distance rosenblad 2007 the main principle for the numerical transit simulation for this operation is the same as the independent navigation elaborated in section 2 1 1 however this situation involves two ships the leading ship operates the same as in independent navigation the following ship however may encounter different ice situations under the influence of the leading ship the dynamic ice edge is affected by the leading ship as shown in fig 2 and the condition of the ice edge after the leading ship influences the assisted ship generally two situations can be distinguished s1 and s2 as shown in fig 2 s1 is the situation that the assisted ship navigates in channel ice broken by the leading ship and the ice edge reaches the assisted vessel at a position abaft the bow shoulder or that the ice edge does not reach the ship side s2 is the situation that the channel broken by the leading ship is closing and has become narrower than the width of assisted ship so that the assisted ship needs to break ice to go forward in s1 the total resistance is due to two parts channel ice resistance and additional resistance from dynamic ice the estimation of the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice can be calculated using eqs 8 and 9 when the effective contact length is determined for each time step if there is no effective contact the additional dynamic resistance is zero the channel ice resistance estimation uses formulas proposed by riska et al 1997 i e 14 r c h 1 2 h f 2 c p 1 2 h m 2 h f 2 b 2 h f c o s δ 1 t a n ψ μ c o s φ s i n ψ s i n α c m l p h f 2 ρ δ g l t b 2 3 h m a w f f n 2 15 h f h m b 2 t a n γ t a n γ t a n δ b h m b 4 t a n γ t a n γ t a n δ where r c h is the channel ice resistance h m is the thickness of brash ice in the middle of the channel h f describes the thickness of the brash ice which is displaced by the bow and moved to the side against the parallel midbody δ and γ are the slope angles of the side wall of brash ice taken as 22 6 and 2 riska et al 1997 c p is a constant that depends on the internal friction angle of the ice rubble and c m is a constant dependent on the possion s ratio and friction coefficient of the ice rubble taken as 7500 kg m2 s2 and 45 9 kg m2 s2 li et al 2018 b l l p t are breadth length length of parallel midship section and draught of the ship a w f is the waterline area of the foreship α φ ψ are ship open water angle stem angle and flare angle ρ δ g f n are the different between ice and water gravity acceleration and froude number except the ones mentioned the other parameters and variables are in si units more details can be found in riska et al 1997 in s2 the assisted ship needs to break some ice which has drifted in front of the ship and meanwhile overcome some channel ice resistance at the same time the ice breaking at its bow shoulder also creates a new ice edge which may act on its parallel midship section as in the independent navigation therefore the total resistance is also composed of two parts the level channel ice resistance and additional resistance from dynamic ice there is no formula to calculate this level channel ice resistance situation yet therefore this situation is considered as a combination of channel ice and level ice calculated by combining the two resistances based on their proportions in front of the ship 16 r l c r l 2 d l b r c h 1 2 d l b where r l c is the level channel ice resistance for s2 r c h and r l are channel ice resistance eq 14 and level ice resistance eq 4 respectively d l is the distance the ice edge crosses from the ship sideline to the center line of the ship see in fig 2 b is ship breadth they are in si unit if the channel is totally closed it is equivalent to the situation that the ship is navigating in level ice the calculation of additional resistance from dynamic ice for assisted ship in s2 follows the same principle as independent navigation described in section 2 1 1 and applies equations 5 8 the resistances for assisted ship in escort operation can be calculated as mentioned above in addition the modelling of the net thrust and the motion equation for escort operation remains the same as in the independent navigation situation elaborated in section 2 1 1 2 2 ship operability index in dynamic ice the ship transit modelling in dynamic ice enables an estimation of ship performance under given conditions however in order to present the information concerning the risk of getting beset in dynamic sea ice an easier manner comprehensive but simplified information of the ship s navigational capability is required for various conditions for example if information about the limiting ice conditions including ice thickness and ice drift speed is known for an independently navigating oil spill response vessel the decision whether to commence the ship s mission through that ice environment can be made based on the forecasted environment and ice conditions if the vessel cannot safely operate independently information about whether having the vessel assisted by an icebreaker in the prevailing ice conditions can be useful similarly potentially hazardous areas can be avoided in route planning or in a routing algorithm therefore this section focuses on developing this comprehensive and practically useful information for both independent and escort navigations this is achieved by defining and operationalizing a ship operability index which is composed of two parts a base index defining a basic operational category i e favorable risky or unfavorable and a degree index reflecting the operational degree of severity within each category more details are given in the following section 2 2 1 ship operability index for independent navigation for ships navigating independently the relevant variables are ship related parameters and environmental related conditions the ship related parameters are relatively constant if a ship and its navigation status are decided thus the ship operability estimation is primarily based on environmental conditions specifically ice thickness and ice drift speed in general the operability can be categorized as favorable risky and unfavorable here favorable is defined so that ship speed at the end of a defined simulation period is over 2 kn risky is defined here as the condition that the ship speed drops to the interval between 0 and 2 kn whereas unfavorable means that the ship is stopped by the ice i e that it gets stuck in the dynamic ice a base operability index is allocated to each operability category i e 17 o p b 0 v 2 1 0 v 2 2 v 0 where o p b is base operability index and v is ship speed in kn the base operability index makes it possible to digitize the three operability categories however it lacks the ability to show the degree of operability within each category for a more accurate representation of the operability e g reflecting the difference between 1 1 and 1 9 in risky category therefore a degree index is introduced to show how severe it is inside each category based on the degree of speed drop 18 o p d k v k v m i n k v m a x k v m i n where o p d is the degree index k v is the speed drop rate based on the initial and final speed for the defined simulation period t k v v t v 0 t k v m i n and k v m a x are the minimum and maximum speed drop rate in corresponding category o p d is in the range of 0 1 o p b determines the basic category based on the final ship speed and o p d reflects the severity degree within each category by adding degree index o p d to the base index o p b the defined ship operability index op is formulated as expressed in formula 19 more specifically o p b can be regarded as the integer part of op and o p d can be regarded as decimal part of op 19 o p o p b o p d 0 1 f a v o r a b l e 1 2 r i s k y 2 3 u n f a v o r a b l e the op index is derived based on the ship speed at the end of the transit simulation in dynamic ice here the simulation time is set as 10 min i e it is considered that the dynamic ice the ship sails in within 10 min is always complete level ice condition which is a quite strict condition because in practice the ice condition varies a lot there will not be always level ice and the ice will be fractured or deformed when a ship is sailing inside one op index can be obtained for each pair of ice thickness and ice drift speed h i v i where h i influences both level ice resistance and additional added resistance from dynamic ice through its effect in both resistance equations and v i influences the additional added resistance component through its effect in the effective contact length between the parallel midship section and dynamic ice in each time step thus the overall matrix of op index for a ship can be derived by simulating various combinations of h i v i the overall operability for a certain ship in various ice conditions can then be presented as in fig 3 fig 3 as represented in this section is only a schematic diagram not reflecting realistic information for op map in terms of h i v i when the practical ice condition is known a quick assessment of the ship s operability in that condition can be made based on a real obtained operability map like fig 3 2 2 2 ship operability index for escort operations escort is different from independent navigation because it relates to not only the ice condition but also the operations between the two ships therefore in addition to the ice thickness and drift speed the operability is affected by the escort distance between the two ships and the escort speed based on practical understandings and information from the literature zhang et al 2017 2018 2019 it is assumed that the escort operation follows a principle i e the leading ship and assisted ship try to maintain a steady escort distance and a steady escort speed if the leading ship and assisted ship cannot maintain the preset escort speed in a certain ice condition the assisted ship s real speed will be followed as the escort speed detailed implementation features of the proposed algorithm include 1 the leading ship closely follows the assisted ship s speed 2 when the assisted ship s speed is less than two knots the leading ship increases its speed to avoid getting itself stuck 3 when the leading ship cannot maintain its speed the assisted ship will try to slow down as well to avoid collision 4 when the assisted ship cannot fully stop and reaches the leading ship it is considered as a potential collision which is categorized as unfavorable condition based on these the operability of the ships can be simulated over a set of ice condition and operation condition h i v i d v e s c o r t following the same procedure in section 2 2 1 a similar mapping as in fig 3 for both ships can be obtained however over the four variables h i v i d v e s c o r t the operability of the assisted ship is in particular focus to assess the operability of the escort operation 3 method validation case studies comparing the proposed method with observations this section focuses on case studies of independent navigation and escort operation in real dynamic ice providing a validation of the capability of the ships in real dynamic ice conditions with the ship operability as simulated by the method described in section 2 empirical cases of a ship which has gotten stuck in dynamic ice are valuable information sources to study the ship operability due to the complexity of real situations there are various reasons for a ship to stop therefore the only plausible way to confirm a ship getting stuck in a dynamic ice field is to rely on observations in the corresponding context the cases here are determined based on the safewin project cruise report vedenpää 2011 it describes events where the research vessel got stuck in severe dynamic ice scenarios and reported other nearby vessels becoming beset in ice according to the reported time and location the scene is recreated using data from the automatic identification system ais in this region for the reported vessel and other nearby vessels as well as relevant ice information three ships are selected which represent validation scenarios for the proposed model for operability of independent navigation and escort in dynamic ice conditions reconstructing case studies of ships in the dynamic ice requires different detailed information and data sources as the process of a vessel becoming stuck in ice occurs over a relatively short time period as found also e g in montewka et al 2015 hence the resolution of key data sources should be sufficiently high especially the ship speed the general data related to the case study scenarios are described in section 3 1 whereas the validation results and sensitivity analysis are shown in section 3 2 3 1 data and information sources the case study scenarios concern two operation modes and three ships as shown in table 2 in independent navigation the ice breaking research vessel aranda became beset in ice at around 22 00 another icebreaker nordica is selected for comparison with aranda in the same period in escort operation nordica is the leading ship while envik is the assisted vessel the relevant data and information consist of three parts ship data environmental data and operational data in the following sections these are described in turn 3 1 1 ship data ship data refers to the ship related parameters required for estimating the vessel performance according to section 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 such as vessel dimensions power etc aranda is a finish research vessel with ice breaking capability nordica is a finnish icebreaker designed for assisting merchant vessels in winter operations in the northern baltic sea envik is a merchant vessel with ice navigation capability their main parameters are listed in table 3 3 1 2 environmental data environmental data represents the external conditions in which the ship navigates for the current purposes this primarily includes the ice condition data as well as wind data to provide more detailed contextual information hindcast data obtained using the helmi ice model haapala et al 2005 mårtensson et al 2012 are used as a basis for describing the sea ice conditions similarly as in montewka et al 2015 and goerlandt et al 2017 the ice model is discretized in a curvilinear coordinate c grid and the grid has 415 nodes from west to east and 556 nodes from south to north it covers an area from coordinates 56 74 n 16 72 e to coordinates 65 99 n 30 48 e with an increment of 1 30 eastwards and 1 60 northwards i e approximately 1 nm in both directions at 60 n goerlandt et al 2017 the helmi forecasting model takes thermodynamic and dynamic forcing from the weather prediction model hirlam and has been validated against observed ice situations with good agreement lehtiranta et al 2012 the data concerning ice thickness ice type and ice concentration are used for ice information here the general ice thickness map is shown in fig 4 the ice type in the region where the three ships operated is level ice according to helmi data the ice thickness is extracted based on the routes of the ships as identified using data from the automatic identification system in addition the ice drift condition is vital as one main external factor the ice drift speed recorded from time to time in the research cruise vedenpää 2011 is used as the local ice drift speed matters most however it only reflects the situation at each recorded time and hence is not available in a continuous way as is required for the calculation procedures according to uotila 2001 ice drift speed is correlated with wind forcing therefore in order to have a better understanding of the ice drift speed the wind data is used as reference the wind data is in 10 min interval derived from a nearest observation station maalahti strömmingsbådan 62 98 n 20 74 e 3 1 3 operational data operational data means the data related to the ships navigation here it mainly concerns ship speed for independent navigation but also includes the distance between the two ships in escort operation the historical navigational data record from ships is not available therefore ais data is used alternatively for deriving the operational data ais is an information exchange platform between vessels and shore organizations and contains static and dynamic data the dynamic data gives time dependent data about the location speed course and navigational status of vessels etc goerlandt et al 2017 as mentioned in the beginning of section 3 the scenes are recreated by using the ais data in this region to confirm the reported ships stuck then a detail investigation of the shorter period when ships got stuck is conducted in this investigation the resolution of the data is highly important ais data is recorded with a varying interval from seconds to minutes depending on the speed of the vessel and operational status therefore this sets the limit of the ais data the data interval for the scenarios in this paper are roughly in 10 s intervals which is close to best resolution in ais and considered sufficient for a detailed investigation of ship operations in escort operations the distance between the icebreaker and the assisted vessel is also important information the distance is calculated based on the coordinates data of the two ships which are interpolated for the same timestamp first in addition the calculated distance is the distance of the locations of the ais transponders in order to obtain the real distance between the two ships the location of ais transponders are assumed in the bridge area the distance to ship bow for assisted ship and the distance to ship stern for leading ship are deduced from the calculated distance from coordinates as in goerlandt et al 2017 furthermore the simulation considers only 2d waterline condition thus the distance in the simulation requires the calculated real distance to add stern length of the leading ship and bow length of the assisted ship 3 2 case study results and sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 case study results comparing the proposed method with observations the method in section 2 is applied to the three ships involved in the case studies in table 2 the same initial ship speed as in the real scenarios is set for the simulation of each ship for the independent navigation the ship operability of aranda scenario 1 simulated according to method described in section 2 1 1 and 2 2 1 is shown in fig 5 left over serials of h i v i conditions the observed scenario of aranda becoming beset is indicated by a rectangle as well in fig 5 left the reported ice drift speed is around 0 3 0 4 kn vedenpää 2011 and the ice thickness is 25 cm as shown by the rectangle in fig 5 left it is seen that the rectangle in fig 5 left extends from the boundary of favorable to the boundary of unfavorable with the largest part situated in the risky operability category therefore the simulated operability estimation corresponds well with the observed ship operability in this case fig 5 right shows the speed drop when aranda begins to get stuck because the recorded ice drift speed is in the range of 0 3 0 4 kn the limit values 0 3 and 0 4 are used in the simulation to compare with the observed ais data the simulation using 0 4 kn ice drift speed is quite close to the trend from ais especially in the end period the change of the speed in the middle period from ais data may reflect slight variation of the ice condition the simulation using 0 3 kn ice drift speed indicates that aranda is still able to navigate if ice drifts at this speed when tracking back to wind records it is found that wind speed reaches the maximum of 15 6 m s at 22 00 i e the time at which aranda became stuck in ice it is the daily maximum wind speed and is 1 m s higher than the speed at 21 50 therefore the ice drift speed is more likely to be close to 0 4 kn thus causing aranda to become stuck it also explains why aranda can still sail before 22 00 therefore ship operability of aranda is overall well estimated by the proposed method another simulation for icebreaker nordica is conducted as it is also in this region while no reports were made of its getting beset in ice therefore the operability simulation of this vessel can contribute to establish validity of the proposed method for a different ship the same ice condition as for aranda is applied to nordica and its operational status i e its initial speed is derived to reconstruct the ship condition at the same time when aranda gets stuck fig 6 left shows that in general nordica operates in favorable ice conditions for its ice going capability so that there are no issues with its operability in the prevalent compressive ice conditions fig 6 right demonstrates the speed trends from simulations and the ais records it is seen that the observed ship speed from ais matches the simulation of the two different ice drift speeds relatively well from the above presented case studies for independent navigation the comparison suggests that the method can adequately estimate the ship operability on a general level and the changes of the ship speed on a detailed level the method furthermore appears to be adequately sensitive to the ice going capability of different ships in the selected escort operation the simulation escort distance at the time for envik getting stuck is calculated as 430 m following steps described in section 3 1 3 the speed of envik is also derived from ais data as escort speed the operability of the assisted vessel is of concern in escort operation in fig 7 the ship operability index of envik is plotted over serials of h i v i conditions which is shown together with the observation of the reported case of the vessel becoming stuck in ice as there is no direct ice drift speed reported in that time period the ice speed is estimated based on the wind speed based on uotila 2001 and montewka et al 2015 it is assumed that the ice speed is linearly affected by the wind hence the ratio of the wind speed reported for scenario 3 and scenario 1 is used as a factor to multiply the ice speed in aranda case this results in an ice drift speed of 0 23 0 29 kn during this period this ice drift speed range is shown by the rectangle in fig 7 left and it covers the risky and unfavorable parts in the simulated operability map in fig 7 left it should be noted that the interval of both ice thickness h i and ice drift speed v i for the ship operability index simulation is 0 05 therefore the operability index result between e g 0 1 m s and 0 15 m s ice drift speed at 0 25 m ice thickness is interpolated if the boundary condition of ice drift speed 0 23 kn and 0 29 kn is used the operability result is unfavorable as can be judged from simulated speeds in fig 7 right this difference is remained here instead of improving the resolution of intervals of parameters for fig 7 left is to highlight the importance of selection of the interval when conducting the ship operability index simulation and mapping fig 7 right shows the speed drop of both simulations and observed ais data the speed trend from the observed case is generally situated between the two bounding simulation scenarios based on the estimated ice speed however it is apparent that envik encountered some varying ice conditions e g some ice floes with open water involved among them in this scenario as it managed to keep the speed at around 4 kn for a period of time before getting stuck nevertheless its speed continued to drop at a similar rate soon and it got stuck this varying ice condition cannot be reflected in the simulation result as the simulation considers the ship encounters level ice continuously in the simulation period 3 2 2 sensitivity analysis effects of operational variables on ship operability index sensitivity analysis is used to ascertain how a given model output depends upon the input parameters and check the robustness and reliability of its analysis which contributes to the validation of a proposed model saltelli et al 2009 the operability assessment of the three ships in various environmental conditions is shown in the operability maps in figs 5 7 as an initial validation of the proposed method these results are based on the operational conditions derived from observed case studies the effects of the operational variables i e ship initial speed v o for independent navigation and escort distance and speed d v e s c o r t for escort operation on the ship operability in dynamic ice are not studied yet therefore this section focuses on the sensitivity analysis of operational variables in the proposed method as a further validation in independent navigation the main operational variable is initial speed fig 8 shows the ship operability index map of aranda for different initial ship speeds 2 5 5 7 5 10 kn in general a higher initial speed does not extend the ship operability to higher maximum ice thicknesses but it does extend the operability to higher ice drift speeds this can be explained by considering that a higher ship speed will enable the ship to avoid contact between its parallel midship and the dynamic ice on the sides in addition a trend can be observed in fig 8 that although the favorable area increases with higher ship speeds there is a more outspoken speed loss i e the color is more diverse for favorable category this is consistent with the fact that a higher initial speed leads to a proportionally larger speed loss compared to lower initial speeds another point is that the change in operability is not always linear for example when the initial ship speed is 5 kn the operability at 0 3 m ice thickness is better than at 0 2 m this can be explained that the ice cusp radius induced by that ship speed and ice thickness is more favorable for the ship to escape the contact from the dynamic ice fig 9 shows a similar sensitivity analysis for the effects of the initial ship speed for nordica the observed effects are relatively smaller than for the aranda cases shown in fig 8 therefore the initial ship speed has a limited effect on ship operability for more powerful icebreakers this can be explained by the fact that powerful icebreakers can already handle more severe ice conditions even at relatively low ship speeds with adequate power for escort operations the operational variables include the escort distance and escort speed the escort distance and speed are taken here as the initial distance between the vessels and initial speed of the assisted ship as described in section 2 2 2 the ships will try to maintain both distance and speed during escort the principles in section 2 2 2 are followed if the ships are not able to continue in the initial states fig 10 shows the sensitivity analysis results for the effects of the escort speed when the escort distance is 200 m a low escort speed 2 5 kn mostly leads to risky and unfavorable operability with increasing escort speeds e g 5 kn the region of favorable ship operability of envik extends to a large ice thickness domain by following nordica however the limiting ice drift speed is quite low i e envik can still relatively easily get stuck in windy conditions at an ice thickness of around 0 35m there is an unfavorable condition this seems an unfavorable ratio between the ship speed and ice cusp radius induced by that ship speed and ice thickness where the assisted ship is caught by the ice edge created by the leading ship with a further increased escort speed 7 5 kn the ship operability extends also to wider ice drift speed limits when the escort speed is high 10 kn the favorable operation condition vanishes in the large ice thickness region 0 8 1 0 m this unfavorable operability is caused by the identified potential collision in the simulation as defined in section 2 2 2 in reality collision is harder to simulate as there are many factors involved including human actions zhang et al 2017 2019 however it is not focus of this paper here the result can be taken to indicate that very thick ice can cause a large speed drop of the leading icebreaker which is equivalent to the situation that the leading ship suddenly stops as described by zhang et al 2018 hence a too high escort speed can more easily lead to a collision and is not a favorable choice under such ice conditions fig 11 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis for the effects of escort distance on the ship operability when the escort distance is relatively small 100 m the favorable operability category for envik is quite wide in ice thickness direction this means that thick ice does not represent a significant problem as envik can follow nordica quite well when nordica breaks the way ahead when escort distance increases the favorable operability region decreases because the ice starts to drift into the channel after the leading ship before the assisted ship which causes operability problems for the assisted ship overall both sensitivity analysis on escort speed and distance shown in figs 10 11 indicate reasonable trends as in practice in the escort operation 4 discussion 4 1 ship transit modelling although the case studies in section 3 2 1 show a reasonable agreement between simulation and real cases from both general operability viewpoint and from the more detailed viewpoint of the speed profile it is noted that the proposed model has several simplifying assumptions first this paper conducts ship transit modelling for independent navigation extending the modelling framework by riska et al 1995 by modelling and integrating each resistance component and thrust in the process in the estimation of the additional resistance caused by the dynamic ice it is assumed that the additional nominal pressure follows the pressure area relationship of eq 8 as the result of crushing however it is known that not only crushing occurs when the dynamic ice reaches the ship side but that bending failure may also occur li et al 2019 the difference may be expected to be small as bending does not frequently happen in addition without considering the bending phenomenon the method gives a relatively conservative results which allows a safety margin when it is practically used it can be investigated in future work to what extent the bending phenomenon is important in this process as there are few researches on this second the effective ice edge is considered as the edge determined by the cusp radius as in eq 10 and 11 and the effective contact length is detected based on those formulations there are usually small sharp ice edges between cusps see e g su et al 2010 and individual sharp ice pieces can also cause some crushing forces on the ship side before the defined effective ice edge reaches the ship this may lead the additional resistance by the dynamic ice to occur earlier than when one only considers effective ice contact length third cracks are also not considered in the simulation when the ship creates cracks in the surrounding ice field the ice may be more broken than in conditions where only cusps caused by bending failure are considered which leads to less resistance finally the simulation model assumes that the dynamic ice edge moves perpendicular to the ship side linearly with time while the ice movement in realistic conditions may be in oblique direction and much more complicated based on the validation cases and sensitivity analysis of section 3 it is found that the model gives reasonable estimates this suggests that the several above identified simplifying assumptions made in the proposed method compensate one another although the actual complexity of the ice conditions in the dynamic ice are not accurately accounted for the model is further extended to escort operation which is a more complex operation as it involves two ships the ice edge affected by the leading ship will further influence the assisted ship the resistance for a ship breaking through in partial level ice and partial channel ice is simplified by combining a weighted sum of both the resistance for a ship in this mode needs more research as currently there is no study on this situation the ice breaking in partial level ice is still considered the same as in level ice including the formation of cusps in addition escort includes cooperation between two ships the principles in section 2 2 2 are practically reasonable however it should be noted that the assumption that the leading ship will increase its speed to avoid getting itself stuck in ice when the assisted ship s speed is less than two knots may cause some overestimate because the leading ship may still be able to keep the low speed in light ice conditions however the chance for the assisted ship to not able to maintain its speed is also relatively rare in that light ice conditions therefore the influence for this overestimation can be considered minor in addition to this the escort process involves communication and control of powering when ships cannot simply follow the escort speed the way to accelerate and decelerate ships influences the ship behavior and operability 4 2 validity of the ship operability method the new proposed method to assess the ship operability for independent navigation and escort appears to provide reasonable results based on the validation case studies and the presented sensitivity analyses however it is advisable to further validate the model in follow up research e g by investigating more cases through comparing the simulation results with observations good case studies require a combination of various sources of high resolution data so that the scene can be accurately reconstructed ais data can provide the operational data for a forensic case study if there is no access to onboard records of operational ship data however ais data has limitations related to the varying time intervals of data reporting the environmental conditions ais antenna setup and other factors can restrict and affect the reception rate last et al 2015 therefore in many conditions the time interval is in minutes and this kind of time interval is less appropriate for obtaining validation case study this makes post case study a bit more difficult in addition it is also not enough to only have environmental data derived from models real onboard measurement and records for the environmental conditions are vital for further validation studies all these factors imply that identifying and defining validation cases studies is a rather cumbersome process which is one of the reasons why also in this paper there are relatively few validation cases the limited attention to and difficulties of validating models for ship performance in ice even for comparatively easier ice conditions such as continuous operation in level ice has been highlighted as well in the work by li et al 2018 in term of the model application it has already shown good behavior as seen in the sensitivity analysis therefore it can be a useful tool to generate the operability index map for a ship so that the ship route or oil spill response missions can be planned and fulfilled more successfully however it should be noted that there are still uncertainties which need to be kept in mind in real application first there may be still model behavior uncertainties unexposed due to the simplifications and limited validation cases second the uncertainties may also come from the quantification of the environmental conditions there are still limitations to have the real accurate forecast of the environmental variables to give good inputs to the model real ice fields may be comprised of several ice types such as ridged and rafted ice hence further developing the proposed method to account for combinations of dynamic ice with ridged and rafted ice can be a fruitful avenue for future work as well 5 conclusions this paper presents a method to assess the performance of ships in dynamic ice for both independent navigation and escort in dynamic ice in addition a ship operability index is suggested which can be a practically useful tool for ship routing to avoid ship stuck in dynamic ice ship operability index can be used as an overall estimation to visualize the operability of vessels based on ice forecast in different sea areas which is especially useful as an information source for emergency response planning such as marine pollution preparedness and response planning case studies show reasonable agreement between the simulated model results and empirical observations reconstructed from available data sources this together with plausible model behaviors as tested in a series of sensitivity analyses suggests a reasonable model validity nevertheless it is advised to further validate the model with other vessel types and in other ice conditions using various data and information sources

20963,in the present study the effect of time asymmetry motion trajectory on force generation propulsion performance and wake structure of a plunging foil is evaluated the proposed motion pattern is inspired by kinematics of natural flyers and manta rays for this simulation a wide range of time asymmetry parameters s adjust the proportion of plunge down in the whole cycle the results show that a noticeable increase is achieved in thrust lift and kinematic velocity when the more asymmetric low s motion is experienced high propulsion efficiency mainly focuses within the domain of 30 s 50 sinusoidal motion the wake evolution gets complex under asymmetry motion when s 50 a faster plunge down produces a single positive vortex and one or more negative vortices generated during slower plunge up the number depends on the reduced frequency asymmetry and plunge amplitude the vortex trajectories and streamwise velocities downstream the trailing edge exhibit asymmetric behavior the present work provides helpful findings for better understanding the kinematic behavior of actual animals and designing bio inspired robotics keywords time asymmetry motion plunging foil thrust performance wake structures 1 introduction humans in quest of fish swimming and bird flight are long standing after hundreds of millions of years of evolution and nature selection they have crystallized more excellent motion patterns flapping wings or fins are generally used by birds insects and fish to produce force and moment to maintain lower energy consumption and higher manoeuvrability which bring great inspiration to bionic inventions and engineering applications from now on researchers have made much effort into the design and performance of devices propelled by flapping including underwater vehicles bandyopadhyay 1997 licht 2004 bio inspired robotic vehicles triantafyllou 1995 zimmerman 2017 and micro aerial vehicles platzer 2008 shyy 1999 a volume of experimental and numerical work triantafyllou 1991 yu 2017 has shown that flapping foil can generate thrust and high propulsive efficiency at appropriate frequency and amplitude based on these parameters the wakes are divided into von karman vortex street reverse von karman vortex street deflected wake and chaotic wake which are closed related to drag or thrust generation jones 1998 andersen 2017 systematic investigation has been conducted on sinusoidal plunging motion viscous flow study around a symmetric airfoil was carried out by lewin and haj hariri 2003 for a sinusoidal plunging airfoil the study showed that wake patterns depend primarily on the fate of the leading edge vortex which positively or negatively reinforce the trailing edge vortex directly influence the heaving efficiency ashraf et al 2012 conducted numerically study on a plunging foil at re 20000 the results shown that the thrust and efficiency generally increase with the reduced frequency for a given strouhal number it was attributed to larger suction caused by smaller sized leading edge vortices levs formed at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes and timing of the shedding of these vortices being more synchronized with the motion of the airfoil up to now to achieve the enhancement of both thrust and the corresponding propulsive efficiency of flapping foil a great deal of effort has been devoted and a large number of techniques have been employed ashraf 2011 showed that an optimally thick foil produces larger thrust and higher efficiency while camber offers little to no benefit over symmetric foils in terms of the time averaged thrust and propulsive efficiency under the sinusoidal plunging motion ground effect and free surface performed a significant impact on the thrust force of plunging foil mivehchi 2016 esmaeilifar 2017 as discussed above these studies were focused on the foil in pure sinusoidal motion to study the effect of various kinematic parameters however motion trajectory also has a prominent impact on force generation and efficiency the first work involving non sinusoidal oscillations was experimentally conducted by koochesfahani 1987 in a water tunnel it was found that asymmetric pitching had a very pronounced influence on the evolving vorticity structure at a given frequency and amplitude the experiment results showed that a single strong vortex is formed during the fast part of the cycle while more than one vortex forms on the slow cycle however no force performance and propulsion efficiency was achieved naguib 2011 put forward a vortex array model to extend the preceding wake result the model whose inputs were the relative position core radius and circulation of the vortices is employed to reconstruct the unsteady streamwise and transverse velocity in the wake to compute the mean streamwise force acting on the foil read 2003 performed the experiments to investigate the effects of higher order harmonic plunging motion on the thrust generation and propulsive efficiency they found that thrust coefficients are improved and propulsion efficiency keep nearly constant at the high strouhal numbers xiao and liao 2009 numerically investigated the effect of asymmetric sinusoidal oscillating motion on the propulsion performance of a pitching naca0012 airfoil at re 10000 with amplitudes of 2 4 and 6 the results showed that the higher asymmetry can induce the stronger reverse von karman vortex in the wake which in turn leads to the increased thrust however the propulsion efficiency reduced as increasing asymmetry lu et al 2013a 2013b also conducted asymmetric pitching motion and nonsinusoidal pitching motion at reynolds number of 135000 and 13500 thakor et al 2020 investigated asymmetric motion at low reynolds number and high reduced frequencies they all found that asymmetry noticeable affects the instantaneous force coefficients force peak values hysteresis loop width and wake structures both formation and development of leading edge vortex can be delayed by the fast half stroke of the cycle liu 2020 experimentally studied the effect of the asymmetric pitching motion on the propulsive performance of a jellyfishlike ornithopter model which consists of two anti phase flapping wings in a side by side arrangement it was shown that the fast downstroke and slow upstroke pattern is superior to symmetric back and forth pitching more thrust and less fluctuations in the side force can be achieved investigations into motion trajectory effects on the plunging foil also have been conducted by some researchers sarkar 2006 studied three asymmetric plunging trajectories using a 2 d discrete vortex method they were the first to directly show the impact of asymmetric on the forces and efficiency they commented that an asymmetric trajectory produced an increase in propulsive efficiency the time averaged lift was non zero when using an asymmetric motion and increased with asymmetry and reduced frequency though no quantitative data was presented esfahani 2015 considered that elliptical motion can significantly influence the propulsive efficiency of a pure plunging foil van buren et al 2017 experimentally studied the impact of wave form shape that included approximately triangular sinusoidal or square on the wake and propulsive performance of a pure pitching and pure heaving two dimensional foil the results showed that square like motions exhibited higher thrust and power than the triangular like and sinusoidal motions while the effects of wave form shape for efficiency were subtle square like wave type motions produced a dual jet velocity wake while triangular like and sinusoidal motions showed more typical behavior with a reverse von kármán vortex street and a single jet wake it was suggested that a square wave could be used to accelerate quickly whereas a sinusoid could be used for efficient cruise for vehicles and swimming robots sankarasubramanian 2018 numerically studied the performance characteristics of square plunge motion and trapezoidal plunge motion with varying slope for naca 4 digit airfoil series the study showed that sinusoidal plunging motion was more efficient but generated less thrust when compared to square and trapezoidal plunging motions lin 2018 numerically investigated the wall effect of a two dimensional foil simultaneously executed the asymmetric heaving motion and the traditional pitching motion it can be concluded that a flapping foil heaving quickly during the downstroke but slowly during the upstroke was an effective strategy when it was advance near a wall young 2019 proposed hybrid heave motions inspired by the sail flicking motions which can amplify both lift force and driving force the vortex dynamics lead to 3 principal vortices being convected downstream every cycle flying animals and aquatic animals may use different actuated wave forms while flying swimming near a boundary or a water surface or during maneuvering besides the above motioned trajectory study it is clear that our understanding of the effects of motion trajectory on motion performance is only rudimentary especially for the time asymmetry plunging motion lacking in thorough research on force and wake structure without a fully described force and wake structure and the range of chosen parameters is narrow therefore to further explore the mechanics of a flapping foil this work continues to investigate the effect of motion trajectory of a flapping foil on the propulsive performance and lift enhancement as well here we explore an integrated family of time asymmetry shapes to lucubrate its effect and hope to seek diversity of motion trajectories the purpose of this paper is to systematically qualitative evaluate and quantify the role of asymmetry on the forces and flow structure of a pure plunging foil the computation will be conducted over a wide range of oscillating frequency plunging amplitude and asymmetry parameter the analysis of computed thrust propulsion efficiency and wake structure is presented to help us better understand the mechanism of the propulsion enhancement caused by time asymmetry motion the rest of this paper is organized as follows first we introduce the computational approach in section 2 including the problem description related parameters validations and numerical method the simulation results including force and wake structures are then discussed in section 3 finally the paper is concluded in section 4 2 problem definition and methodology 2 1 problem definition in the current study a rigid two dimensional naca0012 foil with chord length c is placed in uniform flow with an oncoming velocity u in x direction undergoing simultaneous pure plunging motion at zero angle of attack different from the previous literature study the asymmetric motion of a pure plunging foil is prescribed as 1 h t a 0 2 cos π s t t 0 t s t a 0 2 cos π t s t t s t s t t t where h t denotes the instantaneous plunging amplitude a 0 is the peak to peak plunging amplitude t is the time period of motion and t is the instantaneous time in eq 1 we use an asymmetric parameter s which is defined as a function of the time duration of downstroke in one cycle time to realize the foil s periodic time asymmetric plunging motion based on this definition the plunging profile gradually changes from a faster downstroke s 50 to a faster upstroke s 50 in particular the sinusoidal wave shape is obtained by substituting s 0 5 into eq 1 in fig 1 we choose to show the waveform shapes of this typical motion for s 10 20 30 40 50 70 and 90 and plunging velocity in the simulations conducted in this study the flow over the plunging body can be characterized by the following set of non dimensional parameters reynolds number re peak to peak plunging amplitude a c chord based strouhal number sr and strouhal number st a 2 r e u c ν a c a 0 c s r f c u s t a s r a c where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the chord based strouhal number sr is sometimes referred to non dimensional frequency it can be seen that st a is the product of sr and a c we choose re 1000 for the following simulations to quantify the force generation of the oscillating foil dimensionless coefficients c t c l and c p denotes the instantaneous thrust coefficient lift coefficient and input power coefficient respectively therefore during a plunging period the time mean force coefficients are calculated as 3 c t m e a n 1 t t t t c t t dt c l m e a n 1 t t t t c l t dt based on these definitions it is easy to discover that c t mean 0 produces thrust while c t mean 0 produces drag for a plunging foil the instantaneous input power coefficient is calculated as c p t c l t t hence the time mean input power coefficient is calculated as 4 c p m e a n 1 t t t t c l t h t u dt therefore the propulsive efficiency of the plunging foil is defined as 5 η c t m e a n c p m e a n 2 2 numerical method the unsteady laminar flow field around a plunging foil is simulated using the commercial software fluent discretizing the navier stokes equations based on finite volume method fvm the piso algorithm is used for the velocity pressure coupling a second order upwind method is applied for momentum discretization and the derivatives are calculated based on green gauss nodes the plunging movement is controlled by means of user defined function udf in present work the computational domain is considered as a rectangular area the velocity inlet is at a distance of 20c from the leading edge of the foil and the pressure outlet is at a distance of 40c from the trailing edge the upper and lower boundaries are set as slip wall with a distance of 20c to the foil the flow field is divided into three zones an inner zone and an outer zone the unstructured grids in the inner zone adopt dynamic meshing method named diffusion to reduce computational resource and avoid obvious change of grids while the structured grids within the outer zone are stationary in addition the boundary layer mesh surrounds the foil is structured mesh with the first cell height of 10 3 c a total of twenty layers of mesh under the ratio of 1 15 can precisely capture the force and wake structures on the plunging foil 2 3 validations prior to the simulation we need to analyze the grid independence temporal resolution and fluid solver to find appropriate mesh size time step and numerical method for the present study according to the experiment conducted by cleaver 2012 they performed force measurements for a naca0012 foil with sinusoidal plunge motion at various amplitudes and strouhal numbers based on chord length in a water tunnel in order to evaluate grid independence three grids with different mesh sizes are considered a coarse mesh of 9 104 a medium mesh of 2 105 and a fine mesh of 3 105 corresponding to 200 400 and 600 nodes on the foil surface respectively for the temporal resolution analysis three levels of time step per motion cycle are also considered using the medium mesh 1000 2000 3000 results for space and time refinements are shown in fig 2 with sr 2 5 a c 0 2 fig 2 a shows the variation of instantaneous thrust for different mesh sizes maximum percentage increase in c t mean observed is 0 7 between the fine mesh and coarse mesh hence the medium mesh is used in further simulations fig 2 b shows the instantaneous thrust for different step sizes with medium mesh it can be observed that there is no distinct difference between 2000 and 3000 time steps hence the number of time steps per plunging cycle was taken to be 2000 for running further simulations furthermore to validate the fluid solver fig 2 c shows the comparison of time mean thrust coefficients for a wide range of chord based strouhal numbers sr for two different amplitudes a c 0 2 0 4 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results indicating that present fluid solver is applicable wake pattern is another important aspect when we investigate plunging foil jones 1998 conducted an experiment through dye flow visualization in a water tunnel fig 2 d shows the comparison of vorticity contours for reduced frequency k 2πfc u 0 equal to 3 and a c 0 4 the wake patterns obtained from present computation are consistent with the experimental result 3 results and discussion the present parametric study is executed to systematically evaluate and quantify the effect of asymmetry on plunging motion main influencing parameters concerned including asymmetric parameter s chord based strouhal number sr and non dimensional plunge amplitude a c to fully investigate the influence of asymmetric motion a wide range of s from 10 to 90 is chosen so that both the slower and faster plunge downstroke are considered 3 1 statistical results fig 3 a e present η distribution in sr a c planes at various asymmetry parameters revealing the effect of s on the propulsive performance of the studied foil by comparing fig 3 a e efficiency contours we can see the that efficiency of asymmetric motion covers greater area while the symmetric plunging possesses minimum area for the lowest non dimensional frequency sr 0 2 s 10 can get efficiency at about a c 0 5 while s 50 can only get efficiency until a c 0 9 for the lowest non dimensional flapping amplitude a c 0 1 s 10 can obtain efficiency at about sr 1 while s 50 get it until about sr 2 which is achieved to extend the drag thrust line fig 3 e shows the symmetric motion at s 50 there exists an area of high propulsive efficiency in which the heave amplitude is intermediate and the non dimensional frequency is high we note that the optimal efficiency is obtained at 0 3 st a 0 5 which accords better with the previous experiments anderson 1998 read 2003 when the motion becomes asymmetric the size of the area of high propulsive efficiency is reduced and the area of low efficiency colored in blue is bigger as shown in fig 3 b c the optimal propulsive efficiency points occur within a range of 0 2 st a 0 4 accordingly well with the previous experiments anderson 1998 read 2003 and the biological studies conducted on flying and swimming animals indicated that the propulsive efficiency peaks usually within the interval 0 2 st a 0 4 with the asymmetry further increasing the area of high propulsion efficiency gradually disappears as can be seen in fig 3 d e in addition synchronize with the variation of the efficiency contour map the drag thrust transition boundary moves towards the left bottom of the sr a c as asymmetry increases from fig 3 a e we can find the highest efficiency generated at a c 0 3 and a c 0 5 so here a quantitative analysis of the relationship between propulsive efficiency sr ac and s is provided in fig 4 a b obviously for each value of sr examined the efficiency η is symmetrically equal about s 50 fig 4 a displays the efficiency at a c 0 3 the efficiency increases with sr increases when sr is greater than 0 6 the value of the efficiency first increases after reaching a maximum and then jumps to the low value in addition sr 0 2 shows no efficiency due to the drag force generation and sr 0 4 can only get efficiency at s 10 the efficiency of all asymmetric motions are greater than sinusoidal motion at sr 0 6 with increasing sr to 0 8 the efficiency of sinusoidal motion is only greater than that at s 10 s 90 when the sr reaches 1 the maximum efficiency of 15 6 is achieved at s 40 s 60 for the a c 0 5 in fig 4 b the curves of sr 0 4 and s 0 6 have the same behavior depending on the asymmetry parameter the efficiency holds constant at 8 except the extreme motion of s 10 s 90 sr 0 8 and sr 1 have the same variation tendency that efficiency increases with increasing asymmetry as a result the maximum efficiency achieved at sinusoidal motion is 14 8 fig 5 shows the time mean thrust coefficient with different asymmetric parameter s and motion parameters firstly we can see that the time mean thrust coefficient is symmetrically equal about s 50 at all frequencies for example c t mean at s 10 is equal to the value at s 90 c t mean at s 30 is equal to the value at s 70 the rest of the asymmetric parameters s 20 and s 80 as well as s 40 and s 60 follow the same law secondly for a given value of non dimensional frequency s r and asymmetric parameter s c t mean increases with the increase of plunge amplitude a c this trend is consistent across all asymmetric motions here c t mean is negative at lower st a and this can be attributed to the dominant viscous effect generally c t mean always increases with increasing asymmetry when the motion is more asymmetric the critical value of st between drag and thrust is lower it means the increasing asymmetry accelerates the beginning of thrust generation at low frequency verifying the thrust generation enhancement by the increase in asymmetry obviously asymmetric parameter has a stronger and more noticeable effect on the time mean thrust coefficient that comes with complex variety sr 0 2 follows the rules mentioned above the growth rate at s 10 s 90 is much larger than other asymmetries however the rules are broken after sr 0 6 for sr 0 6 where c t mean at s 40 and s 50 exceeds the value of s 30 s 70 when ac is larger than approximately 0 7 and 0 84 respectively yet the value at s 40 is greater than s 50 for sr 1 everything goes well until ac 0 35 where c t mean at s 50 starts to exceed s 30 s 70 and s 40 in general the plunging foil can obtain larger c t mean when plunge is more asymmetric fig 6 plots the time mean lift coefficient with sr ac and s it can be seen that asymmetry has a remarkable influence on c l mean which is entirely different from sinusoidal motion with further increase in ac and s c l mean departs further and further from zero implying the onset of wake deflection similar to the generation of c t mean the numerical results for c l mean indicate that the plunging foil also can achieve significant increase on the lift with keeping increase of asymmetry in contrast to the rule of c t mean we can see that c l mean is symmetrically opposite about s 50 at all frequencies reveals that the direction of wake deflection is opposite for example c l mean at s 10 and s 90 is equal and opposite the same is true of other asymmetries we observe that c l mean at s 50 is always keeping zero for sr 0 2 the changes are more complicated after that c l mean gradually reduces to negative for s 40 and s 50 when sr 0 6 and the deviation extend of s 40 is larger than s 50 while lower than s 50 for sr 1 a unique feature at s 30 is that c l mean is negative for sr 0 6 while positive for sr 1 in fact these differences also suggested that the complexity of flowing structure under different movement parameters such as the leading and trailing edge vortex forming and evolving 3 2 unsteady results fig 7 shows the instantaneous thrust and lift coefficients acting on the foil with different s in the last two simulated cycles at sr 0 4 and a c 0 3 obviously the calculated thrust and lift coefficients are reached periodic changing and s influences the coefficients noticeably one of the significant phenomena associated with the force generation of symmetric motion is that one c l peak is generated in each oscillation cycle while two c t peaks are observed in the same period this is in accordance with previous study lu 2013 in particular the peaks of c l occur when the foil reverses its plunging direction at st once the foil changes its plunge direction at st a positive vortex is shedding from the trailing edge of the foil with increasing the asymmetry the reversal of foil s plunge is accelerated hence the initial velocity of the shedding vortex increases gradually reflecting that the peak values of the instantaneous coefficients are augmented step by step we also note that as the asymmetry increases the peak values of c t and c l increases compared with sinusoidal motion c t max 0 02 c l max 1 5 even 150 times and 25 times at s 90 even though the second peak of c t gets flat due to the low velocity of plunge up the resultant c t mean is still increased significantly thanks to the large accumulation during the fast stroke since s physically describes how fast the foil can reverse its direction we argue that the initial velocity of vortex shed increases with asymmetry and results in an increase of c t peak and c l peak next the effect of non dimensional frequency sr on time histories of thrust and lift coefficients at s 30 and ac 0 3 is discussed as shown in fig 8 a with the increase of sr the peak values of thrust coefficient increase and lie at 0 15t another peak values increase as well and lie at 0 65t it can be inferred that the flow is quasi periodic at sr 1 leading to inconsistent peak formation fig 9 a b describe the effects of varying non dimensional plunge amplitudes a c on thrust and lift at s 30 and sr 0 2 it can be seen that depression and dump appear gradually in thrust and lift coefficients between 0 3t and 0 5t respectively increase with a c and the peak values of thrust and lift coefficients increase 3 3 wake evolution to develop an understanding of the physical mechanism of the asymmetry trajectory the vortex shedding from the foil and the evolution of the wake is discussed qualitative features of the wake structure for asymmetric trajectories are presented in fig 10 for different s r at a c 0 3 as well as time mean streamwise velocity fields in fig 11 in fig 10 sr increases from left to right while asymmetry increases from top to down the foil is at middle position of the downstroke the value of s lower than 50 imples the downstroke of the cycle is faster than the upstroke the shape of the plunge waveform has a strong effect on vortical patterns in the wakes at a given sr by simply changing the shape of the waveform it is obvious to generate a variety of complex vortex vortex interactions for traditional sinusoidal motion it is clear that the wake transits from von karman wake to reverse von karman wake when sr increases from 0 2 to 1 at low asymmetry s 40 there is a very subtle effect caused by asymmetry at sr 0 2 but the vortex structure has a slight downward deflection as increasing sr two negative vortices shed during the slower upstroke and one strong positive vortex is formed during the faster downstroke at s 30 the positive vortices move below the centerline and the upper negative vortices move downward toward positive vortices a third vortex sheds at s 20 for sr 0 4 but also pairs with the lower negative vortex downstream with increasing sr the vortices become more diffused and the upper negative vortices get weaker accordingly the time mean flows for these cases exhibit more intuitive properties we can see apparent velocity deficits behind the foil for the cases of sr 0 2 which lead to drag force more negative vortices exist in the flow field of asymmetry motion and one of them convects above the centerline thus a beam of negative velocity and a beam of positive velocity coexists which one is strong results in drag or thrust with increasing asymmetry and sr the top negative vortices get weaker velocity surplus and high thrust is achieved there is no show in the wake of s 50 mainly based on the following considerations as discussed in section 3 2 it shows the same thrust and opposite lift between s 50 and s 50 we infer that the wake performs similarity thus one of the cases is selected to illustrate when s 30 the wake deflection is downward and a single positive vortex generated during faster plunge down while three negative vortices generated during slower plunge up in fig 12 a however in fig 12 b of s 70 the wake deflection is upward and a single negative vortex generated during faster plunge up while three positive vortices generated during slower plunge down it can be concluded that whether the slower plunge down or the faster plunge down the slower stroke produces more vortices of the same sign while only one strong vortex is generated during the faster stroke all the other situations show the same evolution so we mainly present the situation under s 50 to our knowledge in some cases wake will deflect from the centerline for sinusoid motion and the deflection direction depends on the initial plunging direction we discuss the situation at s 30 sr 0 2 and a c 0 3 as shown in fig 13 a b when the motion gets asymmetry the wake moves downward as the foil firstly plunges down conversely the wake moves upward as the foil firstly plunges up same as the wake of s 70 fig 14 shows the wake structure for asymmetric trajectories in different non dimensional plunging amplitudes at sr 0 2 and a c increases from left to right while asymmetry increases from top to down for traditional sinusoidal motion it is clear that the wake transits from von karman wake to reverse von karman wake when a c increases from 0 1 to 0 9 at s 40 there is a very subtle effect caused by asymmetry for each a c but both the positive and negative vortices have a slight downward deflection the deflection angle of the wake visually increases as the asymmetry increases from s 40 20 but decreases to the wake centerline at s 10 at s 30 three negative vortices formed during the slow cycle and all of the vortices move downstream steadily without rotation for s 20 and s 10 every vortex rotates to make stronger interactions among the vortices with increasing asymmetry and amplitude the vortex intensity is strengthened and the number of negative vortex also increases although the wake structure of asymmetry trajectory is presented above it is helpful to quantify the motion of the vortices by tracking the centroid through space two values of sr 0 2 0 4 and a c 0 3 0 5 are considered for different asymmetries to demonstrate difference in how the vortices move when the trajectory is asymmetric the trajectories of the vortex centroids are shown in fig 15 the negative vortices are labeled according to the order of shedding to our knowledge for s 50 n1 and n2 followed the same trajectory for each non dimensional frequency due to symmetry in the plunging motion when the motion becomes asymmetric there is a distinct deflection and asymmetry in the vortex trajectories and more negative vortices are generated at low sr both p and n1 convect below the wake centerline whereas n2 convects in the vicinity of the centerline with increasing sr and a c each positive vortex moves closer to the wake centerline and even merges to a bigger vortex meanwhile p moves more gently and trends upward downstream at s 10 a dipole is formed between the first negative vortex and positive vortex it rotates counter clockwise quickly so that the negative vortex moves to the top and the second negative vortex moves below the centerline the distance between p and n1 decreases gradually and the deflection tendency gets weaker thus it can be seen that asymmetry primary influences the vortex trajectories to better understand the unsteadiness of a plunging foil it is always of interest to study both its trailing edge vortex tev and leading edge vortex lev fig 16 shows the vortical contours of plunge down and plunge up during a periodic cycle for different asymmetries at sr 0 4 and ac 0 3 the selected cases generally show the vorticity evolution associated with the formation of one two or three negative vortices to form in the wake first for the sinusoidal motion a counter clockwise positive vortex forms at the trailing edge during the plunge down while a clockwise negative vortex forms during the plunge up when the trajectory is asymmetric the vortices form asymmetrically when the foil plunges down for s 40 a positive vortex is shed into the wake and the center is more upstream compared with s 50 as the foil plunges up a negative vortex forms at the trailing edge a second negative vortex is observed near the trailing edge and becomes a braid downstream as the foil continues plunging up when s 30 a lev forms and travels along the upper surface of the foil results in the third negative vortex during the plunge up for s 20 the positive vortex forms more rapidly at the trailing edge during the fast plunge down as the foil switches direction a negative vortex forms at the trailing edge and quickly sheds with the positive vortex into the wake as a dipole a strong jet is generated in the dipole which induces a high pressure on the rear part of the foil thus causing a thrust on the foil we mark the flow jets in fig 18 with arrows for s 10 the dipole sheds faster and rotates quickly and merges with the former negative vortex then the vorticities are redistributed on the wake centerline thus increasing the thrust acting on the foil as the foil continues plunging up high magnitude negative vorticity forms at the leading edge and shed as a stronger vortex as the wake gets complicated with increasing asymmetry here we choose s 30 which has distinct vortex to classify the wake structures in fig 17 for increasing a c the vortex is still downstream indicating an increasing amount of thrust production it can be seen that wake e mainly distributes at 0 2 st a 0 4 while a positive vortex and two relative stronger negative vortices are generated in this range and the distance between them is shorter than other types of wake structures in order to investigate the correlation between drag thrust generation and wake structure of time asymmetry motion fig 18 provides the average and root mean square rms profiles four chord lengths downstream of the trailing edge for different wake structures selected in fig 16 respectively mean streamwise velocity u mean root mean square rms velocity u rms and cross stream rms velocity v rms at a given streamwise location in the wake directly influence the mean streamwise force for rms profiles the peak locations are associated with the vortex configuration for fig 18 a c u mean produces a transition from deficit to surplus the sharp drop in u rms for the second case indicates the vortices are nearly aligned below the centerline when the force switches over from drag to thrust in fig 18 d e u mean shows a combination of velocity deficit and larger excess while results in an excess in the mass it is particular to note the fairly crazy variation in the u rms profile a clear asymmetry is seen from u rms and v rms profile taking the form of a downward shift meanwhile the maximum velocity in the jet progressively shifts in the negative y direction suggesting the wake deflects to the high speed side 4 conclusions in this paper the effects of time asymmetric plunging motion trajectories of a two dimensional foil are studied numerically in an effort to better understand unsteady fish propulsion and discover new techniques for improving propulsive performance a wide range of asymmetry parameters plunging amplitudes and frequencies are considered first the effect of time asymmetry plunging motion on the force generation and efficiency are investigated for different plunging amplitudes a c and frequencies sr the numerical results indicate that time asymmetry plunging motion produces a non zero average lift and a dramatic increase in average thrust even a lower amplitude with a lower frequency can generate thrust compared with sinusoidal motion the foil can obtain higher velocity and acceleration with asymmetric plunge when s 30 40 optimal efficiency can be achieved within a range of 0 2 st a 0 4 while optimal efficiency of the sinusoidal motion s 50 lies at 0 3 st a 0 5 second the thrust and lift coefficient against time with different s a c and sr have been investigated it can be found that asymmetry parameter has a larger influence on the maximum value of lift coefficient than the other parameters finally detailed research on wake evolution under different motional parameters is presented to better understand the physical mechanism of time asymmetry motion this typical trajectory has a dramatic impact on the vortex structure of the foil a faster plunge down produces a single positive vortex and one or more negative vortices generated during slower plunge up the number depends on the reduced frequency and asymmetry when the foil motion trajectory is asymmetric the vortex trajectories and properties in the wake exhibit asymmetric behavior thus animals and vehicles could use asymmetry motions to increase thrust lift efficiency or swimming speed depending upon the situation cownose rays adopt this kind of motion type to get high speed and excellent hydrodynamic performance in future robots asymmetry motion could be used to accelerate quickly whereas a sinusoid could be used for efficient cruise this concept is consistent with the diversity of motion types seen in biological swimmers and it suggests new strategies for effective motor control in swimming robots credit authorship contribution statement xiao chen conceptualization methodology data curation investigation

20963,in the present study the effect of time asymmetry motion trajectory on force generation propulsion performance and wake structure of a plunging foil is evaluated the proposed motion pattern is inspired by kinematics of natural flyers and manta rays for this simulation a wide range of time asymmetry parameters s adjust the proportion of plunge down in the whole cycle the results show that a noticeable increase is achieved in thrust lift and kinematic velocity when the more asymmetric low s motion is experienced high propulsion efficiency mainly focuses within the domain of 30 s 50 sinusoidal motion the wake evolution gets complex under asymmetry motion when s 50 a faster plunge down produces a single positive vortex and one or more negative vortices generated during slower plunge up the number depends on the reduced frequency asymmetry and plunge amplitude the vortex trajectories and streamwise velocities downstream the trailing edge exhibit asymmetric behavior the present work provides helpful findings for better understanding the kinematic behavior of actual animals and designing bio inspired robotics keywords time asymmetry motion plunging foil thrust performance wake structures 1 introduction humans in quest of fish swimming and bird flight are long standing after hundreds of millions of years of evolution and nature selection they have crystallized more excellent motion patterns flapping wings or fins are generally used by birds insects and fish to produce force and moment to maintain lower energy consumption and higher manoeuvrability which bring great inspiration to bionic inventions and engineering applications from now on researchers have made much effort into the design and performance of devices propelled by flapping including underwater vehicles bandyopadhyay 1997 licht 2004 bio inspired robotic vehicles triantafyllou 1995 zimmerman 2017 and micro aerial vehicles platzer 2008 shyy 1999 a volume of experimental and numerical work triantafyllou 1991 yu 2017 has shown that flapping foil can generate thrust and high propulsive efficiency at appropriate frequency and amplitude based on these parameters the wakes are divided into von karman vortex street reverse von karman vortex street deflected wake and chaotic wake which are closed related to drag or thrust generation jones 1998 andersen 2017 systematic investigation has been conducted on sinusoidal plunging motion viscous flow study around a symmetric airfoil was carried out by lewin and haj hariri 2003 for a sinusoidal plunging airfoil the study showed that wake patterns depend primarily on the fate of the leading edge vortex which positively or negatively reinforce the trailing edge vortex directly influence the heaving efficiency ashraf et al 2012 conducted numerically study on a plunging foil at re 20000 the results shown that the thrust and efficiency generally increase with the reduced frequency for a given strouhal number it was attributed to larger suction caused by smaller sized leading edge vortices levs formed at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes and timing of the shedding of these vortices being more synchronized with the motion of the airfoil up to now to achieve the enhancement of both thrust and the corresponding propulsive efficiency of flapping foil a great deal of effort has been devoted and a large number of techniques have been employed ashraf 2011 showed that an optimally thick foil produces larger thrust and higher efficiency while camber offers little to no benefit over symmetric foils in terms of the time averaged thrust and propulsive efficiency under the sinusoidal plunging motion ground effect and free surface performed a significant impact on the thrust force of plunging foil mivehchi 2016 esmaeilifar 2017 as discussed above these studies were focused on the foil in pure sinusoidal motion to study the effect of various kinematic parameters however motion trajectory also has a prominent impact on force generation and efficiency the first work involving non sinusoidal oscillations was experimentally conducted by koochesfahani 1987 in a water tunnel it was found that asymmetric pitching had a very pronounced influence on the evolving vorticity structure at a given frequency and amplitude the experiment results showed that a single strong vortex is formed during the fast part of the cycle while more than one vortex forms on the slow cycle however no force performance and propulsion efficiency was achieved naguib 2011 put forward a vortex array model to extend the preceding wake result the model whose inputs were the relative position core radius and circulation of the vortices is employed to reconstruct the unsteady streamwise and transverse velocity in the wake to compute the mean streamwise force acting on the foil read 2003 performed the experiments to investigate the effects of higher order harmonic plunging motion on the thrust generation and propulsive efficiency they found that thrust coefficients are improved and propulsion efficiency keep nearly constant at the high strouhal numbers xiao and liao 2009 numerically investigated the effect of asymmetric sinusoidal oscillating motion on the propulsion performance of a pitching naca0012 airfoil at re 10000 with amplitudes of 2 4 and 6 the results showed that the higher asymmetry can induce the stronger reverse von karman vortex in the wake which in turn leads to the increased thrust however the propulsion efficiency reduced as increasing asymmetry lu et al 2013a 2013b also conducted asymmetric pitching motion and nonsinusoidal pitching motion at reynolds number of 135000 and 13500 thakor et al 2020 investigated asymmetric motion at low reynolds number and high reduced frequencies they all found that asymmetry noticeable affects the instantaneous force coefficients force peak values hysteresis loop width and wake structures both formation and development of leading edge vortex can be delayed by the fast half stroke of the cycle liu 2020 experimentally studied the effect of the asymmetric pitching motion on the propulsive performance of a jellyfishlike ornithopter model which consists of two anti phase flapping wings in a side by side arrangement it was shown that the fast downstroke and slow upstroke pattern is superior to symmetric back and forth pitching more thrust and less fluctuations in the side force can be achieved investigations into motion trajectory effects on the plunging foil also have been conducted by some researchers sarkar 2006 studied three asymmetric plunging trajectories using a 2 d discrete vortex method they were the first to directly show the impact of asymmetric on the forces and efficiency they commented that an asymmetric trajectory produced an increase in propulsive efficiency the time averaged lift was non zero when using an asymmetric motion and increased with asymmetry and reduced frequency though no quantitative data was presented esfahani 2015 considered that elliptical motion can significantly influence the propulsive efficiency of a pure plunging foil van buren et al 2017 experimentally studied the impact of wave form shape that included approximately triangular sinusoidal or square on the wake and propulsive performance of a pure pitching and pure heaving two dimensional foil the results showed that square like motions exhibited higher thrust and power than the triangular like and sinusoidal motions while the effects of wave form shape for efficiency were subtle square like wave type motions produced a dual jet velocity wake while triangular like and sinusoidal motions showed more typical behavior with a reverse von kármán vortex street and a single jet wake it was suggested that a square wave could be used to accelerate quickly whereas a sinusoid could be used for efficient cruise for vehicles and swimming robots sankarasubramanian 2018 numerically studied the performance characteristics of square plunge motion and trapezoidal plunge motion with varying slope for naca 4 digit airfoil series the study showed that sinusoidal plunging motion was more efficient but generated less thrust when compared to square and trapezoidal plunging motions lin 2018 numerically investigated the wall effect of a two dimensional foil simultaneously executed the asymmetric heaving motion and the traditional pitching motion it can be concluded that a flapping foil heaving quickly during the downstroke but slowly during the upstroke was an effective strategy when it was advance near a wall young 2019 proposed hybrid heave motions inspired by the sail flicking motions which can amplify both lift force and driving force the vortex dynamics lead to 3 principal vortices being convected downstream every cycle flying animals and aquatic animals may use different actuated wave forms while flying swimming near a boundary or a water surface or during maneuvering besides the above motioned trajectory study it is clear that our understanding of the effects of motion trajectory on motion performance is only rudimentary especially for the time asymmetry plunging motion lacking in thorough research on force and wake structure without a fully described force and wake structure and the range of chosen parameters is narrow therefore to further explore the mechanics of a flapping foil this work continues to investigate the effect of motion trajectory of a flapping foil on the propulsive performance and lift enhancement as well here we explore an integrated family of time asymmetry shapes to lucubrate its effect and hope to seek diversity of motion trajectories the purpose of this paper is to systematically qualitative evaluate and quantify the role of asymmetry on the forces and flow structure of a pure plunging foil the computation will be conducted over a wide range of oscillating frequency plunging amplitude and asymmetry parameter the analysis of computed thrust propulsion efficiency and wake structure is presented to help us better understand the mechanism of the propulsion enhancement caused by time asymmetry motion the rest of this paper is organized as follows first we introduce the computational approach in section 2 including the problem description related parameters validations and numerical method the simulation results including force and wake structures are then discussed in section 3 finally the paper is concluded in section 4 2 problem definition and methodology 2 1 problem definition in the current study a rigid two dimensional naca0012 foil with chord length c is placed in uniform flow with an oncoming velocity u in x direction undergoing simultaneous pure plunging motion at zero angle of attack different from the previous literature study the asymmetric motion of a pure plunging foil is prescribed as 1 h t a 0 2 cos π s t t 0 t s t a 0 2 cos π t s t t s t s t t t where h t denotes the instantaneous plunging amplitude a 0 is the peak to peak plunging amplitude t is the time period of motion and t is the instantaneous time in eq 1 we use an asymmetric parameter s which is defined as a function of the time duration of downstroke in one cycle time to realize the foil s periodic time asymmetric plunging motion based on this definition the plunging profile gradually changes from a faster downstroke s 50 to a faster upstroke s 50 in particular the sinusoidal wave shape is obtained by substituting s 0 5 into eq 1 in fig 1 we choose to show the waveform shapes of this typical motion for s 10 20 30 40 50 70 and 90 and plunging velocity in the simulations conducted in this study the flow over the plunging body can be characterized by the following set of non dimensional parameters reynolds number re peak to peak plunging amplitude a c chord based strouhal number sr and strouhal number st a 2 r e u c ν a c a 0 c s r f c u s t a s r a c where ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the chord based strouhal number sr is sometimes referred to non dimensional frequency it can be seen that st a is the product of sr and a c we choose re 1000 for the following simulations to quantify the force generation of the oscillating foil dimensionless coefficients c t c l and c p denotes the instantaneous thrust coefficient lift coefficient and input power coefficient respectively therefore during a plunging period the time mean force coefficients are calculated as 3 c t m e a n 1 t t t t c t t dt c l m e a n 1 t t t t c l t dt based on these definitions it is easy to discover that c t mean 0 produces thrust while c t mean 0 produces drag for a plunging foil the instantaneous input power coefficient is calculated as c p t c l t t hence the time mean input power coefficient is calculated as 4 c p m e a n 1 t t t t c l t h t u dt therefore the propulsive efficiency of the plunging foil is defined as 5 η c t m e a n c p m e a n 2 2 numerical method the unsteady laminar flow field around a plunging foil is simulated using the commercial software fluent discretizing the navier stokes equations based on finite volume method fvm the piso algorithm is used for the velocity pressure coupling a second order upwind method is applied for momentum discretization and the derivatives are calculated based on green gauss nodes the plunging movement is controlled by means of user defined function udf in present work the computational domain is considered as a rectangular area the velocity inlet is at a distance of 20c from the leading edge of the foil and the pressure outlet is at a distance of 40c from the trailing edge the upper and lower boundaries are set as slip wall with a distance of 20c to the foil the flow field is divided into three zones an inner zone and an outer zone the unstructured grids in the inner zone adopt dynamic meshing method named diffusion to reduce computational resource and avoid obvious change of grids while the structured grids within the outer zone are stationary in addition the boundary layer mesh surrounds the foil is structured mesh with the first cell height of 10 3 c a total of twenty layers of mesh under the ratio of 1 15 can precisely capture the force and wake structures on the plunging foil 2 3 validations prior to the simulation we need to analyze the grid independence temporal resolution and fluid solver to find appropriate mesh size time step and numerical method for the present study according to the experiment conducted by cleaver 2012 they performed force measurements for a naca0012 foil with sinusoidal plunge motion at various amplitudes and strouhal numbers based on chord length in a water tunnel in order to evaluate grid independence three grids with different mesh sizes are considered a coarse mesh of 9 104 a medium mesh of 2 105 and a fine mesh of 3 105 corresponding to 200 400 and 600 nodes on the foil surface respectively for the temporal resolution analysis three levels of time step per motion cycle are also considered using the medium mesh 1000 2000 3000 results for space and time refinements are shown in fig 2 with sr 2 5 a c 0 2 fig 2 a shows the variation of instantaneous thrust for different mesh sizes maximum percentage increase in c t mean observed is 0 7 between the fine mesh and coarse mesh hence the medium mesh is used in further simulations fig 2 b shows the instantaneous thrust for different step sizes with medium mesh it can be observed that there is no distinct difference between 2000 and 3000 time steps hence the number of time steps per plunging cycle was taken to be 2000 for running further simulations furthermore to validate the fluid solver fig 2 c shows the comparison of time mean thrust coefficients for a wide range of chord based strouhal numbers sr for two different amplitudes a c 0 2 0 4 the numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental results indicating that present fluid solver is applicable wake pattern is another important aspect when we investigate plunging foil jones 1998 conducted an experiment through dye flow visualization in a water tunnel fig 2 d shows the comparison of vorticity contours for reduced frequency k 2πfc u 0 equal to 3 and a c 0 4 the wake patterns obtained from present computation are consistent with the experimental result 3 results and discussion the present parametric study is executed to systematically evaluate and quantify the effect of asymmetry on plunging motion main influencing parameters concerned including asymmetric parameter s chord based strouhal number sr and non dimensional plunge amplitude a c to fully investigate the influence of asymmetric motion a wide range of s from 10 to 90 is chosen so that both the slower and faster plunge downstroke are considered 3 1 statistical results fig 3 a e present η distribution in sr a c planes at various asymmetry parameters revealing the effect of s on the propulsive performance of the studied foil by comparing fig 3 a e efficiency contours we can see the that efficiency of asymmetric motion covers greater area while the symmetric plunging possesses minimum area for the lowest non dimensional frequency sr 0 2 s 10 can get efficiency at about a c 0 5 while s 50 can only get efficiency until a c 0 9 for the lowest non dimensional flapping amplitude a c 0 1 s 10 can obtain efficiency at about sr 1 while s 50 get it until about sr 2 which is achieved to extend the drag thrust line fig 3 e shows the symmetric motion at s 50 there exists an area of high propulsive efficiency in which the heave amplitude is intermediate and the non dimensional frequency is high we note that the optimal efficiency is obtained at 0 3 st a 0 5 which accords better with the previous experiments anderson 1998 read 2003 when the motion becomes asymmetric the size of the area of high propulsive efficiency is reduced and the area of low efficiency colored in blue is bigger as shown in fig 3 b c the optimal propulsive efficiency points occur within a range of 0 2 st a 0 4 accordingly well with the previous experiments anderson 1998 read 2003 and the biological studies conducted on flying and swimming animals indicated that the propulsive efficiency peaks usually within the interval 0 2 st a 0 4 with the asymmetry further increasing the area of high propulsion efficiency gradually disappears as can be seen in fig 3 d e in addition synchronize with the variation of the efficiency contour map the drag thrust transition boundary moves towards the left bottom of the sr a c as asymmetry increases from fig 3 a e we can find the highest efficiency generated at a c 0 3 and a c 0 5 so here a quantitative analysis of the relationship between propulsive efficiency sr ac and s is provided in fig 4 a b obviously for each value of sr examined the efficiency η is symmetrically equal about s 50 fig 4 a displays the efficiency at a c 0 3 the efficiency increases with sr increases when sr is greater than 0 6 the value of the efficiency first increases after reaching a maximum and then jumps to the low value in addition sr 0 2 shows no efficiency due to the drag force generation and sr 0 4 can only get efficiency at s 10 the efficiency of all asymmetric motions are greater than sinusoidal motion at sr 0 6 with increasing sr to 0 8 the efficiency of sinusoidal motion is only greater than that at s 10 s 90 when the sr reaches 1 the maximum efficiency of 15 6 is achieved at s 40 s 60 for the a c 0 5 in fig 4 b the curves of sr 0 4 and s 0 6 have the same behavior depending on the asymmetry parameter the efficiency holds constant at 8 except the extreme motion of s 10 s 90 sr 0 8 and sr 1 have the same variation tendency that efficiency increases with increasing asymmetry as a result the maximum efficiency achieved at sinusoidal motion is 14 8 fig 5 shows the time mean thrust coefficient with different asymmetric parameter s and motion parameters firstly we can see that the time mean thrust coefficient is symmetrically equal about s 50 at all frequencies for example c t mean at s 10 is equal to the value at s 90 c t mean at s 30 is equal to the value at s 70 the rest of the asymmetric parameters s 20 and s 80 as well as s 40 and s 60 follow the same law secondly for a given value of non dimensional frequency s r and asymmetric parameter s c t mean increases with the increase of plunge amplitude a c this trend is consistent across all asymmetric motions here c t mean is negative at lower st a and this can be attributed to the dominant viscous effect generally c t mean always increases with increasing asymmetry when the motion is more asymmetric the critical value of st between drag and thrust is lower it means the increasing asymmetry accelerates the beginning of thrust generation at low frequency verifying the thrust generation enhancement by the increase in asymmetry obviously asymmetric parameter has a stronger and more noticeable effect on the time mean thrust coefficient that comes with complex variety sr 0 2 follows the rules mentioned above the growth rate at s 10 s 90 is much larger than other asymmetries however the rules are broken after sr 0 6 for sr 0 6 where c t mean at s 40 and s 50 exceeds the value of s 30 s 70 when ac is larger than approximately 0 7 and 0 84 respectively yet the value at s 40 is greater than s 50 for sr 1 everything goes well until ac 0 35 where c t mean at s 50 starts to exceed s 30 s 70 and s 40 in general the plunging foil can obtain larger c t mean when plunge is more asymmetric fig 6 plots the time mean lift coefficient with sr ac and s it can be seen that asymmetry has a remarkable influence on c l mean which is entirely different from sinusoidal motion with further increase in ac and s c l mean departs further and further from zero implying the onset of wake deflection similar to the generation of c t mean the numerical results for c l mean indicate that the plunging foil also can achieve significant increase on the lift with keeping increase of asymmetry in contrast to the rule of c t mean we can see that c l mean is symmetrically opposite about s 50 at all frequencies reveals that the direction of wake deflection is opposite for example c l mean at s 10 and s 90 is equal and opposite the same is true of other asymmetries we observe that c l mean at s 50 is always keeping zero for sr 0 2 the changes are more complicated after that c l mean gradually reduces to negative for s 40 and s 50 when sr 0 6 and the deviation extend of s 40 is larger than s 50 while lower than s 50 for sr 1 a unique feature at s 30 is that c l mean is negative for sr 0 6 while positive for sr 1 in fact these differences also suggested that the complexity of flowing structure under different movement parameters such as the leading and trailing edge vortex forming and evolving 3 2 unsteady results fig 7 shows the instantaneous thrust and lift coefficients acting on the foil with different s in the last two simulated cycles at sr 0 4 and a c 0 3 obviously the calculated thrust and lift coefficients are reached periodic changing and s influences the coefficients noticeably one of the significant phenomena associated with the force generation of symmetric motion is that one c l peak is generated in each oscillation cycle while two c t peaks are observed in the same period this is in accordance with previous study lu 2013 in particular the peaks of c l occur when the foil reverses its plunging direction at st once the foil changes its plunge direction at st a positive vortex is shedding from the trailing edge of the foil with increasing the asymmetry the reversal of foil s plunge is accelerated hence the initial velocity of the shedding vortex increases gradually reflecting that the peak values of the instantaneous coefficients are augmented step by step we also note that as the asymmetry increases the peak values of c t and c l increases compared with sinusoidal motion c t max 0 02 c l max 1 5 even 150 times and 25 times at s 90 even though the second peak of c t gets flat due to the low velocity of plunge up the resultant c t mean is still increased significantly thanks to the large accumulation during the fast stroke since s physically describes how fast the foil can reverse its direction we argue that the initial velocity of vortex shed increases with asymmetry and results in an increase of c t peak and c l peak next the effect of non dimensional frequency sr on time histories of thrust and lift coefficients at s 30 and ac 0 3 is discussed as shown in fig 8 a with the increase of sr the peak values of thrust coefficient increase and lie at 0 15t another peak values increase as well and lie at 0 65t it can be inferred that the flow is quasi periodic at sr 1 leading to inconsistent peak formation fig 9 a b describe the effects of varying non dimensional plunge amplitudes a c on thrust and lift at s 30 and sr 0 2 it can be seen that depression and dump appear gradually in thrust and lift coefficients between 0 3t and 0 5t respectively increase with a c and the peak values of thrust and lift coefficients increase 3 3 wake evolution to develop an understanding of the physical mechanism of the asymmetry trajectory the vortex shedding from the foil and the evolution of the wake is discussed qualitative features of the wake structure for asymmetric trajectories are presented in fig 10 for different s r at a c 0 3 as well as time mean streamwise velocity fields in fig 11 in fig 10 sr increases from left to right while asymmetry increases from top to down the foil is at middle position of the downstroke the value of s lower than 50 imples the downstroke of the cycle is faster than the upstroke the shape of the plunge waveform has a strong effect on vortical patterns in the wakes at a given sr by simply changing the shape of the waveform it is obvious to generate a variety of complex vortex vortex interactions for traditional sinusoidal motion it is clear that the wake transits from von karman wake to reverse von karman wake when sr increases from 0 2 to 1 at low asymmetry s 40 there is a very subtle effect caused by asymmetry at sr 0 2 but the vortex structure has a slight downward deflection as increasing sr two negative vortices shed during the slower upstroke and one strong positive vortex is formed during the faster downstroke at s 30 the positive vortices move below the centerline and the upper negative vortices move downward toward positive vortices a third vortex sheds at s 20 for sr 0 4 but also pairs with the lower negative vortex downstream with increasing sr the vortices become more diffused and the upper negative vortices get weaker accordingly the time mean flows for these cases exhibit more intuitive properties we can see apparent velocity deficits behind the foil for the cases of sr 0 2 which lead to drag force more negative vortices exist in the flow field of asymmetry motion and one of them convects above the centerline thus a beam of negative velocity and a beam of positive velocity coexists which one is strong results in drag or thrust with increasing asymmetry and sr the top negative vortices get weaker velocity surplus and high thrust is achieved there is no show in the wake of s 50 mainly based on the following considerations as discussed in section 3 2 it shows the same thrust and opposite lift between s 50 and s 50 we infer that the wake performs similarity thus one of the cases is selected to illustrate when s 30 the wake deflection is downward and a single positive vortex generated during faster plunge down while three negative vortices generated during slower plunge up in fig 12 a however in fig 12 b of s 70 the wake deflection is upward and a single negative vortex generated during faster plunge up while three positive vortices generated during slower plunge down it can be concluded that whether the slower plunge down or the faster plunge down the slower stroke produces more vortices of the same sign while only one strong vortex is generated during the faster stroke all the other situations show the same evolution so we mainly present the situation under s 50 to our knowledge in some cases wake will deflect from the centerline for sinusoid motion and the deflection direction depends on the initial plunging direction we discuss the situation at s 30 sr 0 2 and a c 0 3 as shown in fig 13 a b when the motion gets asymmetry the wake moves downward as the foil firstly plunges down conversely the wake moves upward as the foil firstly plunges up same as the wake of s 70 fig 14 shows the wake structure for asymmetric trajectories in different non dimensional plunging amplitudes at sr 0 2 and a c increases from left to right while asymmetry increases from top to down for traditional sinusoidal motion it is clear that the wake transits from von karman wake to reverse von karman wake when a c increases from 0 1 to 0 9 at s 40 there is a very subtle effect caused by asymmetry for each a c but both the positive and negative vortices have a slight downward deflection the deflection angle of the wake visually increases as the asymmetry increases from s 40 20 but decreases to the wake centerline at s 10 at s 30 three negative vortices formed during the slow cycle and all of the vortices move downstream steadily without rotation for s 20 and s 10 every vortex rotates to make stronger interactions among the vortices with increasing asymmetry and amplitude the vortex intensity is strengthened and the number of negative vortex also increases although the wake structure of asymmetry trajectory is presented above it is helpful to quantify the motion of the vortices by tracking the centroid through space two values of sr 0 2 0 4 and a c 0 3 0 5 are considered for different asymmetries to demonstrate difference in how the vortices move when the trajectory is asymmetric the trajectories of the vortex centroids are shown in fig 15 the negative vortices are labeled according to the order of shedding to our knowledge for s 50 n1 and n2 followed the same trajectory for each non dimensional frequency due to symmetry in the plunging motion when the motion becomes asymmetric there is a distinct deflection and asymmetry in the vortex trajectories and more negative vortices are generated at low sr both p and n1 convect below the wake centerline whereas n2 convects in the vicinity of the centerline with increasing sr and a c each positive vortex moves closer to the wake centerline and even merges to a bigger vortex meanwhile p moves more gently and trends upward downstream at s 10 a dipole is formed between the first negative vortex and positive vortex it rotates counter clockwise quickly so that the negative vortex moves to the top and the second negative vortex moves below the centerline the distance between p and n1 decreases gradually and the deflection tendency gets weaker thus it can be seen that asymmetry primary influences the vortex trajectories to better understand the unsteadiness of a plunging foil it is always of interest to study both its trailing edge vortex tev and leading edge vortex lev fig 16 shows the vortical contours of plunge down and plunge up during a periodic cycle for different asymmetries at sr 0 4 and ac 0 3 the selected cases generally show the vorticity evolution associated with the formation of one two or three negative vortices to form in the wake first for the sinusoidal motion a counter clockwise positive vortex forms at the trailing edge during the plunge down while a clockwise negative vortex forms during the plunge up when the trajectory is asymmetric the vortices form asymmetrically when the foil plunges down for s 40 a positive vortex is shed into the wake and the center is more upstream compared with s 50 as the foil plunges up a negative vortex forms at the trailing edge a second negative vortex is observed near the trailing edge and becomes a braid downstream as the foil continues plunging up when s 30 a lev forms and travels along the upper surface of the foil results in the third negative vortex during the plunge up for s 20 the positive vortex forms more rapidly at the trailing edge during the fast plunge down as the foil switches direction a negative vortex forms at the trailing edge and quickly sheds with the positive vortex into the wake as a dipole a strong jet is generated in the dipole which induces a high pressure on the rear part of the foil thus causing a thrust on the foil we mark the flow jets in fig 18 with arrows for s 10 the dipole sheds faster and rotates quickly and merges with the former negative vortex then the vorticities are redistributed on the wake centerline thus increasing the thrust acting on the foil as the foil continues plunging up high magnitude negative vorticity forms at the leading edge and shed as a stronger vortex as the wake gets complicated with increasing asymmetry here we choose s 30 which has distinct vortex to classify the wake structures in fig 17 for increasing a c the vortex is still downstream indicating an increasing amount of thrust production it can be seen that wake e mainly distributes at 0 2 st a 0 4 while a positive vortex and two relative stronger negative vortices are generated in this range and the distance between them is shorter than other types of wake structures in order to investigate the correlation between drag thrust generation and wake structure of time asymmetry motion fig 18 provides the average and root mean square rms profiles four chord lengths downstream of the trailing edge for different wake structures selected in fig 16 respectively mean streamwise velocity u mean root mean square rms velocity u rms and cross stream rms velocity v rms at a given streamwise location in the wake directly influence the mean streamwise force for rms profiles the peak locations are associated with the vortex configuration for fig 18 a c u mean produces a transition from deficit to surplus the sharp drop in u rms for the second case indicates the vortices are nearly aligned below the centerline when the force switches over from drag to thrust in fig 18 d e u mean shows a combination of velocity deficit and larger excess while results in an excess in the mass it is particular to note the fairly crazy variation in the u rms profile a clear asymmetry is seen from u rms and v rms profile taking the form of a downward shift meanwhile the maximum velocity in the jet progressively shifts in the negative y direction suggesting the wake deflects to the high speed side 4 conclusions in this paper the effects of time asymmetric plunging motion trajectories of a two dimensional foil are studied numerically in an effort to better understand unsteady fish propulsion and discover new techniques for improving propulsive performance a wide range of asymmetry parameters plunging amplitudes and frequencies are considered first the effect of time asymmetry plunging motion on the force generation and efficiency are investigated for different plunging amplitudes a c and frequencies sr the numerical results indicate that time asymmetry plunging motion produces a non zero average lift and a dramatic increase in average thrust even a lower amplitude with a lower frequency can generate thrust compared with sinusoidal motion the foil can obtain higher velocity and acceleration with asymmetric plunge when s 30 40 optimal efficiency can be achieved within a range of 0 2 st a 0 4 while optimal efficiency of the sinusoidal motion s 50 lies at 0 3 st a 0 5 second the thrust and lift coefficient against time with different s a c and sr have been investigated it can be found that asymmetry parameter has a larger influence on the maximum value of lift coefficient than the other parameters finally detailed research on wake evolution under different motional parameters is presented to better understand the physical mechanism of time asymmetry motion this typical trajectory has a dramatic impact on the vortex structure of the foil a faster plunge down produces a single positive vortex and one or more negative vortices generated during slower plunge up the number depends on the reduced frequency and asymmetry when the foil motion trajectory is asymmetric the vortex trajectories and properties in the wake exhibit asymmetric behavior thus animals and vehicles could use asymmetry motions to increase thrust lift efficiency or swimming speed depending upon the situation cownose rays adopt this kind of motion type to get high speed and excellent hydrodynamic performance in future robots asymmetry motion could be used to accelerate quickly whereas a sinusoid could be used for efficient cruise this concept is consistent with the diversity of motion types seen in biological swimmers and it suggests new strategies for effective motor control in swimming robots credit authorship contribution statement xiao chen conceptualization methodology data curation investigation

20964,this study introduces a numerical scheme for investigating the effects of viscous damping on the dynamic response of a hybrid floating platform concept the floating offshore wind turbine fowt assemblage adopted for this study is the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine mounted on a newly developed inhouse hybrid floating platform identified as the trigon hybrid floater trihf the trihf concept for fowts is developed based on the design principles that cuts across a spar buoy tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible the scheme employed for this study enhances the capability of a potential based hydrodynamic solver by implementing the viscous damping coefficients obtained from a free decay numerical test results from this study confirms that the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform to rotational motion is highly impacted by the effect of viscous damping however the effect of viscous damping on translational motion is insignificant keywords coupled dynamics viscous damping free decay test floating offshore wind turbine fowt six degrees of freedom 6 dof hybrid platform concept time domain frequency domain trigon hybrid floater trihf 1 introduction deepwater floating platforms for offshore wind turbines are integrated systems that combine wind turbine generators wtg floating platforms and station keeping systems moorings and or tethers responding to wind wave and current loadings in a complex way during the design phase of a fowt a coupled dynamics simulation strategy is required to sufficiently predict the motion responses resulting from the interaction between the environmental loads and the assemblage of the fowt there has been a significant increase in the rate at which literature relating to offshore wind energy generation is delivered due to the diversion of research efforts to emerging areas of clean energy several papers rhodri and marc costa 2015 maine 2013 sandy et al 2007 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2020 have presented specific areas of research around floating offshore structure design for wind energy fig 1 depicts an artist impression of some floating concepts in comparison to some fixed bottom foundation concepts in general all three floating spar submersible tlp and spar buoy concepts make use of catenary or taut mooring any of these floating concepts must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine in addition to keeping motions in six degrees of freedom 6 dof within the acceptable limits advancements in wind renewable energy technology have followed the logical and conventional route i e land based foundation to offshore fixed bottom support to floating platform support however fixed bottom technology has seen limited deployment to water depth exceeding 60 m consequently it is generally acceptable to deploy floating platform technology for water depths exceeding 60 m although economics are the key element for the choice of a floating platform concept other aspects such as seabed conditions can play an equally important role nevertheless a remarkable consideration is that floating platforms enhance the flexibility for site selection and lessen the cost dependence on the water depth of the installation site unlike fixed bottom foundations fowts will experience stability limitations because of its floatation fig 2 is an illustration of various interfaces fluid structure and fluid fluid and dynamic loads experienced by a fowt structure under marine environmental conditions the assemblage of the wind turbine structure above the msl will experience aerodynamic loads while the rest of the structure below the msl will experience hydrodynamic wave and current loads both are expected to be transient in nature predicting the dynamic responses is complicated because of the complex load interaction with the fowt assemblage especially for extreme environmental conditions of wind wave and current examining the dynamic forces and motion responses of the fowt structure is extremely challenging current research work has not paid much attention to the effect of viscous damping on the hydrodynamic response of floating platforms for offshore wind turbines thus present studies for coupled dynamics modelling dunbar et al 2015 12 al solihat and nahon 2018 07 jonkman 2013 can be further enhanced to yield more precise results by adequately accounting for intricate hydrodynamic viscous effects a conventional methodology for investigating the viscous effect is by performing a free decay test using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations here the floating structure is displaced from its equilibrium position and forced to undergo harmonic oscillations in calm water m kim et al mingyuet al 2020 performed experimental and numerical studies to estimate the roll damping and hydrodynamic pressure on a 2 d rectangular studies a similar cfd study was also done by wassermann et al 2016 where they investigated the roll damping of vessels using a free decay test from forced harmonic roll motion oliva remola et al adriana et al 2018 estimated the damping of a ship in calm water by performing test experiments using excited roll motions through an internally shifting mass the roll damping parameters where then established from the analysis of the roll response curve obtained from the experiment related studies by jeong et al se min et al 2020 irkal et al 2016 kianejad et al 2018 wilson et al 2006 and song et al 2019 applied different methodologies to achieve one goal which was to examine the viscous damping characteristics of marine floating structures marino et al 2013 ma et al 2015 ullah et al 2019 and ye and ji 2019 have presented studies around the dynamic responses of fowts under hydrodynamic loading using potential theory for regular and irregular waves these studies adopted a similar methodology proposed by jonkman 2007 more recent studies by zhenju et al 2020 investigated the influence of second order wave excitation loads on the coupled response of an offshore wind turbine using the oc4 deepcwind as a case study their emphasis was on investigate how the wave mean drift force and slow drift wave excitation load influence the platform s motions mooring line tension and tower base bending moments fig 3 presents the scope and framework of the present study it introduces a streamlined holistic coupled dynamics simulation strategy for fowts under environmental loads by employing the effective use of a computer aided engineering cae tool kit within the ansys software workbench in this approach a forced oscillation free decay test is adequately modelled by executing an unsteady state multi physics and volume of fluid vof simulation in flat wave or calm water allowing for the calculation of viscous damping arising during coupled heave roll pitch responses thereafter by introducing a floating rigid body frb load model of the fowt assemblage and a finite element fe model of the mooring system a global performance analysis hydrodynamic diffraction hd and hydrodynamic response hr analysis of the fowt is performed using the ansys aqwa cae toolkit the capability of the hydrodynamic rigid body solver in ansys aqwa is then further enhanced by adequately accounting for viscous damping effects upon implementing the results obtained from the free decay test into the rigid body solver 2 wind turbine baseline and hybrid floating platform concept 2 1 wind turbine baseline a 5 mw mw wind turbine has good precedence regarding feasibility studies and executing pilot projects for offshore wind farms in addition to being a typical utility scale for onshore and offshore wind turbine projects musial et al 2004 malcolm and hansen 2002 thus a representative utility scale multimegawatt turbine known as the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine is implemented the theoretical national renewable energy laboratory nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine is a conventional three bladed upwind turbine established to support conceptual research for offshore wind energy industry the gross properties and geometry of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine assemblage are shown in table 1 2 2 hybrid platform concept rationale several papers james and ross 2015 mast et al 2015 bossler 2011 butterfield et al 2007 have presented specific areas of research around floating offshore structure design for wind energy these investigations have broadly grouped these floating offshore structures into four main categories based on their source of stability spar buoy ballast stabilised resulting in a low centre of gravity tension leg platform tlp mooring line stabilised semi submersible buoyancy and or water plane stabilised understanding the key characteristics of the three main floating concepts tlp spar buoy semi submersible is crucial when developing an entirely new concept that cuts across the design principles of either two or all these concepts in this respect the natural periods of motions are key parameters and in many ways reflect the design philosophy for a floating platform typical motion natural periods and hydrodynamic load effects of different fowt platform are presented in table 2 according to ref global performance analys 2004 design of floating wind t 2013 as can be observed from the data presented in table 2b a common characteristic of all floater types is that they are compliant c or soft in the horizontal plane with surge sway and yaw periods generally 100 s the essential differences among the floaters are related to their modes of motions in the vertical plane heave roll and pitch which are decisive for the choice of a station keeping system obviously tension leg platforms tlps differ fundamentally from all other floater concepts because of their stiffness with regards to heave pitch and roll which is governed by tendons rather than water plane area hence tlps are compliant to surge sway and yaw motions but very much restrained in heave roll and pitch motions as presented in table 2a tlps generally experience wave induced motions in the horizontal plane that are of the same order of magnitude as those of a spar submersible of comparable size but they experience very little wave motion responses in the vertical plane spar buoys are characterised by small heave motions with natural periods less than 5 s however due to the deep draft for a spar buoy floater a large area of the submerged platform is exposed to current forces which are usually the dominant environmental load for a spar submersible the main source of stability are the columns of the floater which nevertheless provide small waterplane areas causing natural periods slightly 20 s with regards to the vertical modes of motion a hybrid mooring system that constitutes of subsea buoys and weights can be fitted in a spar submersible floater concept additionally spar submersibles are very sensitive to weight changes and experience large current forces due to the bluff shapes of its submerged columns and pontoons as shown in table 2b a spar submersible is characterised by being compliant with all modes of motions having natural periods above the range of natural wave periods however wave loads can become significantly important in extreme environmental loads 2 3 trigon hybrid floater trihf concept rationale and model description as highlighted earlier the wider aim of this study is to conceptualise an in house hybrid floating platform for fowts identified as trihf it combines the benefits of all three floater concepts considering various design aspects from engineering construction fabrication installation and maintenance the trihf platform consists of a trigon hull made from steel the trigon shaped three sided polygon hull is designed for optimal motion response in wind and wave and provides the main source of buoyancy the braces and the centre column provide structural support for the wtg system the trigon hull serves three main purposes which are to provide buoyancy support water plane stability and ballasting for draft control also the hull provides a connection for the mooring assembly on the floater fig 4 contains an artistic impression showing the complete fowt including the nrel 5 mw wind turbine baseline when in transit the floating stability of the trihf platform is mainly obtained from the cut waterplane area of the trigon hull and correspondingly a high restoring stiffness especially in the vertical plane heave pitch and roll consequently the fully assembled fowt system can be towed out on its keel using conventional tugboats and with its full cut waterline area exposed to the waves once at the desired offshore wind farm project site the centre column tank is partially ballasted thus lowering the fowt s centre of gravity and submerging the hull to its operational draft the circumference and height of the trigon hull also provide more inertia which reduces the platform s motion and improves stability the heavy counterweight at the bottom of the centre column is a permanent ballast component made from high density material 5000 kg m3 suitable heavy aggregate can be manufactured from the mineral magnetite reaching densities up to 5200 kg m3 danielsweden 2020 one of the key benefits of using high aggregate is the reduction of the bulk volume of the floating platform more importantly the wtg assemblage is positioned at the centre of the trihf platform to facilitate the needless use of additional ballasting to counteract the weight of the turbine the result is a reduced draft enabling easy navigation into a port dry dock or sheltered area another key merit of a shallow draft fowt platform is that it allows fabrication construction assembling and pre commissioning of the floater at inshore rather than offshore locations passive water ballast of approximately 1418 tons is required to reach the design draft of 36 m thus trihf achieves pitch restoring from a combination of passive ballasting and buoyancy another key merit of a shallow draft fowt platform is that it allows fabrication construction assembling and pre commissioning of the floater at inshore rather than offshore locations passive water ballast of approximately 1418 tons is required to reach the design draft of 36 m thus trihf achieves pitch restoring from a combination of passive ballasting and buoyancy the use of an active ballast system for trihf is unnecessary which reduces the number of active components in the system and ultimately the associated risk of component failures one of the main drivers for the design of the trigon hull is the ease of fabrication and robustness of the structure the structural design of the hull frame is based on stiffened steel plates like the material specification used in the offshore oil and gas industry the dimensions of the trihf platform are presented in table 3 a seven line taut leg mooring configuration is the principal choice for the trihf platform it is configured to utilise the benefits of the restoring forces generated by the elasticity of the mooring line fig 5 presents an illustration of the mooring configuration as can be observed a symmetrical arrangement about the x axis for the mooring line orientation is adopted the mooring connection point on the floater is located midway of the hull s submerged height and coincident with its vertices while its connection point on the counterweight is positioned midway of the lower disc s height this arrangement precludes any need for balancing cable tensions table 4 contains the mooring system properties the platform coordinate system definition used is consistent with recommended standards and practices design of floating wind t 2013 design of offshore wind t 2014 loads and sites condition 2016 where z direction corresponds with height and is positive above and negative below the msl the global coordinate centre is located at the centre of the hull at msl wind and current direction are positive toward the x direction and the angle of attack is measured in a clockwise direction the trihf platform comprises major elements of a spar buoy centre column with a low cg as well as a tlp taut mooring and to a minor extend some of the features of a semi submersible 2 4 precise mass calculations for trihf platform fig 6 a and b illustrate the precise mass calculations performed for the trihf platform using ansys static structural and aqwa respectively in fig 6 a the centre of mass and principal moment of inertia for each component of the fowt were set up discretely and then solved to provide a combined solution for centre of mass and principal moment of inertia the combined solution yielded a new position for the centre of mass at 0 0 19 25 m and a principal moment of inertia about the centre of mass 8 79e 09 8 78e 09 7 44e 08 kg m2 concerning the result for the hydrostatics centre of mass and principal moment of inertia as shown in fig 6 b the centre of mass moved slightly upwards toward the msl by 0 25 m a logical explanation to this transformation can be attributed to the inclusion of the internal ballast tank in the model 3 rigid body coupled dynamics and numerical simulation strategy 3 1 governing equation and boundary conditions for wave structure interaction the potential code used to derive the platform motions facilitates boundary element method bem basic assumptions are the use of linear wave theory and linear system behaviour linear wave theory adopts continuity for an ideal fluid combined with the definition of a potential flow any solution for the potential φ must satisfy the well known laplace eq 1 1 2 φ 0 to be able to solve the laplace eq the propagation of waves is reduced to a two dimensional problem additionally several boundary conditions need to be established which are the bottom boundary condition the kinematic boundary condition the dynamic boundary condition as well as the fact that the seabed is parallel to the still water level solving for the wave potential yields 2 φ o i g a ω cosh k z d sinh k d e i k

radiation cannot be neglected in this case φ 0 φ d and φ r represent independent potentials for the incident wave wave scattering and wave radiation the linear superposition of these potentials forms the excitation for the wave structure interaction problem physically wave radiation is caused by the structure s movement the incident wave transfers energy into the structure causing motions in 6 dof respectively in turn the structure s motion transfer energy back into the water generating radiating waves within potential theory codes such as aqwa the energy transfer from structure to wave is consider as potential damping however these codes cannot take into account any viscous effects such as shear stresses along the wetted surface and turbulence hence potential codes generally underestimate the total damping and in return overestimate the system response especially for those waves that have their frequencies close to the natural frequencies of the structure 3 2 governing equations and boundary conditions for viscous damping investigation for correctly estimating the structure s response viscous damping is crucial once determined the results derived using potential theory can be enhanced by incorporating the viscous damping this way an overestimation of motions especially close to the structure s natural frequencies can be corrected to determine the viscous damping this research focuses on investigating the total damping coefficients for the coupled heave roll pitch motion simulating a free oscillation decay test the strategy here will be to first determine the potential damping coefficients using the potential theory solver and then theoretically calculate the total damping employing the exponential decay derived from the simulated free oscillation this yields the total damping coefficients for heave b 33 roll b 44 and pitch b 55 as 6 b 33 t o t a l 2 ς 33 m m a 33 c 33 7 b 44 t o t a l 2 ς 44 i 44 i a 44 c 44 8 b 55 t o t a l 2 ς 55 i 55 i a 55 c 55 where i 44 and i 55 are the moments of inertia about the roll and pitch axis respectively similarly i a 44 and i a 55 are the added moment of inertia about the roll and pitch axis respectively m is the total mass of the structure while m a is the added mass and c is the restoring coefficient of the structure most importantly ς i j is the non dimensional total damping this is

model set up boundary conditions and pre processing strategies a three dimensional dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi physics continuum with overset meshing strategy is employed in performing the numerical simulation for the free decay test of the trihf the cae toolkit used in this instance is star ccm the volume of fluid vof wave solver with eulerian multiphase air and water is employed to capture the free surface the k ε turbulence model with the realisable k ε two layer all y treatment is initiated to adequately capture the viscous flow conditions around the trihf to reduce the computational effort only the floating platform s body is used in performing the free decay test however the mass centre of mass and moments of inertia used in performing the numerical simulation are those of the complete assemblage the size of the domain is set to 300 m in depth below the free surface zone to avoid the development of reverse flow from the boundaries of the domain during the simulation the floating platform is placed at the centre of the domain and the length and width of the domain were geometricized to 600 m and 400 m respectively fig 8 illustrates the boundary conditions for the flow domain and the section plane of the meshing scheme adopted for the simulation the overlap mesh region acts as an interface that couples the region containing the rigid body and the background region which mimics the environment an implicit unsteady state physics continuum is initiated for the regions of interests background and overset due the presence of eulerian multiphase fluids in different phases the effect of gravity acting on both is modelled using the gravity model also the grid around the trihf and the water air interface i e the free surface region is refined to capture the relevant flow details fig 9 shows scenes from cut planes during the initialisation after generating the mesh the trihf is given an initial displacement and orientations of 5 m 5 and 5 along the heave axis and around the roll and pitch axis respectively the initial displacements has to be large enough to allow for at least 3 peaks in the response signals 4 2 results fig 10 highlights the free decay curves of the trihf the platform line of symmetry is along the x axis which is defined as the roll axis although the platform is not symmetrical along the pitch axis y axis the response signals for roll and pitch motion are almost identical as shown in fig 10 a with regards to heave motion an additional 1 dof free decay test is done to check if roll and pitch motion have any substantial effect on the heave response see fig 10 b a comparison shows no significant discrepancy fig 11 and fig 12 contain the scenes of swl iso surface distribution vorticity distribution and absolute pressure distribution along the surface of the floating platform for a 1 dof heave motion free decay test and coupled heave roll pitch free decay test respectively table 5 highlights the calculated non dimensional total damping coefficients ς i j 5 discussion and comparison fig 10 shows the decay as it occurs during the simulated free decay test described in section 4 as a result the non dimensional damping coefficient for heave is ς 33 0 2781 for roll ς 44 0 1071 and for pitch ς 55 0 099 ς 44 and ς 55 deviate by only 8 2 as can be expected by directly comparing roll and pitch oscillations as presented in fig 10 the corresponding damping coefficients are b 33 t o t a l 10 50 10 6 k g s for heave b 44 t o t a l 28 63 10 6 k g m 2 s for roll and b 55 t o t a l 26 47 10 6 k g m 2 s for pitch in relation to that the radiation damping for heave as calculated using potential theory is b 33 r ω 0 33 0 03 10 6 k g s 0 3 of the total damping this is an intriguing observation as the ensuing negative potential damping for heave suggests an additional source of forcing or excitation different from the incident wave excitation rather than damping of the motion effects like this can be a result of vortex shedding that happens close to or at the natural frequency of motion however this would require current induced vortices which are not part of the potential theory calculations at this stage of the research no obvious explanation can be given hence the authors will investigate this matter in detail at a later stage consequently with total damping being the sum of potential and viscous damping the viscous damping for heave comprises to b 33 10 53 10 6 k g s or 100 3 of the total damping as for roll the radiation damping is b 44 r ω 0 44 5 38 10 6 k g m 2 s hence 18 8 of the total damping thus the viscous damping for the pitch motion is b 44 23 25 10 6 k g m 2 s or 81 2 of the total damping the situation for pitch deviates slightly off that from roll b 55 r ω 0 44 5 38 10 6 k g m 2 s hence 20 3 of the total damping with b 55 21 06 10 6 k g m 2 s or 79 7 of the total damping this clearly shows that viscous damping is an effect that cannot be neglected when hydrodynamically analysing the trihf as it is at least four times as high as the potential damping for all three cases viscous damping will notably reduce the magnitude of the harmonic response whilst simultaneously reducing the natural frequency increases the natural period not taking it into account will result in a disproportional overestimation of responses to wave excitations near the natural frequencies to put the results derived for the trihf into perspective they are compared to experimental results for another fowt design as illustrated in fig 13 coulling et al 2013 and robertson et al robertsonet al 2017 10 performed model experiments to validate the global dynamic performance of the deepcwind floating semi submersible under a project funded by the international energy agency iea research for wind energy coulling et al s oc4 1 1 offshore code comparison collaboration continuation oc4 project was a model experimentation performed at the maritime research institute netherlands marin wave basin while robertson et al s oc5 2 2 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project was a revision of the oc4 project two years later both projects also utilised the nrel 5 mw wind turbine system for their case study one of the experiments carried out in the oc5 project involved performing a free decay test to compare the eigenfrequencies and damping of the fowt structure for all 6dof as can be observed by comparing both designs see figs 4 and 13 and table 6 the trihf and the deepcwind structure are similar in size however there are differences in draft water depth and other properties such as restoring coefficients where the trihf features 10 times higher stiffness for heave roll and pitch respectively most obviously the trfihf features a different waterplane area prone to create significant turbulence and corresponding viscous damping effects also the deepcwind platform facilitates a spread hence a rather soft mooring allowing for large motions with regards to sway and surge consequently pitch roll and heave are also not as restricted as for a taut mooring featured as part of the trihf design fig 14 indicates a comparison of the damping effects and natural periods between the current study trihf and the deepcwind semi submersible as can be observed from fig 14 the non dimensional total damping ratios differ only slightly from that of the deepcwind platform however the total damping of the trihf for heave roll and pitch alike is by a magnitude higher than that of the deepcwind this can be attributed to the additional stiffness of the trihf offered by the taut leg mooring line the largely bigger stiffness of the trihf see table 6 also significantly increases the natural frequencies reducing the natural periods as compared to the deepcwind in addition the viscous damping also causes a slight shift of all three the natural periods towards longer periods see fig 14 right although the trihf is significantly stiffer it operates well off the peak periods of the design sea state as presented in table 7 which start at 17 5 s for operational power production regimes and move up for more extreme design sea states however larger accelerations due to the higher natural frequencies e g at the top of the tower nacelle need a careful investigation credit authorship

20964,this study introduces a numerical scheme for investigating the effects of viscous damping on the dynamic response of a hybrid floating platform concept the floating offshore wind turbine fowt assemblage adopted for this study is the national renewable energy laboratory nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine mounted on a newly developed inhouse hybrid floating platform identified as the trigon hybrid floater trihf the trihf concept for fowts is developed based on the design principles that cuts across a spar buoy tension leg platform tlp and semi submersible the scheme employed for this study enhances the capability of a potential based hydrodynamic solver by implementing the viscous damping coefficients obtained from a free decay numerical test results from this study confirms that the hydrodynamic response of the floating platform to rotational motion is highly impacted by the effect of viscous damping however the effect of viscous damping on translational motion is insignificant keywords coupled dynamics viscous damping free decay test floating offshore wind turbine fowt six degrees of freedom 6 dof hybrid platform concept time domain frequency domain trigon hybrid floater trihf 1 introduction deepwater floating platforms for offshore wind turbines are integrated systems that combine wind turbine generators wtg floating platforms and station keeping systems moorings and or tethers responding to wind wave and current loadings in a complex way during the design phase of a fowt a coupled dynamics simulation strategy is required to sufficiently predict the motion responses resulting from the interaction between the environmental loads and the assemblage of the fowt there has been a significant increase in the rate at which literature relating to offshore wind energy generation is delivered due to the diversion of research efforts to emerging areas of clean energy several papers rhodri and marc costa 2015 maine 2013 sandy et al 2007 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2020 have presented specific areas of research around floating offshore structure design for wind energy fig 1 depicts an artist impression of some floating concepts in comparison to some fixed bottom foundation concepts in general all three floating spar submersible tlp and spar buoy concepts make use of catenary or taut mooring any of these floating concepts must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine in addition to keeping motions in six degrees of freedom 6 dof within the acceptable limits advancements in wind renewable energy technology have followed the logical and conventional route i e land based foundation to offshore fixed bottom support to floating platform support however fixed bottom technology has seen limited deployment to water depth exceeding 60 m consequently it is generally acceptable to deploy floating platform technology for water depths exceeding 60 m although economics are the key element for the choice of a floating platform concept other aspects such as seabed conditions can play an equally important role nevertheless a remarkable consideration is that floating platforms enhance the flexibility for site selection and lessen the cost dependence on the water depth of the installation site unlike fixed bottom foundations fowts will experience stability limitations because of its floatation fig 2 is an illustration of various interfaces fluid structure and fluid fluid and dynamic loads experienced by a fowt structure under marine environmental conditions the assemblage of the wind turbine structure above the msl will experience aerodynamic loads while the rest of the structure below the msl will experience hydrodynamic wave and current loads both are expected to be transient in nature predicting the dynamic responses is complicated because of the complex load interaction with the fowt assemblage especially for extreme environmental conditions of wind wave and current examining the dynamic forces and motion responses of the fowt structure is extremely challenging current research work has not paid much attention to the effect of viscous damping on the hydrodynamic response of floating platforms for offshore wind turbines thus present studies for coupled dynamics modelling dunbar et al 2015 12 al solihat and nahon 2018 07 jonkman 2013 can be further enhanced to yield more precise results by adequately accounting for intricate hydrodynamic viscous effects a conventional methodology for investigating the viscous effect is by performing a free decay test using computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations here the floating structure is displaced from its equilibrium position and forced to undergo harmonic oscillations in calm water m kim et al mingyuet al 2020 performed experimental and numerical studies to estimate the roll damping and hydrodynamic pressure on a 2 d rectangular studies a similar cfd study was also done by wassermann et al 2016 where they investigated the roll damping of vessels using a free decay test from forced harmonic roll motion oliva remola et al adriana et al 2018 estimated the damping of a ship in calm water by performing test experiments using excited roll motions through an internally shifting mass the roll damping parameters where then established from the analysis of the roll response curve obtained from the experiment related studies by jeong et al se min et al 2020 irkal et al 2016 kianejad et al 2018 wilson et al 2006 and song et al 2019 applied different methodologies to achieve one goal which was to examine the viscous damping characteristics of marine floating structures marino et al 2013 ma et al 2015 ullah et al 2019 and ye and ji 2019 have presented studies around the dynamic responses of fowts under hydrodynamic loading using potential theory for regular and irregular waves these studies adopted a similar methodology proposed by jonkman 2007 more recent studies by zhenju et al 2020 investigated the influence of second order wave excitation loads on the coupled response of an offshore wind turbine using the oc4 deepcwind as a case study their emphasis was on investigate how the wave mean drift force and slow drift wave excitation load influence the platform s motions mooring line tension and tower base bending moments fig 3 presents the scope and framework of the present study it introduces a streamlined holistic coupled dynamics simulation strategy for fowts under environmental loads by employing the effective use of a computer aided engineering cae tool kit within the ansys software workbench in this approach a forced oscillation free decay test is adequately modelled by executing an unsteady state multi physics and volume of fluid vof simulation in flat wave or calm water allowing for the calculation of viscous damping arising during coupled heave roll pitch responses thereafter by introducing a floating rigid body frb load model of the fowt assemblage and a finite element fe model of the mooring system a global performance analysis hydrodynamic diffraction hd and hydrodynamic response hr analysis of the fowt is performed using the ansys aqwa cae toolkit the capability of the hydrodynamic rigid body solver in ansys aqwa is then further enhanced by adequately accounting for viscous damping effects upon implementing the results obtained from the free decay test into the rigid body solver 2 wind turbine baseline and hybrid floating platform concept 2 1 wind turbine baseline a 5 mw mw wind turbine has good precedence regarding feasibility studies and executing pilot projects for offshore wind farms in addition to being a typical utility scale for onshore and offshore wind turbine projects musial et al 2004 malcolm and hansen 2002 thus a representative utility scale multimegawatt turbine known as the nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine is implemented the theoretical national renewable energy laboratory nrel offshore 5 mw baseline wind turbine is a conventional three bladed upwind turbine established to support conceptual research for offshore wind energy industry the gross properties and geometry of the nrel 5 mw baseline wind turbine assemblage are shown in table 1 2 2 hybrid platform concept rationale several papers james and ross 2015 mast et al 2015 bossler 2011 butterfield et al 2007 have presented specific areas of research around floating offshore structure design for wind energy these investigations have broadly grouped these floating offshore structures into four main categories based on their source of stability spar buoy ballast stabilised resulting in a low centre of gravity tension leg platform tlp mooring line stabilised semi submersible buoyancy and or water plane stabilised understanding the key characteristics of the three main floating concepts tlp spar buoy semi submersible is crucial when developing an entirely new concept that cuts across the design principles of either two or all these concepts in this respect the natural periods of motions are key parameters and in many ways reflect the design philosophy for a floating platform typical motion natural periods and hydrodynamic load effects of different fowt platform are presented in table 2 according to ref global performance analys 2004 design of floating wind t 2013 as can be observed from the data presented in table 2b a common characteristic of all floater types is that they are compliant c or soft in the horizontal plane with surge sway and yaw periods generally 100 s the essential differences among the floaters are related to their modes of motions in the vertical plane heave roll and pitch which are decisive for the choice of a station keeping system obviously tension leg platforms tlps differ fundamentally from all other floater concepts because of their stiffness with regards to heave pitch and roll which is governed by tendons rather than water plane area hence tlps are compliant to surge sway and yaw motions but very much restrained in heave roll and pitch motions as presented in table 2a tlps generally experience wave induced motions in the horizontal plane that are of the same order of magnitude as those of a spar submersible of comparable size but they experience very little wave motion responses in the vertical plane spar buoys are characterised by small heave motions with natural periods less than 5 s however due to the deep draft for a spar buoy floater a large area of the submerged platform is exposed to current forces which are usually the dominant environmental load for a spar submersible the main source of stability are the columns of the floater which nevertheless provide small waterplane areas causing natural periods slightly 20 s with regards to the vertical modes of motion a hybrid mooring system that constitutes of subsea buoys and weights can be fitted in a spar submersible floater concept additionally spar submersibles are very sensitive to weight changes and experience large current forces due to the bluff shapes of its submerged columns and pontoons as shown in table 2b a spar submersible is characterised by being compliant with all modes of motions having natural periods above the range of natural wave periods however wave loads can become significantly important in extreme environmental loads 2 3 trigon hybrid floater trihf concept rationale and model description as highlighted earlier the wider aim of this study is to conceptualise an in house hybrid floating platform for fowts identified as trihf it combines the benefits of all three floater concepts considering various design aspects from engineering construction fabrication installation and maintenance the trihf platform consists of a trigon hull made from steel the trigon shaped three sided polygon hull is designed for optimal motion response in wind and wave and provides the main source of buoyancy the braces and the centre column provide structural support for the wtg system the trigon hull serves three main purposes which are to provide buoyancy support water plane stability and ballasting for draft control also the hull provides a connection for the mooring assembly on the floater fig 4 contains an artistic impression showing the complete fowt including the nrel 5 mw wind turbine baseline when in transit the floating stability of the trihf platform is mainly obtained from the cut waterplane area of the trigon hull and correspondingly a high restoring stiffness especially in the vertical plane heave pitch and roll consequently the fully assembled fowt system can be towed out on its keel using conventional tugboats and with its full cut waterline area exposed to the waves once at the desired offshore wind farm project site the centre column tank is partially ballasted thus lowering the fowt s centre of gravity and submerging the hull to its operational draft the circumference and height of the trigon hull also provide more inertia which reduces the platform s motion and improves stability the heavy counterweight at the bottom of the centre column is a permanent ballast component made from high density material 5000 kg m3 suitable heavy aggregate can be manufactured from the mineral magnetite reaching densities up to 5200 kg m3 danielsweden 2020 one of the key benefits of using high aggregate is the reduction of the bulk volume of the floating platform more importantly the wtg assemblage is positioned at the centre of the trihf platform to facilitate the needless use of additional ballasting to counteract the weight of the turbine the result is a reduced draft enabling easy navigation into a port dry dock or sheltered area another key merit of a shallow draft fowt platform is that it allows fabrication construction assembling and pre commissioning of the floater at inshore rather than offshore locations passive water ballast of approximately 1418 tons is required to reach the design draft of 36 m thus trihf achieves pitch restoring from a combination of passive ballasting and buoyancy another key merit of a shallow draft fowt platform is that it allows fabrication construction assembling and pre commissioning of the floater at inshore rather than offshore locations passive water ballast of approximately 1418 tons is required to reach the design draft of 36 m thus trihf achieves pitch restoring from a combination of passive ballasting and buoyancy the use of an active ballast system for trihf is unnecessary which reduces the number of active components in the system and ultimately the associated risk of component failures one of the main drivers for the design of the trigon hull is the ease of fabrication and robustness of the structure the structural design of the hull frame is based on stiffened steel plates like the material specification used in the offshore oil and gas industry the dimensions of the trihf platform are presented in table 3 a seven line taut leg mooring configuration is the principal choice for the trihf platform it is configured to utilise the benefits of the restoring forces generated by the elasticity of the mooring line fig 5 presents an illustration of the mooring configuration as can be observed a symmetrical arrangement about the x axis for the mooring line orientation is adopted the mooring connection point on the floater is located midway of the hull s submerged height and coincident with its vertices while its connection point on the counterweight is positioned midway of the lower disc s height this arrangement precludes any need for balancing cable tensions table 4 contains the mooring system properties the platform coordinate system definition used is consistent with recommended standards and practices design of floating wind t 2013 design of offshore wind t 2014 loads and sites condition 2016 where z direction corresponds with height and is positive above and negative below the msl the global coordinate centre is located at the centre of the hull at msl wind and current direction are positive toward the x direction and the angle of attack is measured in a clockwise direction the trihf platform comprises major elements of a spar buoy centre column with a low cg as well as a tlp taut mooring and to a minor extend some of the features of a semi submersible 2 4 precise mass calculations for trihf platform fig 6 a and b illustrate the precise mass calculations performed for the trihf platform using ansys static structural and aqwa respectively in fig 6 a the centre of mass and principal moment of inertia for each component of the fowt were set up discretely and then solved to provide a combined solution for centre of mass and principal moment of inertia the combined solution yielded a new position for the centre of mass at 0 0 19 25 m and a principal moment of inertia about the centre of mass 8 79e 09 8 78e 09 7 44e 08 kg m2 concerning the result for the hydrostatics centre of mass and principal moment of inertia as shown in fig 6 b the centre of mass moved slightly upwards toward the msl by 0 25 m a logical explanation to this transformation can be attributed to the inclusion of the internal ballast tank in the model 3 rigid body coupled dynamics and numerical simulation strategy 3 1 governing equation and boundary conditions for wave structure interaction the potential code used to derive the platform motions facilitates boundary element method bem basic assumptions are the use of linear wave theory and linear system behaviour linear wave theory adopts continuity for an ideal fluid combined with the definition of a potential flow any solution for the potential φ must satisfy the well known laplace eq 1 1 2 φ 0 to be able to solve the laplace eq the propagation of waves is reduced to a two dimensional problem additionally several boundary conditions need to be established which are the bottom boundary condition the kinematic boundary condition the dynamic boundary condition as well as the fact that the seabed is parallel to the still water level solving for the wave potential yields 2 φ o i g a ω cosh k z d sinh k d e i k x ω t or φ o i g a ω e k z e i k x ω t for deep water where a is the wave amplitude z the water depth and ω the angular wave frequency following from the potential the wave properties e g water

radiation cannot be neglected in this case φ 0 φ d and φ r represent independent potentials for the incident wave wave scattering and wave radiation the linear superposition of these potentials forms the excitation for the wave structure interaction problem physically wave radiation is caused by the structure s movement the incident wave transfers energy into the structure causing motions in 6 dof respectively in turn the structure s motion transfer energy back into the water generating radiating waves within potential theory codes such as aqwa the energy transfer from structure to wave is consider as potential damping however these codes cannot take into account any viscous effects such as shear stresses along the wetted surface and turbulence hence potential codes generally underestimate the total damping and in return overestimate the system response especially for those waves that have their frequencies close to the natural frequencies of the structure 3 2 governing equations and boundary conditions for viscous damping investigation for correctly estimating the structure s response viscous damping is crucial once determined the results derived using potential theory can be enhanced by incorporating the viscous damping this way an overestimation of motions especially close to the structure s natural frequencies can be corrected to determine the viscous damping this research focuses on investigating the total damping coefficients for the coupled heave roll pitch motion simulating a free oscillation decay test the strategy here will be to first determine the potential damping coefficients using the potential theory solver and then theoretically calculate the total damping employing the exponential decay derived from the simulated free oscillation this yields the total damping coefficients for heave b 33 roll b 44 and pitch b 55 as 6 b 33 t o t a l 2 ς 33 m m a 33 c 33 7 b 44 t o t a l 2 ς 44 i 44 i a 44 c 44 8 b 55 t o t a l 2 ς 55 i 55 i a 55 c 55 where i 44 and i 55 are the moments of inertia about the roll and pitch axis respectively similarly i a 44 and i a 55 are the added moment of inertia about the roll and pitch axis respectively m is the total mass of the structure while m a is the added mass and c is the restoring coefficient of the structure most importantly ς i j is the non dimensional total damping this is derived from the exponential decay of the free oscillation at the structure s natural frequency as proposed by journee and massie journée and massie 2001 9 b ω 0 2 c ς i j 1 2 π l n ϑ o ϑ 1 ϑ 2 ϑ 3 1

studies investigated the heave motion of a circular cylinder with dual damping plates where the viscous damping coefficients for heave roll and pitch motion were obtained using these expressions 10 b

heave roll and pitch motion respectively c 33 c 44 and c 55 are the restoring force moment coefficients b 33 r ω 0 33 b 44 r ω 0 44 and b 55 r ω 0 55 are the radiation damping coefficients at the

model set up boundary conditions and pre processing strategies a three dimensional dynamic fluid body interaction dfbi physics continuum with overset meshing strategy is employed in performing the numerical simulation for the free decay test of the trihf the cae toolkit used in this instance is star ccm the volume of fluid vof wave solver with eulerian multiphase air and water is employed to capture the free surface the k ε turbulence model with the realisable k ε two layer all y treatment is initiated to adequately capture the viscous flow conditions around the trihf to reduce the computational effort only the floating platform s body is used in performing the free decay test however the mass centre of mass and moments of inertia used in performing the numerical simulation are those of the complete assemblage the size of the domain is set to 300 m in depth below the free surface zone to avoid the development of reverse flow from the boundaries of the domain during the simulation the floating platform is placed at the centre of the domain and the length and width of the domain were geometricized to 600 m and 400 m respectively fig 8 illustrates the boundary conditions for the flow domain and the section plane of the meshing scheme adopted for the simulation the overlap mesh region acts as an interface that couples the region containing the rigid body and the background region which mimics the environment an implicit unsteady state physics continuum is initiated for the regions of interests background and overset due the presence of eulerian multiphase fluids in different phases the effect of gravity acting on both is modelled using the gravity model also the grid around the trihf and the water air interface i e the free surface region is refined to capture the relevant flow details fig 9 shows scenes from cut planes during the initialisation after generating the mesh the trihf is given an initial displacement and orientations of 5 m 5 and 5 along the heave axis and around the roll and pitch axis respectively the initial displacements has to be large enough to allow for at least 3 peaks in the response signals 4 2 results fig 10 highlights the free decay curves of the trihf the platform line of symmetry is along the x axis which is defined as the roll axis although the platform is not symmetrical along the pitch axis y axis the response signals for roll and pitch motion are almost identical as shown in fig 10 a with regards to heave motion an additional 1 dof free decay test is done to check if roll and pitch motion have any substantial effect on the heave response see fig 10 b a comparison shows no significant discrepancy fig 11 and fig 12 contain the scenes of swl iso surface distribution vorticity distribution and absolute pressure distribution along the surface of the floating platform for a 1 dof heave motion free decay test and coupled heave roll pitch free decay test respectively table 5 highlights the calculated non dimensional total damping coefficients ς i j 5 discussion and comparison fig 10 shows the decay as it occurs during the simulated free decay test described in section 4 as a result the non dimensional damping coefficient for heave is ς 33 0 2781 for roll ς 44 0 1071 and for pitch ς 55 0 099 ς 44 and ς 55 deviate by only 8 2 as can be expected by directly comparing roll and pitch oscillations as presented in fig 10 the corresponding damping coefficients are b 33 t o t a l 10 50 10 6 k g s for heave b 44 t o t a l 28 63 10 6 k g m 2 s for roll and b 55 t o t a l 26 47 10 6 k g m 2 s for pitch in relation to that the radiation damping for heave as calculated using potential theory is b 33 r ω 0 33 0 03 10 6 k g s 0 3 of the total damping this is an intriguing observation as the ensuing negative potential damping for heave suggests an additional source of forcing or excitation different from the incident wave excitation rather than damping of the motion effects like this can be a result of vortex shedding that happens close to or at the natural frequency of motion however this would require current induced vortices which are not part of the potential theory calculations at this stage of the research no obvious explanation can be given hence the authors will investigate this matter in detail at a later stage consequently with total damping being the sum of potential and viscous damping the viscous damping for heave comprises to b 33 10 53 10 6 k g s or 100 3 of the total damping as for roll the radiation damping is b 44 r ω 0 44 5 38 10 6 k g m 2 s hence 18 8 of the total damping thus the viscous damping for the pitch motion is b 44 23 25 10 6 k g m 2 s or 81 2 of the total damping the situation for pitch deviates slightly off that from roll b 55 r ω 0 44 5 38 10 6 k g m 2 s hence 20 3 of the total damping with b 55 21 06 10 6 k g m 2 s or 79 7 of the total damping this clearly shows that viscous damping is an effect that cannot be neglected when hydrodynamically analysing the trihf as it is at least four times as high as the potential damping for all three cases viscous damping will notably reduce the magnitude of the harmonic response whilst simultaneously reducing the natural frequency increases the natural period not taking it into account will result in a disproportional overestimation of responses to wave excitations near the natural frequencies to put the results derived for the trihf into perspective they are compared to experimental results for another fowt design as illustrated in fig 13 coulling et al 2013 and robertson et al robertsonet al 2017 10 performed model experiments to validate the global dynamic performance of the deepcwind floating semi submersible under a project funded by the international energy agency iea research for wind energy coulling et al s oc4 1 1 offshore code comparison collaboration continuation oc4 project was a model experimentation performed at the maritime research institute netherlands marin wave basin while robertson et al s oc5 2 2 offshore code comparison collaboration continued with correlation oc5 project was a revision of the oc4 project two years later both projects also utilised the nrel 5 mw wind turbine system for their case study one of the experiments carried out in the oc5 project involved performing a free decay test to compare the eigenfrequencies and damping of the fowt structure for all 6dof as can be observed by comparing both designs see figs 4 and 13 and table 6 the trihf and the deepcwind structure are similar in size however there are differences in draft water depth and other properties such as restoring coefficients where the trihf features 10 times higher stiffness for heave roll and pitch respectively most obviously the trfihf features a different waterplane area prone to create significant turbulence and corresponding viscous damping effects also the deepcwind platform facilitates a spread hence a rather soft mooring allowing for large motions with regards to sway and surge consequently pitch roll and heave are also not as restricted as for a taut mooring featured as part of the trihf design fig 14 indicates a comparison of the damping effects and natural periods between the current study trihf and the deepcwind semi submersible as can be observed from fig 14 the non dimensional total damping ratios differ only slightly from that of the deepcwind platform however the total damping of the trihf for heave roll and pitch alike is by a magnitude higher than that of the deepcwind this can be attributed to the additional stiffness of the trihf offered by the taut leg mooring line the largely bigger stiffness of the trihf see table 6 also significantly increases the natural frequencies reducing the natural periods as compared to the deepcwind in addition the viscous damping also causes a slight shift of all three the natural periods towards longer periods see fig 14 right although the trihf is significantly stiffer it operates well off the peak periods of the design sea state as presented in table 7 which start at 17 5 s for operational power production regimes and move up for more extreme design sea states however larger accelerations due to the higher natural frequencies e g at the top of the tower nacelle need a careful investigation credit authorship
