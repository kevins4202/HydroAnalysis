12205,in order to better understand the encroachment of seawater into the groundwater system a total 115 groundwater samples were collected in an area of 7 km2 in cox s bazar paleobeach and its vicinity from different types of tubewells which included hand pump fitted bore wells 50 m depth moderately deep energized bore wells 50 m 100 m depth and deep bore wells 100 m depth during june 2013 a combined hydro geochemical indicators selected trace elements sr and b and in addition to δ18o and δ2h were used in this study results show that the high values of ec 202 μs cm to 6730 μs cm and tds 135 mg l to 4509 mg l are found in groundwater of wells closer to the coast and few wells from the northern and central part of the study area the cross plot of hco3 cl and tds shows that groundwater along the paleobeach and some isolated areas are saline with tds 1000 mg l associated with high ratios of cl tds 0 065 the groundwater facies generally evolves from freshwater ca mg hco3 to saline water na cl type with an intermediate ca mg cl type indicating that the aquifer system interacts with seawater and undergoes cation exchange results also reveal that the area affected by marine water intrusion has ionic ratios of br cl 0 0006 0 0021 similar to seawater 0 0015 with some higher values groundwaters along the paleobeach and some isolated areas low ionic ratios of so4 cl 0 01 6 53 and na cl 0 20 152 09 relative to marine ratios 0 05 and 0 86 respectively are also observed groundwaters with seawater mixing index 1 0 and tds 1000 mg l constitute about 20 of the studied groundwaters and have relatively high δ 18o 4 0 values and the linear relationships between tds and most of the ions including b and sr and the chemical signature of the saline plumes e g marine so4 cl na cl and br cl ratios suggest that mixing processes control the chemical composition of the seawater within the aquifers however these geochemical variations also reveal that the quality of potable water has deteriorated to a large extent due to seawater intrusion along the paleobeach migrating inland toward the heavily groundwater exploited areas from the coast line and may entail various future health hazards graphical abstract image 1 keywords cox s bazar paleobeach coastal groundwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction the cox s bazar city is considered as one of the most popular tourist destinations in bangladesh and is famous for tourism over 1 000 000 tourists visit each year personal communications cox s bazar municipality due to its pleasant climate and geographic location it is one of the most densely populated 50 000 inhabitants km2 rapidly growing coastal cities in bangladesh located along the shoreline of bay of bengal has been taken up for the present study the town of cox s bazar and its surrounding areas depend on the groundwater and today because of the saltwater intrusion and pollution with trace elements i e mn b fe and radioactive heavy metals i e u th seddique et al 2016 2013 the government plans to bring water from a dam which will be built at bakkhali river about 10 km away from town and making also a desalination plant the economy of the region depends to a large extent on the availability of fresh water so that seawater intrusion and salinization could endanger the economic future of the region thereafter coastal groundwater aquifer is the most important water resources in cox s bazar supplying 90 of the water consumption and the demand for fresh groundwater has increased over the years and in many cases the abstractions have led to aquifer overexploitation especially during dry season cox s bazar city aquifers are reported to have been subjected to the influence of marine water due to increased anthropogenic pressure and the salinity of groundwater in the study area has increased as well as saline plumes have formed in its central region seddique et al 2013 as a result risk of saline water intrusion has been increasing significantly over the last few years in the prime tourist resort of bangladesh and there are some anecdotal evidences of sea water intrusions in cox s bazar town seddique et al 2013 the degree of seawater intrusion i e the movement of salt water into a freshwater aquifer in an aquifer depends upon the amount of recharge discharge of groundwater the groundwater level the distance between the aquifer and sources of salt water and drainage channels and its geological structure kumar 2006 kumar et al 2015 it is often associated with over pumping in coastal regions resulting in overdraft conditions and creating an inland gradient of seawater moujabber et al 2006 somay and gemici 2009 and reference therein in recent years a number of studies have been carried out across the globe and a number of different methodologies e g geochemical and isotopic have been used to identify the origin of salinity especially for tracing the evidence of seawater intrusion through an aquifer in coastal belts as well as to better understand the sources of groundwater recharge thickness and spatial distributions of fresh or brackish water kim et al 2003a 2003b park et al 2005 eissa et al 2013 nair et al 2015 park et al 2005 reported that over 21 of the shallow groundwater along the western coast of korea was affected by the salinization process and that seawater intrusion was present in groundwater about 6 km towards the land so far we know no detailed study has been done to investigate the hydrochemical behavior of groundwater aquifers for tracing the origin of seawater in the cox s bazar coastal groundwater aquifers for this purpose we have performed a combined hydro geochemical seawater intrusion indicators such as ec tds ionic ratios of hco3 cl so4 cl na cl br cl cl tds selected trace elements sr and b and in addition to stable isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h were used to understand the encroachment and extent of seawater into the groundwater system of cox s bazar paleobeach and its surrounding areas and to evaluate the possible future impact on groundwater aquifers due to over exploitation of groundwater in the study area 1 1 area of investigation the study area is located along the coast of bay of bengal and lies between 21 20 to 21 30 n in latitudes and between 91 57 to 92 4 e in longitudes fig 1 covering cox s bazar municipality and its adjacent areas the total investigated area is about 7 km2 encompassing the foredune i e the area of the present beach including the recent sand dunes backdune i e the paleobeach sand dunes aligned parallel to the present coastline and south eastern part of hill ranges the area is bounded in north and east by moheskhali channel and bakkhali river and in the west by the bay of bengal to the east and the southern boundary of the area along the beach is characterized by neogene low hill ranges that rise to elevations of about 30 m 45 m with the maximum of 50 m above mean sea level amsl the western and northern sides of the area are characterized as foredunes and paleobeach areas with an average elevation varies between 1 m and 9 m amsl the regional gradient is towards the western side the slope is gentle in the northeastern and central part and nearly flat in the south western boundary along the paleobeach of the area the bakkhali river is a non perennial and normally flows only for a few days during south east monsoon period i e june to october that starts from the south eastern hills of mizoram flows across the coastal hills and terraces and empty into the moheskhali channel which carries saline backwater it is generally observed that after the monsoon due to the high tide in the bay of bengal the saline water enters the river and these backwaters extend towards the inland the study area is also drained by a network of streamlets originating from the hilly areas which are locally known as chara oriented in the northeast southwest direction which are of ephemeral in nature most of its water comes from precipitation and are connected with bakkhali river according to the previous studies by seddique et al 2013 the detailed landuse map based on quickbird image of 2011 showed that the main landuse was settlement 49 25 agricultural 21 30 water bodies 5 03 marshy land 4 91 forest including hill and mangrove forest 8 38 and others including airport road gher salt pan etc 11 14 due to the rapid urban sprawl the agricultural land has a net decrease of 61 46 settlement has increased by 245 64 and water bodies have decreased 63 41 seddique et al 2013 the subsurface stratigraphy at the foredunes and paleobeach areas consists of unconsolidated sedimentary formations of about 5 m 265 m thick deposition of fine to medium size sands to form the groundwater aquifers with small patches of silty clay and alluvium of quaternary age the top unsaturated surface unit 0 2 5 m thick of silty clay and very fine sand covers throughout the foredunes and paleobeach areas except smaller portion of western part of the study area the natural levees and swamps of the floodplain are widely distributed in the eastern part of the area very hard and compact bokabil sediments i e sandstone and shale and tipam sandstone reddish brown oxidized fine to coarse sand sediments of miocene age underlie the quaternary alluvial sediments throughout the foredunes and paleobeach areas and leaving it behind the beach areas as eroded remnants of the neogene hills which is aligned parallel to the present coastline fig 2 alam et al 1999 noted that the width of the present beach varies with time and place and ranges from 100 m during the rainy season to 300 m during the dry season and slopes gradually towards the sea from 4 to 6 and rises at its eastern boundary to about 4 m 5 m amsl kibria et al 2000 the distance between the coast line and the base of coastal cliff at laboni point is 600 m and decrease southward the paleobeach area now it is also called hotel motel zone represented the actual sea beach about 5000 years ago monsur and kamal 1994 seddique et al 2016 documented the detailed lithology and structure of the aquifers of foredunes and paleobeach areas and discussed the geochemical characteristics of the radioactive heavy metals and trace elements enriched groundwater according to continuous core drilling data and based on electrical resistivity survey i e vertical electrical sounding ves along the foredunes and paleobeach areas deciphered six hydrostratigraphic units having three major aquifers i e upper 50 m depth middle 50 m 100 m depth and lower aquifers 100 m depth at 265 m depth sediment hosted by quaternary deposits seddique et al 2016 physiographically the eastern and southern boundary regions are undulating with hilly and valley areas the occurrence of groundwater in the valley areas is also largely controlled by the weathered zones up to 10 m thick depending on the topography of tipam sandstone seddique et al 2016 also reported that the upper sand unit of the holocene deposits composed of fine to medium sand holds the unconfined aquifer and that the middle mud unit 5 m 20 m thick works as an aquitard separating this unconfined aquifer from the semi confined aquifer 15 m 50 m thick composed of fine to medium sand this unit is underlain by aquitard with a thickness varying from 5 m to 12 m which separated the lower confined aquifer 44 m thick which is composed of fine to medium sand the deepest identified zone acts as aquitard having a maximum thickness of 22 m this area has been extensively utilizing pumped water from the underlying aquifers to meet the demand for thousands of tourists along with domestic aquaculture and agricultural water supplies have been developed in this relatively small area most of these wells tap groundwater from the shallow holocene aquifers the area experiences tropical climatic conditions high temperature heavy rainfall generally excessive humidity and distinct seasonal variations the annual average temperature in cox s bazar remains at about a maximum of 34 8 c and a minimum of 16 1 c mean temperature ranges from a minimum of 11 c to a maximum of 29 c in the winter november february and from a minimum of 21 c to a maximum of 34 c in the summer april september evaporation rate ranges from 70 mm to 90 mm in the winter to 180 mm in the dry period the average annual rainfall of this region is 42 857 mm and the rains come from the south east monsoon usually in may to october the heavy rainfall during the monsoon period together with runoff of streamlets locally known as chara originating from the hilly areas recharges the groundwater of the study area seddique et al 2016 noted that groundwater levels show significant seasonal variation that of the upper and middle aquifer lies within 5 m of the ground surface in the dry season whereas during the rainy season it rises rapidly to 1 m the groundwater level of the lower aquifer lies within 18 m of the ground surface in the dry season whereas during the rainy season it becomes 8 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analytical techniques a total of 115 groundwater samples were collected in pre monsoon were collected in june 2013 within about 7 km2 area from the different depths of cox s bazar paleobeach and eroded valleys of neogene hilly areas covering the major part of the study area locations of the sampling wells were determined using a portable gps receiver with an error limit of 10m fig 1 shows the location of sampling sites on the map the selection of sampling sites was based on the local hydrogeological and geological conditions the groundwater samples were collected from different types of tubewells which include hand pump fitted bore wells 50 m depth moderately deep energized bore wells 50 m 100 m depth and deep bore wells 100 m depth temperature ph eh and ec of the water samples were measured in the field using portable instruments groundwater was sampled preserved and treated in the field based on seddique et al 2016 alkalinity co2 2 hco3 was determined in non acidified and filtered water by titration method major cations and trace elements were analyzed using an icp ms icp ms spq 9700 sii nanotechnologies with precision of 5 using standard methods for analyses of the major cations k na ca2 mg2 and trace elements e g b sr groundwater was collected through 0 45 μm syringe filters and acidified with hno3 until the solution ph becomes lower than 2 for analyses of the major anions cl br no3 so4 2 groundwater was also sampled through 0 45 μm syringe filters without acidification and then analyzed by an ion chromatography ic dionex dx120 with precision of 3 depending on concentration oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h stable isotopic composition were measured on unacidified filtered 0 22 μm samples using a mass spectrometer thermoquest finnigan deltaplusxl at the research institute for humanity and nature japan the results expressed in per mil relative to the international vsmow with an accuracy of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h 2 2 calculation of seawater mixing index smi seawater mixing index smi was initially developed by park et al 2005 based on the four major ions such as na cl mg and so4 2 to study the mixing behavior of seawater and groundwater however in this paper for quantitative estimation of the relative degree of seawater mixing in certain water we adopted a parameter called smi this parameter was based on park et al 2005 and smi can be measured using the following eq 1 1 smi a c na t na b c mg t mg c c cl t cl d c s o 4 t s o 4 where constants a b c and d denote the relative concentration proportion of na mg cl and so4 a 0 31 b 0 04 c 0 57 and d 0 08 in seawater respectively c is the calculated concentration of groundwater samples in mg l and t represents the calculated regional threshold values of selected ions in groundwater samples which can be estimated from the interpretation of cumulative probability curves if the calculated smi value is greater than 1 the water may be considered to obviously record the effect of seawater mixing park et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variations and evolution of groundwater quality the physical parameters and chemical and isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen 115 groundwater samples from the selected tubewells and one seawater sample are presented in tables s1 and s2 see appendix supplementary tables 1 and 2 respectively the typical major ion concentrations of seawater goldberg et al 1971 are provided as end member values previous researchers e g sung wook jeen et al 2001 mondal et al 2010 have revealed that the degree of salinization due to seawater intrusion in a tubewell or a given area could be indicated by an increase in electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and possibly an increase in nearly all major ions in particular ec tds na and cl concentrations of groundwater in the present study varied greatly the spatial variations of ec tds na and cl content are shown in fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b respectively the ec values of the groundwater ranged from 202 μs cm to 6730 μs cm this result indicates a wide range of water quality varying from fresh to saline water mondal et al 2010 2008 saxena et al 2004 kim et al 2003a also reported that in the coastal areas groundwater with ec greater than 5000 μs cm is considered as affected by seawater intrusion tds also shows a wide variation from 135 to 4509 mg l as calculated from the ec values thereafter the safe limit of ec and tds in the drinking water samples are considered to be 600 μs cm to 1000 μs cm and 1000 mg l respectively who 2011 as shown in fig 3a and b the groundwater in the topographically hilly area has relatively low ec and tds concentrations than the surrounding seashore area it is also clear that the higher values of ec 1000 μs cm and tds 1000 mg l observed in the northern and western parts in particular close to the moheskhali channel bakkhali river and along the shoreline of bay of bengal are more affected this may indicate the possibility of a high rate of seawater intrusion in the paleobeach areas where a high rate of withdrawal of groundwater was observed and also landuse pattern has changed significantly where the rapid expansion of settlement area over the last twenty years seddique et al 2013 thereafter according to the robinove et al 1958 salinity classification groundwaters were classified into freshwater tds 1000 mg l slightly saline tds 1000 mg l to 3000 mg l moderately saline tds 3000 mg l to 10 000 mg l based on this pattern of classification 20 of the sampled groundwaters are found slightly saline to moderately saline see supplementary table 1 it indicates that groundwater composition in the quaternary shallow aquifer was largely influenced by seawater intrusion a number of researchers observed that na and cl are the dominant ions of seawater and the high levels of na and cl concentrations in coastal groundwater may indicates a significant effect of seawater mixing whereas the concentration variations of other elements are frequently ignored because of their transformation and modification due to interactions with aquifer materials kumar 2014 mondal et al 2008 park et al 2005 stoessell et al 1997 hem 1989 the cl concentration of the groundwater samples ranges from 2 95 mg l to 2940 1 mg l consequently the concentration of na in the groundwater ranges from 2 3 mg l to 1098 1 mg l this result suggest that majority of the groundwater samples have an elevated levels of cl and na exceeded the drinking water guideline value of 250 mg l for cl and of 200 mg l for na who 2011 the spatial distribution of na and cl as shown in fig 4a and b respectively and shows that the changes in the content of na and cl have concurrent increases of ec and tds values however the distribution of these ions indicated the increased salinity in the northern and western parts of the study area is very observable and also shows a diagnostic sign of seawater intrusion into drilled wells evaluation of groundwater facies is evident from the water chemistry data table s2 using a piper diagram fig 5 indicate a wide range of water types ranging from freshwater ca mg hco3 type through an intermediate ca mg cl type to saline water na cl type which clearly indicates that the groundwater aquifer system in the study area interacts with seawater and undergoes cation exchange piper 1953 gimenez forcada 2010 kumar 2014 the changes in chemical composition of fresh groundwater are caused by mixing as well as by chemical reactions such as ion exchange processes bivariate diagrams of major ions na k mg and so4 vs cl are presented in order to separate mixing mechanisms of fresh water and saline water from chemical reactions fig 6 in general most ions are positively correlated with cl and especially na mg and so4 show a strong correlation with cl indicating that such ions are derived from the same source of saline waters the relationship between cl hco3 ratio and cl also shows mixing of groundwaters and seawater and the samples with lower ratios can be characterized as fresh waters fig 6e in the case of cl vs tds a good linear relationship is observed see fig 6f which suggests that both of them are mainly from a single source and the possibility of hydrochemical processes such as seawater intrusions and dilution with fresh groundwater have been taken place simultaneously at various palaces in the region 3 2 geochemical ionic ratios and evidence of seawater influence ionic ratios are commonly used to evaluate the seawater intrusion and the source and nature of the salinity present in the coastal aquifers andreasen and fleck 1997 kim et al 2003a vengosh et al 1999 2003 moujabber et al 2006 and references therein in the present study hco3 cl so4 cl na cl and br cl are used to delineate the region affected by seawater intrusion ionic ratios of hco3 cl so4 cl br cl and na cl of the studied groundwater ranges from 0 02 to 47 36 0 01 to 7 92 0 0005 to 0 0036 and 0 20 to 14 29 respectively the groundwaters within the paleobeach and at the central and northern part of the study area e g kalatoli holiday point kurushkhul indicate high ratio of br cl 0 00154 similar to seawater 0 0015 along with higher values and low ionic ratios of hco3 cl 1 00 so4 cl 0 05 and na cl 0 86 fig 7 a d as compared to the marine ratios 1 00 0 05 and 0 86 respectively are observed these geochemical variations characterize seawater mixing vengosh 2003 isawi et al 2016 and thus suggest that seawater intrusion is the predominant source for groundwater salinization in these areas this result is reinforced also by isotopic evidences see section isotopic characteristics the bivariate plot of hco3 cl versus tds shows that the regression slope is negative in the high 1000 mg l tds concentration range while the slope is positive tendency in the low 1000 mg l tds concentration range fig 8 a it indicates that about 22 analyzed samples are saline with hco3 cl molar ratios of 1 0 and tds concentration of 1000 mg l this result indicating that groundwaters with high tds concentration are enriched in cl and such ions derived from mixing with seawater which acts the main source of solutes in groundwater salinization and that groundwaters with low tds concentration are not affected or less affected by seawater the br to cl concentration ratio is also used to estimate the degree of groundwater salinization by seawater intrusion in general the degree of groundwater salinization by seawater intrusion leads to an increase in cl concentration and accordingly the br cl ratio decreases mercado 1985 richter and kreitler 1993 this representative feature is also shown in fig 7 which shows the changes of the br cl ratio versus cl concentrations the higher positive relationship r 0 998 between the conservative ions br and cl fig 8b and their marine ratio fig 7c supports a seawater intrusion source for these waters which are located along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area e g kalatoli holiday point kurushkhul where a high rate of withdrawal of groundwater was observed and also landuse pattern has changed significantly seddique et al 2013 3 3 b and sr contents and identification of seawater intrusion the selected trace elements i e b and sr concentration in the studied samples ranged from 0 01 mg l to 0 97 mg l and 0 10 mg l to 24 94 mg l respectively in general the b and sr concentrations are low in fresh groundwater but high in brackish and saline waters mondal et al 2010 saxena et al 2004 b and sr of groundwater reveal good correlations with tds values fig 9 it is also observed that seawater intrusion is more in the central part and northern and western part of the study area where the groundwater also content relatively high values of tds ec na and cl as well see fig 3a and b and fig 4a and b thereafter the effects of seawater intrusion are less in the southern and eastern parts of the area close to kalatoli and link road regions this suggests that the aquifer system was under interaction with seawater and that the source of b and sr content may be linked solely to marine in origin 3 4 identification of groundwater origin by δ18o and δ2h analyses the stable isotopes of oxygen δ 18o and hydrogen δ 2h values can provide information on precipitation evaporated surface water and seawater sources and thus can help to identify the origins of groundwater salinity values of δ18o and δ 2h were used to understand the mixing of seawater with the groundwater in the many parts of the world gaye 2001 kim et al 2003a and references therein however the δ 18o and δ 2h values are used to determine the origin of the groundwater in the study area data provided by majumder et al 2011 show that long term weighted mean values of δ 18o and δ 2h of the rainfall in savar which is located in the central part of bangladesh are 4 1 to 21 respectively from a study conducted by majumder et al 2011 which included measurements of δ 18o and δ 2h of the rainfall in savar station 1000 amsl which is located in the central part of bangladesh we defined the local meteoric water line lmwl based on the following equation δ 2h 7 7 δ 18o 10 7 that is representative of the studied area the δ 2h verses δ 18o relationship for all water samples is also defined in relation with global meteoric water line gmwl given by the following equation δ 2h 8δ 18o 10 craig 1961 table s1 shows the analysis results of the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic compositions of groundwater and seawater of the study area the typical δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values of seawater goldberg et al 1971 are provided as end member values the isotopic composition of the studied groundwater shows a wide range of δ 18o values 6 2 to 2 7 and the δ 2h values 38 9 to 8 9 all ranges are in accordance with values given by majumder et al 2011 stable isotope measurements in water are plotted in a classical δ 18o vs δ2h diagram fig 10 a fig 10a shows that the most groundwater samples plot between the local and the global meteoric line s reflecting a meteoric origin for the water without any major transformation e g evaporation this suggests that transfer from rainfall towards groundwater storage through soil and non saturated zone is fast and that post precipitation evaporation during the passage in soil is not an active processes in comparison with other groundwater samples 22 out of 105 the samples wells with depth 25 m and including one sample with depth 100 m are distinctly enriched in their stable isotope compositions and deviate significantly from the lmwl and gmwl fig 10a these groundwater samples are characterized by relatively high δ 18o 4 7 values plot along a line having a slope of 6 23 that is a slope considerably lower than that of the lmwl 7 7 suggesting that the enrichment can be attributed to the mixing of groundwater and seawater and or the influence of evaporation kim et al 2003a vengosh et al 1999 fig 10b shows the relationship between the δ18o values of groundwater and well depth and also shows that shallow depth of tubewells water 100 m depth δ18o values show a progressively enrichment trend with relatively high values 4 7 suggesting that these groundwater can be attributed to the influence of seawater vengosh et al 1999 3 5 evaluation of groundwater salinity using seawater mixing index smi hydrochemical data were used to estimate an index called smi which evaluates the relative mixing of seawater with groundwater into the study area the probability distribution curves have great importance in dealing with the interpretation of geochemical data and the discrimination of processes affecting groundwater chemistry shaw 1961 sinclair 1974 1976 fig 9 shows that results of the interpretation of cumulative probability curves for chosen hydrochemical parameters cl na mg so4 the inflection points in the cumulative probability plots are estimated according to the distribution probability curves and can be considered as regional threshold values t for the respective ion for differentiating the samples with the effect of seawater mixing in the study area mondal et al 2010 kumar 2014 in this study two threshold values obtained by these plots the approximate threshold values for inflection point 1and 2 for different ions are na 110 mg l and 286 mg l cl 146 mg l and 504 mg l so4 62 mg l and 160 mg l and mg 48 mg l and 83 mg l respectively fig 11 a d since our aim was to obtain the natural background level in groundwater the upper value i e inflection point 2 obtained from this plot is very high and even exceeded the drinking water standards who 2011 thereafter the lower values i e inflection point 1 obtained of these ions is more realist for the background level and therefore used in the calculation of smi based on the concentrations mg l of na mg cl and so4 in each sample c regional approximate threshold t values and the calculated a b c and d constant factors the swmi can be calculated for each individual well using equation 1 fig 12 shows the relationship of smi and tds values based on the smi results there are three groundwater types in the study area the smi values show that almost all of the type 1 waters have smi values smaller than 1 while the type 2 and type 3 waters have values larger than 1 therefore at least 19 waters belonging to type 2 and type 3 corresponding to about 22 of the analyzed tubewell waters can be considered to be significantly affected by the mixing of seawater components park et al 2005 mondal et al 2010 these wells are located along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area e g holiday point kurushkhul nuniarchar laboni point and kalatoli point which is evident from the spatial distribution of smi fig 13 4 conclusion the integrated data presented in this study suggest that the groundwater in the cox s bazar town and its surrounding areas did not originate only from modern recharge in addition the geochemical variations also revealed large water quality differentiation with high quality water in the southern part of the area relative to highly saline water in the northern western and central parts given the weakness of recent replenishment we predict that continued exploitation of the groundwater in this area could further increase the salinization of the water resources particularly in areas with low hydraulic gradient and intensive water abstraction has been occurring without considering safe yield in contrast we argued that the heavily exploited shallow aquifer along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area is more vulnerable given the relatively high longer residence time e g δ 18o 4 0 of the water ionic changes sweater mixing index and sensitive trace elements of groundwater provide diagnostic tools that trace the different hydrochemical processes and seawater intrusion in cox s bazar coastal aquifers our results also represent a base for future hydrochemical work that will help in the planning

12205,in order to better understand the encroachment of seawater into the groundwater system a total 115 groundwater samples were collected in an area of 7 km2 in cox s bazar paleobeach and its vicinity from different types of tubewells which included hand pump fitted bore wells 50 m depth moderately deep energized bore wells 50 m 100 m depth and deep bore wells 100 m depth during june 2013 a combined hydro geochemical indicators selected trace elements sr and b and in addition to δ18o and δ2h were used in this study results show that the high values of ec 202 μs cm to 6730 μs cm and tds 135 mg l to 4509 mg l are found in groundwater of wells closer to the coast and few wells from the northern and central part of the study area the cross plot of hco3 cl and tds shows that groundwater along the paleobeach and some isolated areas are saline with tds 1000 mg l associated with high ratios of cl tds 0 065 the groundwater facies generally evolves from freshwater ca mg hco3 to saline water na cl type with an intermediate ca mg cl type indicating that the aquifer system interacts with seawater and undergoes cation exchange results also reveal that the area affected by marine water

na cl 0 20 152 09 relative to marine ratios 0 05 and 0 86 respectively are also observed groundwaters with seawater mixing index 1 0 and tds 1000 mg l constitute about 20 of the studied groundwaters and have relatively high δ 18o 4 0 values and the linear relationships between tds and most of the ions including b and sr and the chemical signature of the saline plumes e g marine so4 cl na cl and br cl ratios suggest that mixing processes control the chemical composition of the seawater within the aquifers however these geochemical variations also reveal that the quality of potable water has deteriorated to a large extent due to seawater intrusion along the paleobeach migrating inland toward the heavily groundwater exploited areas from the coast line and may entail various future health hazards graphical abstract image 1 keywords cox s bazar paleobeach coastal groundwater seawater intrusion 1 introduction the cox s bazar city is considered as one of the most popular tourist destinations in bangladesh and is famous for tourism over 1 000 000 tourists visit each year personal communications cox s bazar municipality due to its pleasant climate and geographic location it is one of the most densely populated 50 000 inhabitants km2 rapidly growing coastal cities in bangladesh located along the shoreline of bay of bengal has been taken up for the present study the town of cox s bazar and its surrounding areas depend on the groundwater and today because of the saltwater intrusion and pollution with trace elements i e mn b fe and radioactive heavy metals i e u th seddique et al 2016 2013 the government plans to bring water from a dam which will be built at bakkhali river about 10 km away from town and making also a desalination plant the economy of the region depends to a large extent on the availability of fresh water so that seawater intrusion and salinization could endanger the economic future of the region thereafter coastal groundwater aquifer is the most important water resources in cox s bazar supplying 90 of the water consumption and the demand for fresh groundwater has increased over the years and in many cases the abstractions have led to aquifer overexploitation especially during dry season cox s bazar city aquifers are reported to have been subjected to the influence of marine water due to increased anthropogenic pressure and the salinity of groundwater in the study area has increased as well as saline plumes have formed in its central region seddique et al 2013 as a result risk of saline water intrusion has been increasing significantly over the last few years in the prime tourist resort of bangladesh and there are some anecdotal evidences of sea water intrusions in cox s bazar town seddique et al 2013 the degree of seawater intrusion i e the movement of salt water into a freshwater aquifer in an aquifer depends upon the amount of recharge discharge of groundwater the groundwater level the distance between the aquifer and sources of salt water and drainage channels and its geological structure kumar 2006 kumar et al 2015 it is often associated with over pumping in coastal regions resulting in overdraft conditions and creating an inland gradient of seawater moujabber et al 2006 somay and gemici 2009 and reference therein in recent years a number of studies have been carried out across the globe and a number of different methodologies e g geochemical and isotopic have been used to identify the origin of salinity especially for tracing the evidence of seawater intrusion through an aquifer in coastal belts as well as to better understand the sources of groundwater recharge thickness and spatial distributions of fresh or brackish water kim et al 2003a 2003b park et al 2005 eissa et al 2013 nair et al 2015 park et al 2005 reported that over 21 of the shallow groundwater along the western coast of korea was affected by the salinization process and that seawater intrusion was present in groundwater about 6 km towards the land so far we know no detailed study has been done to investigate the hydrochemical behavior of groundwater aquifers for tracing the origin of seawater in the cox s bazar coastal groundwater aquifers for this purpose we have performed a combined hydro geochemical seawater intrusion indicators such as ec tds ionic ratios of hco3 cl so4 cl na cl br cl cl tds selected trace elements sr and b and in addition to stable isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h were used to understand the encroachment and extent of seawater into the groundwater system of cox s bazar paleobeach and its surrounding areas and to evaluate the possible future impact on groundwater aquifers due to over exploitation of groundwater in the study area 1 1 area of investigation the study area is located along the coast of bay of bengal and lies between 21 20 to 21 30 n in latitudes and between 91 57 to 92 4 e in longitudes fig 1 covering cox s bazar municipality and its adjacent areas the total investigated area is about 7 km2 encompassing the foredune i e the area of the present beach including the recent sand dunes backdune i e the paleobeach sand dunes aligned parallel to the present coastline and south eastern part of hill ranges the area is bounded in north and east by moheskhali channel and bakkhali river and in the west by the bay of bengal to the east and the southern boundary of the area along the beach is characterized by neogene low hill ranges that rise to elevations of about 30 m 45 m with the maximum of 50 m above mean sea level amsl the western and northern sides of the area are characterized as foredunes and paleobeach areas with an average elevation varies between 1 m and 9 m amsl the regional gradient is towards the western side the slope is gentle in the northeastern and central part and nearly flat in the south western boundary along the paleobeach of the area the bakkhali river is a non perennial and normally flows only for a few days during south east monsoon period i e june to october that starts from the south eastern hills of mizoram flows across the coastal hills and terraces and empty into the moheskhali channel which carries saline backwater it is generally observed that after the monsoon due to the high tide in the bay of bengal the saline water enters the river and these backwaters extend towards the inland the study area is also drained by a network of streamlets originating from the hilly areas which are locally known as chara oriented in the northeast southwest direction which are of ephemeral in nature most of its water comes from precipitation and are connected with bakkhali river according to the previous studies by seddique et al 2013 the detailed landuse map based on quickbird image of 2011 showed that the main landuse was settlement 49 25 agricultural 21 30 water bodies 5 03 marshy land 4 91 forest including hill and mangrove forest 8 38 and others including airport road gher salt pan etc 11 14 due to the rapid urban sprawl the agricultural land has a net decrease of 61 46 settlement has increased by 245 64 and water bodies have decreased 63 41 seddique et al 2013 the subsurface stratigraphy at the foredunes and paleobeach areas consists of unconsolidated sedimentary formations of about 5 m 265 m thick deposition of fine to medium size sands to form the groundwater aquifers with small patches of silty clay and alluvium of quaternary age the top unsaturated surface unit 0 2 5 m thick of silty clay and very fine sand covers throughout the foredunes and paleobeach areas except smaller portion of western part of the study area the natural levees and swamps of the floodplain are widely distributed in the eastern part of the area very hard and compact bokabil sediments i e sandstone and shale and tipam sandstone reddish brown oxidized fine to coarse sand sediments of miocene age underlie the quaternary alluvial sediments throughout the foredunes and paleobeach areas and leaving it behind the beach areas as eroded remnants of the neogene hills which is aligned parallel to the present coastline fig 2 alam et al 1999 noted that the width of the present beach varies with time and place and ranges from 100 m during the rainy season to 300 m during the dry season and slopes gradually towards the sea from 4 to 6 and rises at its eastern boundary to about 4 m 5 m amsl kibria et al 2000 the distance between the coast line and the base of coastal cliff at laboni point is 600 m and decrease southward the paleobeach area now it is also called hotel motel zone represented the actual sea beach about 5000 years ago monsur and kamal 1994 seddique et al 2016 documented the detailed lithology and structure of the aquifers of foredunes and paleobeach areas and discussed the geochemical characteristics of the radioactive heavy metals and trace elements enriched groundwater according to continuous core drilling data and based on electrical resistivity survey i e vertical electrical sounding ves along the foredunes and paleobeach areas deciphered six hydrostratigraphic units having three major aquifers i e upper 50 m depth middle 50 m 100 m depth and lower aquifers 100 m depth at 265 m depth sediment hosted by quaternary deposits seddique et al 2016 physiographically the eastern and southern boundary regions are undulating with hilly and valley areas the occurrence of groundwater in the valley areas is also largely controlled by the weathered zones up to 10 m thick depending on the topography of tipam sandstone seddique et al 2016 also reported that the upper sand unit of the holocene deposits composed of fine to medium sand holds the unconfined aquifer and that the middle mud unit 5 m 20 m thick works as an aquitard separating this unconfined aquifer from the semi confined aquifer 15 m 50 m thick composed of fine to medium sand this unit is underlain by aquitard with a thickness varying from 5 m to 12 m which separated the lower confined aquifer 44 m thick which is composed of fine to medium sand the deepest identified zone acts as aquitard having a maximum thickness of 22 m this area has been extensively utilizing pumped water from the underlying aquifers to meet the demand for thousands of tourists along with domestic aquaculture and agricultural water supplies have been developed in this relatively small area most of these wells tap groundwater from the shallow holocene aquifers the area experiences tropical climatic conditions high temperature heavy rainfall generally excessive humidity and distinct seasonal variations the annual average temperature in cox s bazar remains at about a maximum of 34 8 c and a minimum of 16 1 c mean temperature ranges from a minimum of 11 c to a maximum of 29 c in the winter november february and from a minimum of 21 c to a maximum of 34 c in the summer april september evaporation rate ranges from 70 mm to 90 mm in the winter to 180 mm in the dry period the average annual rainfall of this region is 42 857 mm and the rains come from the south east monsoon usually in may to october the heavy rainfall during the monsoon period together with runoff of streamlets locally known as chara originating from the hilly areas recharges the groundwater of the study area seddique et al 2016 noted that groundwater levels show significant seasonal variation that of the upper and middle aquifer lies within 5 m of the ground surface in the dry season whereas during the rainy season it rises rapidly to 1 m the groundwater level of the lower aquifer lies within 18 m of the ground surface in the dry season whereas during the rainy season it becomes 8 m 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analytical techniques a total of 115 groundwater samples were collected in pre monsoon were collected in june 2013 within about 7 km2 area from the different depths of cox s bazar paleobeach and eroded valleys of neogene hilly areas covering the major part of the study area locations of the sampling wells were determined using a portable gps receiver with an error limit of 10m fig 1 shows the location of sampling sites on the map the selection of sampling sites was based on the local hydrogeological and geological conditions the groundwater samples were collected from different types of tubewells which include hand pump fitted bore wells 50 m depth moderately deep energized bore wells 50 m 100 m depth and deep bore wells 100 m depth temperature ph eh and ec of the water samples were measured in the field using portable instruments groundwater was sampled preserved and treated in the field based on seddique et al 2016 alkalinity co2 2 hco3 was determined in non acidified and filtered water by titration method major cations and trace elements were analyzed using an icp ms icp ms spq 9700 sii nanotechnologies with precision of 5 using standard methods for analyses of the major cations k na ca2 mg2 and trace elements e g b sr groundwater was collected through 0 45 μm syringe filters and acidified with hno3 until the solution ph becomes lower than 2 for analyses of the major anions cl br no3 so4 2 groundwater was also sampled through 0 45 μm syringe filters without acidification and then analyzed by an ion chromatography ic dionex dx120 with precision of 3 depending on concentration oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δ2h stable isotopic composition were measured on unacidified filtered 0 22 μm samples using a mass spectrometer thermoquest finnigan deltaplusxl at the research institute for humanity and nature japan the results expressed in per mil relative to the international vsmow with an accuracy of 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h 2 2 calculation of seawater mixing index smi seawater mixing index smi was initially developed by park et al 2005 based on the four major ions such as na cl mg and so4 2 to study the mixing behavior of seawater and groundwater however in this paper for quantitative estimation of the relative degree of seawater mixing in certain water we adopted a parameter called smi this parameter was based on park et al 2005 and smi can be measured using the following eq 1 1 smi a c na t na b c mg t mg c c cl t cl d c s o 4 t s o 4 where constants a b c and d denote the relative concentration proportion of na mg cl and so4 a 0 31 b 0 04 c 0 57 and d 0 08 in seawater respectively c is the calculated concentration of groundwater samples in mg l and t represents the calculated regional threshold values of selected ions in groundwater samples which can be estimated from the interpretation of cumulative probability curves if the calculated smi value is greater than 1 the water may be considered to obviously record the effect of seawater mixing park et al 2005 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial variations and evolution of groundwater quality the physical parameters and chemical and isotopic compositions of oxygen and hydrogen 115 groundwater samples from the selected tubewells and one seawater sample are presented in tables s1 and s2 see appendix supplementary tables 1 and 2 respectively the typical major ion concentrations of seawater goldberg et al 1971 are provided as end member values previous researchers e g sung wook jeen et al 2001 mondal et al 2010 have revealed that the degree of salinization due to seawater intrusion in a tubewell or a given area could be indicated by an increase in electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and possibly an increase in nearly all major ions in particular ec tds na and cl concentrations of groundwater in the present study varied greatly the spatial variations of ec tds na and cl content are shown in fig 3 a and b and fig 4 a and b respectively the ec values of the groundwater ranged from 202 μs cm to 6730 μs cm this result indicates a wide range of water quality varying from fresh to saline water mondal et al 2010 2008 saxena et al 2004 kim et al 2003a also reported that in the coastal areas groundwater with ec greater than 5000 μs cm is considered as affected by seawater intrusion tds also shows a wide variation from 135 to 4509 mg l as calculated from the ec values thereafter the safe limit of ec and tds in the drinking water samples are considered to be 600 μs cm to 1000 μs cm and 1000 mg l respectively who 2011 as shown in fig 3a and b the groundwater in the topographically hilly area has relatively low ec and tds concentrations than the surrounding seashore area it is also clear that the higher values of ec 1000 μs cm and tds 1000 mg l observed in the northern and western parts in particular close to the moheskhali channel bakkhali river and along the shoreline of bay of bengal are more affected this may indicate the possibility of a high rate of seawater intrusion in the paleobeach areas where a high rate of withdrawal of groundwater was observed and also landuse pattern has changed significantly where the rapid expansion of settlement area over the last twenty years seddique et al 2013 thereafter according to the robinove et al 1958 salinity classification groundwaters were classified into freshwater tds 1000 mg l slightly saline tds 1000 mg l to 3000 mg l moderately saline tds 3000 mg l to 10 000 mg l based on this pattern of classification 20 of the sampled groundwaters are found slightly saline to moderately saline see supplementary table 1 it indicates that groundwater composition in the quaternary shallow aquifer was largely influenced by seawater intrusion a number of researchers observed that na and cl are the dominant ions of seawater and the high levels of na and cl concentrations in coastal groundwater may indicates a significant effect of seawater mixing whereas the concentration variations of other elements are frequently ignored because of their transformation and modification due to interactions with aquifer materials kumar 2014 mondal et al 2008 park et al 2005 stoessell et al 1997 hem 1989 the cl concentration of the groundwater samples ranges from 2 95 mg l to 2940 1 mg l consequently the concentration of na in the groundwater ranges from 2 3 mg l to 1098 1 mg l this result suggest that majority of the groundwater samples have an elevated levels of cl and na exceeded the drinking water guideline value of 250 mg l for cl and of 200 mg l for na who 2011 the spatial distribution of na and cl as shown in fig 4a and b respectively and shows that the changes in the content of na and cl have concurrent increases of ec and tds values however the distribution of these ions indicated the increased salinity in the northern and western parts of the study area is very observable and also shows a diagnostic sign of seawater intrusion into drilled wells evaluation of groundwater facies is evident from the water chemistry data table s2 using a piper diagram fig 5 indicate a wide range of water types ranging from freshwater ca mg hco3 type through an intermediate ca mg cl type to saline water na cl type which clearly indicates that the groundwater aquifer system in the study area interacts with seawater and undergoes cation exchange piper 1953 gimenez forcada 2010 kumar 2014 the changes in chemical composition of fresh groundwater are caused by mixing as well as by chemical reactions such as ion exchange processes bivariate diagrams of major ions na k mg and so4 vs cl are presented in order to separate mixing mechanisms of fresh water and saline water from chemical reactions fig 6 in general most ions are positively correlated with cl and especially na mg and so4 show a strong correlation with cl indicating that such ions are derived from the same source of saline waters the relationship between cl hco3 ratio and cl also shows mixing of groundwaters and seawater and the samples with lower ratios can be characterized as fresh waters fig 6e in the case of cl vs tds a good linear relationship is observed see fig 6f which suggests that both of them are mainly from a single source and the possibility of hydrochemical processes such as seawater intrusions and dilution with fresh groundwater have been taken place simultaneously at various palaces in the region 3 2 geochemical ionic ratios and evidence of seawater influence ionic ratios are commonly used to evaluate the seawater intrusion and the source and nature of the salinity present in the coastal aquifers andreasen and fleck 1997 kim et al 2003a vengosh et al 1999 2003 moujabber et al 2006 and references therein in the present study hco3 cl so4 cl na cl and br cl are used to delineate the region affected by seawater intrusion ionic ratios of hco3 cl so4 cl br cl and na cl of the studied groundwater ranges from 0 02 to 47 36 0 01 to 7 92 0 0005 to 0 0036 and 0 20 to 14 29 respectively the groundwaters within the paleobeach and at the central and northern part of the study area e g kalatoli holiday point kurushkhul indicate high ratio of br cl 0 00154 similar to seawater 0 0015 along with higher values and low ionic ratios of hco3 cl 1 00 so4 cl 0 05 and na cl 0 86 fig 7 a d as compared to the marine ratios 1 00 0 05 and 0 86 respectively are observed these geochemical variations characterize seawater mixing vengosh 2003 isawi et al 2016 and thus suggest that seawater intrusion is the predominant source for groundwater salinization in these areas this result is reinforced also by isotopic evidences see section isotopic characteristics the bivariate plot of hco3 cl versus tds shows that the regression slope is negative in the high 1000 mg l tds concentration range while the slope is positive tendency in the low 1000 mg l tds concentration range fig 8 a it indicates that about 22 analyzed samples are saline with hco3 cl molar ratios of 1 0 and tds concentration of 1000 mg l this result indicating that groundwaters with high tds concentration are enriched in cl and such ions derived from mixing with seawater which acts the main source of solutes in groundwater salinization and that groundwaters with low tds concentration are not affected or less affected by seawater the br to cl concentration ratio is also used to estimate the degree of groundwater salinization by seawater intrusion in general the degree of groundwater salinization by seawater intrusion leads to an increase in cl concentration and accordingly the br cl ratio decreases mercado 1985 richter and kreitler 1993 this representative feature is also shown in fig 7 which shows the changes of the br cl ratio versus cl concentrations the higher positive relationship r 0 998 between the conservative ions br and cl fig 8b and their marine ratio fig 7c supports a seawater intrusion source for these waters which are located along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area e g kalatoli holiday point kurushkhul where a high rate of withdrawal of groundwater was observed and also landuse pattern has changed significantly seddique et al 2013 3 3 b and sr contents and identification of seawater intrusion the selected trace elements i e b and sr concentration in the studied samples ranged from 0 01 mg l to 0 97 mg l and 0 10 mg l to 24 94 mg l respectively in general the b and sr concentrations are low in fresh groundwater but high in brackish and saline waters mondal et al 2010 saxena et al 2004 b and sr of groundwater reveal good correlations with tds values fig 9 it is also observed that seawater intrusion is more in the central part and northern and western part of the study area where the groundwater also content relatively high values of tds ec na and cl as well see fig 3a and b and fig 4a and b thereafter the effects of seawater intrusion are less in the southern and eastern parts of the area close to kalatoli and link road regions this suggests that the aquifer system was under interaction with seawater and that the source of b and sr content may be linked solely to marine in origin 3 4 identification of groundwater origin by δ18o and δ2h analyses the stable isotopes of oxygen δ 18o and hydrogen δ 2h values can provide information on precipitation evaporated surface water and seawater sources and thus can help to identify the origins of groundwater salinity values of δ18o and δ 2h were used to understand the mixing of seawater with the groundwater in the many parts of the world gaye 2001 kim et al 2003a and references therein however the δ 18o and δ 2h values are used to determine the origin of the groundwater in the study area data provided by majumder et al 2011 show that long term weighted mean values of δ 18o and δ 2h of the rainfall in savar which is located in the central part of bangladesh are 4 1 to 21 respectively from a study conducted by majumder et al 2011 which included measurements of δ 18o and δ 2h of the rainfall in savar station 1000 amsl which is located in the central part of bangladesh we defined the local meteoric water line lmwl based on the following equation δ 2h 7 7 δ 18o 10 7 that is representative of the studied area the δ 2h verses δ 18o relationship for all water samples is also defined in relation with global meteoric water line gmwl given by the following equation δ 2h 8δ 18o 10 craig 1961 table s1 shows the analysis results of the δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic compositions of groundwater and seawater of the study area the typical δ 18o and δ 2h isotopic values of seawater goldberg et al 1971 are provided as end member values the isotopic composition of the studied groundwater shows a wide range of δ 18o values 6 2 to 2 7 and the δ 2h values 38 9 to 8 9 all ranges are in accordance with values given by majumder et al 2011 stable isotope measurements in water are plotted in a classical δ 18o vs δ2h diagram fig 10 a fig 10a shows that the most groundwater samples plot between the local and the global meteoric line s reflecting a meteoric origin for the water without any major transformation e g evaporation this suggests that transfer from rainfall towards groundwater storage through soil and non saturated zone is fast and that post precipitation evaporation during the passage in soil is not an active processes in comparison with other groundwater samples 22 out of 105 the samples wells with depth 25 m and including one sample with depth 100 m are distinctly enriched in their stable isotope compositions and deviate significantly from the lmwl and gmwl fig 10a these groundwater samples are characterized by relatively high δ 18o 4 7 values plot along a line having a slope of 6 23 that is a slope considerably lower than that of the lmwl 7 7 suggesting that the enrichment can be attributed to the mixing of groundwater and seawater and or the influence of evaporation kim et al 2003a vengosh et al 1999 fig 10b shows the relationship between the δ18o values of groundwater and well depth and also shows that shallow depth of tubewells water 100 m depth δ18o values show a progressively enrichment trend with relatively high values 4 7 suggesting that these groundwater can be attributed to the influence of seawater vengosh et al 1999 3 5 evaluation of groundwater salinity using seawater mixing index smi hydrochemical data were used to estimate an index called smi which evaluates the relative mixing of seawater with groundwater into the study area the probability distribution curves have great importance in dealing with the interpretation of geochemical data and the discrimination of processes affecting groundwater chemistry shaw 1961 sinclair 1974 1976 fig 9 shows that results of the interpretation of cumulative probability curves for chosen hydrochemical parameters cl na mg so4 the inflection points in the cumulative probability plots are estimated according to the distribution probability curves and can be considered as regional threshold values t for the respective ion for differentiating the samples with the effect of seawater mixing in the study area mondal et al 2010 kumar 2014 in this study two threshold values obtained by these plots the approximate threshold values for inflection point 1and 2 for different ions are na 110 mg l and 286 mg l cl 146 mg l and 504 mg l so4 62 mg l and 160 mg l and mg 48 mg l and 83 mg l respectively fig 11 a d since our aim was to obtain the natural background level in groundwater the upper value i e inflection point 2 obtained from this plot is very high and even exceeded the drinking water standards who 2011 thereafter the lower values i e inflection point 1 obtained of these ions is more realist for the background level and therefore used in the calculation of smi based on the concentrations mg l of na mg cl and so4 in each sample c regional approximate threshold t values and the calculated a b c and d constant factors the swmi can be calculated for each individual well using equation 1 fig 12 shows the relationship of smi and tds values based on the smi results there are three groundwater types in the study area the smi values show that almost all of the type 1 waters have smi values smaller than 1 while the type 2 and type 3 waters have values larger than 1 therefore at least 19 waters belonging to type 2 and type 3 corresponding to about 22 of the analyzed tubewell waters can be considered to be significantly affected by the mixing of seawater components park et al 2005 mondal et al 2010 these wells are located along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area e g holiday point kurushkhul nuniarchar laboni point and kalatoli point which is evident from the spatial distribution of smi fig 13 4 conclusion the integrated data presented in this study suggest that the groundwater in the cox s bazar town and its surrounding areas did not originate only from modern recharge in addition the geochemical variations also revealed large water quality differentiation with high quality water in the southern part of the area relative to highly saline water in the northern western and central parts given the weakness of recent replenishment we predict that continued exploitation of the groundwater in this area could further increase the salinization of the water resources particularly in areas with low hydraulic gradient and intensive water abstraction has been occurring without considering safe yield in contrast we argued that the heavily exploited shallow aquifer along the paleobeach area towards the bay of bengal and at the central and northern part of the study area is more vulnerable given the relatively high longer residence time e g δ 18o 4 0 of the water ionic changes sweater mixing index and sensitive trace elements of groundwater provide diagnostic tools that trace the different hydrochemical processes and seawater intrusion in cox s bazar coastal aquifers our results also represent a base for future hydrochemical work that will help in the planning

12206,groundwater resources are limited and they are declining in quality and quantity due to contamination and climate change impacts under the environment of the increasing water demand for domestic agricultural and industrial uses and dwindling resources the management of groundwater resources is a challenging task worldwide precise evaluation of groundwater recharge is vital for its sustainable management and efficient use for various sectors of the economy an overview of different groundwater recharge estimation techniques is presented in this paper the techniques covered in this study include numerical approach tracer method hydrologic budget method and multiple methods the norms of recharge estimation through rainfall canal seepage and field percolation are also covered in this study the literature analysis revealed that the tracer techniques are extensively used in water scarce areas for estimating groundwater recharge and the use of watertable fluctuations is a valuable means for shaping the size of both long and short term alterations in recharge the analysis also revealed that groundwater recharge can be estimated by using the numerical models because each approach is associated with some limitations the use of multiple approaches was recommended to estimate the groundwater recharge in many cases diverse approaches balance every other and aid improve the conceptual model of recharge processes this literature analysis provides the basis for the selection of an appropriate recharge estimation technique under a specific set of conditions graphical

therefore groundwater is very convenient to extract from the users perspective but many regions experiencing waterlogging fao 2016 by rising poor quality groundwater and limited fresh quality groundwater may be available at a deeper depth which is expensive for exploration by the common user singh 2015 therefore it is imperative to increase the fresh groundwater potential for sustainable

recharge lee et al 2008 rushton et al 2006 healy and cook 2002 the quantum of information needed for recharge estimation depends on the convolution of the method used for instance a number of methods involve the development of complex mathematical models while others require extensive fieldwork finch 1998 gogolev 2002 usually the key methods for groundwater recharge estimation are numerical models hydrological budgets watertable fluctuations and tracer techniques this study presents an overview of different techniques used for the estimation of groundwater recharge norms for the determination of different recharge components are also presented in this paper 2 numerical approach groundwater recharge can be estimated by using the numerical models wanke et al 2008 the calibration process can be used for obtaining the recharge flux that is needed to match target heads said et al 2005 cherkauer 2004 it is imperative to note that these models do not produce distinctive results for hydraulic heads for the reason that the results depend on how fit the boundary conditions and aquifer formation are described and assumptions were taken besides developing numerical models is expensive requires modeling ability time consuming and requires widespread historical data many researchers have used numerical methods to solve the richards equation and thus construct soil hydrological models for soil moisture simulation ross 1990 fayer 2000 in a plain region soil moisture progression in the vertical direction plays a central role and thus a 1 d model should be enough such a model was developed by chen and hu 2004 to investigate the groundwater influence on soil moisture and surface evaporation chen et al 2008 two unsaturated zone models i e richards equation and water balance based were used by gogolev 2002 for estimating groundwater recharge while ragab et al 1997 applied a simple soil model for the accurate estimation of groundwater recharge similarly finch 1998 used a simple water balance model for estimating direct groundwater recharge monte carlo technique for recharge estimation was used by beseki and macconchie 1999 these models are good for estimating groundwater recharge but they need many field data such as rainfall soil water content potential evapotranspiration etc and include many model parameters which possession is a lot difficult and takes plenty of time eventually limiting their real field applications a conceptual rainfall runoff model smar was used to overcome the aforesaid limitations the smar estimates recharge using only groundwater level rainfall and evaporation this model however cannot be used directly for an aquifer where horizontal groundwater flow is prominent for this reason a horizontal flow component was added to this model fazal et al 2005 ketchum et al 2000 and avery et al 1999 reported that recharge is estimated by multiplying the specific yield of the aquifer material with the amount of water level fluctuations in wells in the majority of previous studies yeh et al 2007 and louie et al 2000 described the processes of groundwater recharge and fluxes of the water balance concept application of soil moisture budget and simulation models are currently considered as typical techniques for the estimation of regional groundwater recharge zhang et al 1999 chen et al 2005 diverse approaches including the boundary element the finite element and the finite difference method have been extensively used by the scholars for solving the groundwater flow equations among which tough2 pruess et al 1999 modflow chiang and kinzelbach 1998 and rockflow kohlmeier et al 2007 are the most often used for simulating groundwater flow the soil moisture budget method which accounts for climatic conditions and soil properties is used to approximate the evapotranspiration runoff infiltration and recharge the amount of recharge by rainfall infiltration determines the sustainability of a groundwater system lee et al 2008 a correct appraisal of water equilibrium at the regional level is of paramount substance in the environment of an overall rise in agricultural urban and industrial water demand this equilibrium upshots from the interface of soil climate geology and plants de vries and simmers 2002 its appraisal is intricate particularly in dry regions because groundwater recharges and stream discharge fluxes are weak and variable scanlon et al 2006 appraising groundwater recharge as the residual of soil water balance equation is a common way of modeling watershed hydrology collins and bras 2007 anuraga et al 2006 presented a simple method that integrates the 1 d agro hydrological model swap with the data available from government agencies and gis to assess the effect of land use and soil on groundwater budgets at the sub watershed scale there are several reviews on groundwater recharge estimation methods scanlon et al 2002 lerner et al 1990 while these methods offer insights into the developments of groundwater recharge they are unsuitable for normal recharge assessment rushton et al 2006 ragab et al 1997 introduced alternative soil moisture balance models for recharge estimation when there are consistent estimates of outflows from an aquifer due to pumping from boreholes or river flows a groundwater balance possibly used to improve the recharge approximations kendy et al 2003 3 tracer method groundwater recharge may be estimated by several conventional methods nimmo et al 2005 but most methods require analysis of a large volume of hydrological data which is scarce in several regions chand et al 2004 tracer techniques are broadly employed in dry areas for recharge approximation from irrigation and rainfall robertson and cherry 1989 wood and sanford 1995 sami and hughes 1996 cook and solomon 1997 common tracers include bromide jury et al 1982 hendrickx et al 1993 3h rangarajan et al 2005 and visible dyes flury et al 1994 forrer et al 1999 a benefit of tracer techniques is that the requirements are generally for shorter term and straightforwardly available data chand et al 2004 zimmermann et al 1966 dincer et al 1974 athavale et al 1980 generally three types of tracer techniques i e applied tracers environmental tracers and historical tracers are used for the determination of groundwater recharge edson 1998 environmental tracers i e chloride are applied physically on the ground surface in the course of the earth s environment phillips 1994 with a perception of how they accrue and move across in the vadoze zone they can be used for estimating normal recharge scanlon 2000 historical tracers are the result of human activities i e nuclear testing and contaminant spills nativ et al 1995 the recharge rates of more than past 50 years can be estimated by using these historical tracers lin and wei 2006 cook et al 1994 allison and hughes 1983 applied tracers typically are chosen chemicals that are available at low concentrations injected at some depth or applied at the soil surface which is then transported downward by unsaturated zone water the average transport velocity which indicates a recharge rate is expressed by the depth of the tracer front ayers 1981 reported that chloride ion which is concentrated by the processes of evapotranspiration can be used as a tracer for estimating groundwater recharge estimation of fresh water lenses vacher and ayers 1980 reported that this method is effective in recharge estimation regardless of the fact whether the recharge is diffused or focused with some assumptions and conditions the chloride mass balance method offers rational estimates of groundwater recharge in semiarid areas which are very similar to those acquired by physically based methods wood and sanford 1995 the overall disadvantages associated with tracer techniques comprise the extra cost to use tracers the time lapse between submission and sampling and likely complexity in getting the ideal site to sample wang et al 2008b in addition the measurement through this method may result in an over or underestimation of recharge because it does not measure recharge directly lerner et al 1990 4 hydrologic budget method analysis of watertable fluctuations is a valuable means for shaping the size of both long and short term alterations in recharge avery et al 1999 ketchum et al 2000 groundwater estimation committee india has also recommended this method for estimation of groundwater recharge however use of this method is restricted in regions where watertable scrutiny is frequently performed sharda et al 2006 furthermore using a distinct value of specific yield bounds the utility of this method healy and cook 2002 estimated groundwater recharge by using watertable fluctuation method as 1 rech sy δh δt where rech is recharge sy is specific yield t is time and h is watertable depth however this method is primarily suitable over a short period of time such as up to a small number of days yasuda et al 2013 healy and cook 2002 yasuda et al 2013 have undertaken a study to simplify groundwater recharge alongside the interface between the low groundwater and plant ecosystem at a location in the loess plateau of china the hydrological budget method is widely used by hydrologists for estimating groundwater recharge ahmed and umar 2008 marechal et al 2006 this method accounts for all inflow and outflow constituents in addition to storage changes in the saturated and unsaturated zones the method uses specific yield for the calculation of the drained water quantity from inundated storage however assigning a representative value of specific yield leads to over under estimation of groundwater recharge sophocleous 1985 the common hydrologic account of a region can be given as 2 δs i r c r p r q in q out ro et c q w where δs is the net groundwater recharge change in saturated groundwater storage i and r are the irrigation and rainfall respectively r c is the groundwater recharge due to canal seepage r p is the groundwater recharge due to field percolation q in and q out are lateral water fluxes into and out of the command area ro is surface water runoff et c represents water losses due to crop evapotranspiration and q w is groundwater withdrawal through tubewells by and large using this method for estimating groundwater recharge is inexact thanks to complexities in establishing some parameters for example runoff groundwater baseflow evapotranspiration and an interception and the use of a distinct value for specific yield manghi et al 2009 saraf and choudury 1998 jackson 2003 and ghayoumian et al 2006 advocated the use of geospatial techniques such as gis for recharge estimation through the modeling of groundwater resources 5 multiple methods the groundwater recharge is computed by various methods and techniques such as saturated and unsaturated zone techniques etc however since each approach is associated with some limitations the use of multiple approaches was recommended to estimate the groundwater recharge risser et al 2009 healy and cook 2002 in many cases diverse approaches balance every other and aid improve the conceptual model of recharge processes the direct measurement of groundwater recharge is virtually impractical thus scholars usually construct the unsurpassed estimates by the use of techniques that are relatively straightforward in their application and need only commonly available hydrologic data it was commonly recommended that groundwater recharge should be appraised by using the several methods and the results judged against nimmo et al 2003 this is a sensible technique nevertheless quality data generally are not accessible to use several methods risser et al 2009 summarized a study which evaluates the results of groundwater recharge from four methods the development and application of a simple groundwater recharge model was presented by singh 2012b the presented model is simple and it entails inputs that are easily obtainable or accessible the model was used to evaluate the groundwater recharge of a canal command in an irrigated area of india reviews on groundwater recharge estimation are available by lerner et al 1990 simmers 1997 sanford 2002 and scanlon et al 2002 the key assessment norm for selecting the right technique is the likely correlation between indirect and direct recharges if direct recharge is the main process water balance models the chloride mass balance method or numerical analysis of vertical moisture flux can be used 6 recharge estimation norms 6 1 recharge from rainfall statistical studies carried out by researchers worldwide i e taylor et al 1933 and wilsdon and sarathy 1931 indicated that on an average about one third of the water added to the surface of the soil during the year percolates down to the watertable however singh 1973 has used the following equation for the calculation of recharge through rainfall 3 qr cr ro et ac where qr is the volume of the water available for recharge cr is the contributing part of the rain ro is the direct runoff et is evapotranspiration and ac is the area of the catchment the contribution of rainfall in the groundwater recharge is variable significantly with the type of soil and geological conditions rangarajan and athavale 2000 for example for granite the annual recharge rech mm is related to the annual rainfall rf mm as rech 0 172 rf 44 while for the alluvium soil the relationship would be given as rech 0 147 rf 6 similarly chandra and saxena 1975 provided the following relationships between annual recharge and annual rainfall 4 rech 3 984 rf 40 4 0 5 researchers such as singh and kumar 1994 singh et al 2010 and singh 2013 estimated that 20 of the total rainfall contributes to the recharge of groundwater while gupta 1983 reported a recharge of 20 25 for the alluvial sandy areas however for the areas with large clay content rainfall recharge is suggested be 15 20 of the annual rainfall 6 2 recharge from canal seepage groundwater recharge through canal seepage has been estimated for different sets of specific conditions by many researchers i e wolde kirkos and chawla 1994 sharma and chawla 1975 singh et al 2012 subramanya et al 1973 morel seytoux 1964 garg and chawla 1970 and harr 1962 the aforementioned studies provided an accurate mathematical solution to unconfined steady state seepage from the canal networks in the homogeneous porous medium they reported a seepage loss of about 45 of the water supplied to the head of the canal by the time the water reaches the field according to the bureau of indian standards 1980 the seepage loss from unlined canals normally ranges between 0 3 and 7 0 m3 s per million m2 of wetted surface an assessment of canals by wachyan and rushton 1987 showed that even with the utmost care the canal lining does not stay faultless tahir et al 1996 modeled the transmission losses series as an autoregressive integrated moving average arima process the researchers such as tyagi 1983 singh and kumar 1994 and singh et al 2012 estimated the canal seepage as 5 r c wp c n d l c sf 86400 where nd is the number of running days day lc is the length of specific canal m sf is the seepage factor wpc is the wetted perimeter of the canal m and rc is the groundwater recharge due to canal seepage m3 the rate of sf was suggested at 0 62 0 75 and 2 5 3 0 m3 sec mm2 of the wetted area for lined and unlined canals respectively irrigation department 2016 the above method provides an approximate estimation of the canal seepage for precise estimation using above method it is essential to divide the entire length of canal to different sections depending on cross sections as it reduces from head reach to tail reach wetted perimeter is also dynamic depending on full or partial supply of irrigation water at the head regulator it has been observed that some of the lined canals act as unlined system depending on life and quality of construction of the structure moreover due to siltation in canal bed seepage from the unlined canals reduced substantially due to the rodent problem in the embankment of the unlined canal almost entire irrigation water is available in the fields on both sides of the canal therefore more research is required to establish the seepage factor sf according to canal embankment material the life of the structure and human animal interventions 6 3 recharge from field percolation the groundwater estimation committee india suggested the guidelines for the estimation of recharge from irrigated fields singh et al 2010 the diverse proportion of deep percolation in cropped areas taken was based on the studies undertaken in comparable areas for diverse crops the groundwater recharge through the cropped field was estimated as 6 rp d a df where d is the irrigation water depth given to the field m a is the area under specific crop m2 df is the portion of applied water added as groundwater recharge and rp is the groundwater recharge due to field percolation m3 therefore df is dynamic as it depends on crop and soil moisture status on the day of irrigation a major portion of the field percolation losses comes from rice field tuong and bhuiyan 1999 as about 59 of the total water applied lost as deep percolation while it is only 5 6 for wheat and 31 2 for sorghum crop the water balance of paddy fields has been analyzed by kampen 1970 using both numerical and analog models smith 1991 introduced paddy into the computations of the cropwat program adopting a specific procedure 7 summary and conclusions there are diverse indirect and direct approaches and advanced models have been used for groundwater recharge estimation since its direct measurement is nearly impossible tracer techniques are extensively used in water scarce areas for estimating groundwater recharge from irrigation and rainfall however it requires more cost in applying and the time required between applications and sampling moreover the measurement through this method may result in an over or underestimation of recharge because it does not measure recharge directly the use of watertable fluctuations is a valuable means for shaping the size of both long and short term alterations in recharge however use of this method is restricted in regions where watertable scrutiny is frequently performed furthermore using a distinct value of specific yield bounds the utility of this method groundwater recharge can be estimated by using the numerical models the calibration process can be used for obtaining the recharge flux that is needed to match target heads but these models do not produce distinctive results for hydraulic heads for the reason that the results depend on how fit the boundary conditions and aquifer formation are described and assumptions were taken in addition these models require extensive historical data and modeling expertise the hydrological budget method is widely used by hydrologists for estimating groundwater recharge however assigning a representative value of specific yield leads to over under estimation of groundwater recharge because each approach is associated with some limitations the use of multiple approaches was recommended to estimate the groundwater recharge in many cases diverse approaches balance every other and aid improve the conceptual model of recharge processes acknowledgements the authors express their sincere thanks to the state irrigation department and groundwater cell haryana india for

domestic agricultural and industrial uses and dwindling resources the management of groundwater resources is a challenging task worldwide varua et al 2018 singh 2014b c the problem has aggravated more in the recent time thanks to the rise in population and dwindling resource base caused by contamination and global change adhikari and nejadhashemi 2016 singh 2019a b c 2018c it has resulted in a rapid decline in surface water and groundwater reservoirs deforestation and desertification limited surface water availability is governed by spatial and stochastic phenomena of rainfall associated with structural measures in the river system adhikari et al 2017 gaaloul 2014 surface water sharing treaties between neighboring countries have put an additional constraint on its availability therefore groundwater is very convenient to extract from the users perspective but many regions experiencing waterlogging fao 2016 by rising poor quality groundwater and limited fresh quality groundwater may be available at a deeper depth which is expensive for exploration by the common user singh 2015 therefore it is imperative to increase the fresh groundwater potential for sustainable resource conservation in this process groundwater recharge plays a key role in water balance studies in these regions where potential evapotranspiration equals or surpasses average precipitation therefore an accurate estimation of groundwater recharge is essential for efficient and sustainable groundwater management because water resources are critical to economic development in these areas

autoregressive integrated moving average arima process the researchers such as tyagi 1983 singh and kumar 1994 and singh et al 2012 estimated the canal seepage as 5 r c wp c n d l c sf 86400 where nd is the number of running days day lc is the length of specific canal m sf is the seepage factor wpc is the wetted perimeter of the canal m and rc is the groundwater recharge due to canal seepage m3 the rate of sf was suggested at 0 62 0 75 and 2 5 3 0 m3 sec mm2 of the wetted area for lined and unlined canals respectively irrigation department 2016 the above method provides an approximate estimation of the canal seepage for precise estimation using above method it is essential to divide the entire length of canal to different sections depending on cross sections as it reduces from head reach to tail reach wetted perimeter is also dynamic depending on full or partial supply of irrigation water at the head regulator it has been observed that some of the lined canals act as unlined system depending on life and quality of construction of the structure moreover due to siltation in canal bed seepage from the unlined canals reduced substantially due to the rodent problem in the embankment of the unlined canal almost entire irrigation water is available in the fields on both sides of the canal therefore more research is required to establish the seepage factor sf according to canal embankment material the life of the structure and human animal interventions 6 3 recharge from field percolation the groundwater estimation committee india suggested the guidelines for the estimation of recharge from irrigated fields singh et al 2010 the diverse proportion of deep percolation in cropped areas taken was based on the studies undertaken in comparable areas for diverse crops the groundwater recharge through the cropped field was estimated as 6 rp d a df where d is the irrigation water depth given to the field m a is the area under specific crop m2 df is the portion of applied water added as groundwater recharge and rp is the groundwater recharge due to field percolation m3 therefore df is dynamic as it depends on crop and soil moisture status on the day of irrigation a major portion of the field percolation losses comes from rice field tuong and bhuiyan 1999 as about 59 of the total water applied lost as deep percolation while it is only 5 6 for wheat and 31 2 for sorghum crop the water balance of paddy fields has been analyzed by kampen 1970 using both numerical and analog models smith 1991 introduced paddy into the computations of the cropwat program adopting a specific procedure 7 summary and conclusions there are diverse indirect and direct approaches and advanced models have been used for groundwater recharge estimation since its direct measurement is nearly impossible tracer techniques are extensively used in water scarce areas for estimating groundwater recharge from irrigation and rainfall however it requires more cost in applying and the time required between applications and sampling moreover the measurement through this method may result in an over or underestimation of recharge because it does not measure recharge directly the use of watertable fluctuations is a valuable means for shaping the size of both long and short term alterations in recharge however use of this method is restricted in regions where watertable scrutiny is frequently performed furthermore using a distinct value of specific yield bounds the utility of this method groundwater recharge can be estimated by using the numerical models the calibration process can be used for obtaining the recharge flux that is needed to match target heads but these models do not produce distinctive results for hydraulic heads for the reason that the results depend on how fit the boundary conditions and aquifer formation are described and assumptions were taken in addition these models require extensive historical data and modeling expertise the hydrological budget method is widely used by hydrologists for estimating groundwater recharge however assigning a representative value of specific yield leads to over under estimation of groundwater recharge because each approach is associated with some limitations the use of multiple approaches was recommended to estimate the groundwater recharge in many cases diverse approaches balance every other and aid improve the conceptual model of recharge processes acknowledgements the authors express their sincere thanks to the state irrigation department and groundwater cell haryana india for providing valuable literature for this paper the authors also show their gratitude to the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful review and useful comments which have led to widespread improvement to the early versions of the paper 
12207,this study has appraised groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation and its potential health risk to humans within the atankwidi basin of ghana twenty six boreholes were sampled and their physicochemical and heavy metal constituents determined to evaluate the groundwater potability from water quality index computations chlorinity salinity permeability indices sodium adsorption ratio residual bicarbonate and magnesium hardness were also computed to assess the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation more so the hazard quotient hazard index and cancer risk of analyzed heavy metals were estimated to assess their potential carcinogenic risk to human health the results showed that four and nine samples had concentrations of as zn and pb exceeding respective who recommended limits of 0 001 mg l 0 006 mg l and 0 01 mg l fluoride levels in four samples exceeded the maximum who limit of 1 5 mg l whilst two samples were below the minimum limit of 0 5 mg l water quality indices revealed that about 80 of groundwaters were potable compared to adults children were more than twice vulnerable to potential carcinogenic effects over a life time through dermal and ingestion exposures the groundwater was generally found to be suitable for irrigation especially for moderate salt tolerant crops such as maize millet sorghum pepper tomatoes cabbage etc to minimize potential exposure to carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks there should be awareness creation to stop the use of agro chemicals for farming be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords atankwidi basin drinking water quality groundwater health risk assessment irrigation water quality ghana 1 introduction semi arid and arid regions generally consider groundwater as an invaluable renewable natural resource for the sustenance of human life and the ecosystem due to the fact that surface water resources had become increasingly unreliable both in quantity and quality wang et al 2001 awotwi et al 2015 asare donkor et al 2016 anim gyampo et al 2018a its unreliability may also stem from extreme and unfavorable climatic conditions e g low precipitation and high temperatures leading to excessive surficial water loses through processes of evapotranspiration according to appelo and postma 2005 in situations where it is available in sustainable quantities it easily becomes vulnerable to contamination from certain common anthropogenic activities these activities may include industrial mining waste disposal and agricultural activities that generate leachates into surface water reservoirs over time thereby rendering them unsuitable and very expensive to treat to meet the ever increasing demands of rapidly growing population in developing countries awotwi et al 2017 gomez et al 2017 groundwater on the other hand is much reliable both in quantity and quality asare donkor et al 2016 it is generally more ubiquitous in its natural occurrence much more mineralized and better protected from surficial contaminant sources the presence of natural attenuation capacities of vadose zones and the slow movement of infiltrating surficial waters through the pores in soils and fractures in rocks allows for adequate interaction of water with geologic media and may reduce contaminant loads sometimes completely before entering the saturated zones samantara et al 2017 groundwater has therefore become the most preferred source of sustainable water supply to meet domestic agricultural and industrial needs of humans in rural peri urban and urban settings in almost all developing countries countries found in the sub saharan africa ssa including ghana are of no exception obuobie 2008 despite the generally positives associated with groundwater use its quality is not sacrosanct anim gyampo et al 2018b but can be altered over geologic time through natural processes such as geochemical interactions such as the interactions between water and geologic media ion exchange reactions sea water intrusion extreme evaporation and transpiration mechanisms and biogeochemical activities appelo and postma 2005 artificially certain anthropogenic activities due to population boom and rapid urbanization may alter groundwater quality over time shah et al 2019 such activities and processes may include but not limited to leachates from agricultural fields that utilize agro chemicals and leachates from waste disposal sites geissen et al 2015 the atankwidi basin of ghana is a typical semi arid region where about 90 of inhabitants rely on groundwater as the main source of potable water throughout the year martin 2006 obuobie 2008 during prolonged dry seasons october may however groundwater is the only source of potable water van der berg 2008 there exists vast uncultivated fertile lands ofosu et al 2014 but the lack of reliable surface water resources had resulted in poor crop production over the past three decades barry et al 2010 which has rendered the inhabitants to be amongst the second poorest economically as well as second least in terms of food security in ghana to improve the poor socio economic status and food security of the inhabitants groundwater in shallow regolith and fractured aquifers has been found to be in reliable quantities to meet current and future domestic demands and also provide reliable supply to support an intended up scaling of irrigation farming by the government of ghana barry et al 2005 krishna et al 2010 ofosu et al 2014 obuobie 2014 whilst reasonable data on groundwater quantity i e recharge storativity and sustainability in the study area exist martin and van de giesen 2005 barry et al 2010 obuobie 2014 there is very little or no comprehensive data on groundwater quality to evaluate its suitability for domestic and irrigation as well as the risk associated with groundwater consumption thus this study seeks to provide a comprehensive baseline data on the quality of the groundwater for domestic and irrigations purposes as well as the potential risk s associated with groundwater consumption the study will aid stakeholders in future groundwater quality planning monitoring and evaluation to ensure sustainable utilization of the resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is located within longitude 0 50 1 10 w and latitude 10 45 11 00 n with an estimated total area about 156 km2 martin 2006 it is bounded to the west east north and south by kasena nankana municipality kasena nankana west district bolgatanga municipality and southern burkina faso respectively the climate is sudan savannah type which is characterized by high temperatures minimum and maximum daily values averages around 23 c and 35 c respectively average estimated annual evapotranspiration far exceeds annual rainfall values liebe 2002 rainfall occurs in a single but short season june september with precipitation values averaging about 990 mm year followed by a prolonged dry season october may two major air masses controlling the climate are the south west monsoon and northeast trade winds anim gyampo et al 2018a the geology of the area fig 2 is the paleoproterozoic birimian metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks and their respective syngeneic belt and basin granitoids formed during the eburnean orogeny approx 2 250 ma common rock units in the basin include metamorphosed lavas pyroclastic schist phyllites and biotite granite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite gneiss and the younger potassium rich bongo granitoids approx 1970 ma soil types are leptosols lixisols and fluvisols anim gyampo et al 2018b hydrogeology of the area is formed by two main shallow aquifers the regolith aquifers which are unconfined continuous and occur at depths not exceeding approximately 23m and the fractured aquifers which are semi confined and occurs at depths exceeding 23m barry et al 2005 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis twenty six 26 groundwater samples from well distributed boreholes that tap groundwaters from shallow aquifers within the study area were collected during the peak of the dry period april when groundwater becomes the only source of water supply for inhabitants two groundwater samples each were collected into disinfected and well rinsed 500 ml polythene at each site after purging each for about 5 min to obtain representative samples samples earmarked for heavy metal analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes and acidified with 2 v v of hno3 to keep ions in solution whilst the unacidified samples were kept physico chemical analysis electrical conductivity ec acidity ph and alkalinity were measured using wtw field conductivity meter model lft 91 wtw field ph meter model ph 95 and a hach digital titrator respectively color turbidity and total dissolved solids tds were measured using an electronic colorimeter model dr 890 sodium na and potassium k were measured using flame photometer whilst fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer aas model aa240fs measured calcium ca and magnesium mg chloride fluoride nitrate and sulphate were measured by ion chromatograph model dionex ics 90 whilst phosphate was measured with ultraviolet spectrophotometer model uv 1201 heavy metals such as zinc zn lead pb copper cu chromium cr and cobalt co were measured using aas model varian aas240fs in an acetylene air flame whilst for arsenic as and mercury hg argon air flame was used 2 3 estimation of water quality index the evaluation of general suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes for each sample were achieved by estimating their respective water quality index wqi according to sahu and sikdar 2008 wqi reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters on picture of the quality of groundwater for most domestic uses the estimation of wqi requires the utilization of appropriate influential parameters ips dictated by the purpose to which the water is required in the case of drinking groundwater certain cations and anions as well as heavy metals may impose health implications on human health the selected ips for this study include ph ec ca mg f cl no3 so4 zn pb fe as used in this study the highest weight of five 5 was assigned to as pb and f due to their health significance to human health the wqi for each sampled groundwater was estimated using the equations 1 4 and results compared to the criteria defined by sahu and sikdar 2008 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the assigned weight to an influential parameter relative to its impact on the overall quality for drinking purpose in terms of health implications to humans the water quality rating qi according to sahu and sikdar 2008 is given by 2 q i c i s i 100 where q i is referred to as the water quality rating c i and s i represent the measured concentration in sampled groundwater and the respective standard who 2008 of the ith influential parameter the water quality sub index for each of the influential parameter sii is estimated as 3 si i q i w i where the symbols have their usual meanings 4 wqi i 1 n si i 2 4 estimation of health risks associated with groundwater consumption to assess the potential non carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk that inhabitants may be subjected to after the utilization of the groundwater for domestic purposes in the study area direct exposures through two common pathways namely dermal absorption and ingestion were considered this was due to fact that the exposures due to inhalations from showering tend to be relatively insignificant chai et al 2010 2 4 1 non carcinogenic risk assessment the estimation of hazard quotient hq of individual heavy metals allows for the determination of potential risk due to an individual metal in water as well as the overall risk associated hi hqi with the consumption of the water by humans as developed by usepa 2005 and it is estimated using equations 5 8 5 h q e x p o s u r e r f d where exposure is the dosage due to either direct ingestion e x p i n g or dermal absorption e x p d e r m all in mg kg day and r f d is the toxicity reference dose for each pathway the respective values of which are obtained from literature according to usepa 2005 non carcinogenic risk exposure may not exist via ingestion and dermal pathways if the estimated hq is less than 1 and the water is assumed to be safe however if hq value s for dermal and ingestion pathways exceed 1 then there is potential health concern with respect to a metal or metals in the water being consumed furthermore if the summation of the hqs referred to as hazard index hi for all metals and pathways measured in groundwater under consideration is greater than 1 then there is potential health risk associated with the consumption of such water by humans and vice versa according to usepa 2005 the health hazard index hi is estimated using the relation 6 h i n 1 n hq ing derm where hq ing derm is the hazard quotient for ingestion and dermal pathways 7 exp ing c w ir ef ed bw at 8 exp derm c w sa kp et ef ed cf bw at where e x p d e r m and e x p i n g are exposure doses through dermal

carcinogenic risk assessment to evaluate the carcinogenic risk effect of heavy metals consumed from groundwater through the dermal and ingestion pathways their respective cancer risks crderm and cring were calculated using the relation in equation 9 9 cr exposure cancer slope factor csf according to usepa 2005 the csf for cd cr as pb are 6 3 mg kg day 1 5 0e 01 mg kg day 1 1 5 mg kg day 1 and 8 5e 03 mg kg day 1 respectively csr values for zn and fe were unavailable and therefore their crs could not be estimated the range for the acceptability of cr is 10 6 to 10 4 usepa 2005 2 5 evaluation of groundwater suitability for irrigation groundwater is known to contain much dissolved ions cations and anions which can adversely affect the physical and chemical conditions of both plant life and soils such as lowering of the osmotic pressure that leads to reduced water flow or transmission through the various branches to leaves weakening of soil structure and texture which may lead to reduced permeability nagaraju et al 2014 common properties whose indices form the bases for ascertaining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation include salinity index si defined by the ec residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc sodium hazard expressed in sodium adsorption ratio sar and percent sodium na others include but not limited to wilcox plot soil permeability using permeability index pi chlorinity ci which uses the measured chloride concentration and magnesium hardness mh etc the relations used to estimate the above named indices except for si and ci are as follows 10 sodium

characteristics table 1 presents the statistically summarized physicochemical parameters as well as heavy metal concentrations from the analyzed sampled groundwaters from shallow aquifers within study area all the measured water quality parameters of the groundwater sampled within the study area fell within their respective acceptable limits for potable water prescribed by world health organization who 2008 with the exception of ec hardness and f in few samples table 1 water with a ph value of less than 7 is generally described being acidic medium soft corrosive and enhances the dissolution and leaching of metals from natural salts and man made materials such as pipes and other fixtures acidic waters i e ph 6 5 facilitate the dissolution of metals sometimes to permissible limits which according to nishtha et al 2012 can affect the mucous membrane of human cells the measured ph values in the current study ranged from 6 47 to 7 77 with a mean of approximately 7 08 per the classification by hounslow 1995 groundwater in the study area can generally be considered to be neutral total dissolved solids tds ranged from 80 1 mg l to 377 mg l with a mean of 228 mg l according to freeze and cherry 1979 water with tds less than 1000 mg l is fresh water and indicate the occurrence of young recharging groundwater according to nishtha et al 2012 the consumption of such water by inhabitants of the area may not predispose them to gastro intestinal irritation conductivity values ranged from 157 μs cm to 685 μs cm with a mean of 421 μs cm twenty one samples about 81 were within acceptable limits of who 2008 while five samples about 19 exceeded the maximum acceptable limit the low conductivity values in most parts of the study area may indicate possible shorter residence time of the groundwater in the study area hardness ranged from 164mg l to 364 mg l with a mean of 238 6 mg l five samples 19 had hardness values exceeding who 2008 acceptable limit of 300 mg l for drinking water whilst 81 fell within acceptable limit according to mcgowan 2000 encrustation and adverse effects on domestic use may occur when the permissible threshold of 300 mg l is exceeded according to saravanakumar and kumar 2011 groundwater in the area could be described as being predominantly hard because about 81 of the samples had values between 151 and 300 mg l with about 19 being very hard all nutrients no3 po4 and so4 were within acceptable limit for drinking water by human table 1 measured f concentration ranged from 0 38 mg l to 1 95 mg l twenty samples about 77 of groundwater had f concentrations within who recommended range 0 5 1 5 mg l for potable water fluoride in suitable dose i e 0 5 1 5 mg l has been found to promote the growth and strength of human bones and the teeth apambire et al 1997 however long term use of groundwater with fluoride concentrations outside the who 2008 permissible range of 0 5 1 5 mg l can result in serious health implications two samples mirigu and yua chingirigo had f values below the who 2008 recommended lower limit of 0 5 mg l which may lead to potential incidence of dental caries and weakness in bones of inhabitants over life time four samples about 15 located between zokkor and namoo areas had f values exceeding 1 5 mg l but less than 4 mg l indicating potential predisposition of inhabitants to dental fluorosis over life time who 2008 the observed high f levels in the northeastern parts of the study area fig 3 occurred within the bongo granitoids which had been recognized by apambire et al 1997 to be rich in f 3 1 2 chemical quality of groundwater for drinking purposes in determining the overall drinking water quality of groundwaters in the study area the results for wi wi sii and wqi using the selected ips for each of the twenty six selected point sources are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively the estimated wqis for the area ranged from 10 to 133 with a mean value of 34 table 3 according to sahu and sikdar 2008 drinking water is considered excellent if wqi is less or equal to 50 it is considered good water if wqi is greater than 50 but less than 100 100 200 are considered poor water 200 300 very poor and above 300 are unsuitable for drinking by human in the current study twenty two samples about 85 were excellent with wqi values ranging from 10 to 49 three samples about 12 had good quality with wqi values ranging from about 60 to 96 whilst only one sample about 3 had poor water quality with wqi value of 133 3 2 heavy metals concentrations and human health risk assessment of groundwater 3 2 1 heavy metals in sampled groundwaters all the twenty six 26 analyzed groundwater samples had levels of heavy metals either below their respective detection limits or fell within the acceptable limits who 2008 for drinking water except as pb and zn the distribution of as in the area is as shown in fig 4 measured levels of as ranged from 0 001 mg l to 0 009 mg l with a mean value of 0 013 mg l fig 4 four groundwater samples were found to contain levels of as above recommended limit of 0 001mg l for potable water this implies that the consumption of groundwater from these wells over life time may expose inhabitants to potential carcinogenic diseases such as lung and skin cancers who 2008 garcia et al 2013 whilst according to young et al 2014 non carcinogenic effects such as neurobehavioral abnormalities fetus mortality neuritis low intelligent quotient iq and memory loss may occur fig 5 shows the pb distribution in the basin where measured levels ranged from 0 0 005 mg l to 0 0255 mg l with a mean of 0 0128 mg l elevated pb levels exceeding recommended limit of 0 006 mg l for potable water were observed in nine 9 groundwater samples the concentrations of pb were found to be less than 5 μg dl which according to cdc 2012 fall within the category of low pb levels i e 0 9 μg dl to 2 55 μg dl the consumption of groundwater containing low pb levels over a life time may predispose inhabitants especially children to damaged central and peripheral nervous system shorter stature low iq impaired hearing and impaired formation and functioning of the blood cells in pregnant women low pb levels can cause reduced growth of fetus and premature birth thereby putting the lives of both unborn baby and mother at risk who 2008 cdc 2012 usepa 2017 the concentrations of zn ranged from 0 005 to 0 033 mg l with a mean of 0 002 mg l twelve groundwater samples fig 6 had zn levels slightly exceeding recommended value of 0 01 mg l for potable water who 2008 according to li and zhang 2010 in acceptable concentrations about 90 of zn can be found in the muscles and bones of the human body in such levels zn is an essential mineral and plays vital role in maintaining human health by helping in the synthesis of protein however at concentrations above the who 2008 recommended value in drinking water zn can be toxic to human health after prolonged consumption wastney et al 1986 concluded that the ingestion of water with high concentrations of zn over a life time may lead to cell deaths in the human brain trauma prostate cancer and the altering of the lymphocyte function thus the inhabitants within the areas where elevated levels of zn were observed fig 6 may be vulnerable to potential toxic effects the elevated concentrations of pb and as occurred in groundwaters found within the southwestern parts azaasi mirigu kandinga areas whilst that of zn occurred within the eastern through to north eastern parts kandiga zorkor namoo areas of the study area figs 4 6 these areas according to barry et al 2010 are well known for dry season vegetable cultivation with intensive utilization of agro chemicals such as weedicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers on small holder farms it could therefore be inferred that the elevated concentrations of as pb and zn in the shallow groundwater aquifers in the area could be associated with leaching from agricultural activities this is consistent with the findings of van assche and clijsters 1990 that in typical agricultural environments elevated concentrations of pb as zn and cd may commonly be due to leachates from agricultural fields that utilize extensive agro chemicals as part of their farm practices 3 2 2 human health risk assessment of groundwater whilst some heavy metals are generally essential to the promotion of human health e g zn and fe others can be very toxic e g as cd cr pb hg etc elevated concentrations above the levels recommended by who 2008 for potable water of some heavy metals namely as pb zn and fe were observed in some of the sampled groundwaters these metals when found on or within the human body could expose human to both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic implications including the incidences of various forms of cancer tirkey et al 2017 neurological and behavioral effects cdc 2012 diabetes and eye defects young et al 2014 according to the usepa 2005 the generally known three pathways by which humans could be at risk or exposed to potential hazards associated with certain harmful heavy metals i e as cd cr pb hg zn fe etc in water are ingestion dermal and inhalation for most domestic conditions the risk or hazards exposure through inhalation pathway is often insignificant compared with those from ingestion and dermal pathways lee et al 2002 therefore health risks or hazards through ingestion and dermal pathways only were assessed non carcinogenic hq and hi and carcinogenic risks cr were evaluated using equations 5 9 the results are shown in table 4 it is important to point out that cancer risks estimations for zn and fe were not done due to the unavailability of their slope factor values the estimated hazard quotient for dermal exposures hqderm for adults and children were less than one 1 for all the heavy metals table 4 which according to usepa 2005 indicate that little or no potential toxic effects on human health over life time furthermore the estimated hazard quotient for dermal and ingestion exposures hqderm and hqing for adults and children with respect to zn as and fe were less than one it was however observed that the hqing due to pb for adults and children were greater than one i e 1 134 and 4 328 respectively this implies that adults and children could potentially be at risk to adverse health effects from groundwater consumption over life time in assessing the non carcinogenic risks potential due to pb the hazard indices hi for both adults and children on exposure to groundwater consumption through ingestion and dermal contacts were estimated it was observed that hi for both adults and children due to pb exceeded one 1 with respective values being 1 134 and 4 328 this according to cdc 2012 implies that irrespective of age inhabitants in the study area were potentially at risk to non carcinogenic health effects associated with pb table 4 the observed relatively higher hi value for children presents even much health concern since according to schaumberg et al 2004 children and unborn babies fetus compared to adults are rather more vulnerable to non carcinogenic effects of pb even at very low levels such health effects may include damage to low iq shorter stature in children premature birth reduced fetal growth nervous system and dead blood cells who 2008 cdc 2012 hong et al 2014 in adults however common non carcinogenic health effects may include high blood pressure nervous disorders reduced kidney function delayed conception in women and formation of cataract iarc 2004 cdc 2012 schaumberg et al 2004 for both adults and children within the basin the potential for such health effects to occur may be exacerbated during the peak of the prolonged dry period because groundwater becomes the only source of potable water for all inhabitants in rural peri urban and urban areas in evaluating the carcinogenic effects the cancer risks cr were estimated as the incremental probability of an individual developing any form of cancerous effect over a long period carcinogenic exposure of groundwater consumption li and zhang 2010 cdc 2012 hong et al 2014 asare donkor et al 2016 the usepa 2005 considers cr value of 1 10 06 as the acceptable limit for carcinogens in groundwater for drinking the estimated cr of pb and as for adults in this study were 3 4 10 05 and 9 3 10 05 respectively whilst in children the estimated cr of pb and as were 1 3 10 04 and 4 6 10 04 respectively table 4 cr for zn and fe were not investigated due to unavailability of their respective slope factors it was observed that adults and children were potentially at risk to carcinogenic effects from pb and as and the potential exposures in children was approximately three folds that of adults 3 3 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the existence of vast fertile lands less than 5 of which had been cultivated over the past fifty years basically on very small scales had been established by ofosu et al 2014 sustainable quantities of groundwater resource in shallow aquifers within the atankwidi to support the up scaling of large scale dry season irrigational farming basin had been identified barry et al 2010 krishna et al 2010 knowledge of quality of the groundwater resource is therefore critical this is because groundwaters are generally more mineralized with dissolved salts and may adversely impact on soil quality and crop production in the medium to long term jalali 2008 an attempt has therefore been made in this study to evaluate the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the basin by utilizing equations 9 14 the results of estimated parameters and classification of groundwaters within the atankwidi basin of ghana are presented in tables 5 and 6 respectively 3 3 1 salinity index si one of the fundamental parameters of groundwater to be used for irrigation is si determined by measuring the ec according to bhat et al 2016 water with low to moderate values of salinity is mostly preferred for irrigation since it may present potentially less harm to soils and crops productivity measured ec values in this study ranged from 156 9 to 630 μs cm table 5 and according to the classification developed by ussl 1954 about 8 and 92 of groundwaters were classified as excellent and good respectively table 6 this according to bhat et al 2013 implies that almost all the groundwaters are suitable and therefore may not pose any hazard to soil properties and crop production in the long term 3 3 2 chlorinity index ci in determining the salt tolerant level of groundwater in the study area ci values were measured and observed to range from 7 09 mg l to 26 94 mg l about 88 of the groundwaters in the basin had ci values between 8 46 and 28 21 mg l which according to stuyfzand 1989 may be described as brackish water table 6 approximately 12 of the groundwater samples had ci values between 4 24mh l to 8 46 mg l and may therefore be described as fresh brackish water thus groundwaters in the area may not be suitable for chloride sensitive low tolerant crops such as carrots peas and soybean shannon and grieve 1998 but rather suitable for moderate chloride sensitive moderate salt tolerant crops such as rice millet maize potato pepper okra cauliflower broccoli cabbage onion and tomato maas 1986 lopez bereng et al 2008 inal et al 2009 shahbaz et al 2012 these crops incidentally are the traditional staple crops already being cultivated by the local farmers and for which up scaling of irrigational farming is targeting 3 3 3 percent sodium na high sodium concentrations in irrigation water causes soils to become compact and impervious thereby increases osmotic pressure restrict circulation of air and water to root zones the range of na in this study is 29 to 71 table 6 according to the criteria by wilcox and described in todd and mays 2005 about 12 of the sampled groundwaters were good 73 were within permissible class whilst about 15 were doubtful this implies that over 85 of groundwater could generally be described as fairly suitable for irrigation sodium is one of the most important parameters in determining the quality of any water for irrigational purpose since it could be very hazardous to soil structure and plant life according to nagaraju et al 2014 high levels of sodium may cause some deficiencies of magnesium and calcium in plant as they become immobilized leading to the incidence of leaf burn 3 3 4 sodium adsorption ration sar sar is a very well known and globally applied parameter which is very valuable in the evaluation of the water for irrigational purposes this is due to the fact that sar provides a better basis to determine the degree of hazard posed by sodium in irrigation water since it is directly related to the adsorption of sodium on surfaces of soils sar measures the proportion ratio of sodium ions to calcium and magnesium combined and this is due to the fact that excessive concentrations of sodium ions over the combined levels of calcium and magnesium affect soil characteristics and crop production according to todd and mays 2005 excessive na destroys the structure of soils by enhancing dispersion of clay particles increases soil rigidity and tillage which results in the reduction of soil osmotic activity of plants and prevention of adequate water supply to branches and leaves which leads to lower crop productivity subba rao 2002 estimated sar values table 5 in the current study ranged from 1 12 to 3 22 which according to todd and mays 2005 can be described as being excellent for use as irrigation water 3 3 5 residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc the concentrations of carbonate or bicarbonate or both when compared with the combined values of calcium and magnesium is an important parameter in evaluating water for irrigation purpose in typical igneous environment as in the case of the current study carbonates rarely occur in appreciable levels for precipitation of calcium and magnesium to occur thus residual bicarbonate rsbc estimation presents a realistic substitute to residual sodium carbonate rsc as an index to measure the alkalinity hazard if such waters are to be used for irrigation gupta et al 2008 concluded that waters with rsbc values exceeding 5 are unsuitable for use as irrigation waters whilst it is suitable when rsbc values are less than 5 the estimated rsbc values for groundwater in this study range from 2 16 to 6 43 about twenty three samples about 89 had rsbc values to be less than 5 whilst three samples about 12 were unsuitable 3 3 6 magnesium hardness mh magnesium has the potential to adversely affect soil structure especially in saline rich or sodic waters that may result in the eventual decrease in crop productivity srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 in most saline or sodic waters the presence of high concentrations of sodium results in the release of relatively high magnesium ions into solution rendering it alkaline and reducing the potential crop yield kumar et al 2009 according to szabolcs and darab 1964 waters with estimated mh greater than 50 is unsuitable for irrigation and would lead to reduced crop yields it is however considered suitable to support crop productivity when mh is less than 50 within the study area the estimated mh values from all the sampled twenty six groundwaters ranged from 3 to 39 implying that the groundwater in the area may be suitable for irrigation 3 3 7 permeability index pi the effects of sodic and alkalinity hazards which are basically dependent on sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate ions on the permeability of soils over a long period of irrigational water use is determined using what is referred to as permeability index according to doneen 1964 water with pi value less than 25 is considered unsuitable whereas water with pi of 25 75 is moderately suitable however the water is suitable if the pi value is greater than 75 the pi values for this study varied from 72 to 129 thus almost all the boreholes about 96 were suitable for irrigation over a long term period while only 4 were unsuitable with pi values greater than 75 4 conclusion over 80 of sampled groundwater were considered to have good and excellent drinking water based on wqi while the levels of ec hardness and fluoride were unacceptable in about four to six samples even though ec and hardness have no known health implications the occurrence of f outside the recommended range for potability may predispose inhabitants to incidences of dental caries weak bones and dental fluorosis over life time heavy metals i e pb as and zn had unacceptable concentrations in four nine and twelve groundwater samples respectively indicating potential health risks to adults children pregnant women and their unborn fetuses evaluation of hazard quotients and health hazard indices revealed that adults and children were at risk of non carcinogenic effects through ingestion of pb only and the potential risk was more than twice as high in children in comparison to adults cancer risks potential existed for children through ingestion and dermal pathways due to as and pb whilst for adults potential risk due to pb existed through ingestion estimated crs in children and adults due to as were more than twice that of pb over life time of groundwater consumption potential cancerous diseases likely to affect inhabitants over life time may include cancers of the bladder kidney liver and skin in adults and children whilst non cancerous diseases in adults may include hypertension diabetes neuropathic and nervous disorders cardiovascular malfunctioning specifically in men low sperm counts may occur whilst reduced conception and premature births may prevail in women for children low iq behavioral disorders still births and delayed puberty may occur based on irrigational quality evaluation groundwater was found to be largely suitable for use as irrigational water especially in the cultivation of moderate salt tolerant moderate sensitive crops such include but not limited to millet sorghum wheat okra tomato pepper cabbage etc but may not be suitable for the cultivation of low salt tolerant highly sensitive crops such as peas cucumber celery and radish acknowledgement the authors wish to express their profound gratitude

12207,this study has appraised groundwater suitability for drinking and irrigation and its potential health risk to humans within the atankwidi basin of ghana twenty six boreholes were sampled and their physicochemical and heavy metal constituents determined to evaluate the groundwater potability from water quality index computations chlorinity salinity permeability indices sodium adsorption ratio residual bicarbonate and magnesium hardness were also computed to assess the suitability of the groundwater for irrigation more so the hazard quotient hazard index and cancer risk of analyzed heavy metals were estimated to assess their potential carcinogenic risk to human health the results showed that four and nine samples had concentrations of as zn and pb exceeding respective who recommended limits of 0 001 mg l 0 006 mg l and 0 01 mg l fluoride levels in four samples exceeded the maximum who limit of 1 5 mg l whilst two samples were below the minimum limit of 0 5 mg l water quality indices revealed that about 80 of groundwaters were potable compared to adults children were more than twice vulnerable to potential carcinogenic effects over a life time through dermal and ingestion exposures the groundwater was generally found to be suitable for irrigation especially for moderate salt tolerant crops such as maize millet sorghum pepper tomatoes cabbage etc to minimize potential exposure to carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks there should be awareness creation to stop the use of agro chemicals for farming be avoided graphical abstract image 1 keywords atankwidi basin drinking water quality groundwater health risk assessment irrigation water quality ghana 1 introduction semi arid and arid regions generally consider groundwater as an invaluable renewable natural resource for the sustenance of human life and the ecosystem due to the fact that surface water resources had become increasingly unreliable both in quantity and quality wang et al 2001 awotwi et al 2015 asare donkor et al 2016 anim gyampo et al 2018a its unreliability may also stem from extreme and unfavorable climatic conditions e g low precipitation and high temperatures leading to excessive surficial water loses through processes of evapotranspiration according to appelo and postma 2005 in situations where it is available in sustainable quantities it easily becomes vulnerable to contamination from certain common anthropogenic activities these activities may include industrial mining waste disposal and agricultural activities that generate leachates into surface water reservoirs over time thereby rendering them unsuitable and very expensive to treat to meet the ever increasing demands of rapidly growing population in developing countries awotwi et al 2017 gomez et al 2017 groundwater on the other hand is much reliable both in quantity and quality asare donkor et al 2016 it is generally more ubiquitous in its natural occurrence much more mineralized and better protected from surficial contaminant sources the presence of natural attenuation capacities of vadose zones and the slow movement of infiltrating surficial waters through the pores in soils and fractures in rocks allows for adequate interaction of water with geologic media and may reduce contaminant loads sometimes completely before entering the saturated zones samantara et al 2017 groundwater has therefore become the most preferred source of sustainable water supply to meet domestic agricultural and industrial needs of humans in rural peri urban and urban settings in almost all developing countries countries found in the sub saharan africa ssa including ghana are of no exception obuobie 2008 despite the generally positives associated with groundwater use its quality is not sacrosanct anim gyampo et al 2018b but can be altered over geologic time through natural processes such as geochemical interactions such as the interactions between water and geologic media ion exchange reactions sea water intrusion extreme evaporation and transpiration mechanisms and biogeochemical activities appelo and postma 2005 artificially certain anthropogenic activities due to population boom and rapid urbanization may alter groundwater quality over time shah et al 2019 such activities and processes may include but not limited to leachates from agricultural fields that utilize agro chemicals and leachates from waste disposal sites geissen et al 2015 the atankwidi basin of ghana is a typical semi arid region where about 90 of inhabitants rely on groundwater as the main source of potable water throughout the year martin 2006 obuobie 2008 during prolonged dry seasons october may however groundwater is the only source of potable water van der berg 2008 there exists vast uncultivated fertile lands ofosu et al 2014 but the lack of reliable surface water resources had resulted in poor crop production over the past three decades barry et al 2010 which has rendered the inhabitants to be amongst the second poorest economically as well as second least in terms of food security in ghana to improve the poor socio economic status and food security of the inhabitants groundwater in shallow regolith and fractured aquifers has been found to be in reliable quantities to meet current and future domestic demands and also provide reliable supply to support an intended up scaling of irrigation farming by the government of ghana barry et al 2005 krishna et al 2010 ofosu et al 2014 obuobie 2014 whilst reasonable data on groundwater quantity i e recharge storativity and sustainability in the study area exist martin and van de giesen 2005 barry et al 2010 obuobie 2014 there is very little or no comprehensive data on groundwater quality to evaluate its suitability for domestic and irrigation as well as the risk associated with groundwater consumption thus this study seeks to provide a comprehensive baseline data on the quality of the groundwater for domestic and irrigations purposes as well as the potential risk s associated with groundwater consumption the study will aid stakeholders in future groundwater quality planning monitoring and evaluation to ensure sustainable utilization of the resource 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area fig 1 is located within longitude 0 50 1 10 w and latitude 10 45 11 00 n with an estimated total area about 156 km2 martin 2006 it is bounded to the west east north and south by kasena nankana municipality kasena nankana west district bolgatanga municipality and southern burkina faso respectively the climate is sudan savannah type which is characterized by high temperatures minimum and maximum daily values averages around 23 c and 35 c respectively average estimated annual evapotranspiration far exceeds annual rainfall values liebe 2002 rainfall occurs in a single but short season june september with precipitation values averaging about 990 mm year followed by a prolonged dry season october may two major air masses controlling the climate are the south west monsoon and northeast trade winds anim gyampo et al 2018a the geology of the area fig 2 is the paleoproterozoic birimian metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks and their respective syngeneic belt and basin granitoids formed during the eburnean orogeny approx 2 250 ma common rock units in the basin include metamorphosed lavas pyroclastic schist phyllites and biotite granite hornblende biotite granodiorite biotite gneiss and the younger potassium rich bongo granitoids approx 1970 ma soil types are leptosols lixisols and fluvisols anim gyampo et al 2018b hydrogeology of the area is formed by two main shallow aquifers the regolith aquifers which are unconfined continuous and occur at depths not exceeding approximately 23m and the fractured aquifers which are semi confined and occurs at depths exceeding 23m barry et al 2005 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis twenty six 26 groundwater samples from well distributed boreholes that tap groundwaters from shallow aquifers within the study area were collected during the peak of the dry period april when groundwater becomes the only source of water supply for inhabitants two groundwater samples each were collected into disinfected and well rinsed 500 ml polythene at each site after purging each for about 5 min to obtain representative samples samples earmarked for heavy metal analysis were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes and acidified with 2 v v of hno3 to keep ions in solution whilst the unacidified samples were kept physico chemical analysis electrical conductivity ec acidity ph and alkalinity were measured using wtw field conductivity meter model lft 91 wtw field ph meter model ph 95 and a hach digital titrator respectively color turbidity and total dissolved solids tds were measured using an electronic colorimeter model dr 890 sodium na and potassium k were measured using flame photometer whilst fast sequential atomic absorption spectrometer aas model aa240fs measured calcium ca and magnesium mg chloride fluoride nitrate and sulphate were measured by ion chromatograph model dionex ics 90 whilst phosphate was measured with ultraviolet spectrophotometer model uv 1201 heavy metals such as zinc zn lead pb copper cu chromium cr and cobalt co were measured using aas model varian aas240fs in an acetylene air flame whilst for arsenic as and mercury hg argon air flame was used 2 3 estimation of water quality index the evaluation of general suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes for each sample were achieved by estimating their respective water quality index wqi according to sahu and sikdar 2008 wqi reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters on picture of the quality of groundwater for most domestic uses the estimation of wqi requires the utilization of appropriate influential parameters ips dictated by the purpose to which the water is required in the case of drinking groundwater certain cations and anions as well as heavy metals may impose health implications on human health the selected ips for this study include ph ec ca mg f cl no3 so4 zn pb fe as used in this study the highest weight of five 5 was assigned to as pb and f due to their health significance to human health the wqi for each sampled groundwater was estimated using the equations 1 4 and results compared to the criteria defined by sahu and sikdar 2008 1 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the relative weight wi is the assigned weight to an influential parameter relative to its impact on the overall quality for drinking purpose in terms of health implications to humans the water quality rating qi according to sahu and sikdar 2008 is given by 2 q i c i s i 100 where q i is referred to as the water quality rating c i and s i represent the measured concentration in sampled groundwater and the respective standard who 2008 of the ith influential parameter the water quality sub index for each of the influential parameter sii is estimated as 3 si i q i w i where the symbols have their usual meanings 4 wqi i 1 n si i 2 4 estimation of health risks associated with groundwater consumption to assess the potential non carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk that inhabitants may be subjected to after the utilization of the groundwater for domestic purposes in the study area direct exposures through two common pathways namely dermal absorption and ingestion were considered this was due to fact that the exposures due to inhalations from showering tend to be relatively insignificant chai et al 2010 2 4 1 non carcinogenic risk assessment the estimation of hazard quotient hq of individual heavy metals allows for the determination of potential risk due to an individual metal in water as well as the overall risk associated hi hqi with the consumption of the water by humans as developed by usepa 2005 and it is estimated using equations 5 8 5 h q e x p o s u r e r f d where exposure is the dosage due to either direct ingestion e x p i n g or dermal absorption e x p d e r m all in mg kg day and r f d is the toxicity reference dose for each pathway the respective values of which are obtained from literature according to usepa 2005 non carcinogenic risk exposure may not exist via ingestion and dermal pathways if the estimated hq is less than 1 and the water is assumed to be safe however if hq value s for dermal and ingestion pathways exceed 1 then there is potential health concern with respect to a metal or metals in the water being consumed furthermore if the summation of the hqs referred to as hazard index hi for all metals and pathways measured in groundwater under consideration is greater than 1 then there is potential health risk associated with the consumption of such water by humans and vice versa according to usepa 2005 the health hazard index hi is estimated using the relation 6 h i n 1 n hq ing derm where hq ing derm is the hazard quotient for ingestion and dermal pathways 7 exp ing c w ir ef ed bw at 8 exp derm c w sa kp et ef ed cf bw at where e x p d e r m and e x p i n g are exposure doses through dermal

carcinogenic risk assessment to evaluate the carcinogenic risk effect of heavy metals consumed from groundwater through the dermal and ingestion pathways their respective cancer risks crderm and cring were calculated using the relation in equation 9 9 cr exposure cancer slope factor csf according to usepa 2005 the csf for cd cr as pb are 6 3 mg kg day 1 5 0e 01 mg kg day 1 1 5 mg kg day 1 and 8 5e 03 mg kg day 1 respectively csr values for zn and fe were unavailable and therefore their crs could not be estimated the range for the acceptability of cr is 10 6 to 10 4 usepa 2005 2 5 evaluation of groundwater suitability for irrigation groundwater is known to contain much dissolved ions cations and anions which can adversely affect the physical and chemical conditions of both plant life and soils such as lowering of the osmotic pressure that leads to reduced water flow or transmission through the various branches to leaves weakening of soil structure and texture which may lead to reduced permeability nagaraju et al 2014 common properties whose indices form the bases for ascertaining the suitability of groundwater for irrigation include salinity index si defined by the ec residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc sodium hazard expressed in sodium adsorption ratio sar and percent sodium na others include but not limited to wilcox plot soil permeability using permeability index pi chlorinity ci which uses the measured chloride concentration and magnesium hardness mh etc the relations used to estimate the above named indices except for si and ci are as follows 10 sodium

characteristics table 1 presents the statistically summarized physicochemical parameters as well as heavy metal concentrations from the analyzed sampled groundwaters from shallow aquifers within study area all the measured water quality parameters of the groundwater sampled within the study area fell within their respective acceptable limits for potable water prescribed by world health organization who 2008 with the exception of ec hardness and f in few samples table 1 water with a ph value of less than 7 is generally described being acidic medium soft corrosive and enhances the dissolution and leaching of metals from natural salts and man made materials such as pipes and other fixtures acidic waters i e ph 6 5 facilitate the dissolution of metals sometimes to permissible limits which according to nishtha et al 2012 can affect the mucous membrane of human cells the measured ph values in the current study ranged from 6 47 to 7 77 with a mean of approximately 7 08 per the classification by hounslow 1995 groundwater in the study area can generally be considered to be neutral total dissolved solids tds ranged from 80 1 mg l to 377 mg l with a mean of 228 mg l according to freeze and cherry 1979 water with tds less than 1000 mg l is fresh water and indicate the occurrence of young recharging groundwater according to nishtha et al 2012 the consumption of such water by inhabitants of the area may not predispose them to gastro intestinal irritation conductivity values ranged from 157 μs cm to 685 μs cm with a mean of 421 μs cm twenty one samples about 81 were within acceptable limits of who 2008 while five samples about 19 exceeded the maximum acceptable limit the low conductivity values in most parts of the study area may indicate possible shorter residence time of the groundwater in the study area hardness ranged from 164mg l to 364 mg l with a mean of 238 6 mg l five samples 19 had hardness values exceeding who 2008 acceptable limit of 300 mg l for drinking water whilst 81 fell within acceptable limit according to mcgowan 2000 encrustation and adverse effects on domestic use may occur when the permissible threshold of 300 mg l is exceeded according to saravanakumar and kumar 2011 groundwater in the area could be described as being predominantly hard because about 81 of the samples had values between 151 and 300 mg l with about 19 being very hard all nutrients no3 po4 and so4 were within acceptable limit for drinking water by human table 1 measured f concentration ranged from 0 38 mg l to 1 95 mg l twenty samples about 77 of groundwater had f concentrations within who recommended range 0 5 1 5 mg l for potable water fluoride in suitable dose i e 0 5 1 5 mg l has been found to promote the growth and strength of human bones and the teeth apambire et al 1997 however long term use of groundwater with fluoride concentrations outside the who 2008 permissible range of 0 5 1 5 mg l can result in serious health implications two samples mirigu and yua chingirigo had f values below the who 2008 recommended lower limit of 0 5 mg l which may lead to potential incidence of dental caries and weakness in bones of inhabitants over life time four samples about 15 located between zokkor and namoo areas had f values exceeding 1 5 mg l but less than 4 mg l indicating potential predisposition of inhabitants to dental fluorosis over life time who 2008 the observed high f levels in the northeastern parts of the study area fig 3 occurred within the bongo granitoids which had been recognized by apambire et al 1997 to be rich in f 3 1 2 chemical quality of groundwater for drinking purposes in determining the overall drinking water quality of groundwaters in the study area the results for wi wi sii and wqi using the selected ips for each of the twenty six selected point sources are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively the estimated wqis for the area ranged from 10 to 133 with a mean value of 34 table 3 according to sahu and sikdar 2008 drinking water is considered excellent if wqi is less or equal to 50 it is considered good water if wqi is greater than 50 but less than 100 100 200 are considered poor water 200 300 very poor and above 300 are unsuitable for drinking by human in the current study twenty two samples about 85 were excellent with wqi values ranging from 10 to 49 three samples about 12 had good quality with wqi values ranging from about 60 to 96 whilst only one sample about 3 had poor water quality with wqi value of 133 3 2 heavy metals concentrations and human health risk assessment of groundwater 3 2 1 heavy metals in sampled groundwaters all the twenty six 26 analyzed groundwater samples had levels of heavy metals either below their respective detection limits or fell within the acceptable limits who 2008 for drinking water except as pb and zn the distribution of as in the area is as shown in fig 4 measured levels of as ranged from 0 001 mg l to 0 009 mg l with a mean value of 0 013 mg l fig 4 four groundwater samples were found to contain levels of as above recommended limit of 0 001mg l for potable water this implies that the consumption of groundwater from these wells over life time may expose inhabitants to potential carcinogenic diseases such as lung and skin cancers who 2008 garcia et al 2013 whilst according to young et al 2014 non carcinogenic effects such as neurobehavioral abnormalities fetus mortality neuritis low intelligent quotient iq and memory loss may occur fig 5 shows the pb distribution in the basin where measured levels ranged from 0 0 005 mg l to 0 0255 mg l with a mean of 0 0128 mg l elevated pb levels exceeding recommended limit of 0 006 mg l for potable water were observed in nine 9 groundwater samples the concentrations of pb were found to be less than 5 μg dl which according to cdc 2012 fall within the category of low pb levels i e 0 9 μg dl to 2 55 μg dl the consumption of groundwater containing low pb levels over a life time may predispose inhabitants especially children to damaged central and peripheral nervous system shorter stature low iq impaired hearing and impaired formation and functioning of the blood cells in pregnant women low pb levels can cause reduced growth of fetus and premature birth thereby putting the lives of both unborn baby and mother at risk who 2008 cdc 2012 usepa 2017 the concentrations of zn ranged from 0 005 to 0 033 mg l with a mean of 0 002 mg l twelve groundwater samples fig 6 had zn levels slightly exceeding recommended value of 0 01 mg l for potable water who 2008 according to li and zhang 2010 in acceptable concentrations about 90 of zn can be found in the muscles and bones of the human body in such levels zn is an essential mineral and plays vital role in maintaining human health by helping in the synthesis of protein however at concentrations above the who 2008 recommended value in drinking water zn can be toxic to human health after prolonged consumption wastney et al 1986 concluded that the ingestion of water with high concentrations of zn over a life time may lead to cell deaths in the human brain trauma prostate cancer and the altering of the lymphocyte function thus the inhabitants within the areas where elevated levels of zn were observed fig 6 may be vulnerable to potential toxic effects the elevated concentrations of pb and as occurred in groundwaters found within the southwestern parts azaasi mirigu kandinga areas whilst that of zn occurred within the eastern through to north eastern parts kandiga zorkor namoo areas of the study area figs 4 6 these areas according to barry et al 2010 are well known for dry season vegetable cultivation with intensive utilization of agro chemicals such as weedicides pesticides and chemical fertilizers on small holder farms it could therefore be inferred that the elevated concentrations of as pb and zn in the shallow groundwater aquifers in the area could be associated with leaching from agricultural activities this is consistent with the findings of van assche and clijsters 1990 that in typical agricultural environments elevated concentrations of pb as zn and cd may commonly be due to leachates from agricultural fields that utilize extensive agro chemicals as part of their farm practices 3 2 2 human health risk assessment of groundwater whilst some heavy metals are generally essential to the promotion of human health e g zn and fe others can be very toxic e g as cd cr pb hg etc elevated concentrations above the levels recommended by who 2008 for potable water of some heavy metals namely as pb zn and fe were observed in some of the sampled groundwaters these metals when found on or within the human body could expose human to both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic implications including the incidences of various forms of cancer tirkey et al 2017 neurological and behavioral effects cdc 2012 diabetes and eye defects young et al 2014 according to the usepa 2005 the generally known three pathways by which humans could be at risk or exposed to potential hazards associated with certain harmful heavy metals i e as cd cr pb hg zn fe etc in water are ingestion dermal and inhalation for most domestic conditions the risk or hazards exposure through inhalation pathway is often insignificant compared with those from ingestion and dermal pathways lee et al 2002 therefore health risks or hazards through ingestion and dermal pathways only were assessed non carcinogenic hq and hi and carcinogenic risks cr were evaluated using equations 5 9 the results are shown in table 4 it is important to point out that cancer risks estimations for zn and fe were not done due to the unavailability of their slope factor values the estimated hazard quotient for dermal exposures hqderm for adults and children were less than one 1 for all the heavy metals table 4 which according to usepa 2005 indicate that little or no potential toxic effects on human health over life time furthermore the estimated hazard quotient for dermal and ingestion exposures hqderm and hqing for adults and children with respect to zn as and fe were less than one it was however observed that the hqing due to pb for adults and children were greater than one i e 1 134 and 4 328 respectively this implies that adults and children could potentially be at risk to adverse health effects from groundwater consumption over life time in assessing the non carcinogenic risks potential due to pb the hazard indices hi for both adults and children on exposure to groundwater consumption through ingestion and dermal contacts were estimated it was observed that hi for both adults and children due to pb exceeded one 1 with respective values being 1 134 and 4 328 this according to cdc 2012 implies that irrespective of age inhabitants in the study area were potentially at risk to non carcinogenic health effects associated with pb table 4 the observed relatively higher hi value for children presents even much health concern since according to schaumberg et al 2004 children and unborn babies fetus compared to adults are rather more vulnerable to non carcinogenic effects of pb even at very low levels such health effects may include damage to low iq shorter stature in children premature birth reduced fetal growth nervous system and dead blood cells who 2008 cdc 2012 hong et al 2014 in adults however common non carcinogenic health effects may include high blood pressure nervous disorders reduced kidney function delayed conception in women and formation of cataract iarc 2004 cdc 2012 schaumberg et al 2004 for both adults and children within the basin the potential for such health effects to occur may be exacerbated during the peak of the prolonged dry period because groundwater becomes the only source of potable water for all inhabitants in rural peri urban and urban areas in evaluating the carcinogenic effects the cancer risks cr were estimated as the incremental probability of an individual developing any form of cancerous effect over a long period carcinogenic exposure of groundwater consumption li and zhang 2010 cdc 2012 hong et al 2014 asare donkor et al 2016 the usepa 2005 considers cr value of 1 10 06 as the acceptable limit for carcinogens in groundwater for drinking the estimated cr of pb and as for adults in this study were 3 4 10 05 and 9 3 10 05 respectively whilst in children the estimated cr of pb and as were 1 3 10 04 and 4 6 10 04 respectively table 4 cr for zn and fe were not investigated due to unavailability of their respective slope factors it was observed that adults and children were potentially at risk to carcinogenic effects from pb and as and the potential exposures in children was approximately three folds that of adults 3 3 suitability of groundwater for irrigation the existence of vast fertile lands less than 5 of which had been cultivated over the past fifty years basically on very small scales had been established by ofosu et al 2014 sustainable quantities of groundwater resource in shallow aquifers within the atankwidi to support the up scaling of large scale dry season irrigational farming basin had been identified barry et al 2010 krishna et al 2010 knowledge of quality of the groundwater resource is therefore critical this is because groundwaters are generally more mineralized with dissolved salts and may adversely impact on soil quality and crop production in the medium to long term jalali 2008 an attempt has therefore been made in this study to evaluate the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation in the basin by utilizing equations 9 14 the results of estimated parameters and classification of groundwaters within the atankwidi basin of ghana are presented in tables 5 and 6 respectively 3 3 1 salinity index si one of the fundamental parameters of groundwater to be used for irrigation is si determined by measuring the ec according to bhat et al 2016 water with low to moderate values of salinity is mostly preferred for irrigation since it may present potentially less harm to soils and crops productivity measured ec values in this study ranged from 156 9 to 630 μs cm table 5 and according to the classification developed by ussl 1954 about 8 and 92 of groundwaters were classified as excellent and good respectively table 6 this according to bhat et al 2013 implies that almost all the groundwaters are suitable and therefore may not pose any hazard to soil properties and crop production in the long term 3 3 2 chlorinity index ci in determining the salt tolerant level of groundwater in the study area ci values were measured and observed to range from 7 09 mg l to 26 94 mg l about 88 of the groundwaters in the basin had ci values between 8 46 and 28 21 mg l which according to stuyfzand 1989 may be described as brackish water table 6 approximately 12 of the groundwater samples had ci values between 4 24mh l to 8 46 mg l and may therefore be described as fresh brackish water thus groundwaters in the area may not be suitable for chloride sensitive low tolerant crops such as carrots peas and soybean shannon and grieve 1998 but rather suitable for moderate chloride sensitive moderate salt tolerant crops such as rice millet maize potato pepper okra cauliflower broccoli cabbage onion and tomato maas 1986 lopez bereng et al 2008 inal et al 2009 shahbaz et al 2012 these crops incidentally are the traditional staple crops already being cultivated by the local farmers and for which up scaling of irrigational farming is targeting 3 3 3 percent sodium na high sodium concentrations in irrigation water causes soils to become compact and impervious thereby increases osmotic pressure restrict circulation of air and water to root zones the range of na in this study is 29 to 71 table 6 according to the criteria by wilcox and described in todd and mays 2005 about 12 of the sampled groundwaters were good 73 were within permissible class whilst about 15 were doubtful this implies that over 85 of groundwater could generally be described as fairly suitable for irrigation sodium is one of the most important parameters in determining the quality of any water for irrigational purpose since it could be very hazardous to soil structure and plant life according to nagaraju et al 2014 high levels of sodium may cause some deficiencies of magnesium and calcium in plant as they become immobilized leading to the incidence of leaf burn 3 3 4 sodium adsorption ration sar sar is a very well known and globally applied parameter which is very valuable in the evaluation of the water for irrigational purposes this is due to the fact that sar provides a better basis to determine the degree of hazard posed by sodium in irrigation water since it is directly related to the adsorption of sodium on surfaces of soils sar measures the proportion ratio of sodium ions to calcium and magnesium combined and this is due to the fact that excessive concentrations of sodium ions over the combined levels of calcium and magnesium affect soil characteristics and crop production according to todd and mays 2005 excessive na destroys the structure of soils by enhancing dispersion of clay particles increases soil rigidity and tillage which results in the reduction of soil osmotic activity of plants and prevention of adequate water supply to branches and leaves which leads to lower crop productivity subba rao 2002 estimated sar values table 5 in the current study ranged from 1 12 to 3 22 which according to todd and mays 2005 can be described as being excellent for use as irrigation water 3 3 5 residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc the concentrations of carbonate or bicarbonate or both when compared with the combined values of calcium and magnesium is an important parameter in evaluating water for irrigation purpose in typical igneous environment as in the case of the current study carbonates rarely occur in appreciable levels for precipitation of calcium and magnesium to occur thus residual bicarbonate rsbc estimation presents a realistic substitute to residual sodium carbonate rsc as an index to measure the alkalinity hazard if such waters are to be used for irrigation gupta et al 2008 concluded that waters with rsbc values exceeding 5 are unsuitable for use as irrigation waters whilst it is suitable when rsbc values are less than 5 the estimated rsbc values for groundwater in this study range from 2 16 to 6 43 about twenty three samples about 89 had rsbc values to be less than 5 whilst three samples about 12 were unsuitable 3 3 6 magnesium hardness mh magnesium has the potential to adversely affect soil structure especially in saline rich or sodic waters that may result in the eventual decrease in crop productivity srinivasamoorthy et al 2013 in most saline or sodic waters the presence of high concentrations of sodium results in the release of relatively high magnesium ions into solution rendering it alkaline and reducing the potential crop yield kumar et al 2009 according to szabolcs and darab 1964 waters with estimated mh greater than 50 is unsuitable for irrigation and would lead to reduced crop yields it is however considered suitable to support crop productivity when mh is less than 50 within the study area the estimated mh values from all the sampled twenty six groundwaters ranged from 3 to 39 implying that the groundwater in the area may be suitable for irrigation 3 3 7 permeability index pi the effects of sodic and alkalinity hazards which are basically dependent on sodium calcium magnesium and bicarbonate ions on the permeability of soils over a long period of irrigational water use is determined using what is referred to as permeability index according to doneen 1964 water with pi value less than 25 is considered unsuitable whereas water with pi of 25 75 is moderately suitable however the water is suitable if the pi value is greater than 75 the pi values for this study varied from 72 to 129 thus almost all the boreholes about 96 were suitable for irrigation over a long term period while only 4 were unsuitable with pi values greater than 75 4 conclusion over 80 of sampled groundwater were considered to have good and excellent drinking water based on wqi while the levels of ec hardness and fluoride were unacceptable in about four to six samples even though ec and hardness have no known health implications the occurrence of f outside the recommended range for potability may predispose inhabitants to incidences of dental caries weak bones and dental fluorosis over life time heavy metals i e pb as and zn had unacceptable concentrations in four nine and twelve groundwater samples respectively indicating potential health risks to adults children pregnant women and their unborn fetuses evaluation of hazard quotients and health hazard indices revealed that adults and children were at risk of non carcinogenic effects through ingestion of pb only and the potential risk was more than twice as high in children in comparison to adults cancer risks potential existed for children through ingestion and dermal pathways due to as and pb whilst for adults potential risk due to pb existed through ingestion estimated crs in children and adults due to as were more than twice that of pb over life time of groundwater consumption potential cancerous diseases likely to affect inhabitants over life time may include cancers of the bladder kidney liver and skin in adults and children whilst non cancerous diseases in adults may include hypertension diabetes neuropathic and nervous disorders cardiovascular malfunctioning specifically in men low sperm counts may occur whilst reduced conception and premature births may prevail in women for children low iq behavioral disorders still births and delayed puberty may occur based on irrigational quality evaluation groundwater was found to be largely suitable for use as irrigational water especially in the cultivation of moderate salt tolerant moderate sensitive crops such include but not limited to millet sorghum wheat okra tomato pepper cabbage etc but may not be suitable for the cultivation of low salt tolerant highly sensitive crops such as peas cucumber celery and radish acknowledgement the authors wish to express their profound gratitude

of groundwater sources in rural and urban settings in ethiopia hence the aim of this study is to assess the suitability of groundwater in jimma zone for drinking and irrigation purposes 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area jimma zone is one of the administrative zones of oromia national regional state ethiopia with an area of 15 568 58 km2 fig 1 the zone is situated in the igneous formations the highest point in this zone is mount maigudo with altitude of 2386 m the weather condition of the zone is generally humid except those places in dissected gorges and the temperature varies from 20 to 25 c haru et al 2012 most districts of jimma zone receive spring rain from february with intermittent rains continuing through october lemessa 2000 annual rainfall varies from 1600 to 2000 mm and at places even exceeds this value haru et al 2012 the area generally belongs to tropical climate the geological formations of the area are mainly tertiary volcanic flows pyroclastic flows pyroclastic

reliability check for groundwater data the quality and accuracy of analyzed water data have to be checked before interpretation the ionic balance can be checked by the sum of cations or anions comparing with the electrical conductivity divided by 100 as summation of cations or anions as given in eq 1 there was good correlation with r2 0 96 fig 2 which indicate the reliability of the groundwater data 1 cations meq l anions meq l ec μ s cm 1 100 3 2 suitability for drinking and domestic purposes water quality varies depending on soil types geological formations natural and anthropogenic processes the types and concentrations of different elements present in the groundwater depend on the associated rock bodies and the time it has been in contact with geological materials parameters such as na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 f ph ec tds and th are regarded as critical determinants for most development studies of water quality kumar et al 2007 sappa et al 2015 measurement of groundwater ph is essential because many of the solution processes such as aqueous complexation water rock interactions mineral solubility and adsorption properties gas solubility and biochemical reactions are ph sensitive hasen 2011 the ph of the groundwater was within permissible value of 6 5 8 5 federal ministry of water resources 2002 world health organization 2006 the ph of most of the groundwater samples were nearly neutral and about 93 8 of the samples have ph less than 8 which indicates the absence of carbonate in the water and this could indicate that the area is discharge area the evolution of chemical composition of groundwater from recharge areas to discharge areas is characterized by increasing sodium chloride and sulfate contents as a result of leaching of evaporite rock jameel and sirajudeen 2006 granitic terrain decomposition increases the concentration of sodium ion jameel and sirajudeen 2006 na is an essential macro mineral for our body but excess consumption of na is related with hypertension the concentration of na in nine groundwater 25 exceeded the permissible value according to who 200 mg l and in two groundwater 6 were above 358 mg l according to fmowr table 1 an excess or absence of fluoride in drinking water is harmful to health mohan et al 2012 fluoride was identified as the major problem for the suitability of the groundwater in the study area according to who guideline about 46 9 of the groundwater had excess f 1 5 mg l which can be a public health concern higher f intake can cause potential health hazards such as dental and skeletal fluorosis mohan et al 2012 excess f can come from leaching of acid volcanic rocks containing alkaline minerals the interaction of f bearing rock minerals with water and agricultural practices are considered to be the main sources for f in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2003 rocks containing fluoride minerals are generally responsible for high concentration of fluoride in groundwater subba 2003 generally groundwater quality varies from place to place depending on seasonal changes vaishali and punita 2013 the types of soils rocks and surfaces through which it moves seth et al 2014 naturally occurring contaminants present in rocks soils and sediments in the study area f concentration was different due to the difference in lithological formation the samples from chora botor jimma town gomma and kersa districts exhibited excess f concentration fig 3 high f occurrence in groundwater is expected from sodium bicarbonate type water which is calcium deficient the alkalinity of water also helps in mobilizing fluoride from fluorite caf2 the result of the study indicated that the concentration of ca 2 in the water was low this may limit the precipitation of f in the form of caf2 rango et al 2012 which could increase the concentration of f in the water the concentrations of f were plotted against the depths of the sampled wells fig 4 the depth of the groundwater wells ranges from 55 to 246 m the result showed that the f concentration is poorly correlated with the depth of the well but the study conducted in south arabia shows that comparatively higher levels of fluoride were found in relatively less deep wells which may be attributed to contamination from the external sources alabdulaaly et al 2013 fig 5 shows box whisker diagram of f concentration of the study area 3 3 suitability for irrigation purpose most of the irrigation activities in the study area depend on the groundwater the concentration and composition of dissolved substances in the water determines the suitability of the water for agricultural uses the characteristics of water most important in determining its quality for irrigation purpose are total concentration of soluble salts relative proportion of na to other cations and concentration of boron or other elements that may be toxic dessie 2010 3 3 1 salinity index salinity indices of groundwater samples were calculated using the measured electrical conductivity singh et al 2012 salinity determines suitability of water for its intended use according to the classification given by mills singh et al 2012 most of the samples were categorized under class ii 62 5 and class iii 31 2 these samples showed moderate to high salinity and may be considered as suitable for irrigation no sample was fallen into very high salinity hazard category 3 3 2 sodicity index groundwater with a high na concentration is not suitable for irrigation high na deposition deteriorates soil characteristics the sar is commonly used to assess irrigation water suitability singh et al 2012 it determines the degree to which na will be absorbed by the soil sodicity indices were calculated using sar computed using eq 2 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 the na ca2 and mg2 concentrations are expressed in meq l the sar predicts the na hazard of high carbonate waters especially if they contain no residual alkali rao 2006 groundwater samples were classified based on sar values sar 3 class i no na problem sar 3 to 6 class ii low na few problems except with na sensitive crops sar 6 to 8 class iii medium na increasing problems sar 8 to 14 class iv high na not generally recommended and sar 14 class v disregard very high na unsuitable class i and ii waters are generally considered suitable for irrigation more than half of the samples are categorized under class i 53 and class ii 9 which have no na problem about 37 5 of samples exceeded class ii 12 5 in class iii 6 in class iv and class v 18 8 indicating poor quality for irrigation the samples which are categorized under class iv and v are go2 and go3 of gomma district cb1 cb2 and cb4 of chora botor district and jt1 jt2 and jt5 of jimma town which are not generally recommended for irrigation 3 3 3 the us salinity laboratory s diagram the us salinity laboratory s diagram ussld is widely used for rating irrigation waters us salinity laboratory staff 1954 sar was plotted against ec fig 6 the resulting diagram was divided into 16 areas which are used to rate the degree to which a particular water may give rise to salinity problems and undesirable ion exchange effects in soil the data points fall in c1s1 6 of the samples c2s1 56 of the samples c2s2 6 of the samples c3s2 9 of the samples c3s3 9 of the samples c3s4 12 5 of the samples groups table 2 good waters can be used for irrigating most crops on most soils with little or no danger of harmful levels from exchangeable na moderate waters can be used to irrigate salt tolerant and semi tolerant crops under favorable drainage conditions the bad waters are generally undesirable or unsatisfactory for irrigation and should not be used on clayey soils of low permeability however it can be used to irrigate high salt tolerance plants when grown on previously salty soils to protect against further decline in fertility karanth 1987 3 3 4 ec and na ec and na concentration are also very important in classifying irrigation water the na is computed with respect to relative proportions of cations present in water using eq 3 where ions concentrations are expressed in meq l 3 na na k ca 2 mg 2 na k 100 wilcox s diagram where ec is plotted against percent na is used to further classify groundwater for irrigation the na ranges between 18 7 and 93 68 average 64 3 a high na causes deflocculation soils tilt and permeability impairment singh et al 2012 plot of ec versus na is important in classifying groundwater into different irrigation suitability classes about 56 of the samples were excellent to good followed by 22 belonging to permissible to doubtful and 22 of the samples fall into doubtful to unsuitable category for irrigation use fig 7 3 3 5 magnesium hazard mh mg2 is an important parameter in determining the water quality for agricultural uses in general ca2 and mg2 maintain a state of equilibrium in most waters mh value is proposed to evaluate water for irrigation rao 2006 which can be calculated as a percentage using eq 4 where all the ions are expressed in meq l 4 mh mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 100 the calculatedmg2 ratio ranged from 9 4 to 62 3 mean 35 6 for groundwater samples in the study area only four samples se1 in seka district jt4 in jimma town cb1 in chora botor district and go3 in gomma district exceeded the acceptable mg2 ratio limit of 50 us salinity laboratory staff 1954 such high mg2 content in water unfavorably affects crop productivity as the soil becomes more saline the majority of the waters were therefore considered suitable for irrigation 3 4 total hardness depending on ph and alkalinity hardness above 200 mg l can result in scale deposition particularly on heating soft waters with hardness of less than 100 mg l have a low buffering capacity and may be more corrosive to water pipes a number of ecological and analytical epidemiological studies show a statistically significant inverse relationship between hardness of drinking water and cardiovascular disease there is some indication that very soft waters may have an adverse effect on mineral balance but detailed studies were not available for evaluation total hardness has been estimated from ca2 and mg2 concentrations and calculated as mg l caco3using eq 5 ayers and westcot 1985 american public health association apha 2005 5 th 2 497 ca 2 4 118 mg 2 hardness is commonly classified in terms of degree of hardness as 1 soft 0 75 mg l 2 moderate 75 150 mg l 3 hard 150 300 mg l and very hard 300 mg l the results of the study show the total hardness ranges from 27 4 to 268 1 which were observed in samples from jt4 and cb6 respectively groundwater samples from lk4 cb3 cb4 cb5 cb6 and go3 were identified as hard water half of the groundwater samples were moderate in hardness and 31 were soft water 4 conclusion groundwater is an important source of drinking water for many people around the world contamination of groundwater generally results in poor drinking water quality loss of water supply high cleanup costs high cost alternative water supplies and potential health problem in present study the concentration of na in 25 of the groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible value about 47 of the samples contained excess f which is a public health concern the study also revealed that 68 8 of the samples were good 18 8 were moderate and 12 5 were bad water for irrigation uses high concentrations of f and na make the water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation uses respectively in some groundwater samples thus low cost defluoridation technique is required to use the water from the groundwater wells containing f concentration above the permissible value surface water sources should be used for irrigation instead of high sodium containing groundwater

comparing with the electrical conductivity divided by 100 as summation of cations or anions as given in eq 1 there was good correlation with r2 0 96 fig 2 which indicate the reliability of the groundwater data 1 cations meq l anions meq l ec μ s cm 1 100 3 2 suitability for drinking and domestic purposes water quality varies depending on soil types geological formations natural and anthropogenic processes the types and concentrations of different elements present in the groundwater depend on the associated rock bodies and the time it has been in contact with geological materials parameters such as na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl so4 2 f ph ec tds and th are regarded as critical determinants for most development studies of water quality kumar et al 2007 sappa et al 2015 measurement of groundwater ph is essential because many of the solution processes such as aqueous complexation water rock interactions mineral solubility and adsorption properties gas solubility and biochemical reactions are ph sensitive hasen 2011 the ph of the groundwater was within permissible value of 6 5 8 5 federal ministry of water resources 2002 world health organization 2006 the ph of most of the groundwater samples were nearly neutral and about 93 8 of the samples have ph less than 8 which indicates the absence of carbonate in the water and this could indicate that the area is discharge area the evolution of chemical composition of groundwater from recharge areas to discharge areas is characterized by increasing sodium chloride and sulfate contents as a result of leaching of evaporite rock jameel and sirajudeen 2006 granitic terrain decomposition increases the concentration of sodium ion jameel and sirajudeen 2006 na is an essential macro mineral for our body but excess consumption of na is related with hypertension the concentration of na in nine groundwater 25 exceeded the permissible value according to who 200 mg l and in two groundwater 6 were above 358 mg l according to fmowr table 1 an excess or absence of fluoride in drinking water is harmful to health mohan et al 2012 fluoride was identified as the major problem for the suitability of the groundwater in the study area according to who guideline about 46 9 of the groundwater had excess f 1 5 mg l which can be a public health concern higher f intake can cause potential health hazards such as dental and skeletal fluorosis mohan et al 2012 excess f can come from leaching of acid volcanic rocks containing alkaline minerals the interaction of f bearing rock minerals with water and agricultural practices are considered to be the main sources for f in groundwater saxena and ahmed 2003 rocks containing fluoride minerals are generally responsible for high concentration of fluoride in groundwater subba 2003 generally groundwater quality varies from place to place depending on seasonal changes vaishali and punita 2013 the types of soils rocks and surfaces through which it moves seth et al 2014 naturally occurring contaminants present in rocks soils and sediments in the study area f concentration was different due to the difference in lithological formation the samples from chora botor jimma town gomma and kersa districts exhibited excess f concentration fig 3 high f occurrence in groundwater is expected from sodium bicarbonate type water which is calcium deficient the alkalinity of water also helps in mobilizing fluoride from fluorite caf2 the result of the study indicated that the concentration of ca 2 in the water was low this may limit the precipitation of f in the form of caf2 rango et al 2012 which could increase the concentration of f in the water the concentrations of f were plotted against the depths of the sampled wells fig 4 the depth of the groundwater wells ranges from 55 to 246 m the result showed that the f concentration is poorly correlated with the depth of the well but the study conducted in south arabia shows that comparatively higher levels of fluoride were found in relatively less deep wells which may be attributed to contamination from the external sources alabdulaaly et al 2013 fig 5 shows box whisker diagram of f concentration of the study area 3 3 suitability for irrigation purpose most of the irrigation activities in the study area depend on the groundwater the concentration and composition of dissolved substances in the water determines the suitability of the water for agricultural uses the characteristics of water most important in determining its quality for irrigation purpose are total concentration of soluble salts relative proportion of na to other cations and concentration of boron or other elements that may be toxic dessie 2010 3 3 1 salinity index salinity indices of groundwater samples were calculated using the measured electrical conductivity singh et al 2012 salinity determines suitability of water for its intended use according to the classification given by mills singh et al 2012 most of the samples were categorized under class ii 62 5 and class iii 31 2 these samples showed moderate to high salinity and may be considered as suitable for irrigation no sample was fallen into very high salinity hazard category 3 3 2 sodicity index groundwater with a high na concentration is not suitable for irrigation high na deposition deteriorates soil characteristics the sar is commonly used to assess irrigation water suitability singh et al 2012 it determines the degree to which na will be absorbed by the soil sodicity indices were calculated using sar computed using eq 2 2 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 the na ca2 and mg2 concentrations are expressed in meq l the sar predicts the na hazard of high carbonate waters especially if they contain no residual alkali rao 2006 groundwater samples were classified based on sar values sar 3 class i no na problem sar 3 to 6 class ii low na few problems except with na sensitive crops sar 6 to 8 class iii medium na increasing problems sar 8 to 14 class iv high na not generally recommended and sar 14 class v disregard very high na unsuitable class i and ii waters are generally considered suitable for irrigation more than half of the samples are categorized under class i 53 and class ii 9 which have no na problem about 37 5 of samples exceeded class ii 12 5 in class iii 6 in class iv and class v 18 8 indicating poor quality for irrigation the samples which are categorized under class iv and v are go2 and go3 of gomma district cb1 cb2 and cb4 of chora botor district and jt1 jt2 and jt5 of jimma town which are not generally recommended for irrigation 3 3 3 the us salinity laboratory s diagram the us salinity laboratory s diagram ussld is widely used for rating irrigation waters us salinity laboratory staff 1954 sar was plotted against ec fig 6 the resulting diagram was divided into 16 areas which are used to rate the degree to which a particular water may give rise to salinity problems and undesirable ion exchange effects in soil the data points fall in c1s1 6 of the samples c2s1 56 of the samples c2s2 6 of the samples c3s2 9 of the samples c3s3 9 of the samples c3s4 12 5 of the samples groups table 2 good waters can be used for irrigating most crops on most soils with little or no danger of harmful levels from exchangeable na moderate waters can be used to irrigate salt tolerant and semi tolerant crops under favorable drainage conditions the bad waters are generally undesirable or unsatisfactory for irrigation and should not be used on clayey soils of low permeability however it can be used to irrigate high salt tolerance plants when grown on previously salty soils to protect against further decline in fertility karanth 1987 3 3 4 ec and na ec and na concentration are also very important in classifying irrigation water the na is computed with respect to relative proportions of cations present in water using eq 3 where ions concentrations are expressed in meq l 3 na na k ca 2 mg 2 na k 100 wilcox s diagram where ec is plotted against percent na is used to further classify groundwater for irrigation the na ranges between 18 7 and 93 68 average 64 3 a high na causes deflocculation soils tilt and permeability impairment singh et al 2012 plot of ec versus na is important in classifying groundwater into different irrigation suitability classes about 56 of the samples were excellent to good followed by 22 belonging to permissible to doubtful and 22 of the samples fall into doubtful to unsuitable category for irrigation use fig 7 3 3 5 magnesium hazard mh mg2 is an important parameter in determining the water quality for agricultural uses in general ca2 and mg2 maintain a state of equilibrium in most waters mh value is proposed to evaluate water for irrigation rao 2006 which can be calculated as a percentage using eq 4 where all the ions are expressed in meq l 4 mh mg 2 ca 2 mg 2 100 the calculatedmg2 ratio ranged from 9 4 to 62 3 mean 35 6 for groundwater samples in the study area only four samples se1 in seka district jt4 in jimma town cb1 in chora botor district and go3 in gomma district exceeded the acceptable mg2 ratio limit of 50 us salinity laboratory staff 1954 such high mg2 content in water unfavorably affects crop productivity as the soil becomes more saline the majority of the waters were therefore considered suitable for irrigation 3 4 total hardness depending on ph and alkalinity hardness above 200 mg l can result in scale deposition particularly on heating soft waters with hardness of less than 100 mg l have a low buffering capacity and may be more corrosive to water pipes a number of ecological and analytical epidemiological studies show a statistically significant inverse relationship between hardness of drinking water and cardiovascular disease there is some indication that very soft waters may have an adverse effect on mineral balance but detailed studies were not available for evaluation total hardness has been estimated from ca2 and mg2 concentrations and calculated as mg l caco3using eq 5 ayers and westcot 1985 american public health association apha 2005 5 th 2 497 ca 2 4 118 mg 2 hardness is commonly classified in terms of degree of hardness as 1 soft 0 75 mg l 2 moderate 75 150 mg l 3 hard 150 300 mg l and very hard 300 mg l the results of the study show the total hardness ranges from 27 4 to 268 1 which were observed in samples from jt4 and cb6 respectively groundwater samples from lk4 cb3 cb4 cb5 cb6 and go3 were identified as hard water half of the groundwater samples were moderate in hardness and 31 were soft water 4 conclusion groundwater is an important source of drinking water for many people around the world contamination of groundwater generally results in poor drinking water quality loss of water supply high cleanup costs high cost alternative water supplies and potential health problem in present study the concentration of na in 25 of the groundwater samples exceeded the maximum permissible value about 47 of the samples contained excess f which is a public health concern the study also revealed that 68 8 of the samples were good 18 8 were moderate and 12 5 were bad water for irrigation uses high concentrations of f and na make the water unsuitable for drinking and irrigation uses respectively in some groundwater samples thus low cost defluoridation technique is required to use the water from the groundwater wells containing f concentration above the permissible value surface water sources should be used for irrigation instead of high sodium containing groundwater

12209,to evaluate the trace element contamination level and human health risk in study area a total of twenty groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for ph ec cu cd fe mn ni and zn the results revealed that groundwater is slightly acidic in nature with the mean conductance of 686 10 μs cm heavy metal evaluation index hei the degree of contamination c d and nemerow pollution index ni were employed to estimate the pollution load and it was found 5 95 and 75 of samples exhibits the high degree of pollution respectively according to the spatial analysis it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated with trace elements moreover pearson correlation principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were applied to identify the pollution source and factors controlling groundwater quality and the results indicates that groundwater of the study area were influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors chronic health risk via exposure of both oral and dermal routes were also determined by calculating the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for both adults and children in case of oral exposure almost 85 of samples suggest the medium category of chronic risk for adult and 50 of samples were found at high risk for children again dermal exposure showed comparatively lower risk than oral exposure and 55 and 80 of samples attributed medium chronic risk for adult and children respectively however the carcinogenic risk of cadmium cd via oral exposure pathway suggest all of the samples are at high risk for both adults and children average lifetime cancer risks ltcr of cd for both adult and children were found to be 4 55e 4 and 5 59e 4 respectively that indicated high carcinogenic risk results of sensitivity

multivariate statistics sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role for the sustenance of living beings and considered as a safe reserve of good quality water bhutiani et al 2016 batabyal 2018 in many countries in the world its used as the major sources for drinking irrigation and industrial needs due to its instant availability and natural protection from microbial contamination al khashman and jaradat 2014 aghazadeh et al 2017 selvam et al 2017 saha et al 2018 the rapid increase of population and surface water contamination over the last few decades in bangladesh has made excessive demands on groundwater resources hasan et al 2007 islam 2014 dey et al 2017 bodrud doza et al 2019a b but it is now a matter of concern as groundwater is contaminated by various trace metals in excess of natural background loads ahmed et al 2004 biswas et al 2012 islam et al 2017a uddin et al 2018 which may have serious health effects due to their toxic persistence and carcinogenic in nature naz et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 generally water used for drinking purpose with small quantities of trace metals can help in normal functioning of the human body but in excess and expose in long time can be toxic to human health islam et al 2017b vetrimurugan1 et al 2017 groundwater contamination may occur from geological phenomena like ore formation weathering of rocks and leaching or due to increased population urbanization industrial activities agricultural practices exploration and exploitation of natural resources bhattacharya et al 2002 von brömssen et al 2007 lee et al 2014 bhutiani et al 2016 aghazadeh et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019 former studies evident that a wide range of public health issues like hypertension cancer vascular disease restrictive lung disease gastrointestinal bleeding neurological disorder and reproductive effects may appear due to consumption of water contaminated with trace metals lu et al 2015 das et al 2016 noubissié et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 belabed and soltani 2018 haouti et al 2018 nkpaa et al 2018 singh et al 2018 for instance excess intakes of copper cu with drinking water

health celebi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 tirkey et al 2017 singh et al 2018 it involves identifying risk indices of potential risk sources estimating the values of risk indices and quantifying the health consequences of exposure ni et al 2010 generally four steps i e hazard identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization were widely used to determine the human health risk ma et al 2007 rahman et al 2017 usepa delineates human health risk assessment by estimating the probability of health effects on humans via contaminated chemicals ma et

determine the influential factors with possible reasons shrestha and kazama 2007 giri and singh 2015 ahmed et al 2019 islam et al 2018 however damurhuda is situated in the central west part of bangladesh and groundwater is used as the main source for domestic and agricultural purpose excess withdrawal agricultural leaching with others geogenic factors may take part in the deterioration of groundwater quality in study area bgs and dphe 2001 local peoples used groundwater in drinking domestic and agricultural needs in case of domestic use groundwater can harm humans through drinking and dermal contact exposure pathways wu and sun 2016 rezaei et al 2018 considering the above all issues the present study intended to determine the level of trace elements in the groundwater samples along with their health risk assessment of adult and children s exposures via both oral and dermal pathways a set of pollution evaluation indices with multivariate statistics were used to delineate the groundwater quality and human health risk of drinking use which could be used as a baseline study for future groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area damurhuda upazila under chuadanga district is located in the central west part of bangladesh a part of gangetic delta geographically it positioned between 23 29 and 23 42 n latitudes and 88 39 and 88 51 e longitudes fig 1 geologically the area lies in the faridpur trough of bengal foredeep which is nearly the hinge zone in the west and barisal faridpur uplift in the east faridpur trough is characterized by a general gravity low of northeast trend which is apparently related to general subsidence of basement khan 1991 lithological characteristics of the study area is composed of coarse to fine grained sediments gravely sand and some places fine sand to silt deposits dphe jica 2010 hossain et al 2014 however the total area of the upazila is 308 11 km2 with the population of 2 13 291 bbs 2011 annual average temperature in study area varied from 11 2 to 37 1 c with an annual average rainfall 1467 mm bmd 2018 major land use categories identified in damurhuda upazila are agricultural land use rural settlement and homestead vegetation and water bodies agriculture lands occupy more than three quarters land of the study area the sources of drinking water for the natives are tube well 94 53 tap water 1 02 pond water 0 12 and others 4 33 banglapedia 2015 so major portion of water that meet the local demands are coming from the groundwater resources total 18 77 urban 34 63 and rural 14 27 of dwelling households of the upazila use sanitary latrines and 50 65 urban 43 39 and rural 52 71 of dwelling households use non sanitary latrines 30 58 of households do not have latrine facilities bbs 2011 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 20 groundwater samples were collected from the preselected sampling locations of the study area fig 1 during the period of june 2016 the depths of the sampled tube wells were varied from 40 to 90 ft 12 19 27 43 m recorded from the information from well owners geographical locations of the selected wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were collected using pre washed high density polyethylene bottles the bottles were cleaned by soaking in 0 5 mol l hcl followed by 0 1 mol l naoh for 24 h each the samples were stored on ice box and returned to the laboratory for measurement of metal concentrations 65 concentrated hno3 acid were added to each sample immediately to bring the ph blow 2 to minimize precipitation and adsorption onto bottles walls apha 1998 the physicochemical parameters i e temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured with calibrated portable instruments the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was used to measure ph of groundwater electrical conductivity ec was measured using a conductivity meter jenway model 4520 and temperature was also read from the same meter elemental analysis e g cu cd fe mn ni and zn was done by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model spectraa 55b varian water sample were digested with concentrated hno3 acid for trace metal determination as described by apha 1998 the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate analysis of 10 of all samples and analysis of check standards for every 10 samples were performed to assess measurement error and to check for accuracy and precision of measurement technique 2 3 pollution evaluation indices heavy metal evaluation index hei degree of contamination c d and nemerow pollution index ni were investigated for the purpose of evaluating drinking suitability hei gives an insight the overall quality of the groundwater with respect to trace metals edet and offiong 2002 and calculate by following 1 h e i i 1 n h c h m a c where h c monitored value and h mac maximum admissible concentration mac of the ith parameter the degree of heavy metal index was classified into three divisions like hei 10 low hei 10 20 medium and hei 20 high edet and offiong 2002 bodrud doza et al 2016 the degree of contamination c d indicates the overall effects of each contaminants or water quality parameters islam et al 2016 and calculated by following backman et al 1997 equation 2 c d i 1 n c f i where c f i c a i c n i 1 c fi contamination factor c ai analytical value the ith component c ni upper permissible concentration of the ith component and n normative value here c ni is considered as mac the pollution level was divided into three categories cd 1 low cd 1 3 medium and cd high edet and offiong 2002 however ni applied to determine how different heavy metals pollute groundwater at the sampling sites of the study area zhong et al 2015 and calculated by 3 n i 1 n c i s i 2 max c i s i 2 2 were n number of indices c i measured content of heavy metal i s i standard value heavy metal pollution in groundwater is divided by ni into 6 like no pollution 0 5 clean 0 5 0 7 warm 0 7 1 0 polluted 1 0 2 0 medium pollution 2 0 3 0 and severe pollution 3 0 zhong et al 2015 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis to evaluate analytical data multivariate statistical techniques i e correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used by using spss version 22 0 software for windows principal component analysis was applied to identify the hypothetical sources of heavy metals exploratory factor analysis was performed by varimax rotation method howitt and cramer 2005 that reduced the variable number with a high loading on every component thus facilitating the interpretation of pca results principal components pcs gives identification of the most influential parameters from the whole data set introducing data reduction with minimum loss of baseline information hair et al 1995 vega et al 1998 this analysis also minimizes the contribution of less significant variables generated from pca and the new group of variables generated from pca vega et al 1998 wunderlin et al 2001 pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to support the results obtained from pca and to determine the constituent variances that can be explained by its inter relationship with others liu et al 2003 cluster analysis was further introduced to delineate groups of samples with similar heavy metal contents panda et al 2006 and to provide supportive information to the results obtained from pca ca was calculated by ward algorithmic method and squared euclidean distance was considered to identify the distance between clusters of similar metal contents bhuiyan et al 2010 2 5 human health risk assessment 2 5 1 chronic risk assessment the health risk assessment of each heavy metal or metalloid is usually based on quantification of the risk level and is expressed in terms of carcinogenic or non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 the two principal toxicity risk factors evaluated are the slope factor sf for carcinogen risk characterization and the reference dose rfd for non carcinogen risk characterization lim et al 2008 both oral and dermal exposure pathway were considered for the assessment and the chronic daily intake cdi of elements via oral and dermal pathways were calculated by followings usepa 1989 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 4 c d i o r a l c w i r e f e d b w a t 5 c d i d e r m a l c w s a k p e t e f e d c f b w a t where cdi oral and cdi dermal indicates the exposure dose mg kg day via oral ingestion and dermal pathway which calculated using the parameters value of table 1 potential non carcinogenic risks for exposure to contaminants of potential concern were evaluated by comparison of the estimated contaminant intakes from each exposure route oral dermal with the reference dose rfd to produce the hazard quotient hq defined by usepa 1989 if the value of hq exceeds 1 there is an unacceptable risk of adverse non carcinogenic effects on health while if the hq is less than 1 it is at an acceptable level usepa 2001 giri and singh 2015 6 h q c d i r f d where hq hazard quotient unit less and rfd is the reference dose μg kg day originates from risk based concentration table usepa 2001 to assess the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects posed by more than one chemical the hqs calculated for each chemical are summed and expressed as hazard index hi usepa 1989 7 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q n if hi does not exceed unity hi 1 no chronic risks were assumed to occur at the site and if hi 1 it implies that the non carcinogenic health risk usepa 1989 yang et al 2012 2 5 2 carcinogenic risk assessment carcinogenic risks were estimated as the incremental probability of an individual developing cancer over a lifetime as a result of exposure to a potential carcinogen rahman et al 2017 the following linear dose carcinogenic risk equations were used for each exposure route by following usepa 1989 8 l o w d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k c d i s f 9 h i g h d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k 1 exp c d i s f where risk stood for cancer risk and sf is the slope factor of contaminants mg kg day the toxicity responses of trace elements for the oral and dermal reference dose rfd and oral slope factor sf are presented in table 2 if the calculated value is higher than 0 01 only then formula in equation 9 was considered an acceptable level was considered at 1 10 6 which means on average the probability is that approximately 1 person per 1 000 000 will develop cancer as a consequence of the exposure lim et al 2008 risk in the range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 typically considered as acceptable usepa 1992 yang et al 2012 detail scale of chronic and carcinogenic risk assessment are shows in table 3 the lifetime cancer risk ltcr was calculated through multiplication of chronic daily intake cdi oral by cancer slope factor sforal which is determined by integrated risk information system iris as follows miri et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 10 ltcr cdi oral sf oral cadmium cd is considered as one of the carcinogenic elements which sf oral values is 0 38 table 2 hence the risk of carcinogenicity was calculated only for cadmium in this study however sensitivity analysis technique was used in this study to determine how different values of input variables can affect risk estimation in a given set of assumptions in addition risk assessment was carried out by monte carlo simulation technique using the software crystal ball version 11 1 2 3 created by oracle co oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 3 lu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 arcgis version 10 1 was also used for mapping of sample locations and to show the spatial distribution of pollution indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace elements concentrations the summary of the measured parameters of groundwater samples along with standard permissible limits are in presented table 4 the ph values of the groundwater samples varied from 6 25 to 6 88 with a mean value of 6 47 which indicates the water is slightly acidic in nature among 20 samples only 40 falls within the permissible limits for drinking purpose electrical conductivity ec is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 islam 2014 higher ec values indicate increased concentration of dissolved solids and high ionic strength of the groundwater islam et al 2017b ahmed et al 2019 however ec of the studied water samples ranges from 403 to 1080 μs cm with a mean of 686 10 μs cm though mean value lies within the permissible limits but 30 samples exceed the limits recommended by usepa 2006 the maximum concentration of cu in groundwater of the study area was found 393 90 μg l with a mean value of 334 73 μg l mean concentration of cu was found within the permissible limit of all standards however the maximum concentration of cd in groundwater of the study area is 60 2 μg l with an average value and standard deviation of 33 16 μg l and 13 98 respectively this elevated level of mean cd concentration breaks all the standard limits major effects of cd exposure are necrosis of the gastric and intestinal mucosa dystrophic changes of liver heart and kidneys and have also carcinogenic effects who 2011 the range of fe in groundwater of the study area is 556 20 2663 10 μg l with a mean value and standard deviation of 1303 32 μg l and 641 67 respectively it was found that the concentration of fe in groundwater is too high where only 35 sample falls within the range of doe 1997 but exceeds all others standards mn concentration showed a wide variation ranging from 77 20 to 662 50 μg l with mean value of 283 915 μg l the mean value of mn exceeds all the standards except bis 2012 indian standard and except one samples all the samples exceed the bangladesh standard doe 1997 high concentration of mn through drinking water for long times may create neurological disorder reproductive problems and unlikely responsible for cancer usepa 2004 who 2011 again maximum concentration of ni in groundwater of the study area is 329 3 μg l with an average value of 78 955 μg l the permissible level of ni in groundwater is 20 μg l as deemed fit for drinking as per bis 2012 and eu 1998 around 25 40 and 90 water samples exceed the standard limits of doe 1997 who 2011 and bis 2012 standards respectively however the concentration of zn of the groundwater is comparatively low and the maximum concentration is 260 70 μg l with an average value of 80 06 μg l the concentrations of zn in all the groundwater samples were below than the drinking water standards it was seen that the mean concentrations of trace metals followed a descending order as fe cu mn zn ni cd 3 2 pollution level of groundwater the result of pollution evaluation indices is listed in table 5 results showed that heavy metal evaluation index hei was ranged from 6 50 to 20 81 with the mean value of 11 91 about 50 of the sampling sites s1s4 s6s7 s9s10 s13 and s20 were characterized as medium degree of pollution while 45 s8 s11s12 and s14s19 and 5 s5 sampling sites characterized as low and high degree respectively again the degree of contamination c d was used to determine the metal pollution extent in the sampling sites edet and offiong 2002 islam et al 2016 the result of c d ranged from 16 49 to 2 37 with the mean value of 8 05 pollution category results for c d in this study revealed that 95 sampling sites s1s17 s19 and s20 were characterized as high category of pollution occurrence and rest of 5 sampling sites s18 characterized as low pollution category nemerrow pollution index ni was further applied to identify how different heavy metals pollute the groundwater in the studied sampling sites zhong et al 2015 the range of ni for the groundwater samples varied from 2 19 to 8 62 with the mean value of 4 85 it was found that about 75 s1s15 sampling sites exhibited high degree of pollution and rest of 25 sampling sites s16s20 exhibited low degree of pollution from the spatial distribution fig 2 of these indices values it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated by trace elements 3 3 source apportionment of pollution pearson s correlation matrix pca and ca were applied to identify the source materials in groundwater the results of pearson s correlation showed some significant positive and negative correlations among the measured parameters for instance cu have positive correlation with ph and fe and fe have correlation with zn on the other hand cu and fe showed strong negative correlation with cd table 6 the positive significant co relationship indicating the origination of metals from same sources and negative significant co relationship indicating the origination of metals from different sources giri and singh 2015 islam et al 2017b both r mode and q mode pca was further applied to elucidate the observed relationship of cluster variables in simple ways expressed in the patterns of variance and covariance between the variable and similarities between observations mertler and vannatta 2005 bhuiyan et al 2016 total 3 factors of r mode pca with eigenvalues 1 were extracted for groundwater samples exhibited 72 672 of total variance table 7 scree plot was used to find out the principal component numbers in the underlying parameters fig 3 a the positive and negative values in pca explained the groundwater samples were likely or unlikely to be affected by the presence of extracted loads on a specific component about 72 672 of total variance is exhibited in the rotated loading plots of first three components in groundwater samples fig 3b in this study pc1 pc2 and pc3 were explained by 33 995 20 902 and 17 776 of variance respectively table 7 the results of r mode analysis were also correlated with q mode where it was revealed that pc1 in the data set explained 33 995 of total variance and mostly consists of cu and fe very high loadings of these elements were found in the sampling sites s14 s16 s17 s18 s19 and s20 high levels of cu may get into the water through agricultural activities domestic wastes and mineral leaching cdcp 2015 usgs 2016 however fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence it was concluded that this factor was geogenic in nature bhattacharya et al 2002 bhutiani et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019b again pc2 exhibits the total variance of 20 902 and mostly loaded with mn ni and zn very high loadings of these elements were dominated in the sampling sites s5 s6 s10 s17 s19 and s20 mn in the groundwater of the area occurs naturally as a mineral from sediment and rocks giri and singh 2015 usgs 2016 potential heavy metals i e ni and zn can be assimilated in groundwater through geogenic processes augmented by human induced activities such as industrial activities fertilizers and agrochemicals chodak and blaszczyk 2008 usgs 2016 bhuiyan et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2016 2019b high loading of also zn could be attributed to the cation exchange characteristics of groundwater aquifer kumar 2014 furthermore pc3 consist of 17 776 of total variance and highly loaded with ec and zn which mostly distributed in s2 s4 s5 s11 s12 and s17 high loadings of these components could be generated from anthropogenic activities like fertilizer use or leaching from non sanitary latrines and also from natural activities like dissolution of fluids or evaporates valdes et al 2007 jiang et al 2009 bhuiyan et al 2010 the hierarchical cluster analysis ca was also performed which is very similar to the pca s results parameters belonging to the same cluster are likely to have originated from a same source bhuiyan et al 2016 the r mode ca retains three clusters for the analyzed parameters presented in fig 4 a cluster 1 consists of ph cu fe ni and zn indicated the influence domestic and industrial pollution along with geogenic interaction omo irabor et al 2008 cluster 2 consists of ec reflecting the high ions content of water due to the natural and man made activities again cluster 3 consist of mn and cd may be due to the chemical weathering of the parent rock industrial and agricultural activities in the study area bernard 2008 omo irabor et al 2008 on the other hand q mode ca has been applied to detect the spatial similarities and site grouping among the sampling points particular group shows similar characteristics with respect to the analyzed parameters and the 20 sampling sites categorized into three clusters fig 4b cluster 1 consists of 7 sampling sites i e s2 s15 s16 s17 s18 s19 and s20 cluster 2 includes 6 sampling sites s1 s5 s6 s9 s10 s13 and cluster 3 consists of 7 sampling sites s3 s4 s7 s8 s11 s12 and s14 indicates these sites may have polluted by similar contaminants 3 4 human health risk 3 4 1 chronic risk human chronic health risk hq and hi of groundwater through the exposure of oral and dermal routes for adults and children are summarised in tables 8 11 respectively in this study hq values for cu fe ni and zn were found to be less than 1 for both adult and children which indicates these elements could pose low degree of hazards if that occurred individually in the study area giri and singh 2015 however highest hq oral values for cd and mn was found 3 784 and 1 0411 for adult and 4 8160 and 1 3250 for children respectively according to usepa 1999 most of the samples suggests medium category of chronic risk for adult table 8 and 50 samples were found in high risk for children table 9 again tables 10 and 11 further exhibited the results of hi dermal for both adult and children respectively it was found that dermal exposure has comparatively lower risk than oral exposure in case of adult about 55 of the samples attributed to medium chronic risk and rest of 45 samples attributed to the low chronic risk level table 10 on the other hand almost 80 samples suggest medium and 20 samples suggests for lower level of chronic risk table 11 in all the cases including for both adult and children potentially highest chronic risk was found in sampling point s5 while least potential chronic risk was found in sampling point s18 3 4 2 carcinogenic risk carcinogenic risk of cadmium cd via oral exposure pathway was calculated for both adult and children and it was found that all the samples 100 falls in high carcinogenic risk suggested by usepa 1999 the sampling point which is mostly threaten was found s5 and least threaten sampling point was s19 and the cancer risk values are higher for children than adults table 12 this results also gives similar trend as like as the spatial analysis fig 2 and indicates higher pollution areas means south central part of the study area is in high threat of carcinogenic risk such results suggest that young generation particularly children are more vulnerable in potential cancer risk in study area due to oral exposure of groundwater using monte carlo method the carcinogenic risk of cd was studied fig 5 a b shows the prediction for probability of lifetime cancer risk of cd for both adult and children in study area the mean probability of ltcr of cd for adult and children was found 4 55e 4 and 5 59e 4 respectively while the median values of incremental ltcr for adult and children were found 4 36e 4 and 5 39e 4 respectively with 100 risk the risks of 5 and 95 were obtained as many as 2 31e 4 and 4 49e 4 for adults and 2 57e 4 and 9 05e 4 for children this risk level was higher than the acceptable risk 10 6 and the priority risk level 10 4 stated by lu et al 2015 this suggests a high potential health risks from cadmium in drinking water implying that this element requires attention similar study was conducted in xinjiang china indicating a value lower than what calculated in present work turdi and yang 2016 sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine importance of the variables involved in ltcr calculation lu et al 2015 fallahzadeh et al 2017 such analysis for both adult and children showed that concentration of cd is the most important factors on ltcr values fig 6 a and b in case of adult concentration exposure duration ed exposure frequency ef and ingestion rate ir showed the positive impacts with the percentage of 63 2 9 8 8 5 and 5 7 respectively while average time at and body weight bw take negative impacts with the percentage of 7 5 and 5 4 for ltrc calculation fig 6a on the other hand concentration 60 9 ef 10 1 ed 8 8 and ir 5 9 takes positive impacts and at 8 0 and bw 6 4 for the ltrc of children fig 6b from this study it was found that concentration of pollutant is highly responsible for cancer risk in study area 4 conclusions present study evaluated the ph ec cu cd fe mn ni and zn concentrations of groundwater samples collected from damurhuda upazila located at central west part of bangladesh except cu and zn all others trace elements exceed the standard permissible limits for drinking water results of hei suggest almost 50 samples fall in medium degree of pollution while 95 and 75 samples exhibit high degree of pollution in case of c d and ni respectively source apportionment results using pca and ca indicates groundwater of sampling sites were influenced by both natural and anthropogenic sources however highest hq oral and hq dermal values of cu cd fe mn ni and zn were found in the sampling sites s20 s5 s19 s6 s20 and s17 for both adult and children hq values greater than 1 in all most all the sampling sites for cadmium raising concerns about both chronic and carcinogenic health risk in case of chronic health risk via both oral and dermal exposure pathways children are more vulnerable with high health risk but both adult and children are at high risk due to oral exposure of cadmium containing groundwater from study it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated with trace elements and falls in higher health risk of both chronic and carcinogenic risk so peoples of these area should concern about to consume of groundwater and need to find out alternative sources of drinking water 
12209,to evaluate the trace element contamination level and human health risk in study area a total of twenty groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for ph ec cu cd fe mn ni and zn the results revealed that groundwater is slightly acidic in nature with the mean conductance of 686 10 μs cm heavy metal evaluation index hei the degree of contamination c d and nemerow pollution index ni were employed to estimate the pollution load and it was found 5 95 and 75 of samples exhibits the high degree of pollution respectively according to the spatial analysis it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated with trace elements moreover pearson correlation principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were applied to identify the pollution source and factors controlling groundwater quality and the results indicates that groundwater of the study area were influenced by both natural and anthropogenic factors chronic health risk via exposure of both oral and dermal routes were also determined by calculating the hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi for both adults and children in case of oral exposure almost 85 of samples suggest the medium category of chronic risk for adult and 50 of samples were found at high risk for children again dermal exposure showed comparatively lower risk than oral exposure and 55 and 80 of samples attributed medium chronic risk for adult and children respectively however the carcinogenic risk of cadmium cd via oral exposure pathway suggest all of the samples are at high risk for both adults and children average lifetime cancer risks ltcr of cd for both adult and children were found to be 4 55e 4 and 5 59e 4 respectively that indicated high carcinogenic risk results of sensitivity analysis specified concentration has high impact on carcinogenic risk both for adult and children graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic risk groundwater heavy metals lifetime cancer risks ltcr multivariate statistics sensitivity analysis 1 introduction groundwater plays a vital role for the sustenance of living beings and considered as a safe reserve of good quality water bhutiani et al 2016 batabyal 2018 in many countries in the world its used as the major sources for drinking irrigation and industrial needs due to its instant availability and natural protection from microbial contamination al khashman and jaradat 2014 aghazadeh et al 2017 selvam et al 2017 saha et al 2018 the rapid increase of population and surface water contamination over the last few decades in bangladesh has made excessive demands on groundwater resources hasan et al 2007 islam 2014 dey et al 2017 bodrud doza et al 2019a b but it is now a matter of concern as groundwater is contaminated by various trace metals in excess of natural background loads ahmed et al 2004 biswas et al 2012 islam et al 2017a uddin et al 2018 which may have serious health effects due to their toxic persistence and carcinogenic in nature naz et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 generally water used for drinking purpose with small quantities of trace metals can help in normal functioning of the human body but in excess and expose in long time can be toxic to human health islam et al 2017b vetrimurugan1 et al 2017 groundwater contamination may occur from geological phenomena like ore formation weathering of rocks and leaching or due to increased population urbanization industrial activities agricultural practices exploration and exploitation of natural resources bhattacharya et al 2002 von brömssen et al 2007 lee et al 2014 bhutiani et al 2016 aghazadeh et al 2017 chakraborty et al 2017 ahmed et al 2019 former studies evident that a wide range of public health issues like hypertension cancer vascular disease restrictive lung disease gastrointestinal bleeding neurological disorder and reproductive effects may appear due to consumption of water contaminated with trace metals lu et al 2015 das et al 2016 noubissié et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 belabed and soltani 2018 haouti et al 2018 nkpaa et al 2018 singh et al 2018 for instance excess intakes of copper cu with drinking water causes stomach upset nausea diarrhoea and can lead to tissue injury of liver usnrc 2000 cadmium cd is known as human carcinogen and excess uptakes may cause kidney damage respiratory disorder and harmful for the skeletal system bernard 2008 belabed and soltani 2018 dutta et al 2018 the presence of excessive iron fe in drinking water may causes unusual metallic taste and responsible for fatigue loss of weight and joint pain islam et al 2017b ahmed et al 2019 bodrud doza et al 2019b again high concentration of mn consumption for long times may create neurological disorder such as reducing the intellectual capacity of children annaduzzaman et al 2018 and also responsible for dna damage who 2011 exposure of nickel ni via dermal and oral routes may causes nickel allergy lung fibrosis cardiovascular and kidney diseases and cancer of the respiratory tract duda chodak and blaszczyk 2008 iarc 2012 furthermore long term exposure of zinc zn via drinking pathway may lead to stomach cramps vomiting and anemia singh et al 2018 therefore human health risk assessment of groundwater is essential and considered as an investigation tool to correlates environmental pollution with human health celebi et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 rahman et al 2017 tirkey et al 2017 singh et al 2018 it involves identifying risk indices of potential risk sources estimating the values of risk indices and quantifying the health consequences of exposure ni et al 2010 generally four steps i e hazard identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization were widely used to determine the human health risk ma et al 2007 rahman et al 2017 usepa delineates human health risk assessment by estimating the probability of health effects on humans via contaminated chemicals ma et al 2007 bhuiyan et al 2016 moreover a set of pollution evaluation indices also used to identify the degree of pollution level of groundwater bhuiyan et al 2010 vetrimurugan et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2017 bodrud doza et al 2019b the application of different multivariate statistical techniques used to the interpretation of complex data matrices for better understanding of water quality and to determine the influential factors with possible reasons shrestha and kazama 2007 giri and singh 2015 ahmed et al 2019 islam et al 2018 however damurhuda is situated in the central west part of bangladesh and groundwater is used as the main source for domestic and agricultural purpose excess withdrawal agricultural leaching with others geogenic factors may take part in the deterioration of groundwater quality in study area bgs and dphe 2001 local peoples used groundwater in drinking domestic and agricultural needs in case of domestic use groundwater can harm humans through drinking and dermal contact exposure pathways wu and sun 2016 rezaei et al 2018 considering the above all issues the present study intended to determine the level of trace elements in the groundwater samples along with their health risk assessment of adult and children s exposures via both oral and dermal pathways a set of pollution evaluation indices with multivariate statistics were used to delineate the groundwater quality and human health risk of drinking use which could be used as a baseline study for future groundwater management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area damurhuda upazila under chuadanga district is located in the central west part of bangladesh a part of gangetic delta geographically it positioned between 23 29 and 23 42 n latitudes and 88 39 and 88 51 e longitudes fig 1 geologically the area lies in the faridpur trough of bengal foredeep which is nearly the hinge zone in the west and barisal faridpur uplift in the east faridpur trough is characterized by a general gravity low of northeast trend which is apparently related to general subsidence of basement khan 1991 lithological characteristics of the study area is composed of coarse to fine grained sediments gravely sand and some places fine sand to silt deposits dphe jica 2010 hossain et al 2014 however the total area of the upazila is 308 11 km2 with the population of 2 13 291 bbs 2011 annual average temperature in study area varied from 11 2 to 37 1 c with an annual average rainfall 1467 mm bmd 2018 major land use categories identified in damurhuda upazila are agricultural land use rural settlement and homestead vegetation and water bodies agriculture lands occupy more than three quarters land of the study area the sources of drinking water for the natives are tube well 94 53 tap water 1 02 pond water 0 12 and others 4 33 banglapedia 2015 so major portion of water that meet the local demands are coming from the groundwater resources total 18 77 urban 34 63 and rural 14 27 of dwelling households of the upazila use sanitary latrines and 50 65 urban 43 39 and rural 52 71 of dwelling households use non sanitary latrines 30 58 of households do not have latrine facilities bbs 2011 2 2 sampling and analytical procedure a total of 20 groundwater samples were collected from the preselected sampling locations of the study area fig 1 during the period of june 2016 the depths of the sampled tube wells were varied from 40 to 90 ft 12 19 27 43 m recorded from the information from well owners geographical locations of the selected wells were determined by global positioning system gps receiver kansas usa prior to sampling each well were pumped for 10 min until it purged out approximately twice the well volume or until steady state chemical conditions were obtained usgs 2006 groundwater samples were collected using pre washed high density polyethylene bottles the bottles were cleaned by soaking in 0 5 mol l hcl followed by 0 1 mol l naoh for 24 h each the samples were stored on ice box and returned to the laboratory for measurement of metal concentrations 65 concentrated hno3 acid were added to each sample immediately to bring the ph blow 2 to minimize precipitation and adsorption onto bottles walls apha 1998 the physicochemical parameters i e temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured with calibrated portable instruments the ph meter model sensiontm1 hach international usa was used to measure ph of groundwater electrical conductivity ec was measured using a conductivity meter jenway model 4520 and temperature was also read from the same meter elemental analysis e g cu cd fe mn ni and zn was done by atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas model spectraa 55b varian water sample were digested with concentrated hno3 acid for trace metal determination as described by apha 1998 the instrument was linearly calibrated with standards before use triplicate analysis of 10 of all samples and analysis of check standards for every 10 samples were performed to assess measurement error and to check for accuracy and precision of measurement technique 2 3 pollution evaluation indices heavy metal evaluation index hei degree of contamination c d and nemerow pollution index ni were investigated for the purpose of evaluating drinking suitability hei gives an insight the overall quality of the groundwater with respect to trace metals edet and offiong 2002 and calculate by following 1 h e i i 1 n h c h m a c where h c monitored value and h mac maximum admissible concentration mac of the ith parameter the degree of heavy metal index was classified into three divisions like hei 10 low hei 10 20 medium and hei 20 high edet and offiong 2002 bodrud doza et al 2016 the degree of contamination c d indicates the overall effects of each contaminants or water quality parameters islam et al 2016 and calculated by following backman et al 1997 equation 2 c d i 1 n c f i where c f i c a i c n i 1 c fi contamination factor c ai analytical value the ith component c ni upper permissible concentration of the ith component and n normative value here c ni is considered as mac the pollution level was divided into three categories cd 1 low cd 1 3 medium and cd high edet and offiong 2002 however ni applied to determine how different heavy metals pollute groundwater at the sampling sites of the study area zhong et al 2015 and calculated by 3 n i 1 n c i s i 2 max c i s i 2 2 were n number of indices c i measured content of heavy metal i s i standard value heavy metal pollution in groundwater is divided by ni into 6 like no pollution 0 5 clean 0 5 0 7 warm 0 7 1 0 polluted 1 0 2 0 medium pollution 2 0 3 0 and severe pollution 3 0 zhong et al 2015 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis to evaluate analytical data multivariate statistical techniques i e correlation analysis principal component analysis pca and cluster analysis ca were used by using spss version 22 0 software for windows principal component analysis was applied to identify the hypothetical sources of heavy metals exploratory factor analysis was performed by varimax rotation method howitt and cramer 2005 that reduced the variable number with a high loading on every component thus facilitating the interpretation of pca results principal components pcs gives identification of the most influential parameters from the whole data set introducing data reduction with minimum loss of baseline information hair et al 1995 vega et al 1998 this analysis also minimizes the contribution of less significant variables generated from pca and the new group of variables generated from pca vega et al 1998 wunderlin et al 2001 pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to support the results obtained from pca and to determine the constituent variances that can be explained by its inter relationship with others liu et al 2003 cluster analysis was further introduced to delineate groups of samples with similar heavy metal contents panda et al 2006 and to provide supportive information to the results obtained from pca ca was calculated by ward algorithmic method and squared euclidean distance was considered to identify the distance between clusters of similar metal contents bhuiyan et al 2010 2 5 human health risk assessment 2 5 1 chronic risk assessment the health risk assessment of each heavy metal or metalloid is usually based on quantification of the risk level and is expressed in terms of carcinogenic or non carcinogenic health risk usepa 2009 the two principal toxicity risk factors evaluated are the slope factor sf for carcinogen risk characterization and the reference dose rfd for non carcinogen risk characterization lim et al 2008 both oral and dermal exposure pathway were considered for the assessment and the chronic daily intake cdi of elements via oral and dermal pathways were calculated by followings usepa 1989 wu et al 2009 karim 2011 4 c d i o r a l c w i r e f e d b w a t 5 c d i d e r m a l c w s a k p e t e f e d c f b w a t where cdi oral and cdi dermal indicates the exposure dose mg kg day via oral ingestion and dermal pathway which calculated using the parameters value of table 1 potential non carcinogenic risks for exposure to contaminants of potential concern were evaluated by comparison of the estimated contaminant intakes from each exposure route oral dermal with the reference dose rfd to produce the hazard quotient hq defined by usepa 1989 if the value of hq exceeds 1 there is an unacceptable risk of adverse non carcinogenic effects on health while if the hq is less than 1 it is at an acceptable level usepa 2001 giri and singh 2015 6 h q c d i r f d where hq hazard quotient unit less and rfd is the reference dose μg kg day originates from risk based concentration table usepa 2001 to assess the overall potential for non carcinogenic effects posed by more than one chemical the hqs calculated for each chemical are summed and expressed as hazard index hi usepa 1989 7 h i h q 1 h q 2 h q n if hi does not exceed unity hi 1 no chronic risks were assumed to occur at the site and if hi 1 it implies that the non carcinogenic health risk usepa 1989 yang et al 2012 2 5 2 carcinogenic risk assessment carcinogenic risks were estimated as the incremental probability of an individual developing cancer over a lifetime as a result of exposure to a potential carcinogen rahman et al 2017 the following linear dose carcinogenic risk equations were used for each exposure route by following usepa 1989 8 l o w d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k c d i s f 9 h i g h d o s e e x p o s u r e r i s k 1 exp c d i s f where risk stood for cancer risk and sf is the slope factor of contaminants mg kg day the toxicity responses of trace elements for the oral and dermal reference dose rfd and oral slope factor sf are presented in table 2 if the calculated value is higher than 0 01 only then formula in equation 9 was considered an acceptable level was considered at 1 10 6 which means on average the probability is that approximately 1 person per 1 000 000 will develop cancer as a consequence of the exposure lim et al 2008 risk in the range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 typically considered as acceptable usepa 1992 yang et al 2012 detail scale of chronic and carcinogenic risk assessment are shows in table 3 the lifetime cancer risk ltcr was calculated through multiplication of chronic daily intake cdi oral by cancer slope factor sforal which is determined by integrated risk information system iris as follows miri et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 10 ltcr cdi oral sf oral cadmium cd is considered as one of the carcinogenic elements which sf oral values is 0 38 table 2 hence the risk of carcinogenicity was calculated only for cadmium in this study however sensitivity analysis technique was used in this study to determine how different values of input variables can affect risk estimation in a given set of assumptions in addition risk assessment was carried out by monte carlo simulation technique using the software crystal ball version 11 1 2 3 created by oracle co oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 3 lu et al 2015 ren et al 2016 fallahzadeh et al 2017 arcgis version 10 1 was also used for mapping of sample locations and to show the spatial distribution of pollution indices 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace elements concentrations the summary of the measured parameters of groundwater samples along with standard permissible limits are in presented table 4 the ph values of the groundwater samples varied from 6 25 to 6 88 with a mean value of 6 47 which indicates the water is slightly acidic in nature among 20 samples only 40 falls within the permissible limits for drinking purpose electrical conductivity ec is considered as one of the important parameters to classify the drinking water quality subramani et al 2005 islam 2014 higher ec values indicate increased concentration of dissolved solids and high ionic strength of the groundwater islam et al 2017b ahmed et al 2019 however ec of the studied water samples ranges from 403 to 1080 μs cm with a mean of 686 10 μs cm though mean value lies within the permissible limits but 30 samples exceed the limits recommended by usepa 2006 the maximum concentration of cu in groundwater of the study area was found 393 90 μg l with a mean value of 334 73 μg l mean concentration of cu was found within the permissible limit of all standards however the maximum concentration of cd in groundwater of the study area is 60 2 μg l with an average value and standard deviation of 33 16 μg l and 13 98 respectively this elevated level of mean cd concentration breaks all the standard limits major effects of cd exposure are necrosis of the gastric and intestinal mucosa dystrophic changes of liver heart and kidneys and have also carcinogenic effects who 2011 the range of fe in groundwater of the study area is 556 20 2663 10 μg l with a mean value and standard deviation of 1303 32 μg l and 641 67 respectively it was found that the concentration of fe in groundwater is too high where only 35 sample falls within the range of doe 1997 but exceeds all others standards mn concentration showed a wide variation ranging from 77 20 to 662 50 μg l with mean value of 283 915 μg l the mean value of mn exceeds all the standards except bis 2012 indian standard and except one samples all the samples exceed the bangladesh standard doe 1997 high concentration of mn through drinking water for long times may create neurological disorder reproductive problems and unlikely responsible for cancer usepa 2004 who 2011 again maximum concentration of ni in groundwater of the study area is 329 3 μg l with an average value of 78 955 μg l the permissible level of ni in groundwater is 20 μg l as deemed fit for drinking as per bis 2012 and eu 1998 around 25 40 and 90 water samples exceed the standard limits of doe 1997 who 2011 and bis 2012 standards respectively however the concentration of zn of the groundwater is comparatively low and the maximum concentration is 260 70 μg l with an average value of 80 06 μg l the concentrations of zn in all the groundwater samples were below than the drinking water standards it was seen that the mean concentrations of trace metals followed a descending order as fe cu mn zn ni cd 3 2 pollution level of groundwater the result of pollution evaluation indices is listed in table 5 results showed that heavy metal evaluation index hei was ranged from 6 50 to 20 81 with the mean value of 11 91 about 50 of the sampling sites s1s4 s6s7 s9s10 s13 and s20 were characterized as medium degree of pollution while 45 s8 s11s12 and s14s19 and 5 s5 sampling sites characterized as low and high degree respectively again the degree of contamination c d was used to determine the metal pollution extent in the sampling sites edet and offiong 2002 islam et al 2016 the result of c d ranged from 16 49 to 2 37 with the mean value of 8 05 pollution category results for c d in this study revealed that 95 sampling sites s1s17 s19 and s20 were characterized as high category of pollution occurrence and rest of 5 sampling sites s18 characterized as low pollution category nemerrow pollution index ni was further applied to identify how different heavy metals pollute the groundwater in the studied sampling sites zhong et al 2015 the range of ni for the groundwater samples varied from 2 19 to 8 62 with the mean value of 4 85 it was found that about 75 s1s15 sampling sites exhibited high degree of pollution and rest of 25 sampling sites s16s20 exhibited low degree of pollution from the spatial distribution fig 2 of these indices values it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated by trace elements 3 3 source apportionment of pollution pearson s correlation matrix pca and ca were applied to identify the source materials in groundwater the results of pearson s correlation showed some significant positive and negative correlations among the measured parameters for instance cu have positive correlation with ph and fe and fe have correlation with zn on the other hand cu and fe showed strong negative correlation with cd table 6 the positive significant co relationship indicating the origination of metals from same sources and negative significant co relationship indicating the origination of metals from different sources giri and singh 2015 islam et al 2017b both r mode and q mode pca was further applied to elucidate the observed relationship of cluster variables in simple ways expressed in the patterns of variance and covariance between the variable and similarities between observations mertler and vannatta 2005 bhuiyan et al 2016 total 3 factors of r mode pca with eigenvalues 1 were extracted for groundwater samples exhibited 72 672 of total variance table 7 scree plot was used to find out the principal component numbers in the underlying parameters fig 3 a the positive and negative values in pca explained the groundwater samples were likely or unlikely to be affected by the presence of extracted loads on a specific component about 72 672 of total variance is exhibited in the rotated loading plots of first three components in groundwater samples fig 3b in this study pc1 pc2 and pc3 were explained by 33 995 20 902 and 17 776 of variance respectively table 7 the results of r mode analysis were also correlated with q mode where it was revealed that pc1 in the data set explained 33 995 of total variance and mostly consists of cu and fe very high loadings of these elements were found in the sampling sites s14 s16 s17 s18 s19 and s20 high levels of cu may get into the water through agricultural activities domestic wastes and mineral leaching cdcp 2015 usgs 2016 however fe is one of the metals having abundant crustal presence it was concluded that this factor was geogenic in nature bhattacharya et al 2002 bhutiani et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2019b again pc2 exhibits the total variance of 20 902 and mostly loaded with mn ni and zn very high loadings of these elements were dominated in the sampling sites s5 s6 s10 s17 s19 and s20 mn in the groundwater of the area occurs naturally as a mineral from sediment and rocks giri and singh 2015 usgs 2016 potential heavy metals i e ni and zn can be assimilated in groundwater through geogenic processes augmented by human induced activities such as industrial activities fertilizers and agrochemicals chodak and blaszczyk 2008 usgs 2016 bhuiyan et al 2016 bodrud doza et al 2016 2019b high loading of also zn could be attributed to the cation exchange characteristics of groundwater aquifer kumar 2014 furthermore pc3 consist of 17 776 of total variance and highly loaded with ec and zn which mostly distributed in s2 s4 s5 s11 s12 and s17 high loadings of these components could be generated from anthropogenic activities like fertilizer use or leaching from non sanitary latrines and also from natural activities like dissolution of fluids or evaporates valdes et al 2007 jiang et al 2009 bhuiyan et al 2010 the hierarchical cluster analysis ca was also performed which is very similar to the pca s results parameters belonging to the same cluster are likely to have originated from a same source bhuiyan et al 2016 the r mode ca retains three clusters for the analyzed parameters presented in fig 4 a cluster 1 consists of ph cu fe ni and zn indicated the influence domestic and industrial pollution along with geogenic interaction omo irabor et al 2008 cluster 2 consists of ec reflecting the high ions content of water due to the natural and man made activities again cluster 3 consist of mn and cd may be due to the chemical weathering of the parent rock industrial and agricultural activities in the study area bernard 2008 omo irabor et al 2008 on the other hand q mode ca has been applied to detect the spatial similarities and site grouping among the sampling points particular group shows similar characteristics with respect to the analyzed parameters and the 20 sampling sites categorized into three clusters fig 4b cluster 1 consists of 7 sampling sites i e s2 s15 s16 s17 s18 s19 and s20 cluster 2 includes 6 sampling sites s1 s5 s6 s9 s10 s13 and cluster 3 consists of 7 sampling sites s3 s4 s7 s8 s11 s12 and s14 indicates these sites may have polluted by similar contaminants 3 4 human health risk 3 4 1 chronic risk human chronic health risk hq and hi of groundwater through the exposure of oral and dermal routes for adults and children are summarised in tables 8 11 respectively in this study hq values for cu fe ni and zn were found to be less than 1 for both adult and children which indicates these elements could pose low degree of hazards if that occurred individually in the study area giri and singh 2015 however highest hq oral values for cd and mn was found 3 784 and 1 0411 for adult and 4 8160 and 1 3250 for children respectively according to usepa 1999 most of the samples suggests medium category of chronic risk for adult table 8 and 50 samples were found in high risk for children table 9 again tables 10 and 11 further exhibited the results of hi dermal for both adult and children respectively it was found that dermal exposure has comparatively lower risk than oral exposure in case of adult about 55 of the samples attributed to medium chronic risk and rest of 45 samples attributed to the low chronic risk level table 10 on the other hand almost 80 samples suggest medium and 20 samples suggests for lower level of chronic risk table 11 in all the cases including for both adult and children potentially highest chronic risk was found in sampling point s5 while least potential chronic risk was found in sampling point s18 3 4 2 carcinogenic risk carcinogenic risk of cadmium cd via oral exposure pathway was calculated for both adult and children and it was found that all the samples 100 falls in high carcinogenic risk suggested by usepa 1999 the sampling point which is mostly threaten was found s5 and least threaten sampling point was s19 and the cancer risk values are higher for children than adults table 12 this results also gives similar trend as like as the spatial analysis fig 2 and indicates higher pollution areas means south central part of the study area is in high threat of carcinogenic risk such results suggest that young generation particularly children are more vulnerable in potential cancer risk in study area due to oral exposure of groundwater using monte carlo method the carcinogenic risk of cd was studied fig 5 a b shows the prediction for probability of lifetime cancer risk of cd for both adult and children in study area the mean probability of ltcr of cd for adult and children was found 4 55e 4 and 5 59e 4 respectively while the median values of incremental ltcr for adult and children were found 4 36e 4 and 5 39e 4 respectively with 100 risk the risks of 5 and 95 were obtained as many as 2 31e 4 and 4 49e 4 for adults and 2 57e 4 and 9 05e 4 for children this risk level was higher than the acceptable risk 10 6 and the priority risk level 10 4 stated by lu et al 2015 this suggests a high potential health risks from cadmium in drinking water implying that this element requires attention similar study was conducted in xinjiang china indicating a value lower than what calculated in present work turdi and yang 2016 sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine importance of the variables involved in ltcr calculation lu et al 2015 fallahzadeh et al 2017 such analysis for both adult and children showed that concentration of cd is the most important factors on ltcr values fig 6 a and b in case of adult concentration exposure duration ed exposure frequency ef and ingestion rate ir showed the positive impacts with the percentage of 63 2 9 8 8 5 and 5 7 respectively while average time at and body weight bw take negative impacts with the percentage of 7 5 and 5 4 for ltrc calculation fig 6a on the other hand concentration 60 9 ef 10 1 ed 8 8 and ir 5 9 takes positive impacts and at 8 0 and bw 6 4 for the ltrc of children fig 6b from this study it was found that concentration of pollutant is highly responsible for cancer risk in study area 4 conclusions present study evaluated the ph ec cu cd fe mn ni and zn concentrations of groundwater samples collected from damurhuda upazila located at central west part of bangladesh except cu and zn all others trace elements exceed the standard permissible limits for drinking water results of hei suggest almost 50 samples fall in medium degree of pollution while 95 and 75 samples exhibit high degree of pollution in case of c d and ni respectively source apportionment results using pca and ca indicates groundwater of sampling sites were influenced by both natural and anthropogenic sources however highest hq oral and hq dermal values of cu cd fe mn ni and zn were found in the sampling sites s20 s5 s19 s6 s20 and s17 for both adult and children hq values greater than 1 in all most all the sampling sites for cadmium raising concerns about both chronic and carcinogenic health risk in case of chronic health risk via both oral and dermal exposure pathways children are more vulnerable with high health risk but both adult and children are at high risk due to oral exposure of cadmium containing groundwater from study it was found that south central part of the study area is highly contaminated with trace elements and falls in higher health risk of both chronic and carcinogenic risk so peoples of these area should concern about to consume of groundwater and need to find out alternative sources of drinking water
